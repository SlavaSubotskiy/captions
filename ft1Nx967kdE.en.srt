00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:10,690
June 14th, 1989

3
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:27,690
At the very outset we have to understand that
truth is what it is. We cannot organize it,

4
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:41,610
we cannot order it, nor can we conceptualize
it. It has to be felt on your central nervous

5
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:52,220
system and this is what it is called, what
we call as Self Realization, or we can say

6
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:04,350
the second birth as told by Christ. It’s
not an artificial way of accepting any baptism.

7
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:15,340
That we say that we are baptized but whether
you are baptized or not baptized, you are

8
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:21,799
just the same. There’s nothing special has
happened to you, nothing has happened to your

9
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:28,799
awareness, nothing has happened to your personality.
So when we say that we have to have our Self

10
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:38,209
Realization means, whatever is our human awareness,
has to achieve a new break-through. In the

11
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:50,389
process of our evolutionary process – which
is, as you know, is a living process – we

12
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:58,650
have achieved a state, what we call as human
beings. And human beings have freedom to choose

13
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:08,519
whatever they like - till they realize with
their own trial-and-error-methods that this

14
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:16,599
is wrong, this is wrong. It takes too much
time for them really to reach a point to understand

15
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:24,989
what is really good and what is bad for their
society, for their country and also for themselves.

16
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:32,279
Today when we are standing on the brink of
a delusion and a shock we don’t know what’s

17
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:43,529
going to happen to us in future. One has to
realize the One who has created this beautiful

18
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:51,810
universe is not going to allow this work of
His to be destroyed. Only thing He has given

19
00:03:53,510 --> 00:04:00,510
you chance - full chance to realize your freedom,
to develop your wisdom and to see how far

20
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:13,790
you really understand what is right and what
is wrong. In the human awareness whatever

21
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,320
we know about is in a relative terminology.
We are not absolutely sure, there’s no absolute

22
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:37,930
knowledge with us – because we are not in
the state of absoluteness. Also the development

23
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:47,360
- the material, the physical, the scientific,
all development that has taken place has evolved

24
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:56,500
us outside, just like a tree has grown. But
we have lost our roots and whatever just now

25
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:07,810
you have heard about is the knowledge of our
roots. And if we do not know our roots we

26
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:16,120
are waiting really for a complete destructive
shock. It’s an evolutionary process which

27
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:24,550
has come to this point and the break-through
is a very small journey, say at the most of

28
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:31,780
three to four feet that you have to allow
your Kundalini to rise and break through.

29
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:42,889
About which thousands of years back people
have talked. In every country there has been

30
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:50,319
lots of prophecies that such a time will come
when men of God will know the truth. And this

31
00:05:53,419 --> 00:06:00,419
is what it is. Today we have so many seekers,
so many seekers of truth who are genuine,

32
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:07,530
honest, trying to find out what is the truth
of life. Why are we here? What are we to do?

33
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:14,530
You are here to enter into the kingdom of
God, to enjoy the blessings of God – not

34
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:23,930
to torture yourself, not to trouble yourself,
but to abide in that beautiful land of God’s

35
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:33,470
joyous, blissful state. For that you cannot
pay. Please remember that God doesn’t understand

36
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:44,849
money – and you can’t pay for it. Anybody
who takes money in the name of God is a false

37
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:51,849
personality, he’s a false person because
you cannot pay for it. But when this happening

38
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,280
takes place, when your Kundalini, which is
the pure desire within you - the pure desire

39
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:06,280
- because all other desires, as described
in the economics, that they are not satiable

40
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:16,030
in general. This desire is the one - this
energy when it rises then you become the giver

41
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:25,610
of desires, all desires subside and just you
enjoy each and everything of this creation.

42
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:35,620
This is all within us, is all your own. Just
like one candle can enlighten another candle

43
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:45,759
- it works. It’s very spontaneous because
it’s a living process – as you can understand

44
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,750
one seed if it has to sprout you have to just
put it in the Mother Earth, and the Mother

45
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:58,509
Earth has got the power to sprout it. And
when it sprouts it comes up by itself – in

46
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:05,289
the same way this Kundalini comes up by itself
and you can feel the Cool Breeze of the Holy

47
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:12,289
Ghost around you. Now this Cool Breeze of
the Holy Ghost has been described in the Bible,

48
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,560
has been described in all Indian Scriptures
as the all-pervading Power of God’s Love.

49
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:27,020
It’s described in all the western and eastern,
northern and southern scriptures, all the

50
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:34,760
treaties of all the saints.

51
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:41,760
So actually what happens to you that you become
a saint – but you don’t give up anything.

52
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:49,060
You exist wherever you belong. You don’t
give up anything – what is there to be given

53
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:57,940
up? Only thing you become a witness of the
whole play and you enjoy all that is created.

54
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:04,940
All that you see – it seems to be a very
dangerous thing sometimes and sometimes very

55
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:14,100
frustrating and sometimes very depressing,
everything becomes like a play. Like a thought

56
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:21,050
that rises and falls off, another thought
rises and falls off and we are jumping on

57
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:26,470
the cusp of the thought. You are thinking
about the future and the past, but we have

58
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:32,250
to be in the present. When the Kundalini rises
than you stand in the present and you see

59
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,760
the past and the future. And when you see
the past and the future you are surprised

60
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,810
that you are silent. There is no thought.

61
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,779
Now when you are out of the water it’s much
easy to solve the problem. You can see the

62
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:52,779
water and you are not afraid of it – you
are in the boat, you can enjoy the ride. But

63
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:59,779
supposing you become a master who can swim
then you can save others also. The time has

64
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:08,990
come for humanity, for all of us to get this
blessing. This is all built-in within you,

65
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,529
I don’t have to do anything. It’s like
one candle which is enlightened can enlighten

66
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:21,230
another candle. It’s enlightenment which
is just spontaneous, happens spontaneously.

67
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:28,230
So I do not deserve any credit for you and
you don’t have to be obliged about it. It’s

68
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:34,500
just your own, it’s your own property by
which you achieve. Now the knowledge about

69
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:41,010
the Kundalini, all the knowledge about all
these things are to be taken in a very open-minded

70
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,810
way like a scientific attitude.

71
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:50,500
Now I put before you, or he has put before
you this hypothesis and you should see for

72
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,600
yourself - it works or not. If it does not
work, all right – we should work harder

73
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,600
to see that it works out. But when it works,
honestly you must believe in it and you must

74
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:12,019
go with it, and you must take upon yourself
that now you are a light and you have to give

75
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:19,600
light to others. This is a very, very important
thing. As a result of this happening, of course,

76
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:26,600
diseases get cured, many incurable diseases
have been cured by Sahaja Yoga. There are

77
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:33,740
mental cases which are being cured, people
feel absolutely peaceful, the so-called tension-business

78
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:39,540
disappears. Because I think a little hole
is created and the whole heat comes out of

79
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:46,399
your heads as the tension passes out and you
feel absolutely relaxed. You look very young,

80
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:53,399
you feel very young and the whole attitude
of life changes as if you are asking for something

81
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:04,560
always, now you are standing here to give
something. All these things are at hand, you

82
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,560
don’t have to do anything difficult. And
why not, why not we all get our Realization?

83
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:22,139
I am sorry to say that I am here only for
tonight. On My way I - just as if I have stopped

84
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:27,529
here, I wish I was here for a longer period
to be with you all. But we have here some

85
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:33,470
very good Sahaja Yogis who are very senior
people, who have mastered this and they’ll

86
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:40,470
be very good to you. And they are very compassionate,
they are very righteous people and they lead

87
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,870
a very beautiful life. So you’ll be happy
to meet them and they will help you and then,

88
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:53,070
as one light enlightens another, you can go
on enlightening another people. It’s a very

89
00:12:53,070 --> 00:13:00,070
simple method, there’s nothing much is to
be done and children are the best for it.

90
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:07,440
Now I have to just say that supposing in this
place if I have to come and put on the light

91
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,940
we just have to switch on. That’s all. I
need not tell you about the whole electricity,

92
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:20,089
about the history of electricity, how it was
brought and the source of electricity. In

93
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:27,070
the same way you are built-in, it’s within
you. Through your different stages of evolution

94
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:33,300
everything is built-in within you. So you
don’t have to do much about it, but once

95
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:39,509
you get the light then it’s better to know
more about it. For example if somebody is

96
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:45,660
holding a snake in the hand, he is in the
darkness, he can’t see anything, and if

97
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,730
you tell him, “You know it’s a snake”,
he’ll say, “No, it’s a rope.” He’ll

98
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:54,329
argue with you. It’s better is to put on
the light and let him see for himself so he

99
00:13:54,329 --> 00:14:01,139
drops it. In the same way as he has told you
all your conditionings and habits drop out,

100
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:07,019
because there is light. But it’s not mental,
it’s just a happening, the center which

101
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:12,880
is here as Agnya chakra is shown there which
crosses, this center when awakened, this is

102
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:19,230
the center of Christ. When this center is
awakened it sucks in all our conditioning

103
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:26,230
and our ego, that’s why we say that He died
for our sins. But He is to be awakened, if

104
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:33,540
He is awakened then He sucks in and then you
get your Realization. This is a very simple

105
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:41,230
method built within us for our second birth
which is a reality, which is not something

106
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:48,259
just talking or words. I hope most of you
get your Realization in this beautiful atmosphere.

107
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,110
May God bless you all!

108
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:56,980
Now, I would like to have some questions from
you, but it’s so far away, you are so far

109
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:02,300
away from Me, I don’t know how will I be
able to relate, but if you have some good

110
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:09,300
questions – not to challenge or not to sort
of criticize, but ask questions which are

111
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,930
related to the subject, which will help you.
Because I am not here for seeking votes or

112
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,180
for any money or anything. You can’t give
Me anything, it’s better you take something

113
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:27,029
from Me, will be a better idea. So if you
want to ask some questions, please ask.

114
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:34,029
A lot can be said about Sahaja Yoga – I
must have given at least 4,000 lectures or

115
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,870
5,000 lectures in English language.

116
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,940
Aside: Yes, all right.

117
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,850
But that’s different, I said first have
your enlightenment and then we can talk about

118
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,589
it.

119
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:53,069
Yes please.

120
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:59,670
YOGI: Why this time in history can they have
a gift like this?

121
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:06,670
SHRI MATAJI: It’s a blossomtime, Sir. (Shri
Mataji laughing) You see, in the beginning

122
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:15,029
of the Tree of Life we had very few flowers,
but now it’s a blossomtime. We have so many

123
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:25,199
people who are seeking the truth. It was all
prophesized long time back, that the modern

124
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:36,569
times - as they call it, the Kali Yuga - you’ll
find people who will be leading a normal life,

125
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:44,519
normal householders will be seeking the truth
and they’ll find it.

126
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:52,509
SEEKER: [ What will be the result of this
special time? INDIST…]

127
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,140
YOGI: He wants to know, what will be the results
of this special time, this blossoms, what

128
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,310
will it mean, what will it do in their lives?

129
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:17,310
SHRI MATAJI: Now I would say, I mean so many
things it can do. But you see around, we have

130
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:26,569
people who are Christians, Hindus, Muslims,
Sikhs – all kinds of people we have. We

131
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:36,270
have Americans, Indians, all types - human
beings. And everybody is capable of committing

132
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:44,669
any horrible thing, any violent thing, any
sinful thing. There is no binding force. So

133
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:53,080
when we talk of peace they have no peace within
themselves. You just talk of peace, there

134
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:01,100
are foundations of peace and organizations
of peace - at the slightest pretext you find

135
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:08,100
they themselves become violent. So what you
need is the transformation of a human being

136
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:16,350
who expresses the Spirit. The Spirit which
is knowledge, knowledge which is not relative,

137
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:28,289
which is not mental, but which is absolute,
compassion and love that expresses joy. And

138
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:40,520
attention that can work out things. All this
is within the reach of human beings in these

139
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:51,000
modern times, the blossomtime.

140
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,960
We have to transform human beings. All the
problems of this world are created by human

141
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,600
beings and not by God – so that transformation
creates a beautiful race of people who are

142
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,600
collective. They act as collective beings
because your Spirit is the collective being

143
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:22,090
within you. So it’s like you become part
and parcel of the whole. If this finger is

144
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:29,360
suffering immediately My another hand helps
it. It doesn’t think I have to oblige or

145
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:36,080
anything because it’s a part and parcel
of the whole. In the same way we become genuinely

146
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:43,080
collective. As a result the complete emancipation
of humanity can be achieved.

147
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,520
The best part of the whole thing is that today
it is acting en masse. The righteousness,

148
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:09,440
the compassion, the love, the wisdom of saints
is now manifesting en masse. Other things

149
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:22,990
happen also, I would say I have known people
who never knew what is art have become artists

150
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:29,990
- artists who create things which emit divine
vibrations. Then there are people who never

151
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:43,630
could sing have started singing; those who
could not do good in their work have become

152
00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:51,669
dynamic – but despite all that they are
compassionate and honest.

153
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:02,770
I’m sorry this is the first time I’ve
come to Cincinnati, that’s why it sounds

154
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:10,370
little fantastic – but we are fantastic,
we are fantastic. In a village of India, if

155
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,740
supposing you take a television and say that,
“You can see all kinds of beautiful images”,

156
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,860
nobody is going to believe you. They’ll
say, “Ah, he’s telling stories, this is

157
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:25,860
just a box of plastic.” But when you put
to the mains it starts working. In the same

158
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:34,100
way you start working like a computer. You
are a divine computer – only thing you have

159
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:40,950
to be aware of it. And if it is going to be
that way - why not?

160
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:47,950
FEMALE SEEKER: Could you please elaborate
on how when the Kundalini is awakened, how

161
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,190
that’ll erase the negative karma?

162
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,440
SHRI MATAJI: What’s it?

163
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:07,610
YOGI: She wants to know, she is asking You
to elaborate on how when the Kundalini is

164
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,340
awakened it removes negative karma.

165
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:16,340
SHRI MATAJI: It does. You see we judge ourselves
in a very funny way, all the time we are judging

166
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,620
ourselves and feeling guilty and for small,
small things we think, “Oh! We should not

167
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:32,620
have done this way.” Even if you spill a
little coffee you think you have done a disastrous

168
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:40,370
thing. After all we are human beings – if
you make mistakes it’s all right. After

169
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:47,370
all we are not God, are we? All the time we
try condemning ourselves, we done this bad,

170
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:54,830
that one, we are negative. Also the suggestion
comes from so many ways, people say you are

171
00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:01,830
sinner, you have done this sin, that sin – just
imagine. It’s not so, we are all human beings.

172
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:16,950
So let your Kundalini which is your own individual
Mother decide what karmas you have done. And

173
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:24,630
She’ll see to it that you get rid of them.
Don’t condemn yourself. Don’t feel guilty.

174
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:32,700
That’s the first condition, if you feel
guilty I do not promise you Kundalini awakening,

175
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:43,760
to begin with. Not to feel guilty at all.
That’s first condition. Second is, we have

176
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,590
to forgive everyone. After all, whether we
forgive or if you don’t forgive, we don’t

177
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:59,590
do anything. I mean it’s a myth. We say
it’s very difficult to forgive, but what

178
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:06,690
are you doing about it? Only thing, by not
forgiving we are playing into the wrong hands.

179
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:13,240
So it’s a very great weapon we have got,
just you say, “I forgive everyone.” Don’t

180
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:20,220
count how many you have to forgive, don’t
count their mistakes and your mistakes. In

181
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:26,730
short - forget the past for the time being.

182
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:33,730
And not to feel miserable about yourself.
You have to be pleasantly placed - especially

183
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:46,049
towards yourself. If you are not pleasantly
placed towards yourself, you cannot be pleasantly

184
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:50,200
placed towards anyone.

185
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:57,200
All right? So should we have our Realization
now?

186
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,429
**** part 2 ****

187
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:10,429
It’s they are too far away, if they can
come a little forward would be better.

188
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:14,919
Yes, My child?

189
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:15,679
FEMALE SEEKER: [INDIST.]

190
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:16,940
SHRI MATAJI: I can’t hear.

191
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,440
SEEKER: [INDIST.]

192
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,700
SHRI MATAJI: What’s they say?

193
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,490
YOGI: She’s saying that children are supposed
to be born in a more enlightened stage, and

194
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:29,490
what can we do to help them maintain their
enlightening.

195
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:53,500
SHRI MATAJI: Ahh, you should get your own…
Oh Ma, they have all come here, look at that

196
00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:03,149
– that’s Cincinnati really. May God bless
you! Oh!

197
00:26:03,149 --> 00:26:10,149
Look at that! May God bless you all! Ah, but
– yes, yes – by getting Realization you’ll

198
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:20,360
understand your children much better and you
can do much better for them. Oh, it’s great,

199
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:39,950
isn’t it? Please put Me forward.

200
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:59,020
I have just to ask you to take out your shoes,
because shoes little bit tighten your feet.

201
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,980
So just take out your shoes if possible.

202
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,480
Aside: It’s all right, I have a shawl on
Me.

203
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:16,480
With such earnestness, what beautiful people
you are - really so beautiful.

204
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:26,649
So we are all going to enter into the kingdom
of God, and nobody has to feel guilty. When

205
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:33,649
you are going on a big journey, so pleasant
at that we have to be very pleasant, we have

206
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,809
to be very happy and enthusiastic.

207
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:46,809
All right, it’s very, very simple – extremely
simple as I told you. They – as he has told

208
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:00,120
that we have to little bit help our centers.
And on the left-hand side we’ll be helping

209
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:06,299
our centers. All those who are sitting up
on the chair should take out their shoes also,

210
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:10,250
please – and put your feet on the Mother
Earth because this Mother Earth helps us a

211
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:15,620
lot, She is a very helpful thing. And so,
if you could take out your shoes I’ll be

212
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:21,620
thankful. For a little while, only ten minutes
at the most. (Shri Mataji laughing)

213
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:26,010
Takes about ten minutes, not more than that
– and that much time we can always give

214
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:33,010
to ourselves. And those who are sitting on
a chair have to put both the feet apart from

215
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:43,580
each other. The best are those who are sitting
on the ground. All right. But in any case

216
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,360
it will work, I am sure.

217
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:54,360
Now what we have to do is to understand as
he has told you in a very short form, that

218
00:28:54,450 --> 00:29:01,450
the left side is the power of desire, so you
put the left hand towards Me, just like this,

219
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:08,700
very comfortably, without troubling much,
just the left hand like that. Be comfortable.

220
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,070
You can’t sit with the legs like that? Those
who can’t sit like that, it will be difficult,

221
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:20,970
so at least have one foot up and another like
that – so that you can put the left hand

222
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:27,970
towards Me. And the right hand on the Mother
Earth – here on the heart. On the heart.

223
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:39,720
In the heart resides the Spirit – so first
we put our hand on the center where resides

224
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:47,490
the Spirit. Then we take down our hand and
put it on the upper part of our abdomen on

225
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:58,159
the left-hand side. Left hand all the time
like this – desiring to get your Realization.

226
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:09,169
Then one has to understand that if you are
the Spirit you are also your master, you are

227
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,450
also your guide – because there is light
and you know what is to be done, you don’t

228
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:22,450
need any master, you don’t need any guru.
You become your own guru. Then you take your

229
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:28,279
right hand and put it in the lower part of
your abdomen, lower part on the left-hand

230
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:32,130
side.

231
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:39,130
The upper one was the center of your mastery,
the lower one is the center which gives you

232
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:47,299
the manifestation of the Divine Power in your
central nervous system – means it’s the

233
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:55,519
pure knowledge. It’s not the knowledge that
you just know through your mental activity,

234
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:02,519
but is the pure knowledge. Like I can feel
this is hot, or cold, this is red, this is

235
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:09,769
pink – in the same way. Absolutely. That’s
the center for your pure knowledge.

236
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:20,620
Then you take back your hand on the upper
part of your abdomen, again on the left-hand

237
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:28,470
side, to raise the Kundalini as we’ll do
later on with closing our eyes.

238
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:39,210
Then you have to take it to your heart. And
then you have to take your hand in the corner

239
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:52,380
of your neck and your shoulder and turn your
head to your right. Now this is the center

240
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:59,880
I was talking about which is always very much
caught up, because we feel guilty. And is

241
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:09,659
the worst center, because it causes horrible
diseases like angina, spondylitis - all kinds

242
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:16,659
of headaches. So please put your hand as far
as possible on the back and turn your head

243
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,370
to your right.

244
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:27,370
Now this hand again is brought onto the forehead
across – as we put it sometimes for our

245
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:35,960
headache, and press it on both the sides.
This is the center of forgiveness. Then we

246
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:42,960
take back our hand and put it on the backside
of our head and push our head on top and look

247
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:53,519
up. Now, this is the center for asking forgiveness
without counting your mistakes, your guilts

248
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,899
and all kinds of condemnations.

249
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:07,899
Then you stretch your hand, stretch your hand
and put the left hand with the center of your

250
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:15,230
palm, you put the center of your palm, bend
your head in the - on the fontanel bone area,

251
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:27,750
which was a soft bone in your childhood. Just
adjust it properly and then push back your

252
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:35,500
fingers, press it hard and move your scalp
very slowly seven times. Very slowly, clockwise.

253
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:56,730
All this we have to do just now closing our
eyes. Just we have to close our eyes, because

254
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:03,730
our attention has to go inside. Please put
your left hand towards Me. And you can take

255
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:19,659
out your spectacles, would be better because
your eyes also are helped. Now, please put

256
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:29,100
your right hand on your heart and left hand
towards Me with both the legs apart from each

257
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,140
other, not for the sitting people but otherwise.

258
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:39,140
Now, at this point you have to ask Me a questions
three times, a very important question. You

259
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:49,420
can call Me Shri Mataji or you can call Me
Mother, “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask

260
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:56,420
this question three times. It’s a computer-style
of meditation, so ask a question, “Mother,

261
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:04,320
am I the Spirit?” Ask this question three
times. You are not to be diffident about anything

262
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:14,140
at this moment.

263
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:23,740
Now - if you are the Spirit you are also the
master, so take down your hand in the upper

264
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:37,680
portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side
and press it hard which is the center of mastery

265
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:44,680
and ask another question three times, “Mother,
am I my own master?” Please ask this question

266
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:51,760
three times, “Mother, am I my own master?
Mother, am I my own master?” Please ask

267
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:04,420
this question - within your heart.

268
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:13,410
Now, please take your hand in the lower portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side and

269
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:21,570
press it hard. As I told you this is the center
of pure knowledge but I cannot force you to

270
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:31,900
accept pure knowledge, it cannot be done.
So you have to ask for it in your freedom

271
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:38,900
and glory. So please say six times, because
this petal has got - this center has got six

272
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:48,670
petals, so please say it six times, “Mother,
please give me pure knowledge.” Please ask

273
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:09,030
six times.

274
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:16,030
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the
Kundalini starts moving and so we have to

275
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:24,810
help the other centers to be opened out with
our right hand. So we put our right hand in

276
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:32,470
the upper portion of our abdomen on the left-hand
side and here we say with full confidence

277
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:46,720
to open this center of mastery ten times,
we say it ten times, “Mother, I am my own

278
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:57,540
master. Mother, I am my own master”, we
say it ten times.

279
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:16,850
Now, one has to know the truth and the truth
is, you are not this body, you are not this

280
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:36,970
mind, you are not this intelligence, you are
not your ego nor your conditioning - you are

281
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:46,720
the pure Spirit. So please raise your right
hand on your heart and say with full confidence

282
00:38:54,700 --> 00:39:01,700
twelve times - please say it with full confidence
- twelve times, “Mother, I am the Spirit.

283
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:16,330
Mother, I am the Spirit.”

284
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:30,610
Now one has to know that the Divine is the
ocean of bliss and joy, it is the ocean of

285
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:43,830
love and compassion, but above all it is the
ocean of forgiveness. And we cannot do anything

286
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:55,500
that cannot be dissolved by this ocean of
forgiveness. So now raise your hand in the

287
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:05,150
corner of your neck and your shoulder, as
far as back you can take it, and turn your

288
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:13,430
head to your right. Here with full confidence
you have to say sixteen times, with full confidence,

289
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:28,980
sixteen times you have to say, “Mother - Mother
I’m not guilty at all.” Please say it

290
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:36,300
sixteen times. “Mother, I’m not guilty
at all.” And don’t think, “How can I

291
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:42,320
say and how can I not say.” Let your Kundalini
judge you, you should not judge yourself.

292
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:49,320
Please say it sixteen times with full confidence.

293
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:13,260
Now - sixteen times.

294
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:26,910
We have to know, the greatest weapon we have
is that we can forgive others. When we forgive

295
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:36,910
others we get out of the clutches of other
people and the Divine looks after them. So

296
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:46,850
please now raise your hand onto your forehead
and bend your head and press it hard on both

297
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:55,430
the sides. Bend your head and press it hard
on both the sides. Here you have to say from

298
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:08,700
your heart, not how many times but from your
heart, genuinely please say, “Mother, I

299
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:16,840
forgive everyone.” Please say that, “Mother,
I forgive everyone.” It’s very simple

300
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:27,120
to say, just you have to say it. Earnestly
from your heart, please say.

301
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:41,530
Now take back your hand on the backside of
your head and push back your head. Rest on

302
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:54,210
the hand. Here – without feeling guilty,
without finding faults with you, without counting

303
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:05,880
how many mistakes you have committed – for
your own satisfaction, in general you have

304
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:12,880
to say, “Oh Divine, if I have done any mistakes
please forgive. Oh Divine, if I have done

305
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:22,970
any mistakes please forgive.” From your
heart. Not how many times, but from your heart.

306
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:35,660
Now, please stretch your hand and put the
center of your palm on the soft bone that

307
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:47,330
you have, on top of your head when you were
a child, press it hard, push back your fingers,

308
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:55,640
press the scalp and move it slowly. But here
again, I cannot force Self Realization on

309
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:03,980
you, you have to ask for it. You have to ask
for self-enlightenment, so please say, “Mother,

310
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:13,710
please give me my Self Realization.” Seven
times, when you move your scalp seven times

311
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:22,480
clockwise, please.

312
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:30,750
(Shri Mataji blows eight times into the microphone.)

313
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:05,160
Now take down your hand, put down both, put
your hands towards Me, both of them and open

314
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:21,980
your eyes slowly. Watch Me without thinking,
you can do it. Now put the right hand towards

315
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:33,170
Me and see for yourself, bend your head, and
see for yourself if there’s a Cool Breeze

316
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:40,210
coming out of your fontanel bone area. Just
see for yourself. You have to certify yourself,

317
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:48,450
I’m not going to say anything, just see
yourself. Bend your head - better to be seen

318
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:57,210
this way. Now, not to – be close to your
[ head ?]. Little higher. You have to put

319
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:04,010
it little higher. See for yourself if there
is – some people get it very much away.

320
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:11,010
Just see, some people will get hot air, doesn’t
matter. The heat has to come out, then the

321
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:11,960
Cool Breeze starts coming.

322
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:18,210
Now, put the left hand towards Me. With the
right hand you try to feel the Cool Breeze.

323
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:25,210
Now – again - at last, put again the left
hand - little further. See for yourself if

324
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:52,050
there is a Cool Breeze coming out of your
fontanel bone area. Hmm.

325
00:46:53,130 --> 00:47:00,130
Now, you put your both the hands towards the
sky and look up. Ask a question, anyone of

326
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:12,060
these questions, three times, “Mother, is
this the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother,

327
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:20,660
is this the all-pervading Power of God’s
Love? Mother is this the Brahma Chaitanya?”

328
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:33,110
Ask this question three times.

329
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:40,110
Now please take down your hands. Now see,
if you are feeling the Cool Breeze in your

330
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:48,160
hands. Now watch, there is no tree moving,
no leaf - not a single leaf is moving. They’re

331
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:55,450
all watching you, if you are feeling the Cool
Breeze. There is no air-conditioning or anything.

332
00:47:55,450 --> 00:48:02,450
Now all those who have felt the Cool Breeze
in their hands or out of their head – or

333
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:14,280
heat – please raise your hands. Both the
hands. Oh My God. Oh, may God bless you. What

334
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:27,820
a place Cincinnati is, really what a place,
so many seekers. I really bow to you all very

335
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:38,660
much and next time I’m going to come here
for more time to be with you. So heartening.

336
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:44,260
May God bless you!

337
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:51,260
We have a follow-on course and they are going
to look after you. Those who have not felt

338
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:59,330
also Cool Breeze will feel. Everybody can
feel it. And only thing is, it is beyond your

339
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:09,670
thought. So you can’t argue it out, you
cannot think about it. Try to remain in thoughtless

340
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:16,830
awareness. Please come and see these people
and they will definitely help you out to fix

341
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:25,750
your connections. In any case I would like
to meet you, if you want to shake hands with

342
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:26,320
Me – I’ll be very happy.
Thank you!

343
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:31,430
Aside: Please, can you remove this?

344
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:38,430
So many people now, what to say? (Shri Mataji
laughing) Tremendous, they are tremendous!

345
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:48,210
YOGI: You want the microphones off?

346
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:55,210
SHRI MATAJI: Ah? No, no. No more.
