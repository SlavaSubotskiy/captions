11 April 1991

3
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:24,760
13:29
Please be seated. I think I’ll stand up

4
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:36,140
and speak, would be better now.

5
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:27,990
14:41
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

6
00:14:53,459 --> 00:15:00,459
At the very outset we have to know that truth
is what it is. We cannot conceptualize it,

7
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:12,740
we cannot change it, we cannot buy it, and
also unfortunately at this human level we

8
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:25,140
cannot know it. The truth is that you are
not this body, this mind, this intellect,

9
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:43,459
this ego, these conditionings, but you are
the pure spirit. The second truth is that

10
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:57,649
there is a all-pervading Power of divine love,
which is very subtle and which works out all

11
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:06,399
the living work.

12
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:13,240
You see all these beautiful flowers here,
and we take them for granted. We never even

13
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,110
think from where have they come, how have
they come, from a one little seed how – and

14
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:25,110
so many varieties, so many types – how they
have been created and how they grow, and how

15
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:39,970
a flower becomes a fruit. Look at ourselves;
look at our eyes. It’s one of the greatest

16
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:46,519
cameras you could think of. Look at every
machinery that is within us, how it is working

17
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:53,519
beautifully there. But we do not think about
it; we take it for granted.

18
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:01,320
All this living work is done by this all-pervading
Power of divine love. Now when I say that,

19
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:10,769
you need not accept it blindfolded. But I
would request you to have a scientific mind,

20
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,959
have a scientific attitude that you keep yourself
open. Treat this as a hypothesis, and if it

21
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:29,289
is proved then you have to accept it as truth,
if you are honest, because it is not only

22
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:40,450
for individual emancipation but for the emancipation
of the whole world.

23
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:53,080
As I have told you that truth cannot be understood
or felt at this human level because we are

24
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:09,320
mental, at the most, if not emotional being,
or we are mixture of both. We are a bundle

25
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:17,220
of conditionings and egos and everything,
but we are not our selves. When we say “my

26
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,780
ego”, “my intelligence”, “my body”
– but where is this “my”? From where

27
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:28,730
does this word “my” comes? This is what
is the spirit within us.

28
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:35,730
You have been already explained about a mechanism
we have here … and you have been already

29
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:51,530
told this kind of a mechanism exists within
us. (If you remove this one would be better,

30
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:05,290
I think.) Now this mechanism does exist within
us, and is for your last breakthrough in your

31
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:15,670
evolutionary process. You have become from
amoeba to a human state, but we have not yet

32
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:25,760
known the absolute truth. We have not yet
known the absolute knowledge.

33
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:35,270
[Microphone falls down.] All right, now can
you see that? It’s just for your seeing

34
00:19:54,290 --> 00:20:01,290
we are managing something! It’s all right.
But this is all within yourself, is all within

35
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:07,840
yourself which is not going to fall out!

36
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,840
So, we have this mechanism, as I told you,
for your last breakthrough. If we had known

37
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:32,290
the absolute truth and if we had the absolute
knowledge, there would have been no quarrelling,

38
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:40,030
no different “isms”; there would have
been no wars. But because we haven’t got

39
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:50,780
that, we are separated by ignorance, and everybody
thinks “I’m right. Whatever I am doing

40
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:58,530
is the correct thing and whatever I am thinking
is the correct thing.” But there is no way

41
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:05,770
to judge whether it is correct or not. Like
when you say it’s a one meter long, then

42
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:13,460
we have a meter, as you know, in the Museum
of Paris which is kept as one meter all the

43
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:24,919
time. But that, unless and until you discover
we are living in a relative world without

44
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:35,260
any absolute relativity. That’s why there
is chaos; that’s why there are problems.

45
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:43,360
Most of the problems if you see are created
by human beings.

46
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:53,240
These problems, if you just try to locate,
are just based because we haven’t found

47
00:21:54,290 --> 00:22:01,130
out the absolute knowledge. For example, if
this place is completely dark and you can’t

48
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:07,610
see anyone and if you start all running, you’ll
hit someone, somebody will fall down, somebody

49
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:14,610
will be beaten up, somebody might get hurt
because there is darkness, there is confusion.

50
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:23,040
These are the days of the greatest confusion
that we are born in, and it’s promised that

51
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,480
in those days of confusion only you are going
to find out the truth. That’s why there

52
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:35,480
is a category of people, as William Blake
has said, are the men of God who will find

53
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,549
themselves and they will make others the men
of God.

54
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:49,549
The time has come for you all to have your
Self-realization, your self-knowledge. As

55
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:58,040
a result of that you develop a new awareness.
You develop – again I say it’s a question

56
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:05,160
of becoming; it is not certifying – you
develop a new awareness on your central nervous

57
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:14,510
system, which we call as “collective consciousness.”
Is described by Jung very clearly. This is

58
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:23,540
where you can feel your centers on your fingertips,
and you can feel the centers of other people

59
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:33,820
on your fingertips. Now only thing you have
to do is to know what do they denote – this

60
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:40,190
decoding has been done already – and how
to correct them.

61
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:47,190
So, to correct your being physically, mentally,
emotionally and also spiritually, you have

62
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:54,440
to enter inside your being – which you cannot.
For example, you are paying attention to Me,

63
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:01,350
but if I say “pay attention to yourself”
you cannot. You cannot pay attention to yourself

64
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:07,500
inside. So something has to happen, and this
something is the awakening of this residual

65
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:14,500
power which we call as “kundalini.” It’s
a Sanskrit word: “kundal” means “the

66
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:22,700
coils” and is there in three-and-a-half
coils, this energy is settled down. If this

67
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:30,100
energy is awakened, just like a primule in
a seed – it’s a living process – just

68
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:37,900
like a seed sprouts, this kundalini gets awakened,
passes through six centers, pierces through

69
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:47,230
the last one, and you yourself feel the cool
breeze coming out of your head. And then for

70
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:53,490
the first time you start feeling this cool
breeze – it’s not very cool, it’s very

71
00:24:53,490 --> 00:25:00,450
pleasantly cool – which is the all-pervading
Power of divine love.

72
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:07,450
With this you become like a divine computer.
You can feel the centers which are in trouble

73
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:18,919
within yourself. You can feel the centers
of people around. You can feel the centers

74
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:25,440
of people who are far away, also the centers
of people who are dead and gone. That’s

75
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,690
how you can know who was a realized soul who
came on this Earth, and who was a nasty fellow

76
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:37,900
and who was a devil. Otherwise there is no
way of making out.

77
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:44,470
For example, from India people get out of
the jail, immediately they wear these saffron-colored

78
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:51,470
clothes and are in Australia: they become
big gurus. And Australians had lot of money,

79
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:59,710
and they have really fed them with that. So
many of them are coming down. But not so many,

80
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:06,690
because so many are exposed also, so many
are in jail, so many have died. But still,

81
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,610
they can say that “the world is coming to
an end, and you must do this. This is happening,

82
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,679
and you must do that”; and just frighten
you.

83
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,970
And you think, “Oh, otherwise, you see,
how can they tell lies?” But they are thieves!

84
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:25,450
They are coming from the jail direct – you
find out their bona fides: from what kind

85
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:32,049
of families they come, what sort of education
they have had? But blindfolded, people go

86
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:38,419
to them and get infected by them. Mostly they
are mesmerizers and they spoil your chances

87
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:45,270
of your ascent. Not only that: they can give
you some diseases, they can give you some

88
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,610
sort of a brain – you might have an effect
of your taking a drug. Anything can they do,

89
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:54,750
I don’t know to what extent they can go;
because so many have come to Me, and I am

90
00:26:54,750 --> 00:27:00,539
really now fed up the way people are still
running after them, paying them money. It’s

91
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:05,000
something like you see some people coming
out of the pub and falling down on the street,

92
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and others try to push their way inside to
get again the same way.

93
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:18,000
But in spirituality you have to know that
you cannot pay. It’s a living process of

94
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
living energy; it’s a living process. (Will
you take photographs afterwards? All right?)

95
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:37,070
So the second thing that should happen to
you as a result of Self-realization, that

96
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:44,070
you get empowered yourself. You yourself can
give realizations to others. You can find

97
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:52,330
out about another person, you can give them
realization, you can cure them. You can help

98
00:27:53,429 --> 00:28:00,429
them in every way possible. It’s like one
enlightened light can enlighten another light.

99
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:08,000
You are all ready for it, absolutely ready
to get enlightened. I don’t have to do much,

100
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,460
you will see that – how easily you all can
get your realization. It has to be easy, it

101
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:20,669
has to be sahaj, it has to be spontaneous,
because the time has come. And also this all-pervading

102
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:27,669
Power has become extremely active, extremely
active, and it is working wonders everywhere.

103
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:35,270
When the kundalini rises on this center, then
you reach a state which we call as thoughtless

104
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,730
awareness – in Sanskrit it’s called as
“nirvichar samadhi.” When you watch something

105
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:48,480
you just watch, you don’t think. If you
want to think you can think, but you are not

106
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,100
bombarded by thoughts, you are not under the
control of thoughts. Then she rises above

107
00:28:54,100 --> 00:29:00,590
and pierces through here, and establishes
a connection properly: then you get into another

108
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:05,909
kind of a higher awareness we call as “nirvikalpa
samadhi”, which is a doubtless awareness,

109
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:12,909
in which you start raising the kundalini of
others, curing others, helping others, knowing

110
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:20,030
such a lot of knowledge; because once this
kundalini goes into the limbic area, she enlightens

111
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:26,059
these thousand petals there – that is the
thousand nerves.

112
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:33,059
Many children I’ve seen who have been absolutely
very dull children now are scoring above everybody

113
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:41,190
else, getting scholarships. We have some boys
who have done their engineering or chartered

114
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:50,409
accountancy and all this thing in very, very
record time; they have records. They always

115
00:29:50,409 --> 00:29:57,409
stand first and they are doing very well in
their education, but despite all that they

116
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:03,929
are extremely humble and obedient. They respect
their teachers, they respect everyone; because

117
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:10,929
the new virtue which has come in them is the
respect, to respect others, which we have

118
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,350
lost long time back.

119
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:20,000
The second thing that happens to a person
is this: that you become absolutely free.

120
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,780
Of course, in the beginning also I respect
your freedom. I cannot force Self-realization

121
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:32,780
on you – you have to ask for it. Otherwise,
I cannot force it on you. But when you get

122
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:40,820
your Self-realization you become really free,
in the sense that you are able to be free.

123
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:48,370
Like we think we are free, but we have addictions,
we are slaves to so many things, we cannot

124
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:55,370
control ourselves; so we are not free. But
when you become a self-realized person all

125
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,770
such things which dominate us – whether
it’s addiction, alcoholism, any habit, any

126
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:06,770
such thing, tempers, or too much interest
in wrong things – all drops out and you

127
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:15,780
become really a able person: absolutely you
have the ability to be enjoying your freedom

128
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:25,090
and your virtues. Then it happens that you
start seeing everything, as I told you, and

129
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,620
not getting into thoughts.

130
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:38,620
The human nature is such that whatever you
see, you react. But after getting Self-realization

131
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:46,770
you do not react, and your mind is thoughtless.
It’s like a lake which has no ripples on

132
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:53,770
it, and all that is created around that lake
is reflected inside. In the same way when

133
00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:01,669
you watch something, you just watch it. Now
I watch these flowers: I’m just watching,

134
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:07,789
and all the joy that the Creator has put it
in it, it doesn’t come to Me as words but

135
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:13,590
as joy itself, and it starts pouring on Me
and it soothes Me down.

136
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:20,289
You become a person without tension, because
tension comes to you through thoughts. But

137
00:32:20,289 --> 00:32:24,880
thoughts are coming from the past or from
the future, and they throng your head and

138
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:31,880
give you this tension. When the kundalini
rises she comes in between two thoughts, so

139
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:42,179
the future and past – the kundalini is in
the center, that is, in the present. So you

140
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:47,850
just stand in the present, and when you are
in the present there is no tension in your

141
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:54,710
mind. These days there’s a big trouble people
are having of tensions, blood pressures and

142
00:32:54,710 --> 00:33:01,440
all kinds of things, which are absolutely
there because this window has not yet opened

143
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,630
out. Once it has opened out everything goes
away, and you are extremely a relaxed person.

144
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:12,620
You also reduce at least ten years of your
age. As you know, I am sixty-eight years of

145
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:18,960
age and I am travelling every third or fourth
day all over the world. So you get very dynamic

146
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,470
and you get such a lot of energy within you.
At the same time you are very compassionate,

147
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:31,470
you are very considerate, and you are extremely
wise. In every way you are helped: you are

148
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,309
helped in your business, you are helped in
your work, you are helped in your relationship

149
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:41,100
with, in your family, with others, and the
whole thing becomes like a beautiful drama

150
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,120
you are playing.

151
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:47,770
I’m telling, all these things sound very
fantastic to you, and should find – because

152
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:52,720
you might say “we have never seen such angels
before.” But there is a chance for all of

153
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:59,720
you to become that. Supposing you take a television
into a remote village of India where they

154
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,710
have never seen a television, and tell them
that “you can see pictures from all over

155
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,140
the world inside this.”

156
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,289
They’ll say, “What, this box? Useless
thing – how can it be?” But when you put

157
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:16,789
it to the mains, then they see the miracles
of it. In the same way when you are put it,

158
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:21,720
you are put to the mains you start seeing
the miracles of your being. Then you understand

159
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:28,720
how glorified you are, how beautiful you are,
and what is the purpose of your life.

160
00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:34,820
There’s no end to this knowledge. For example,
in here so many lights I see here, but to

161
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:41,820
put them on there might be only one switch
and you can put on all the lights. But supposing

162
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:47,800
I have to tell you all the history, how it
came and how the electricity came, and then

163
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:53,570
how it was brought in Melbourne and how it
was fixed and everything, it’s quite boring.

164
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:58,900
So the best thing is just to put on the light
first. So I would request you, you’d better

165
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:05,150
have your Self-realization first and then
understand, because it’s a very subtle subject

166
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:09,440
and I don’t know how many thousand lectures
I have given only in English language. There

167
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:16,230
are many other languages I speak, but only
in English language I don’t know how many

168
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:19,830
lectures I have given, and every time they
say, “Mother, every time You say something

169
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:26,830
new.” I am giving you thus a introduction
to Sahaja Yoga.

170
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:33,920
Now, once you get your realization you have
to know it works on collectivity. It’s not

171
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,830
that you go home and say, “All right, Mother,
I am meditating at home.” It would be like

172
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:45,070
a nail cut out of the body. You don’t have
to pay for anything, but you have to give

173
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:50,200
some time for your Self-realization and you
have to come to the collective. Luckily in

174
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:55,260
Melbourne we have wonderful people who have
achieved great heights in Sahaja Yoga. They

175
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:01,280
are extremely humble, they are extremely beautiful
people, and I’m sure they’ll help you

176
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,170
to achieve the same heights as they have achieved.

177
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:10,130
This is what we have to get. We have to emancipate
the human beings to solve all our problems,

178
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:16,089
to enter into the Kingdom of God. This has
been promised, and this promise has to be

179
00:36:16,089 --> 00:36:23,089
fulfilled. Of course, before I go ahead with
the process of Self-realization which will

180
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:30,220
take ten minutes only, I would request you
to ask Me questions. But ask relevant questions,

181
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:38,680
questions which show your curiosity to get
your realization, because I’m not here for

182
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:45,680
any votes, nor am I here for any money. I
am here to give you your own key of your own

183
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:52,790
treasures. So accordingly, please ask Me questions.
I’ll be very thankful to you. May God bless

184
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,890
you.

185
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:15,890
[Question: He says he thinks he is reaching
that stage, but could You tell him the symptoms?]

186
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:40,960
Yes. We’ll tell him. You see, first what
happens, that you start feeling the cool breeze

187
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:53,520
out of your head. Sometimes you might get
hot also, hot breeze coming out; then you

188
00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:00,520
start feeling the cool breeze all around it.
Then you become aware of it and you work it

189
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:11,550
out. Then you give realizations to others.
All these things happen, and you become extremely

190
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:17,430
peaceful, loving, affectionate, and a righteous
person – you become. It’s not like following

191
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:24,089
any religion as such, because when we follow
a religion we can do, we can commit any mistakes;

192
00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:31,089
any sins we can commit. But Sahaja Yoga is
such that religion is born within you – like

193
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,339
here, as we have got eight valencies within
us, ten valencies within us, and these ten

194
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:40,300
valencies are in this green part: when they’re
awakened, you become religious. You become.

195
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,910
You are not to be told, you just become. I
don’t have to tell you “don’t do this”

196
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:51,910
– I never say that. It just happens, because
you see in the light what is right and what

197
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,080
is wrong.

198
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:03,080
[Question: What is God, for You, and is God
a separate entity?]

199
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:21,480
Ya, He is. He is, and God for Me is the one
who is witnessing everything. But He has His

200
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:27,510
Power which is the Primordial Mother, which
is the Holy Ghost, which is reflected within

201
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:34,510
you as the kundalini, and God is reflected
within you as the spirit in your heart. At

202
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:41,339
this point they meet, and that’s how you
get your Self-realization. But such a wide

203
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:48,339
subject it is, so you have to have more patience
for such a wider subject.

204
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:55,550
[Question: Will there ever come a time when
the negative force in society will cease to

205
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,589
exist?]

206
00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:25,589
Yes, of course, if you help us.

207
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,660
[Question: Which Indian saints or masters
do You acknowledge, or did any of them inspire

208
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,680
You in Your cause?]

209
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:38,589
Yah, all of them were there, and there are
some more but they have all disappeared in

210
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:44,730
the Himalayas, because they say that “these
human beings are absolutely dullards and they

211
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:51,730
won’t listen to us; You try Your luck!”
We have so many saints in India who are no

212
00:40:54,770 --> 00:41:01,359
more, who really came down to the masses.
The first one who really ventured to talk

213
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,760
to masses was Gyaneshwara, Saint Gyaneshwara.

214
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,329
About kundalini it was written in so many
Sanskrit books, so many of them, you see,

215
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:17,589
but never in a local or a vernacular language.
So Gyaneshwara in the twelfth century first

216
00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:23,990
time talked about it. He took the permission
of his master – because it was a tradition

217
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:30,990
to have one master and one disciple – and
he wrote it about it in his book first of

218
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:38,260
all. And today the time has come for you to
get en masse realization. There are so many

219
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:44,849
saints that I really, in this thing I cannot
tell you, but there was Ramadasa, there is

220
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:51,849
Nanaka, there is Kabira – so many of them
– Adi Shankaracharya; in India, as you ask.

221
00:41:54,070 --> 00:42:01,070
But outside also: William Blake was another
saint.

222
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:09,770
[Question: He says that T.M. talks about Self-realization.
What is the difference between their talking

223
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,300
about Self-realization and You talking about
it?]

224
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:47,329
Now they have started. They never talked about
it before, and they are just talking. If I

225
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:51,790
have to tell you everything frankly about
T.M., it’s better that you listen to it.

226
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:58,790
I’m not afraid of them. I had the head of
their siddha – what they call the “flying

227
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:07,190
academy” – head of that, the director,
one Mr. Peter Pearce, his wife, his deputy

228
00:43:08,089 --> 00:43:13,440
director and his child, all suffering from
epilepsy, came to Me. Luckily My husband was

229
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,800
not at home those days, so I kept them in
My house and treated them, and got them well.

230
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,119
He’s about to write a book about it.

231
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,790
Now I asked him what do they do. So he told
Me – because he was in it – he said that

232
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:35,230
they give three mantras, first stage they
give three mantras, and these three mantras,

233
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:42,230
they were to pay three thousand pounds. Now
these three mantras, out of them any one could

234
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:50,030
be yours. One was “inga”, another was
“pinga”, another was “tinga”. Now

235
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,550
any Indian would laugh at it because they
know there is, these are not Sanskrit words.

236
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:01,310
“Inga” means the scorpion bite; the “pinga”
means a person when he gets possessed, he

237
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:06,290
goes round, is called “pinga” – it is
also in vernacular language, not in Sanskrit

238
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:13,290
– and “tinga” means showing like this.
And they paid three thousand – done! It’s

239
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:16,640
all marketing. People are so stupid!

240
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:23,640
I mean, I have a disciple who came to Me from
T.M., her sister was in lunatic asylum. We

241
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:28,640
had to work so hard on her, but now she’s
cured; and this barrister girl, poor thing,

242
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:34,450
she suffered so much. So many people have
gone into recluses. She told Me that she had

243
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:41,450
to go to Switzerland, pay six thousand pounds
for a course of seven days. And the first

244
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:46,550
day they were given – this is for flying
in the air. Now this is also another stupidity,

245
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:52,490
to go for flying in the air, half-way through
– what is the need? As it is, today there

246
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:59,490
was such a lot of jam; you see, if you start
flying like this, then no car can move! What

247
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:06,740
is the need for you to fly at three feet?
But this is stupidity, and for that stupidity

248
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:12,930
she paid six thousand pounds. And she had
to go to Switzerland, and she said, “No

249
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:18,230
arrangements for us, nothing. We were to live
in a big hall, and they asked us that we have

250
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:25,230
to jump on, what you call these foam mattresses,”
and she broke her bottom, and many broke their

251
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:34,609
bottom. And they were asked, they were asked
to give. And they were given to drink the

252
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:41,280
water that boiled the potatoes for six days,
and the seventh day they were given the rind,

253
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:48,280
and the fifth day the potatoes. For that they
paid six thousand pounds! She’s a daughter

254
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:51,920
of a very, very rich man.

255
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,650
But this is what it is, if you have surplus
money there are people to befool you. There’s

256
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:04,550
a market, it’s all marketing. Now they are
marketing what you call ayurveda. What is

257
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:09,900
there to market ayurveda? You can buy things
directly from India; you don’t need a guru

258
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:15,180
for that. And most of the ayurveda cannot
be practiced abroad because these are made

259
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:21,960
out of fresh leaves. But if you have to treat
yourself with ayurveda you can go to India.

260
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:28,480
But Sahaja Yoga is a direct method that you
can cure yourself by, with your kundalini

261
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:35,480
awakening. There are two doctors in Delhi
University who have got their M.D. on Sahaja

262
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:43,960
Yoga, which proved that Sahaja Yoga can cure
many incurable diseases. We have cured. Not

263
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:50,960
that I have cured, but people are cured through
Sahaja Yoga. Diseases like blood cancer, myelitis,

264
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,380
so many diseases have been cured, and there
are so many that I really do not know how

265
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,589
to even keep account. We cannot keep account
of them.

266
00:47:02,589 --> 00:47:07,790
So this is what T.M. is. Whatever they talk,
they should prove it. Have you met any T.M.

267
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:14,790
fellow who can give realizations to others,
or who can talk like Stephen? There is no

268
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:24,130
modus operandi. There is no modus operandi
they can describe – nothing. On the contrary,

269
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:29,839
if you are a doctor you can find them out
just like that. Once in a lecture there was

270
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:36,839
a Sahaja yogi, who is now head of the Psychology
Department in Amman – he was there in their

271
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:42,579
meetings – and they said that when you take
the brain scan, you see the theta waves. Immediately

272
00:47:42,579 --> 00:47:48,810
he got up, he said, “But you get it with
epilepsy; you get it with epilepsy.”

273
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:53,099
And they were shocked. They just got round
him and said, “Doctor, will you come and

274
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:57,180
have some tea with us?” and this. Then he
went there and they were offering him money

275
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:04,180
and all that. Is all money business. If you
have intelligence you can understand it, that

276
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:10,319
it’s all money. You cannot purchase it.
How much money did you give to Christ? How

277
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:17,319
much money did you give to Krishna or to Rama,
or to any one of them? Those people whom you

278
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:25,069
can purchase are your servants; they cannot
be your gurus.

279
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:33,670
[Seeker: I was in Siddha Yoga for seven years
and I have a lot of problems.]

280
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,030
You will, but I know that, I’ll manage that.
It’s very difficult, but I’ll manage.

281
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:42,230
I know, with all these yogas you get nothing
but trouble. I know that.

282
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:47,210
[Seeker: I tend to get very sleepy and tired,
and meditation makes me even sleepier.]

283
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:54,210
I know. I know that. I’ll help you, don’t
you worry. I’ll help you, all right? Definitely.

284
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,849
I know this is not only your case, it’s
so many. But in Australia he was so popular.

285
00:49:00,849 --> 00:49:07,650
I don’t know why he was so popular here.
You are supposed to be much more intelligent

286
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:12,630
than normal people! Aren’t you?

287
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:19,630
[Question: What are Your views on eating meat,
as opposed to vegetarianism?]

288
00:49:24,589 --> 00:49:31,589
You see, we, in Sahaja Yoga we treat a person
according to his needs. Supposing you need

289
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:41,359
proteins, you have to have proteins. Supposing
you need more carbohydrates, so you have to

290
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:46,480
have carbohydrates. It’s a balancing thing.
By eating meat or anything – like you think,

291
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:53,150
if you save some chickens, can I give them
realization? Simple question. So we are paying

292
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:57,240
too much attention to all nonsensical things.
What you have to think, what we are human

293
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:04,240
beings on top of everything. Of course, some
people don’t have to eat meat because they

294
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:11,270
have problems; but some people have to eat
meat because they have problems. We have to

295
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:19,970
be logical about everything.

296
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:28,490
These are all fads, or “isms”. These are
fads: don’t do this, wear this kind of a

297
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:34,339
dress, go on the street and sing “Hare Rama,
Hare Krishna” or do another nonsensical

298
00:50:34,339 --> 00:50:40,849
thing, or jump here. These are all fads and
fashions. The fashion started that you should

299
00:50:40,849 --> 00:50:46,130
put a tin on your head and tie up your hair,
bouffant or something. Everybody started doing

300
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:52,579
that. We must have our individuality, we should
have our personality. How can we accept anything

301
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:56,900
that comes in the way? And these entrepreneurs
are playing with you, so these gurus also

302
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:01,300
play with you. We should be alert now – we
have already suffered a lot, haven’t we?

303
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:08,300
[Question: What’s Your opinion of Swami
Muktananda?]

304
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:16,740
Ah. Better not ask! You know, I have got just
now a complete file on him, from America they

305
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:25,099
have published: he’s such a horrible man.
If you want you can read it, but I assure

306
00:51:25,099 --> 00:51:32,099
you will not be able to eat food for at least
eight days. He had relations with even thirteen-year-old

307
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:39,170
girls. What are you asking about a swami like
that? Useless fellow!

308
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:42,310
[Question: Sai Baba?]

309
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:49,030
Another horrible person. He is giving you
diamonds. Who has given diamonds to others?

310
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:55,540
Who wants diamonds? From where does he get
diamonds? You know that very well. He gets

311
00:51:55,540 --> 00:52:02,540
even Swiss watches. People are so stupid!
You are talking of spirituality and of God,

312
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:07,660
not of these mundane things. If you want you
can go in the market and get a diamond; even

313
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:14,660
if you don’t get, doesn’t matter. Those
who have it or have not, nothing wrong with

314
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:23,000
them. Look at his, their faces, how they look.

315
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:29,339
I tell you, how can you be enamored by these
things? You always talk of materialism, you

316
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:35,170
talk against it and then you get enamored
by these people because they are in America.

317
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:41,349
When I went there in Boston – can you imagine,
Americans are the best for this – so that

318
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:43,720
they asked Me, “How many Rolls-Royces You
have?”

319
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,010
I said, “I have none.”

320
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:52,010
They said, “Then we are not interested in
You.” Can you imagine? If you are going

321
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:58,710
to impress by these things you are not going
to get to the real thing – is definite.

322
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:05,710
These all things can be bought by money, but
you cannot buy reality with money. Take it

323
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:10,530
from Me, you cannot. It has to happen – is
a fact. I am telling you the truth, whether

324
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:10,780
you like it or not.

325
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:14,020
[Question: Is there an energy field that is
built up by raising the kundalini en masse,

326
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:21,020
and does it spill over into another area?]

327
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:55,359
I think, you see, before describing it you’d
better feel it. All right? What’s the use

328
00:53:55,359 --> 00:54:02,359
of describing the beautiful Australia unless
and until you visit it? Better feel it yourself

329
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:10,170
and then you will know. All right? Yes?

330
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:18,930
[Question from seeker about kundalini raising
giving her headaches.]

331
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:28,780
She’s a … With whom did she do this kundalini
awakening? Do you know? …. Ah, must be somebody

332
00:54:36,089 --> 00:54:42,609
like that. You see, kundalini is your mother,
all right, and she is anxious to give you

333
00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:49,160
a second birth. She works it out herself,
beautifully, like your mother gave you the

334
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:56,160
birth without giving you any trouble. That’s
how she works it out. But if you go to a person

335
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:07,230
who’s not authorized spiritually, they do
all these things. I have not seen, but – now

336
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:14,579
as they must have told you that we are working
in about fifty-four nations, and I must have

337
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:19,280
visited at least forty-five of them – I
have never seen anybody suffering because

338
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:26,280
of kundalini awakening. On the contrary, feeling
very much better. This is what it is. You

339
00:55:26,309 --> 00:55:33,309
must see first of all when you go to somebody:
what about the disciples, how are they? How

340
00:55:35,319 --> 00:55:42,200
are they behaving? Are they beautiful people?
Have they achieved anything, have they got

341
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:49,030
anything? And also you must see the life of
the so-called guru. How does he live? Where

342
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:56,030
is his interest? But headlong if you fall
into something you are going to suffer, isn’t

343
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:04,170
it? Now I’ve been coming to Australia for
the last, how many, from the year ’78 I

344
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:11,280
think, ’77 or ’78; but I saw all the people
were scattered around these people, not around

345
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:18,900
Me. They all like them, all such kinds. They
wouldn’t come to Me. Even some people advised

346
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:24,780
Me that “You’d better charge some money.”

347
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:30,079
I said, “How much will you pay? Tell Me.”
This is invaluable – you can’t pay for

348
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:30,329
it.

349
00:56:30,099 --> 00:56:33,589

351
00:56:35,109 --> 00:56:42,109
Help! Doesn’t matter, we have people there
also. You give us her address, we’ll find

352
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:54,880
out for her. Australia and Iceland’s quite
close, isn’t it! But sweet of you to remember

353
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:55,849
her.

kundalini rising, but suddenly it drops down

355
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:24,640
again. How does she keep it up?]

356
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:42,790
You have been in Sahaja Yoga? Did you get
your realization through Sahaja Yoga? You

357
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:51,250
see, we do not take responsibility of people
who have been to other places, but if you

358
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:56,829
have been in Sahaja Yoga then we can find
out why it is happening. If you have got your

359
00:57:56,829 --> 00:58:02,230
realization through Sahaja Yoga we know, and
we can help you very much better. All right?

360
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:07,900
Then it’s our responsibility. It does happen
sometimes because if you have problems in

361
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:13,819
your brain, or maybe in your body there is
some disease where the kundalini wants to

362
00:58:13,819 --> 00:58:19,089
help, may be happening, but it can be expedited,
it can be cleared out. These are all the problems

363
00:58:19,089 --> 00:58:26,089
which can be solved. You should have patience
with yourself, that’s all.

364
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:45,819
[Question: Could You explain levels of samadhi
and nirvana?]

365
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:56,260
Ah? Nirvana? …. It’s too early to talk
about it, but first you get your samadhi,

366
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:03,260
all right, step by step, step by step. Nirvana
is the same as samadhi is, but in nirvana

367
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:11,930
state the, it’s the highest that you can
achieve in spirituality. All right? So it’s

368
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:19,200
step by step we have to move. We can say it
is the beginning of nirvana and then you have

369
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:31,460
to be working it out and you go to nirvana
itself, into the complete state. But one thing

370
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:38,589
is definite there, that we have to understand
that these words we have read from some books

371
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:49,290
and the connotation of them, it could be very,
very wrong, could be very, very misunderstood.

372
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:58,220
So whatever is the reality you should face
it as reality, you should see it as reality:

373
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:06,500
not to have any concept about it, because
if you have a concept then may be that it

374
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:13,500
might be wrong. So it’s better to see for
yourself. All right?

375
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:30,079
[Question: Is it possible for the kundalini
to be raised prematurely, or does it just

376
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:57,640
rise in its own time?]

377
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:03,460
Prematurely? This is …

378
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:03,710
[Question: Is it dangerous? – there are
lots of written warnings that kundalini can

379
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:03,900
be dangerous?]

380
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:07,540
No, there is no danger at all in kundalini
awakening at all. As I have told you just

381
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:12,780
now, she’s your mother. There’s no danger.
But people must have warnings because they

382
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:17,690
don’t want you to get realization, perhaps.
One might have warned because they must have

383
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:23,410
put their hands into some sort of a burning
fire, thinking it is the kundalini. So that

384
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:30,410
must be the reason. So far, we have had thousands
and thousands and thousands of people: nobody

385
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:37,260
has felt anything bad. After all, when you
became a human being, what was the danger

386
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,839
in becoming human being from a monkey stage?
Did you feel the cutting of your tail even?

387
01:01:40,839 --> 01:01:47,839
So after all, you are made a human being for
a purpose, and that purpose is to make you

388
01:01:53,520 --> 01:02:00,339
the higher being. How can it be troublesome?
It is so vitally important. Why should it

389
01:02:00,339 --> 01:02:07,339
be troublesome to you? Use logic. If that
is the last breakthrough of your evolution,

390
01:02:12,089 --> 01:02:19,089
it has to work spontaneously and easily.

391
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:28,520
Now, so there’s one more gentleman but now
this is the last, all right? What is the question?

392
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:40,190
Can you get up, please? We can’t even see
you. Thank you.

393
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:47,260
[Question: Does Self-realization have to take
place in this life or if you believe in reincarnation,

394
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:57,349
does it take place over a longer period?]

395
01:02:57,349 --> 01:03:03,589
Some people are realized in last life, I know.
They are born as realized souls also, I know.

396
01:03:03,589 --> 01:03:10,559
But I know one thing, that they don’t know
all about it – partly they know. They have

397
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:17,559
to know all about it. They have to know all
about their powers. They have to know how

398
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:23,780
to raise the kundalini. They have to know
what is missing in their realization. All

399
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:29,190
that they have to know.

400
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:36,190
All right. So now, very simple thing we have
to do, raise …. As you know, we have to

401
01:03:37,349 --> 01:03:43,000
use the force of the Mother Earth very much.
For that we have to take out our shoes for

402
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:50,000
a very short time. Those who are sitting on
the ground just have to take out shoes, that’s

403
01:03:54,089 --> 01:03:59,910
all, and sit comfortably.

404
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:06,910
We have the left and the right, two sides,
left and right sympathetic nervous system.

405
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:32,619
The left caters to our emotional side, and
the right to our physical and our mental side.

406
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:44,210
So we put both our feet apart from each other
– but those who are sitting on the ground

407
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:49,339
are all right, no problem – those who are
not sitting on the ground. They can sit comfortably

408
01:04:49,339 --> 01:04:56,339
there, just folded. Just sit whichever way
you like, folded is better. Be comfortable

409
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:01,520
is the point.

410
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:08,520
Before we start anything else, there are two
conditions which you have to fulfill. The

411
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:16,730
first one is that you have to know that you
are a human being, and you have to be confident

412
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:29,380
that you will get your realization and that
it is your right to get your Self-realization.

413
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:42,480
You are not to feel guilty about whatever
has happened in the past, because the divine

414
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:52,530
love is the ocean of forgiveness, and whatever
mistakes you might have committed can be easily

415
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:03,049
dissolved by that ocean of forgiveness.

416
01:06:03,049 --> 01:06:09,579
You must have faith in the power of that ocean.
After all, you are a human being, you are

417
01:06:09,579 --> 01:06:15,920
not God, and if you have done any mistakes
it’s all right. So don’t feel guilty,

418
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,900
don’t condemn yourselves. Those who have
told you “you are sinners,” you should

419
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,950
know they must be the greatest sinners to
say that. Nobody has business to say that

420
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:30,950
to anyone. So please have full confidence
in yourself, and not to feel guilty. When

421
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:36,119
you feel guilty, then this center here on
the back side there catches on, on the left

422
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:43,119
side, and this gives you horrible diseases
like angina, lethargic organs and also spondylitis.

423
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:56,380
So why to feel guilty for nothing at all?
If you think you have done mistakes, forget

424
01:06:56,380 --> 01:07:00,619
it just now.

425
01:07:00,619 --> 01:07:07,619
Second condition is that you have to forgive
everyone in general. You don’t have to think

426
01:07:09,799 --> 01:07:16,799
about people whom you want to forgive. Whether
you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t

427
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:22,890
do anything. Again, logically you don’t
do anything – it’s just a myth; but if

428
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:29,890
you don’t forgive then you play into wrong
hands, in the sense those who wanted to torture

429
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:37,250
you or trouble you, they are quite happy,
but you are suffering mentally. So the best

430
01:07:38,309 --> 01:07:45,309
thing is to forgive everyone in general, not
even thinking about any individual whatsoever.

431
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:54,140
This is a very, very important condition.
Every time I have seen everywhere that people

432
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:02,950
just don’t forgive, and I have to work hard
on them. So best is, to make My situation

433
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:09,950
better and to make the whole thing work out
faster, please, for My sake forgive everyone,

434
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:21,240
everyone. These are the two conditions. That’s
all.

435
01:08:26,429 --> 01:08:33,429
(… You know, I don’t need that now. Too
… )

436
01:08:39,239 --> 01:08:46,239
Now please put your left hand towards Me,
and right hand on your heart. The spirit is

437
01:08:55,039 --> 01:09:02,039
residing in your heart. Left hand on your
lap, just on your lap please, comfortably.

438
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:23,719
Now. Now we are working only on the left-hand
side with right hand, because right hand is

439
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:34,529
for action and left hand is for desire. So
when you put the left hand towards Me, you

440
01:09:34,529 --> 01:09:40,539
are desiring to have your Self-realization;
and with the right hand you are nourishing

441
01:09:40,539 --> 01:09:44,150
your centers, yourself raising your own kundalini.

442
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:51,150
Now take down your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

443
01:09:55,669 --> 01:10:02,669
This is the center which all the prophets
have created for us, all the great masters

444
01:10:06,209 --> 01:10:13,209
have created for our mastery: mastery over
the divine work, divine laws. Now we take

445
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:29,050
down our hand in the lower portion of our
abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the

446
01:10:29,619 --> 01:10:36,619
center of pure knowledge. This knowledge manifests
on your central nervous system. This is what

447
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:46,530
is called is “bodh” from where the word
“Buddha” has come, or “Ved” from the

448
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:51,949
word “vida” – meaning “feeling on
your central nervous system.” As the Gnostic:

449
01:10:51,949 --> 01:10:57,489
“gn” means “to know.” “Know” doesn’t
mean mentally, but to know on your central

450
01:10:57,489 --> 01:11:04,489
nervous system. That’s the pure knowledge.

451
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:10,939
Now you raise your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen and press it hard,

452
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:17,939
on the left-hand side. Again you take your
hand onto your heart. Now please put your

453
01:11:30,389 --> 01:11:37,389
right hand in the corner of your neck and
your shoulder, and turn your head to your

454
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:46,199
right. This is the center I’ve told you
already is in trouble when you feel guilty.

455
01:11:55,469 --> 01:12:02,469
Now please take your right hand on to your
forehead across, and put down your head as

456
01:12:07,919 --> 01:12:14,919
far as possible. This is the center where
you have to forgive everyone in general. Now

457
01:12:24,849 --> 01:12:29,900
take back this right hand on the back side
of your head, and push back your head. Push

458
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:36,900
back your head as far as possible. Here, without
feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

459
01:12:41,719 --> 01:12:48,719
you have to say, “Oh divine Power, please
forgive me if I have done anything wrong,

460
01:12:49,409 --> 01:12:56,409
knowingly or unknowingly.” That I’ll tell
you later on; just now I’m telling you the

461
01:12:57,449 --> 01:12:57,809
position.

462
01:12:57,809 --> 01:13:04,809
Now stretch your palm fully. Put the center
of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area

463
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:15,320
here. And now press it hard. Press down your
head. Press it hard, push back your fingers

464
01:13:25,489 --> 01:13:32,489
and start moving your scalp with the pressure,
seven times clockwise. This is important.

465
01:13:35,539 --> 01:13:42,539
Push back your fingers. Put down your head
fully and now go on moving your scalp seven

466
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:51,150
times clockwise, very slowly. Now take down
your hands.

467
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:21,260
Now you have to close your eyes. Before that
you can take out your spectacles, because

468
01:14:24,709 --> 01:14:31,709
you are not to open your eyes till I tell
you; this might help your eyesight. Now please

469
01:14:36,459 --> 01:14:43,459
remember to put your feet on, away from each
other a little bit. If there’s anything

470
01:14:49,749 --> 01:14:56,749
tight on your neck or on your waist, you can
loosen it a little bit.

471
01:14:59,949 --> 01:15:06,949
Now put your right hand on your heart. Here
you ask Me a very fundamental question – you

472
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:29,010
can call Me “Shri Mataji” or “Mother”,
whatever you like – “Mother, am I the

473
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:36,260
spirit? Mother, am I the spirit?” Ask this
in your heart three times.

474
01:15:44,959 --> 01:15:51,959
If you are the spirit then you become your
own master, because in the light of the spirit

475
01:15:56,409 --> 01:16:03,409
you see everything clearly. So now please
take your hand in the upper portion of your

476
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:12,150
abdomen on the left-hand side, press it hard.
Here you have to say, again a question you

477
01:16:19,719 --> 01:16:26,719
have to ask Me, “Mother, am I my own master?”
Ask this question three times, “Mother,

478
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:40,880
am I my own master?” Three times, in your
heart. As I told you, I respect your freedom

479
01:17:11,539 --> 01:17:18,030
and I cannot force pure knowledge on you,
so you have to ask for it.

480
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:25,030
Take your right hand in the lower portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side and

481
01:17:28,929 --> 01:17:35,929
here you say six times, because this center
has got six petals, “Mother, please give

482
01:17:40,419 --> 01:17:47,419
me self-knowledge” – or you can say “pure
knowledge” – “Mother, please give me

483
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:55,380
pure knowledge.” Say it six times.

484
01:18:18,959 --> 01:18:25,959
Now, raise your right hand in the upper portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side. As

485
01:18:52,689 --> 01:18:59,689
you have asked for pure knowledge, your kundalini
has started moving upward, so we have to nourish

486
01:19:02,219 --> 01:19:09,219
these upper centers with self-confidence.
So here you say ten times, “Mother, I am

487
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:23,630
my own master.” Say it with full self-confidence,
ten times, “Mother, I am my own master.”

488
01:19:34,289 --> 01:19:41,289
I have already told you that the most important
truth about is that you are not this body,

489
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:59,239
not mind, not your conditionings, your ego,
but you are pure spirit. So now raise your

490
01:19:59,809 --> 01:20:06,809
right hand on your heart and say here with
full confidence, twelve times, “Mother,

491
01:20:15,489 --> 01:20:22,489
I am the spirit.” Please say it twelve times.

492
01:20:42,539 --> 01:20:49,539
The divine Power is the ocean of knowledge,
is the ocean of love, joy and bliss, but above

493
01:20:56,209 --> 01:21:03,209
all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever
mistakes you have committed can be easily

494
01:21:03,999 --> 01:21:10,719
dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness.
So please forgive yourself and raise your

495
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:17,719
right hand in the corner of your neck and
your shoulder, and turn your head to your

496
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:26,300
right. Here with full confidence say sixteen
times, “Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

497
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:41,630
Please say that, “Mother, I am not guilty
at all.”

498
01:21:56,119 --> 01:22:02,939
I have already told you, whether you forgive
or don’t forgive you don’t do anything,

499
01:22:02,939 --> 01:22:09,939
but if you don’t forgive then you play into
wrong hands. It’s a myth to know that you

500
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:18,130
are not forgiving someone. It’s a myth.
So please raise your right hand on your forehead

501
01:22:23,619 --> 01:22:30,619
across, and please put down your head as far
as possible. And here with full confidence

502
01:22:34,869 --> 01:22:40,309
you have to say from your heart – not how
many times, from your heart – please say,

503
01:22:40,309 --> 01:22:47,309
it is very important, “Mother, I forgive
everyone.” Don’t say “I try” – just

504
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:55,070
saying it, with full confidence, “Mother,
I forgive everyone in general.”

505
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:11,639
Now, take back your hand on the back side
of your head. Push back your head as far as

506
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:26,070
possible. Here we have to say, without feeling
guilty, without counting your mistakes; just

507
01:23:36,559 --> 01:23:43,559
for your satisfaction, from your heart, not
how many times, “Oh divine Power, if I have

508
01:23:45,570 --> 01:23:52,570
done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly,
please forgive me.”

509
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:25,030
Now stretch your right hand. Put the center
of your palm on the fontanel bone area which

510
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:38,280
was a soft bone in your childhood. Now put
down your head as far as possible, put down.

511
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:45,360
Push back your fingers. Here again I respect
your freedom. I cannot force Self-realization

512
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:57,829
on you – you have to ask for it. So now
push back your fingers with the pressure;

513
01:24:57,829 --> 01:25:04,829
move your scalp seven times clockwise, saying
seven times, “Mother, please give me Self-realization.”

514
01:25:17,439 --> 01:25:24,439
[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone seven
times.]

515
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:58,070
Now please take down your hand. (If you can
close the air-conditioning, they would feel

516
01:26:14,059 --> 01:26:21,059
it better.) Now please put, open your eyes
and put both the hands towards Me like this,

517
01:26:26,269 --> 01:26:33,269
like this. Now, put your right hand like this,
and don’t think – you can manage, now

518
01:26:41,269 --> 01:26:47,989
you don’t think. Put the right hand and
put down your head, and see with the left

519
01:26:47,989 --> 01:26:52,630
hand if there is a cool breeze – can you
get up and show them? – if there’s a cool

520
01:26:52,630 --> 01:26:59,630
breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.
Now, please put the left hand away from your

521
01:26:59,719 --> 01:27:06,719
head, not on top – away, not very far; some
people get it far also – but just try to

522
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:14,280
feel if there’s a cool breeze coming out
of your head. Now please put your left hand

523
01:27:23,969 --> 01:27:30,969
towards Me like this, like this. And now put
down your head, and now see for yourself if

524
01:27:33,010 --> 01:27:40,010
there’s a cool breeze coming out of your
head. (There is so much of cool breeze.) Now

525
01:27:43,649 --> 01:27:50,649
feel it with the right hand. Right hand towards
Me and left hand: you see it clearly, if there’s

526
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:08,639
a cool breeze coming out of your head, the
fontanel bone area. You can move your hand

527
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:12,969
a little bit up and down and see for yourself
on sideways.

528
01:28:12,969 --> 01:28:19,969
Now, raise both your hands towards the sky.
Push back your head and ask a question, “Mother,

529
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:30,780
is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”
or ask, “Mother is this the all-pervading

530
01:28:32,169 --> 01:28:39,169
Power of divine love?” or “Mother, is
this the Paramachaitanya?” Ask any one of

531
01:28:40,519 --> 01:28:47,519
these questions three times, raising your
hands.

532
01:28:47,849 --> 01:28:54,849
Put down your hands, please. So much of breeze
already blowing all over! All those … it’s

533
01:28:58,539 --> 01:29:05,539
tremendous breeze already blowing all over.
It’s not air-conditioning, for your information.

534
01:29:08,039 --> 01:29:15,039
Now those who have felt the cool breeze out
of their fontanel bone area or on their hands

535
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:22,559
or fingertips, please raise both your hands.
May God bless you.

536
01:29:33,530 --> 01:29:39,360
So many of you have felt it now. Some of you
have not felt, doesn’t matter. Tomorrow

537
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:46,360
again we have a program, and I’ll explain
to you more about the nature of spirit and

538
01:29:47,059 --> 01:29:53,860
the nature of these centers. Please inform
your friends, everyone, to come, and tomorrow

539
01:29:53,860 --> 01:30:00,860
hopefully, I will meet all of you one by one.
Also those who have problems should write

540
01:30:01,969 --> 01:30:08,969
them on a piece of paper and their address,
and we’ll try to contact them and help them

541
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:17,320
as far as possible. Thank you very much.

542
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:24,320
Those who have not felt can come on this side
and the Sahaja yogis can work it out in five

543
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:31,139
minutes, those who have not felt. Because
you did not forgive; I know you have not forgiven.

544
01:30:31,139 --> 01:30:34,860
If you had forgiven you would have felt it.
Come along, this side. Just five minutes and

545
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:41,860
they’ll give you realization. You felt it?
Ha, good. Your problems will be solved now,

546
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:51,189
it’s good. You felt it? …. Which hand
you felt? Left you felt, not the right? …. Doesn’t

547
01:31:05,179 --> 01:31:12,179
matter. We’ll work it out. It’s good.
Surprising! …. First of all, see on their

548
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:29,280
heads are you feeling it or not; just see
it. They might be saying they are not feeling

549
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:34,559
it because of Vishuddhi. …. Yes, yes, do.

550
01:31:34,559 --> 01:31:41,559
[Seeker asks about her chronic low energy,
and the Hatha Yoga she has been doing.]

551
01:31:56,769 --> 01:32:03,769
You know, you see this modern Hatha Yoga is
most unscientific. It is just done like all

552
01:32:10,449 --> 01:32:15,519
the medicines you take from the medicine box,
without knowing what you need really. So you

553
01:32:15,519 --> 01:32:20,449
give up that and come to Sahaja Yoga and know
what’s wrong with you, and fill yourself

554
01:32:20,449 --> 01:32:25,999
with energy, all right? Is all nonsense. It’s
all nonsense. It has given heart attacks to

555
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:32,099
people, heart attacks. It’s the way they
go about it. We also do a little bit of Hatha

556
01:32:32,099 --> 01:32:35,709
Yoga, but wherever it is necessary; it’s
not like mad, doing all the time there. Now

557
01:32:35,709 --> 01:32:42,709
you have a catch on this one, you have a catch
on there. Two centers are very badly caught

558
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:48,820
up. So you’d better come to Sahaja Yoga,
all right, and fix yourself up, because Hatha

559
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:52,239
Yoga nobody reaches God, that’s true.

560
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:56,729
But this Hatha Yoga is very limited: a wee
bit of it. You see, Patanjali wrote “Ashtanga

561
01:32:56,729 --> 01:33:03,729
Yoga” out of which this Hatha Yoga that
you do is one-eighth of one of them. And that

562
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:09,610
to be is understood with the guidance of the
kundalini: where is the kundalini stopping?

563
01:33:09,610 --> 01:33:14,369
Whatever center it is stopping, that is the
one you have to look after. And that is the

564
01:33:14,369 --> 01:33:21,369
one you have to do that particular asana for
that particular thing – not all of them

565
01:33:21,399 --> 01:33:28,399
like that mad. All right? So …. You cannot
do it unless and until you start your kundalini.

566
01:33:28,939 --> 01:33:34,189
Once you start your kundalini, you will know
where the problem is. It’s like if your

567
01:33:34,189 --> 01:33:41,189
car has started then you will know where is
the problem is, isn’t it? It’s like that.

568
01:33:44,709 --> 01:33:50,249
May God bless you.

569
01:33:50,249 --> 01:33:57,249
So now, how are you? Your sister? You are
all right now? She’s in Iceland. You give

570
01:34:13,789 --> 01:34:20,789
her address to us, we’ll contact her. All
right. What is she, now? Iceland? …. What’s

571
01:34:39,429 --> 01:34:46,429
the matter with her? …. You see, they will
tell …. You come and see Me, and take the

572
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:33,610
photograph .… And then you send My photograph,
and tell her to put both her hands towards

573
01:35:49,389 --> 01:35:56,389
the photograph and both her feet in 

574
01:39:52,969 --> 01:39:59,969
the water with salt every night …. Both
the hands to the photograph, and both the

575
01:43:27,889 --> 01:43:34,889
feet in the water …. All right? But 

576
01:53:08,889 --> 01:53:15,889
first you master this.

577
01:53:35,469 --> 01:53:42,469
You felt the cool breeze?

578
01:54:02,969 --> 01:54:09,969
[Seeker says he wasn’t sure if it was cool
or not.]

579
01:54:57,479 --> 01:55:04,479
Better forgive. You have to forgive …. you
don’t forgive. How can I forgive for you?

580
02:04:50,019 --> 02:04:57,019
You have to forgive yourself, forgive everyone.
I can’t forgive for you.

581
02:06:55,059 --> 02:07:02,059
[Seeker asks where Shri Mataji lives in India.]

582
02:07:51,399 --> 02:07:58,399
For practical purposes I live in London.
