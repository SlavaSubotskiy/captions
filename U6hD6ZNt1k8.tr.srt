1
00:00:01,458 --> 00:00:11,542
Bugün bizler Adi Shakti‘ye ibadet ediyoruz.

2
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:20,667
Bence en  önemli puja budur

3
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:29,875
çünkü size aydınlanma veren,

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,959
size gerçeği veren

5
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:37,834
, size sevgi ve şefkat gücünü veren

6
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:43,959
Adi Shakti‘nin gücüdür.

7
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:06,000
Bu Sadashiva’dan ayrılan güçtür

8
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:26,250
ve bu gücün kendisi kainatın tamamını yaratmak istedi.

9
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:36,709
O (dişi) kainat üstüne kainat yaratır ve sever.

10
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:45,125
Bu büyük yaradılışı yapan Odur,

11
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:50,667
bu dünyanın yaratılışını da yapan Odur.

12
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:57,250
Bu özellikle seçilmiş bir gezegendir,

13
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:04,000
nihayetinde  insanoğlunun yaratılması için

14
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,625
güneşle ay arasında,

15
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:17,000
çok güzel bir şekilde  merkezlenmişti.

16
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:30,291
Bu Onun öylesi bir sevgi ve şefkatle,

17
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,250
kendi çocuklarının gerçeği bilecekleri,

18
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:43,458
kendileri hakkındaki  ve diğer her şey hakkındaki

19
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,291
nihai bilgiye ulaşacaklarına dair

20
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:52,583
büyük umutla (meydana getirilmiş)  büyük işidir.

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,083
Adi Shakti`nin bir yılan formunda

22
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:09,917
nasıl geldiği ve insanoğluna,

23
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,250
Adem ve Havva`ya,

24
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:22,333
özellikle de Havva`ya,

25
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,709
bilgiyi bilmeniz gerek dediğini İncil`de okudunuz.

26
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:35,542
Ve onlar,  bilgi meyvesini yemeyi kabul ettiler

27
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:41,000
çünkü yaşamın süptilliğini bilmeksizin

28
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,959
ancak hayvanların olduğu gibi olacaklardı,

29
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:48,709
belki de biraz daha yüksek havyanlar.

30
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:57,208
Meyveyi bir kez yiyince,

31
00:03:57,917 --> 00:04:01,125
onlar giysileri olmaksızın bulundukları bu halde,

32
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:05,250
bir şeylerin yanlış olduğunu hissetmeye başladılar.

33
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:10,792
Bu yüzden ağacın bir kaç yaprağını aldılar

34
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,375
ve kendilerini örttüler.

35
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:21,792
Yani gelen ilk bilgi,  iffetti

36
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:28,125
çünkü Shri Ganesha yerleşmişti

37
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:36,291
ve Onun etkisi, bu bedenlerimizi örtmeliyiz

38
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,375
bilincini meydana getirdi.

39
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:42,959
Bizler artık hayvan değiliz.

40
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:47,041
Sadece hayvanlar,

41
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,917
tabi ki onlar ayakta  durmuyorlar, bu yüzden bunda sorun yok,

42
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,041
onlar bunun farkında değiller.

43
00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:02,000
İffet bilgisi ile,

44
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:06,333
insanoğlu yavaş yavaş güzel uluslar şeklinde

45
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:11,041
büyümeye başladı

46
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:19,333
ama hala bilmemiz gereken, farkında olmamız gereken

47
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,750
pek çok şey var.

48
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:32,417
Siz belki de pek çok şeyin farkındasınız

49
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:45,875
ama spiritüel uyanışınızı elde etmediğiniz sürece,

50
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:51,500
kendi benliğinizin bilgisini elde etmediğiniz sürece,

51
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:58,000
diğer tüm bilgiler hiç bir şey değildir.

52
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:07,709
Ancak bu öze dair bilgi ile güçlü olursunuz.

53
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:15,417
Gerçek güç, gerçek güç sevginin ve şevkatin gücüdür.

54
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:26,917
Bu gün, baktığınız zaman, tüm dünya savaşmakla meşgul

55
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:32,750
ve onlar insanları savaştan korumaya çalışıyorlar

56
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:37,667
ve büyük, kocaman koruyucak

57
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:46,291
makineler yaratıyorlar.

58
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:52,542
Tüm dünya, birbirini öldürmek, yok etmek,

59
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:58,625
rekabet, hırs, savaşmaya öncülük etmek

60
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:07,750
ve sonra daha da büyük savaşlara

61
00:07:07,917 --> 00:07:13,250
girmek için çılgın bir yarışın içinde gibi görünüyor.

62
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:19,083
Bir parça toprak için savaşıyorlar.

63
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,417
O kadar cahiller ki.

64
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:32,250
Öldüğün zaman,  bir tutam bile toprak parçasını

65
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:35,041
yanında götürebilir misin?

66
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:41,291
Doğduğun zaman kapanmış yumruklarla geldin.

67
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:46,500
Öldüğün zaman açık ellerle gidersin.

68
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:50,667
Beraberinde ne götüreceksin?

69
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:55,625
Tamam, belki de hiç bir şey almak istemiyorsun

70
00:07:55,792 --> 00:08:00,000
ama uğruna savaşıp çok büyük olduğunu düşündüğün şey

71
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,458
her ne ise, bundan neşe duyuyor musun?

72
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:11,000
Bu savaş bütün bu saçma sapan insanlar arasında neden sürüyor?

73
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:21,166
Mesele bir parça toprak olunca,

74
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,417
insanların kendi anlayışlarını,

75
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:30,166
kendi huzurlarını nasıl bıraktıkları çok şaşırtıcı.

76
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:40,000
Ve bütün her şey çok yanlış bir istikamete gitti

77
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:46,458
ve tam bir yok edilmeye doğru gidiyor.

78
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:57,375
İnsanoğluna bu kadar acı çektiren şeyler,

79
00:08:57,542 --> 00:09:05,500
onların kendi cahilliklerinden dolayıdır,

80
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:11,959
bunlarla,  tüm bu alışkanlıklara,

81
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,792
tüm bu cazibeye,tüm bu tanımlamalara sahip oldular.

82
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:22,542
Bu şeyler,  onların bizlere yaptıkları bu şeyler,

83
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:30,250
bu şeyler  onların hepsini tek tek mahfedecek.

84
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,875
Onlar farkına varmalı

85
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,291
ve kendi öz bilgilerini almalılar.

86
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:50,959
Bu öz bilgi, insanlara

87
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:59,208
bir kurtarıcı vermek için anahtardır.

88
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,917
Bir çok azizimiz oldu.

89
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:09,166
Bir çok sufimiz oldu.

90
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:13,917
Tao insanlarımız oldu. Zen insanlarımız oldu.

91
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:20,125
Her tür aydınlanmış ruh bu dünyaya geldi.

92
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:27,083
Hepsi acı çektiler. Hepsine eziyet edildi.

93
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:36,083
Hiç kimse onları anlamadı ama şimdi sizler için gerçeği bilme zamanı geldi,

94
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:43,125
ama kuru olmayan gerçeği, şevkati olan gerçeği,

95
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:47,291
herkesi sarmalayan gerçeği,

96
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:55,667
var oluşumuzun tam bir görünümünü veren gerçeği.

97
00:10:55,834 --> 00:11:02,291
Neden biz bu dünyadayız? Amacımız ne?

98
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,417
Ne yapmalıyız? Adi Shakti’nin  güçleri,

99
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:10,834
sevgi ve şefkatten gelir,

100
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,583
......................

101
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:19,959
ilk olarak kendinizi anlamanızı sağlar.

102
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:27,375
The love, for you, is very, very limited.

103
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:35,041
There's no awareness of your own being.

104
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:40,166
Just imagine what a great task is for you,

105
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:46,333
how much you have to be seriously

106
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,166
becoming aware of your self first.

107
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:56,000
That is extremely important.

108
00:11:56,667 --> 00:12:01,250
First you have to be aware of your self.

109
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:07,625
And now you have the light of your spirit.

110
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:12,542
In the light of that spirit you can see what you are

111
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:16,333
and you can see how far you are going,

112
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,125
how wrong things you are doing,

113
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:24,667
what harm you are doing to yourself

114
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:29,166
and you have a power to cure it,

115
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:34,542
to improve it and to come to your senses.

116
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:39,083
These are the most important times.

117
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,417
You will never get these times again.

118
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:49,375
Never had it in the history and you can never get it in the future.

119
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:57,291
This is the time you have got, not only the awareness,

120
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:01,542
not only the self knowledge,

121
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:05,750
but you know how to do it.

122
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:09,250
Otherwise, about the saints,

123
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:13,959
about those people, Tao and Zen people,

124
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,792
they have just described

125
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:23,709
what a person with self knowledge is,

126
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:28,917
how he behaves, how his style is,

127
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,041
how he's so different from others.

128
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:37,250
But none of them have said how you become that.

129
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,917
No one has been able to say that.

130
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:46,041
Nobody has been able to do that also

131
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:54,667
because perhaps most of them didn't know about kundalini

132
00:13:54,917 --> 00:14:02,000
and those who knew also could not talk about it to people.

133
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:08,250
So the greatest work of the Adi Shakti is

134
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:17,709
to put the kundalini  in your sacrum bone.

135
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:26,208
This kundalini is not the Adi Shakti.

136
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:29,959
The Adi Shakti is a much greater thing, a much bigger thing,

137
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:35,417
much wider thing, much deeper, much stronger,

138
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,875
much stronger, much more powerful.

139
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,709
Kundalini is the reflection of Adi Shakti power

140
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:54,125
and when She rises you know what happens to you

141
00:14:54,583 --> 00:15:00,375
and how you get your Realisation.

142
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:05,333
But you have to be very watchful.

143
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:10,333
Are you really a compassionate person?

144
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,917
If you are compassionate,

145
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:18,583
the first thing that will happen to any compassionate person,

146
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:25,458
I think, will be to help others,

147
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,375
to emancipate others.

148
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:34,875
They cannot be satisfied with their own achievements

149
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:44,041
and with their own state of Self Realisation.

150
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,667
It cannot happen.

151
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:53,125
What was the need for the Adi Shakti to do all, all these efforts

152
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,000
to work so hard?

153
00:15:55,166 --> 00:16:00,125
You know that, that I had to work very, very hard,

154
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,792
but, from my very childhood

155
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:07,333
I've worked very hard

156
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,792
and I've gone through very difficult times,

157
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:19,834
very, very difficult times according to human understanding,

158
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
but the worst time I have, when I see

159
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:30,375
those people whom I have given Realisation,

160
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:34,500
those who are self-realised people,

161
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:42,291
they are the ones who have no responsibility for others

162
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:46,333
and, if they have, it is very little.

163
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,667
They don't have that compassion

164
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:52,709
and don't have that love

165
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:56,542
that we have to today save the world,

166
00:16:56,709 --> 00:16:58,959
save the humanity.

167
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:05,333
That's our — not only our principal work,

168
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,333
but the only work that we have to do.

169
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,875
All other things are going to achieve nothing,

170
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,792
except for your own efforts here,

171
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,625
individual efforts

172
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:28,083
to give Self Realisation to others

173
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,083
and give them this knowledge.

174
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:38,125
This knowledge is so, so easy to understand.

175
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,792
It is very subtle, no doubt,

176
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:44,709
and, as I've told you,

177
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:51,041
that the quantum theory they're talking about now, the scientists,

178
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:57,125
is that they have seen those miraculous waves of lights

179
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:02,417
and they are trying to find out something about it.

180
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:09,625
It cannot be that some Sahaja Yogis will rise above others.

181
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:16,917
Every one of you [has] to know that this is a very special thing

182
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:20,125
that has happened to you.

183
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,875
Even if you had gone to Himalayas,

184
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,583
even if you have starved yourself,

185
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:32,041
even if you have been singing the praise of God for years,

186
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:38,959
even   you had done all kinds of rituals and penances,

187
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,917
you could not have got your Realisation.

188
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,500
That would not have been possible.

189
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:51,125
I knew this. That's why I have to work very hard,

190
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:56,917
facing all kinds of problems, all kinds of turmoils,

191
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:02,458
all kinds of pressures, what was the thing?

192
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:09,458
Just to see that you all are created

193
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:12,750
and you're all My hands.

194
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:18,709
You have to work. Every finger has to work.

195
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,709
And that is what I have been telling you,

196
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:29,208
that now it is our responsibility to see that we become,

197
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:36,375
not only Sahaja Yogis ourself, but blossoming time

198
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:42,333
and many, many Sahaja Yogis we should have.

199
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:48,625
It's a work of Adi Shakti.

200
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:51,500
Try to understand this.

201
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:55,458
It's not work of any saint.

202
00:19:55,625 --> 00:20:00,208
It's not work of any incarnation.

203
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:04,250
It's not work of any politician.

204
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:10,709
And not work of any big leader.

205
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:14,917
It is the work of Adi Shakti,

206
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:22,250
which is so transparently showing its results in you.

207
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:28,291
Now it is for you to see.

208
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:36,709
To please Me is your ardent desire, I know.

209
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:46,375
I see how you love Me and how you want to do for Me.

210
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:50,458
The greatest thing you can do for Me

211
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:54,917
is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

212
00:20:55,458 --> 00:21:03,125
It is a very special, extremely difficult blessings you have got.

213
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:09,333
You didn't have to do any efforts.

214
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,583
You didn't have to pay any money.

215
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:22,500
You don't have to get sick with rituals.

216
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:26,709
You got it spontaneously.

217
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:33,250
But that doesn't mean that it's sort of your birthright to get it.

218
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,458
[It] is the work of Adi Shakti.

219
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:49,709
And the work of Adi Shakti has to be shown in your life.

220
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:59,750
[It] is the compassion, without any reward.

221
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,834
People have tried to spread their religion

222
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,667
by showing compassion to poor people,

223
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:12,792
looking after the poor people, handicapped people.

224
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:20,375
There's no need, actually, for Sahaja Yogis to do that.

225
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,709
What they have to do is to transform other people.

226
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,125
Find out ways and methods how you can transform,

227
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:37,083
how you can spread the message of Adi Shakti.

228
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,750
Put your mind to it

229
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:44,417
and you will know how you can manage it.

230
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:55,000
There should be all the time compelling desire

231
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:58,000
that we have to find out method

232
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:01,959
by which we can spread Sahaja Yoga.

233
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:09,125
Otherwise it's like what Christ has described

234
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:16,250
that some seed fell on the marshy land

235
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:22,750
and they sprouted, but never grew.

236
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:30,166
You can only grow in the real sense of the word

237
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:37,083
and become something very, very special and real

238
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:44,041
by knowing what you can do.

239
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,291
I have a vision, no doubt,

240
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:52,667
and I've been talking about it quite a lot,

241
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:59,291
but it ends up with the puja is not a good thing.

242
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:04,333
I know some countries are very difficult.

243
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,583
Try to find out what is the problem,

244
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,709
why it is so very difficult.

245
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:19,959
Attention has to be paid to this,

246
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:27,709
that what other human beings are doing to destroy themselves,

247
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:32,375
as if it is the part and parcel of the same game

248
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:37,291
which we call as the last judgement,

249
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:41,125
but let us, through our compassion and love,

250
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:44,250
save as many as possible.

251
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:49,792
This is the work of Adi Shakti,

252
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:55,166
not the work of any saint or any incarnation.

253
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,959
They're all there, no doubt.

254
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:03,000
They're all with us, all the time to help us,

255
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:07,792
but you people have the power of Adi Shakti,

256
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:11,625
which is very great,

257
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:15,583
which is very penetrating,

258
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,792
which is miraculous.

259
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:22,208
It's so effective,

260
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:28,333
but unless and until you become aware of your own powers,

261
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,500
how will you work it out.

262
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:37,041
It would be like a dead machine that has everything,

263
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:41,417
but nobody is there to work it out.

264
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:48,458
All the time I had to go through very,

265
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:51,542
very hazardous times

266
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:58,458
and sometimes I felt that I may have to take another birth,

267
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:02,542
the way things are so difficult for Me.

268
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:09,166
But now, for you, it has been very easy,

269
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:15,291
as if the one who makes the road has to work very hard,

270
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:17,917
but those who walk on that,

271
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:23,208
they don't realise how easily they have got it.

272
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:29,667
And if they realise this, then they will realise also

273
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:32,834
'Let many walk on this road,

274
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,500
which was created with such

275
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:39,792
patience, understanding and love.'

276
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:46,542
I have to really see you all Sahaja Yogis

277
00:26:46,709 --> 00:26:52,166
doing your level best to change this world

278
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:54,333
— has to be changed.

279
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,250
As it is, humanity has to be saved

280
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:02,125
through you and nobody else.

281
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:06,917
No president, no prime minister,

282
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:09,333
no minister,

283
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,291
none of these people can change the world

284
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,208
and save it.

285
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:18,291
It is you who are entitled.

286
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:20,917
You have got this power.

287
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:27,875
Do you realise your own status?

288
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,667
Your own being?

289
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:36,375
which has risen so high?

290
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:42,417
It is not there. If that realisation is there,

291
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:46,417
you would go all out

292
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,542
to express your love and compassion to other people,

293
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:58,959
to make them realise what they are.

294
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:02,166
Only with Sahaja Yoga you can save this world.

295
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:04,625
There's no other way out.

296
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:11,500
Whatever you may try, say, to help the poor, to help this and that

297
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:16,083
is something very, very superficial.

298
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:24,375
Best thing is to give Realisation to every person you see.

299
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,959
We have seen children. They're coming up.

300
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:34,792
They'll be great Sahaja Yogis also. I can see that.

301
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:41,000
But before them, you have to show your own merits

302
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:44,041
of what you have done.

303
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:47,125
It's not a static work.

304
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:53,709
It's a big movement, which has to be really explosive

305
00:28:53,875 --> 00:29:03,208
and unless and until such a great step is taken,

306
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:16,208
I don't know who will be blamed for the doomsday.

307
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:23,583
You are the one[s] who have to build up

308
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,333
the destiny of human beings.

309
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,208
Don't consider as yourself, as something nothing.

310
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:34,875
You could never have got your Realisation.

311
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,083
You'd never have come to Me.

312
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:41,583
Among so many, you are the ones who came to Me

313
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:45,875
and who asked for Realisation and got it.

314
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,959
You know it cannot be forced.

315
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:52,750
This Realisation cannot be forced.

316
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:56,041
This awareness cannot be forced.

317
00:29:56,208 --> 00:30:03,250
And the growthof this awareness also cannot be forced.

318
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:09,834
You have to develop that attention deep down within yourself.

319
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,417
And see for yourself what you have done,

320
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:16,750
what you have done.

321
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:23,125
If you are still busy with the money problem or the power problem

322
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:27,709
and this problem and that, you are a problem.

323
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:30,250
You are not a Sahaja Yogi.

324
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:34,458
Sahaja Yogi is above everything else

325
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:38,208
and is very powerful.

326
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:42,959
Power will be achieved by them

327
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:45,792
— power of love and compassion,

328
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:50,166
which is not only words of love.

329
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:55,959
It is not only act of loving others,

330
00:30:56,583 --> 00:31:05,291
but it is a powerful personality that you will have,

331
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:08,917
which will just emit

332
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:19,375
that great Divine Light and can capture people.

333
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:31,000
All should just take a very brave personality.

334
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:35,083
I must say people have improved,

335
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,375
otherwise everybody used to write to Me:

336
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:42,709
'This is wrong with me and that is wrong with my father.

337
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:47,250
That is wrong with my great-grandmother' and all kinds of things.

338
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:53,041
That is over now. Much less, I must say, much less.

339
00:31:53,792 --> 00:32:00,917
But instead of telling Me about people who are sick,

340
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:04,417
people who have failed,

341
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:12,375
people who are still in a state

342
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,667
that cannot be improved, attention should be changed.

343
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:25,959
If there's one person who has got cancer anywhere,

344
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:30,166
immediately at least ten photographs will come to Me.

345
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:33,792
Leader will write to Me. The wife's leader will write to Me.

346
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:39,875
Everybody will write to Me that Mother, say such-and-such thing.

347
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:48,500
Why? Is that My job?

348
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:52,875
That person can be cured — we have hospitals —

349
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,291
can be cured by photographs,

350
00:32:56,458 --> 00:33:01,625
but attention always goes now to compassion part.

351
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:07,166
To those people who are so-called suffering physically,

352
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:11,959
mentally, emotionally, financially,

353
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:15,000
also in the marriages,

354
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
that's not your job,

355
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,000
neither Mine.

356
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:28,291
If they're sick, they should take a photograph and work it out.

357
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:32,917
If it doesn't work, that means that it doesn't deserve.

358
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:42,750
There is no need for you to treat them and to work it out and,

359
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:45,792
if it fails, to write to Me

360
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:49,375
that 'Mother, such-and-such person is sick.'

361
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:52,417
What's so important?

362
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:59,250
Already we have so many healthy people going round.

363
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:01,625
Why not use them first?

364
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:05,959
Our job is not to cure people.

365
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:11,000
Affection is all right. Compassion is all right. Is a natural thing

366
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:17,875
that our attention goes to sick people or to the poor people

367
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,500
or to the people who are suffering,

368
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:27,959
but what about Sahaj Yog?

369
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:34,583
If you have one sick person,

370
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:38,875
hundred Sahaja Yogis will get after that.

371
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,250
What is the reason?

372
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:46,333
Is it compassion?

373
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,709
It's not.

374
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:57,000
They want to prove that they can cure that person.

375
00:34:57,959 --> 00:35:00,875
Is not compassion.

376
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,291
Compassion today is

377
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:10,834
to transform human beings into Sahajis,

378
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:14,625
into good people.

379
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:18,875
That is the love of Adi Shakti.

380
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:23,083
Because those who are born have to die in any case.

381
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:27,417
We should not be unkind, of course, but

382
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:33,917
our attention should be how many people we are giving Realisation.

383
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:37,291
Is a very common thing

384
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:43,041
that people indulge more into so-called curing

385
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:48,792
and improving and this. It's all right.

386
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:54,333
Also there are problems like in the marriages, you see.

387
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,792
Some marriage couple don't want to be there.

388
00:35:57,959 --> 00:36:01,375
It's all right. Finish them.

389
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:06,500
If they don't want to live together, let them.

390
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:10,959
We have many people who are sensible in this world,

391
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:14,917
many people who are healthy in this world.

392
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:18,417
Now how can you go on struggling with people

393
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:22,458
who don't want to live together and have problems?

394
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:25,750
That's not your job.

395
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:29,000
First of all, you are a spiritual worker.

396
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:32,291
You are not a social worker.

397
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:34,000
Of course,

398
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:39,542
by the way, you can do social work. It doesn't matter, by the way.

399
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:47,291
But the main thing for you is to transform human beings.

400
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,750
With that, the greatest disease

401
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:58,583
is of meanness, of cruelty,

402
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:06,709
of torturing others, anger.

403
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:11,375
All these diseases can be cured,

404
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:15,583
which are internal, not external.

405
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,291
That is today wanted.

406
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:22,458
Every country's fighting and is tortured

407
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:29,792
and is in peril all the time of getting destroyed.

408
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:36,041
The only way you can do it is to give them Realisation.

409
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:40,834
Now what happens is to be seen very clearly

410
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:47,041
that when you give Realisation to someone

411
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:52,750
and he values it, and he grows into it,

412
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:57,417
then you are protected.

413
00:37:57,583 --> 00:38:01,417
You are completely protected.

414
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,792
Who protects you, you may say?

415
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:08,875
The Adi Shakti, all right,

416
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,667
but also there is a destructive power working in this world,

417
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:23,500
not of negativity, but positive destructive power of Shiva.

418
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:35,583
If He says that if Adi Shakti's work is going on well, He's happy.

419
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:39,625
But He's sitting there and watching each and every person,

420
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:43,458
each and every work of Sahaja Yogis

421
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:51,959
and if He finds something really very wrong,

422
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:55,709
I cannot control it.

423
00:38:55,959 --> 00:39:02,458
He destroys. I cannot go to that point.

424
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,250
He destroys.

425
00:39:06,417 --> 00:39:14,125
Not only destroys, but thousands He can destroy.

426
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:21,750
Anywhere there is a calamity,

427
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:28,917
we can say, like an earthquake

428
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:33,583
or some sort of a hurricane,

429
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,583
all these things come

430
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:43,625
through the working of Shri Mahadeva.

431
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:48,208
I can't help you there,

432
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:54,041
but if you really give Realisation to people,

433
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:59,417
all these can be averted.

434
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:06,375
Of course, it is the whim, I should say, of Adi Shakti

435
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:10,959
that She started this work of creating this world,

436
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:16,250
of creating you and making you Sahaja Yogis,

437
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:20,792
but your responsibility is also very important.

438
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,667
You cannot be responsible.

439
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:40,375
Maybe it was, I felt, My responsibility, but there's a difference.

440
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:46,583
I never felt it was My responsibility,

441
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:51,542
never felt this was My job,

442
00:40:51,709 --> 00:40:54,792
never felt I have to do it.

443
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:57,417
'I did it.'

444
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,750
That is the work.

445
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:07,166
That's the kind of personality you should have.

446
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:13,208
You have to do it in a very humble manner,

447
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:19,875
in a very beautiful manner

448
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,166
and you'll be amazed to see how you are protected,

449
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:31,875
how you are supported and how everything works out.

450
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:35,750
The greatest joy you will get when you will find

451
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:39,000
you can give Realisation to people.

452
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:44,208
You can change their lives.

453
00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:47,208
Never you would feel such joy,

454
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:55,333
even if you get, say, a big lottery maybe,

455
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:59,792
a big job or a big name

456
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:06,375
or a very big award, no.

457
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:12,542
The joy of creating Sahaja Yogis

458
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:18,208
knows no bounds,

459
00:42:18,834 --> 00:42:22,709
is such a joy-giving thing.

460
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:28,792
You develop such fraternities,

461
00:42:28,959 --> 00:42:35,000
such solidarity, as they call it, such oneness,

462
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:40,208
such enjoyment of love,

463
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:43,875
enjoyment of compassion.

464
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,834
It's a different level of enjoyment

465
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,041
that's not like ordinary enjoyments.

466
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:57,792
You're not to be afraid of Me,

467
00:42:57,959 --> 00:43:02,166
but be afraid of yourself.

468
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:06,041
Have a watch on yourself and see for yourself

469
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:09,792
what have you been doing so far.

470
00:43:09,959 --> 00:43:13,166
What have you done so far?

471
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:19,667
Because you have been enlightened.

472
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:23,375
If the enlightened people

473
00:43:23,542 --> 00:43:27,375
cannot give light, what's the use in having them?

474
00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:30,291
Look at these little, little candles.

475
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:36,208
Whatever little light they have, they're giving that light.

476
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:40,333
They're burning themselves to give that light.

477
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:46,583
If we cannot give that light,

478
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:52,125
what is the use of enlightenment?

479
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:58,000
Enlightened doesn't mean the light for yourself only

480
00:43:58,166 --> 00:44:03,041
the light of love, compassion,

481
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:09,959
which is divine, which is not normal, which is not ordinary,

482
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:12,875
as you see in the films.

483
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,375
It is a divine love which works

484
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:24,625
and that is what makes Me sometimes little weak

485
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:28,166
when I hear that Sahaja Yogis now

486
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:32,917
are getting involved in money, in cheating.

487
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:37,625
I mean, all kinds of criminal activities they do.

488
00:44:37,792 --> 00:44:41,542
I can't understand. I can't believe it.

489
00:44:41,709 --> 00:44:45,667
After getting the highest,

490
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:51,667
why do you want to go so low as that?

491
00:44:51,834 --> 00:44:57,500
Because you have not yet felt what you have got.

492
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:03,291
You have not realised what you have got.

493
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,166
And you don't respect yourself.

494
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:16,542
Still, if you are on the same line and the same level,

495
00:45:16,709 --> 00:45:27,417
I must say you have done no justice to Me or to yourself.

496
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:31,500
We have to work it out.

497
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:35,125
Single-handed, I've done it,

498
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:38,917
worked very hard, I must say,

499
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:46,208
in the sense that I had to deal with horrible people,

500
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:54,959
very unkind, very selfish, very cruel.

501
00:45:55,709 --> 00:45:58,667
That doesn't matter.

502
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:05,083
And such beautiful birds I have discovered.

503
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:10,417
But you must keep your lustre

504
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:13,458
and work it out.

505
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:20,500
I'll be very happy to know that Sahaja Yoga is spreading

506
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:25,291
with leaps and bounds, with great speed

507
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:29,166
and that people are really

508
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:37,250
getting into that realm

509
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:44,709
of peace, joy and happiness.

510
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:47,667
That's My dream

511
00:46:47,834 --> 00:46:51,792
and I hope you all will all work it out.

512
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:54,917
Thank you very much.
