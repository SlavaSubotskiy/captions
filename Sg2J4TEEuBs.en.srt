00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,030
Oh

00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:15,119
[Music]

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:22,369
I bow to all the seekers of

4
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:44,970
you have to know that truth is what it

5
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:50,699
is we cannot conceptualize it with our

6
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:54,210
human awareness we cannot order it we

7
00:00:50,699 --> 00:01:01,100
cannot manipulate it we cannot organize

8
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:09,030
it it is what it is has been unveiled

9
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:13,380
and what is the truth truth is that we

10
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:17,840
are surrounded or we are penetrated or

11
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:23,369
we are nourished looked after and loved

12
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:31,349
by a very subtle energy which is the

13
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:38,479
energy of divine love the second truth

14
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:38,479
is that we are not this body this mind

15
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:52,080
these conditionings this ego but we are

16
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:56,130
the spirit you don't have to accept what

17
00:01:52,080 --> 00:02:01,410
I am saying blindly because blind

18
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:04,250
well-trained leads to fanaticism but as

19
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:09,300
scientists you must keep your mind open

20
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:16,190
and see for yourself what I am saying if

21
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:16,190
it is so honestly you must accept it

22
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:36,440
we know so much through science about

23
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:40,790
our civilization our advancement this is

24
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:44,329
the advancement of a tree which has

25
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:52,760
grown outside very much but if you do

26
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:55,790
not know our roots will be destroyed so

27
00:02:52,760 --> 00:03:03,790
it is important to know about our roots

28
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:11,750
and this is what it is that I would say

29
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:15,340
are our roots as you can see there are

30
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,340
seven centers within us

31
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:35,569
and these subtle centers are placed in

32
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:38,060
the spinal cord and in the brain these

33
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:43,000
cater to our physical mental emotional

34
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:47,269
and spiritual needs on the physical side

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,909
they manifest the energy for the use of

36
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:58,639
our plexuses which look after our

37
00:03:52,909 --> 00:04:05,480
physical problems that is on the right

38
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:06,650
side this energy which is supplied by

39
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:12,340
this yellow line

40
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:18,199
a subtle Channel we call it as the

41
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:23,479
Pingala Nadi this supplies energy for

42
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:28,130
our physical and mental actions so this

43
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:32,150
is the power of action within us which

44
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:36,470
also caters to the Wrights sympathetic

45
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:40,010
nervous system the another channel you

46
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:45,470
see on the left hand side is the channel

47
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:48,229
by which we desire put our energy to our

48
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:54,560
desire so this is the power of desire

49
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:58,940
and looks after our emotions this is the

50
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:02,840
one which looks after our conditionings

51
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:09,860
also at the end of these two channels

52
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:13,310
they create two institutions one on the

53
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:16,310
right side crosses over and the yellow

54
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:19,970
balloon that you see is the ego is the

55
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:23,300
balloon of ego that we have and the left

56
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:29,500
hand side one that which conditions our

57
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:29,500
mind is the balloon of super-ego

58
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:36,370
as we start growing in age by the time

59
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:45,009
we are 12 years of age these two

60
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:52,270
completely meet and the soft bone in our

61
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:57,099
head becomes completely calcified now

62
00:05:52,270 --> 00:06:02,139
there's third energy within us which is

63
00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:04,300
in the center and this Center central

64
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:09,430
energy is the one which has made us

65
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:14,650
human beings and these centers are the

66
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:23,500
milestones of our evolution so now the

67
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:31,479
last jumping is left out it has reached

68
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:38,020
up to the limbic area now only thing is

69
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:47,430
it has to break through the soft bone in

70
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:52,110
the on the head and break through that

71
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:52,110
which is the actualization of baptism

72
00:06:52,319 --> 00:07:04,779
baptism is not an artificial thing it is

73
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:12,310
an actualization but the energy that

74
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:16,860
does it is we call it sleeping energy in

75
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:21,430
the triangular bone called as sacrum

76
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:24,599
that means the Greeks knew that this is

77
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:29,020
a sacred bone that we called it sacrum

78
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:33,629
this energy has to rise and break

79
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:37,000
through that fontanel bone area and

80
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:40,419
connect us to that subtle divine power

81
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,050
which we have never felt during human

82
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,050
awareness

83
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:57,800
thus we get connected to this divine

84
00:07:53,460 --> 00:08:01,440
power and we start feeling it on our

85
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:05,069
fingertips is described in the Quran

86
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,340
that at the time of resurrection your

87
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:12,150
hands will speak and they will give

88
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:14,909
witness against you that is you start

89
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:19,319
feeling your own centers these are five

90
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:20,610
six and seven centers and they indicate

91
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:29,039
what's wrong with you

92
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:31,139
within yourself what's the problem also

93
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,440
you can feel the cool breeze coming out

94
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:37,560
of your head cool breeze of the Holy

95
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:44,490
Ghost because this sleeping power which

96
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:48,660
is called as the Kundalini Kundalini is

97
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:51,500
coiled it's the power of pure desire

98
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,500
within us

99
00:08:51,970 --> 00:09:05,080
