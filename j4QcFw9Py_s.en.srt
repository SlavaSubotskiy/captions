1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,569
Today I was thinking of telling you about
the ego problem, because I think everybody

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:12,730
feels that that’s the biggest problem they
all have; and there’s a big ego trip one

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:18,200
gets into, and they don’t know what to do
with it.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:26,470
So first part I will tell you how the ego
rises and how, what it does to us; the second

5
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:39,260
how to understand it, how to tackle the position
of ego and put it in its own aspect.

6
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:51,100
As you see in the map here, the yellow stuff
that you see on top is the ego.

7
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,550
The balloon that is yellow is the ego.

8
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,620
You see down below it starts from the Swadhishthana.

9
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:10,770
This is the colour of the bile within us,
and this Swadhishthana Chakra which is for

10
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:21,670
our creativity is directly connected to that
ego there.

11
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:33,640
And when it starts rotating round the Void
and going to the various parts of the Void,

12
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:40,920
it collects all the problems of the Void.

13
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:58,120
Void is that green circle within us where
physically we have in the Void, we have uterus,

14
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:06,060
we have kidney – it’s a complete viscera:
all the intestines, ascending, transverse,

15
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:23,280
descending colon, liver, is the upper part
of liver more, then also pancreas and the spleen.

16
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,630
So all the problems of these organs are collected
by this chakra which moves.

17
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:40,420
It comes out of the Nabhi Chakra and moves
round and round and round, and collects all the problems.

18
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:58,250
It nourishes, gives power, the vital power
to these organs, and also it generates necessary

19
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:04,590
power for our creative action.

20
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:18,020
It also collects the fat cells of the Void,
convert it into the proper cells for the brain,

21
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,670
for its use, for the grey matter.

22
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,530
All this work it has to do, one chakra.

23
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,500
It manifests aortic plexus outside.

24
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:37,900
On the physical level we call it as aortic
plexus, and it has got six sub-plexuses which

25
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:45,850
look after all these organs.

26
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,210
This is meant for our action.

27
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:54,050
When we go into action, this chakra starts
working.

28
00:03:54,050 --> 00:04:04,319
By the first power, which is on the left-hand
side, we desire.

29
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:19,239
But by the second one we go into action, and
it’s called as kriya shakti.

30
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:32,050
Now when this action starts within us, it
produces the by-products or we can say all

31
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:45,169
the problems of these organs, which are to
be deposited somewhere, and they are all deposited in the brain as ego.

32
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:59,081
All the problems that we have out of these,
this creativity and the action of all these

33
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:05,520
organs are to be counterbalanced, and as a
counterbalance the ego develops.

34
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,830
For example, now I have to come and meet you
all here.

35
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:17,020
I had to get out of the house, I had to change,
I had to drive, whatever it is, then I came,

36
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,740
I had to put in effort.

37
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,360
I had to plan out how I’m going to talk
to you – that I don’t do normally, but

38
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,800
I’m saying in generally people do it.

39
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,479
And I put in the effort to come in.

40
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:40,050
Now how am I to justify this, all this effort?

41
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:49,680
What is the satisfaction that one gets out
of doing this effort, this kriya, this action?

42
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:58,469
We go on doing some action, and why should
we do it?

43
00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:09,509
After all, action means, any activity means
exertion, botheration, problems, so best is

44
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:13,020
to sit at home and do nothing of the kind!

45
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:20,270
But we do not do that, we take up challenges,
we rush up to it.

46
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:26,020
All this we do with our kriya shakti, with
our right action.

47
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,490
Because we do action, we have to have a satisfaction
about it.

48
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,129
As a reaction to that, ego develops.

49
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:42,020
If we do not have the ego we would not do
anything – is a fact.

50
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:51,469
But ego is the one that rationalises all our
madness, the rat race we are running into.

51
00:06:51,469 --> 00:07:00,349
If we did not have the ego we would not go
into this nonsense.

52
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:06,179
The more we try to rationalise our activities,
the more ego develops to satisfy.

53
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:07,439
“All right, very good, very good.

54
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,629
Now you are a successful man, see?

55
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:16,879
You’re a very successful man, you have got
this, you have got that."

56
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:22,930
Lots of misunderstandings creep in when we
pamper our ego like this – or I should say

57
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:30,669
that when we are satisfied with our ego – that
we really get lost.

58
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:36,410
We get identified with our ego and not with
ourselves.

59
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:44,860
So if you do some work very well: supposing
you have, say, made a beautiful poetry or,

60
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:53,219
say, not piece of poetry but say you have
made a very good painting, then you would

61
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:54,699
like people to appreciate.

62
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:58,740
If they do not appreciate you, you think you
have done nothing, though you have done a

63
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,729
beautiful poem – of a canvas.

64
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:09,770
But still you will be so dissatisfied with
yourself unless and until people appreciate you.

65
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:15,330
They must garland you, they must say, “Oh,
you are great, you are really unique, you are a genius."

66
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:25,729
You know many artist who created great art,
got trapped into this kind of misidentification.

67
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:36,260
When they created some great art, the art
could not give them satisfaction.

68
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,690
They had to go to ego, and Mr.

69
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:45,490
Ego would not be satisfied unless and until
everybody says, “Yes, yes, you are very good.

70
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,550
You have done this, you are a genius, you
are this, you are that."

71
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:55,870
That’s how the ego develops then within
us.

72
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:06,100
But a situation can arise where even when
we have done nothing, we want to take the credit.

73
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:15,950
Then we call such a person egoistical who
says, “I will do this, I have done this,

74
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,040
I, I, I, I” – then we call him an egoistical
person.

75
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,510
Because he gives words to his ego, that’s
why we call him egoistical.

76
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,320
But all of us have got this Mr.

77
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,770
Ego there, sitting on our heads.

78
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:37,250
When it starts bloating, the more successful
you are, the worse it is.

79
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,970
The more you indulge into planning and thinking,
the worse it is.

80
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,750
The balloon goes on, you see, pumped as if
you are pumping a balloon, you see.

81
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,900
The more you pump, the more it becomes.

82
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:59,250
And you can never realise that you are not
that ego.

83
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:05,610
Then you start feeling very nice about it,
because everybody says, “Oh, what a great man he is."

84
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,550
The whole society develops on those lines.

85
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:18,870
Today only I was discussing about the way
people give you “C.O.B." , I don’t know, “V.I.P." and “M.A.D."

86
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:26,950
like that, and we carry those banners with
us.

87
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,960
And we expect everybody should respect those
banners which have been given to us, you see,

88
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,971
because we’ve done some work, somebody has
recognised us, branded it, stamped it, so

89
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:40,020
we believe really this must be something great.

90
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,300
So we accept that brand and we want to keep
it up.

91
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:54,800
So there’s a doubly fixed thing that you
are really rewarded for what work you are doing.

92
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:03,370
That’s why people start become nuisance
also.

93
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:09,560
Supposing in a society some people do not
find any significance to their lives.

94
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,720
Then they will go to Oxford Street, stand
there, wear funny dresses, start jumping and

95
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,620
singing something nonsensical, and people
make a nuisance out of themselves.We have

96
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:30,990
seen people who paint their hair in different
colours, put pencils in the noses, I think,

97
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:37,600
and do all kinds of mad things just to attract
the attention of others; because we want to

98
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,400
attract the attention of others, because our
ego is not yet satisfied.

99
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,770
But this ego is never satisfied.

100
00:11:47,770 --> 00:12:00,620
It goes on asking for more food, more food,
and you enjoy it too.

101
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:10,330
When such a ego is bloated within us, we cannot
understand what we are doing.

102
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,850
People can befool you like that.

103
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:25,630
It’s very easy to befool a person who is
ego-oriented, than to befool a simple person.

104
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:35,270
A simple-hearted man not, cannot be easily
befooled, because he’s not on a trip, you see.

105
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:41,130
But those who are on a ego trip, you tell
them that this is the best way to go to hell

106
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,710
– they will be the first booking their seats.

107
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:54,900
There will be a queue for it, and people would
be asking for it, “All right, if it is so, it’s good."

108
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:00,610
That is how many gurus in this world have
come forward, have befooled you by telling

109
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,980
you that you will get these powers, those
powers, that will happen, this will happen.

110
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,550
And they know how to pamper your ego.

111
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:16,750
For example, they might say this is a world
organisation of spirituality, and you are

112
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:24,270
the head of the world organisation; and you
believe it.

113
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:30,010
Ego means misappropriation.

114
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:43,880
You believe in it because you think that “after
all I must be something, and I have done this, I have done that."

115
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,029
But actually what happens physically is then
when this balloon spreads on your head all

116
00:13:49,029 --> 00:14:01,150
over – the aura of the brain surrounds the
heart normally, normally; but when there is

117
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:09,529
ego problem, then ego surrounds the heart.

118
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:14,460
And when ego surrounds the heart, the brain
is cut off from the heart.

119
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:22,290
So you are a non-integrated person, or we
can say disintegrated.

120
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:33,450
Your heart runs one side, your brain runs
another side, your body runs third side, your emotions run fourth side.

121
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:39,620
So four people running four horses, and that’s
how you are completely torn.

122
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:51,330
I mean, it’s impossible to stand on two
stools, but if there are four with two legs, it’s a big feat to exist.

123
00:14:51,330 --> 00:15:04,580
So this kind of ego trip comes in, by which
you start behaving and living in this world

124
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,580
in a very unnatural way.

125
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:14,230
And if somebody says that “No, not your
ego, not that.

126
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,010
That’s not you.

127
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,510
You have to be yourself.

128
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,720
Ego is not yourself.

129
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,500
Do not be satisfied with this ego,” then
you don’t like it.

130
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:38,570
Because you are much higher than ego, much
greater than ego, much more than what you

131
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,070
think your ego can do.

132
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,750
With ego what, at the most what can you do,
say?

133
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:50,960
At the most what can you do with your ego?

134
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:57,370
What people have achieved through ego?

135
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,430
Nothing.

136
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,520
Whatever they have discovered even in the
sciences has come from the unknown, from God’s

137
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,940
own treasures.

138
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:14,230
If God has given you some knowledge of the
unknown, you should not feel pampered about

139
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,890
it and think that “Oh, this is what we have
found."

140
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:29,210
No, He graciously gave you this knowledge
which has come to you, so just take it with humility.

141
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:35,970
And this ego is very, very dangerous for Kundalini
awakening.

142
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:41,940
Now you look at the diagram, imagine the whole
of your head is covered with that yellow stuff,

143
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,800
and this blue thing becomes a very small one.

144
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:54,760
So first of all the desire to seek, itself,
is diminished.

145
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:04,080
You see, you go for seeking as if you are
going to a cinema hall.

146
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:10,549
There is no combination of what you are thinking
and your heart.

147
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:14,120
You are not seeking from your heart, you are
seeking just with your brains.

148
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:20,329
Because you have read three, four books, there’s
a fashion, everybody is seeking, everybody

149
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:25,879
is looking as if they are seeking something,
so let us also seek.

150
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:35,020
It is not coming from your heart, because
you can see that the activity of heart has become practically zero.

151
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:42,139
You do not desire anything, it is what your
ego desires you run after.

152
00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:47,279
Anything that doesn’t satisfy your ego,
you get upset about it.

153
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:53,470
One must go on all the time saying that you
are the fastest horse, you are the greatest

154
00:17:53,470 --> 00:18:03,200
person, you are the most unique personality,
then only you are satisfied.

155
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,000
It cuts you out so much from your heart.

156
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:16,200
That’s why we cannot find joy, because joy
you can only get through your heart. But this Mr.

157
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:24,080
Ego gives you some sort of a satisfaction
which is very superficial, temporary, leads you nowhere.

158
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:34,809
With this ego-orientation only you get so
many diseases, as I have told you before,

159
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:51,809
like diabetes, heart attack, we can say also
cancer could be one of them, arthritis you might get.

160
00:18:51,809 --> 00:19:04,070
You also get with this too much thinking,
paralysis, paralysis is because of that, and kidney failures.

161
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,770
The worst is liver.

162
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:14,980
Because of over activity, liver is neglected.

163
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,059
We are least bothered about the liver.

164
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:24,580
If you tell a child “don’t eat chocolates”
in childhood – I mean, it’s an impossibility,

165
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,840
you cannot talk like that.

166
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,190
I mean, I just once said that why not stop
giving chocolates to children, who cannot

167
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:38,320
digest it because their liver is not that;
or make something that is digestible to their

168
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,460
liver from childhood, till they grow up.

169
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:50,350
And why not dilute the chocolates also a little
bit more?

170
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:56,309
So the question comes in then, that “How
can you do it, Mother?

171
00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:02,279
It would be chucking out everything, and children
would protest without chocolates."

172
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:08,799
Gradually they’ll forget.

173
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,269
The liver problem starts within you.

174
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:22,250
You become thin, lean, pale, aggressive, all
the time grumbling, grudging, sulking; never

175
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:27,340
in joy, never in happiness.

176
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:37,910
You call it tension, stress, all these things
– it’s nothing but over activity of this chakra.

177
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:44,619
Tension is because the whole of it is covered
with this balloon, and the balloon is still

178
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:47,559
going on and on and on.

179
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:51,070
That has to reduce.

180
00:20:51,070 --> 00:21:07,239
Sahaja Yoga is the only way really we can
face our ego, because through Sahaja Yoga only we can see ourselves.

181
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:15,759
But it is an impossibility with human beings
to face themselves, even after realisation they find it difficult.

182
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:25,759
For example, all our misidentifications are
there.

183
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,340
Say I’m dealing, say, with English disciples
here.

184
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:35,249
Before I start saying about the misidentification
of the English, I must condemn all the Indians

185
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:42,830
of the world, and all the Japanese, Chinese,
Greeks, everybody else, and then I should

186
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:48,250
say, “There’s also something wrong with
English."

187
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:53,230
Otherwise I had it!

188
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:59,669
Unless and until at every stage I condemn
all the rest of the world, I cannot talk of

189
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:05,970
saying that we also have certain misidentifications
which are sitting on our heads, by which we

190
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:15,909
are oppressed; we think that this is the correct
way of life; by which we have oppressed others.

191
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:20,289
And this ego business is so much prevalent
in our society.

192
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:24,120
Now, with all due apologies, I am talking
about the Western society.

193
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:31,220
When it comes to India I talk to them, but
now I’m talking to you and think that I am also a Western person.

194
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,570
So I can see certain things as a Western personality.

195
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,559
I don’t feel bad about it.

196
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,830
For in the so-called certain traditions that
we have – today only I was discussing, you

197
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,749
see – like on the table we have to sit for
dinner.

198
00:22:44,749 --> 00:22:49,149
All right, simple thing it is to sit on the
table for dinner.

199
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:56,740
Now dinner is there because God has been gracious
to us; for our well-being, for our friendship

200
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,389
we are all going to sit down.

201
00:22:59,389 --> 00:23:04,821
But go to any formal dinner or you arrange
a formal dinner, people would sit down, ten

202
00:23:04,821 --> 00:23:14,739
times discussing where is the seat of X and
the seat of Y and the seat of Z.

203
00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:22,889
But if there is a slightest mistake in placing
the people according to their date of birth,

204
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:31,039
their face colour, their head colour, their
height, their noses, their length, their upper

205
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,659
lips; any difference is there found in the
“Who’s Who” book, you see, that somebody

206
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:39,879
was placed little higher in M.A.D.

207
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:44,730
degree – then you had it!

208
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:50,440
All the good wishes of entertaining people,
of doing some good friendship, of having,

209
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:56,460
creating something very, very great is all
lost.

210
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:04,960
All the effort is lost, and you are left wondering,
“Now what have I done?

211
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,499
I did consult all the dictionaries and the
‘Who’s Who.'”

212
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:12,460
I mean, this “Who’s Who” is another
ego-pampering, you know.

213
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:18,950
But despite that there was a mistake somehow,
and the person has taken a very big objection that Mr.

214
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:26,409
X, who is one day junior to him, has been
made to sit ahead of him.

215
00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:31,299
It’s the greatest calamity to his ego.

216
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:39,220
The poor chairs do not know what happens for
their different shapes, you see!

217
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:47,419
How much we fight over all such things, pampering
our ego.

218
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,429
So on and so forth, we have so many things.

219
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:54,399
But if I say “Scrap all this nonsense,”
why don’t you scrap it?

220
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:59,299
Why to have all this, protocols, this, that?

221
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:03,239
What is the need to have this seat for this
gentleman, that seat?

222
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:07,269
After all, if there are ten people for dinner
they can find their seats, there won’t be

223
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:08,759
a chaos for ten people.

224
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,889
Even for twenty people, even for three hundred.

225
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:15,350
Why should there be seat allotted?

226
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:20,809
If you have invited three hundred people,
all right, they’ll all sit down.

227
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:24,779
If they are remaining they’ll sit down for
the second one or for the third one.

228
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:33,919
What is the, such a hurry of having that program
altogether, or in such a systematic way that

229
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:41,409
everybody feels unsystematic after that, everybody
feels disturbed and upset after the program is over?

230
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:47,470
With all the system, with all the corrections
and with all the great planning we do, ultimately

231
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:51,789
we find all have become nitwits.

232
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:54,120
There must be something wrong about it.

233
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:59,749
And it becomes a frenzy, with mob-like behaviour
people have, you see.

234
00:25:59,749 --> 00:26:05,700
Everybody will come out with very big faces,
“Oh, what a mismanagement, you know, they did this."

235
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,240
What is it?

236
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,440
One can’t even understand what is the value
of these things.

237
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,600
That’s why we have to be like small children.

238
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,360
To them it does not matter where they sit.

239
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:30,799
And so we are grown-up and matured, supposed
to be mature people also; while children are

240
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,929
still innocent and still ignorant, and still
they have to grow up.

241
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:38,960
We are supposed to be up-grown: what has grown
within us is nothing but this Mr.

242
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:45,940
Ego, not you.

243
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:54,049
When this happens, when this happens in the
worst possible way – you know, today’s

244
00:26:54,049 --> 00:27:00,039
paper I was reading about this Ripper.

245
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:07,409
Now the conclusion is reached that he’s
not a psychopath, but he is on an ego trip.

246
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:16,740
He’s doing all this for his ego satisfaction,
because he telephones to the police, he sends

247
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:22,679
a, what you call a tape to the police that
he should be caught.

248
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,059
He tells them “You’ll meet me here,”
and still they cannot catch him.

249
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:32,750
So he thinks, oh, he’s such a great person
that nobody can catch him, the greatest thief

250
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:36,129
ever born who could not be caught.

251
00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:44,210
So that is what you call – he’s not a
psychopath, but I don’t know what name will

252
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,259
you give to such a man.

253
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:52,419
I mean to a egoist like this, the one who
lives by ego, tries to satisfy his ego, and

254
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:56,559
if his ego is not satisfied by something,
he doesn’t feel satisfied.

255
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,809
I don’t know what should you call him.

256
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:04,289
Now, how to overcome this ego?

257
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:08,789
Because people start seeing gradually this:
it happens.

258
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:10,720
They start seeing Mr.

259
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,739
Ego, “Oh, very great, you see it’s coming
up, giving me ideas, all right."

260
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:18,799
You feel sometimes very depressed with the
idea that this is Mr.

261
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,669
Ego I was identified with.

262
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:21,669
All right?

263
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:24,249
You see your ego.

264
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:27,899
Then when you see your ego, then what do you
do with it?

265
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:32,450
Or if somebody says “Better watch your ego,”
then what happens?

266
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,830
You start fighting it.

267
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:38,320
You say, “No, I will not say anything, I’ll
just keep quiet.

268
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,249
Let them say anything, whatever they like."

269
00:28:42,249 --> 00:28:46,340
Then you’ll become another type.

270
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:51,479
You become a person who is suffering from
superego.

271
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:58,910
So you are left with desires, but do not act,
and you’d say that “Let others aggress

272
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,929
me, I’m not going to aggress anyone.

273
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:03,019
I’ll be very careful about non-aggression."

274
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:09,639
But by this kind of a thing, what happens
that when you raise the left side – I mean,

275
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:15,669
left side which goes up on the right-hand
side, superego, it presses the ego down but

276
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:23,210
again is bounced back, and there’s a kind
of a bouncing going on.

277
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:28,820
By this behaviour when you fight your ego,
the ego sits on your head much more.

278
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:33,179
The more you try to fight ego, it sits on
your head.

279
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:38,710
You are not to fight it.

280
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,440
Supposing you take a balloon and start hitting
it, it will hit you back further.

281
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,309
Go on hitting it, it will go on hitting.

282
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:53,299
Now, which is the way to deflate this ego?

283
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:54,690
How do we deflate a balloon?

284
00:29:54,690 --> 00:30:02,419
In the same manner, take a pin and give it
a prick.

285
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:04,509
You just look at yourself, say, “All right,
Mr.

286
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:12,830
So-and-so, now how do you do?” and you laugh
at yourself.

287
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:20,150
You said, “Oh, you were very unhappy, you
see, when you saw that you were not placed very much.

288
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:27,450
All right, now have a pin from me!”

289
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:34,690
And that’s how you deflate it, by seeing
it, by all the time making fun of it yourself,

290
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:41,600
and piercing a pin into it.

291
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:48,989
Not by deflating, in the way people say that
you deflate the whole thing by pushing it

292
00:30:48,989 --> 00:30:58,251
down or by killing it, but actually just making
a hole in it.

293
00:30:58,251 --> 00:31:07,849
In the same way, if you start looking at yourself,
and make fun.

294
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:13,869
Human beings only know very well how to make
fun of themselves.

295
00:31:13,869 --> 00:31:19,169
No animals know that.

296
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:25,059
If you learn how to make fun of yourself,
your ego will go down.

297
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:28,769
Otherwise this ego will suggest whatever you
are doing is the best, “This has to be done,

298
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:29,769
that has to be done.

299
00:31:29,769 --> 00:31:31,629
I am the best, I am doing everything good."

300
00:31:31,629 --> 00:31:36,389
And you might be torturing someone, aggressing
someone, you might be just playing into the

301
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:40,389
hands of ego like a madcap.

302
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:45,350
And you might be a real madcap, but you don’t
know that you are.

303
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:53,649
Because with ego a person becomes successful,
so-called, he becomes very brilliant, shines

304
00:31:53,649 --> 00:32:01,960
out, in competition he comes up; and nobody
dare say a word to him, otherwise he’ll

305
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,890
have punch on the nose, you see.

306
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:14,860
So also he becomes very mighty and powerful,
and everybody hankers after such a behaviour and such a thing.

307
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:23,309
But a time comes when he realises that “I
was hanging in the air.

308
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:34,440
I forgot my basis, and now I have to come
down,” like Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,

309
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,659
and they had a great fall.

310
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:42,029
Such a beautiful … this thing is, written
long time back.

311
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:52,330
And all the men … all the king’s horses
and all the men could not put Humpty Dumpty

312
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,679
back again into its own shape, you see?

313
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:05,710
So don’t be Humpty Dumpty, and don’t live
with that idea of being a Humpty Dumpty.

314
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:12,100
Is a simple thing to fight your ego.

315
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:18,609
And that happens very often in Sahaja Yoga,
is a very common happening in Sahaja Yoga

316
00:33:18,609 --> 00:33:25,899
where your Kundalini itself, you see, creates
such situations that you are flabbergasted at your ego.

317
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:36,539
You don’t have to judge others, just see
yourself, because it is for your own good.

318
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:39,980
If somebody is egoistical it makes no difference
to you.

319
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,070
Or non-egoistical, makes no difference.

320
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:49,980
Only thing is, you should really see for yourself
what is good and what is bad.

321
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,419
That’s how it works out.

322
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:56,879
Otherwise, as I always say that when I give
a lecture immediately we start thinking of

323
00:33:56,879 --> 00:33:58,529
somebody whom we think to be egoistical.

324
00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:03,470
Actually I’m saying to each one of you to
see it, would be a better idea.

325
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:12,490
Now this ego when it covers your entire head,
the complete Sahastrara which is shown there,

326
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:16,080
the white area gets covered.

327
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:23,000
Your brahmarandhra, the portion from where
the Kundalini has to pierce also gets covered.

328
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:30,190
It’s very difficult, the whole thing is
covered and this is small here, the gap is here.

329
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,540
Now you cannot open the gap here.

330
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,800
You have to open the gap here.

331
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,870
So this has to go back like that, and this
has to come up in the centre like that.

332
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:47,100
Then only Kundalini can come up.

333
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:55,650
So what happens at such stage, you will find
such people have a left hand very weak, and right hand throbbing.

334
00:34:55,650 --> 00:35:01,830
So you raise their left, put to the right
side.

335
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:05,750
Again raise their left put to the right, again
raise their left put to the right, so you

336
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:10,970
bring down the ego like this.

337
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:24,321
And once the ego comes down, then this comes
up and the gap comes in between, and then

338
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:26,800
you raise the Kundalini in the centre.

339
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:35,200
Kundalini will come out, and then you tie
it up.

340
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,530
This is Shri Vidya.

341
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:41,950
This is the knowledge of Shri, of the Holy
Spirit.

342
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:52,540
All other knowledge of where you have to sit
in protocol, what you are, is all avidya and nonsense.

343
00:35:52,540 --> 00:36:02,100
Reading “Who’s Who” I don’t know what
you will become, monsters or maybe some sort

344
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:11,180
of a Frankenstein-style personality.

345
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:20,820
This is the vidya, Shri Vidya is the secret
vidya of the Holy Ghost, by which you balance

346
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:33,980
your ego with superego, your desire and action
should be equal; and then raise the Kundalini, put it up and tie it up.

347
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:49,780
All these days people who been realised souls,
great people, have tried to point out the

348
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,960
problems of ego, have talked to you.

349
00:36:51,960 --> 00:37:04,580
They said, you shouldn’t have ego; ego is
the worst thing, one should not be identified with ego, and all that.

350
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:09,160
And as soon as they have said it people have
started just finding out how to do it, and

351
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:16,720
in doing so they have become great “gurus”
– themselves egoistical.

352
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:25,010
The fact is, you do not do anything.

353
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:33,570
This is not ego, but is a mirage of ego that
you have got.

354
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:39,430
You really do not do anything – everything
is done by God.

355
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:43,810
He is the Doer, He has the great Ego.

356
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:53,320
Your ego is just a copy, made artificially.

357
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:59,690
Like He creates the flowers, and you make
plastic flowers and say, “Oh, we have created flowers."

358
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:02,410
He does everything.

359
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:10,540
It is He who expresses His ego, while you
feel you have done something.

360
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:17,160
It happens to you when you get realisation,
when your Kundalini pierces the brahmarandhra,

361
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,570
then you find the power flowing through you.

362
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:24,540
And when you put your hands at somebody you
find the Kundalini rising there, and then

363
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:30,780
you find that you can feel the centres of
that person and catching of his centres, and you’re amazed.

364
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,780
You said, “Mother, how is it?

365
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,320
Just now was nothing, suddenly what has happened
to me?”

366
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:46,030
Because your ego has subsided and has become
one with that of God, and you are giving vent to that power of God.

367
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:52,731
You are playing the role of an instrument,
of a hollow personality, and through you is

368
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:57,950
passing the power of God which is doing the
real work, while you are thinking “I’m

369
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:01,630
doing it,” without getting realisation.

370
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,920
But after realisation you just feel, “Oh,
it’s flowing through me.

371
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:17,650
I can see it flowing, I can see it working,
it is …” You’d start talking in third person, you don’t say “I."

372
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:21,150
You just say, “It’s going, it’s coming,
it’s not there.

373
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,280
This is catching, that is catching."

374
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,140
It is in the third person you talk.

375
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:30,500
You do not say “I am catching."

376
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:36,420
You do not say also that “I have risen the
Kundalini,” you say “The Kundalini has risen."

377
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,240
Who has risen it?

378
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,410
You never say that you have raised the Kundalini.

379
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:44,840
You just say, “The Kundalini has risen.

380
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,070
It is not coming up.

381
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:53,370
It’s just going there,” as if you have
become an instrument of some power which is flowing through you.

382
00:39:53,370 --> 00:40:06,160
And this is how we become one with that, and
all our karmas dissolve into akarma.

383
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,160
Karmas are only the effect of our false idea
of our ego.

384
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:18,680
When there is no ego, where are the karmas
going to be?

385
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:23,200
If there is no one who is doing and the doer
is lost, then who’s going to do the karmas,

386
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:31,500
and who’s going to take the load of the
karmas upon themselves?

387
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:39,220
Like when there is an organisation, then it
says, “I have got assets and I have got

388
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,760
these debts, and these are the things,”
you see.

389
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:52,780
But the association or that organisation disappears,
then who has the debt?

390
00:40:52,780 --> 00:41:02,560
In the same way, you as ego disappear, and
there is no effect of your karmas – all finished.

391
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,600
All that was when one Mr.

392
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,610
Ego was there.

393
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,610
When Mr.

394
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:12,130
Ego has gone, all liabilities have gone with
him.

395
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,070
We are something different now.

396
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:19,670
Now we have become the Self, the Atma.

397
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:32,490
And when we have become the Atma, then we
are one with that Universal Being, and He

398
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,700
is making us do everything.

399
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:45,880
Like My fingers don’t have ego that I’m
doing something and I’m touching the thumb,

400
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,060
because it is a part of this body.

401
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:55,600
Our nose does not have an ego that it is something
special which is breathing.

402
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,770
We say “I breathe,” we don’t say “this
nose breathes."

403
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:07,250
Neither the nose would say this mouth with
which we eat food, it never says that this,

404
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,450
“I eat because of my mouth."

405
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:19,370
When you become one with that whole, then
you just feel that the whole is working and

406
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:30,930
we as part are working with it; and all the
responsibilities are finished.

407
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:40,850
This is a little talk about ego today, because
I felt I should tell you that in Kundalini

408
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:49,740
awakening so far in the West, we have always
faced this problem of ego.

409
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:57,170
Also of superego; those who have been to the
gurus have been possessed by their gurus.

410
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:07,290
And these come as a relief to ego-oriented
society, because you have been, a horse has

411
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:14,150
been running, all right, and you have been
running on the horse.

412
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:20,780
So somebody comes and says, “All right,
now, I’ll tie you up to the stomach of the

413
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,140
horse and I’ll be sitting on the horse myself."

414
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,720
This is the possession part of it.

415
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:35,750
So you feel relieved, you know, quite relieved:
after all, you don’t have to ride the horse, you don’t have to jump.

416
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:41,040
And the rider becomes somebody else, you see,
you feel also that there’s no responsibility, the rider is doing it.

417
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:50,530
But after some time under the belly of the
horse, you start having all kinds of physical problems.

418
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:55,190
With superego you have physical problems.

419
00:43:55,190 --> 00:44:01,130
That’s why is better to have superego than
to have ego, because you know you don’t

420
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:04,410
want to have any more of physical problems.

421
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:07,940
But if you have ego you never get physical
problems, or physically you may improve; you

422
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:13,310
know, you feel very fine, on top of the world,
you see.

423
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,650
That is the biggest problem.

424
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:22,340
But you get mental problems: you can’t sleep,
you go on thinking, thinking like mad, you cannot stop thinking.

425
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,000
You go on arguing that it should be done.

426
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,760
You think that everybody should do your work,
while you are the most important person ever born.

427
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:45,980
So we have only one choice left, is to be
in the centre, to watch your ego and superego.

428
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:53,830
For all the Sahaja yogis who are realised
have to watch themselves, not others.

429
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:59,710
You should not expect anything of others,
just expect something of yourself for a change.

430
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:10,460
With ego you do that and expect something
of the others, in superego you do for others.

431
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:23,430
But in Self-realisation you emit your Self
as joy, love and beauty.

432
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:30,420
May God bless you all.

433
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:38,230
Now, should we go in for vibrations and realisation?

434
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:41,460
Now for the new people I would request if
they can take out their socks it would be

435
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,090
even better, they’ll be freer.

436
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:50,400
Put both the feet on the ground, and sit in
a most relaxed manner.

437
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,910
Now as you must have understood, it is a happening.

438
00:45:55,910 --> 00:46:05,290
You cannot force it down, you cannot work
it out, it has to happen to you.

439
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:10,260
So no effort is to be put in, nothing.

440
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:13,890
You just leave it, it works.

441
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:20,660
Put your hands just like this, in a very relaxed
manner.

442
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:29,340
Even for Sahaja yogis it is very important
that they should go on exposing themselves

443
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:41,830
more and more to divine Power.

444
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:55,320
And then when the Kundalini pierces the fontanel,
you’ll immediately start feeling the cool

445
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,960
vibrations in your hand.

446
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,270
But it happens in many various stages in many
people.

447
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:12,150
For example, some people may not even get
the rising of the Kundalini at all – some people, very few.

448
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:17,350
With some people it rises halfway, again falls
down.

449
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:26,560
With some people it gets caught up in different
chakras, centres which are not all right.

450
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:32,510
With some people there may be physical problem,
so you might feel some heat coming out.

451
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:40,860
Specially with liver you get the heat coming
out, lot of heat is there with the liver.

452
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:45,840
And with some people it could be very cold.

453
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:51,110
Both things are not all right: you have to
be in the centre.

454
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:59,280
If you start feeling any cool in the hand,
then it’s perfectly all right.

455
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,720
But if there is, say, a hot coming in the
hand, doesn’t matter, you can just throw

456
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:08,490
it away and it will work out, in case it is
hot.

457
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:16,330
But if there is trembling in your eyelids
when you close your eyes, then please open your eyes.

458
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:24,410
Kundalini moves up in everybody, it works
in everyone; only thing, it has reactions

459
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:30,040
according to the person who is facing it.

460
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:35,730
So if there is any reaction, or if the Kundalini
doesn’t rise, there’s nothing to feel bad or argue about it.

461
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:41,280
By argument if I could do, I would take you
to courts and argue there things.

462
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,400
But by argument I cannot do it, you see, it
has to happen in you.

463
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:52,070
I’m anxious that it should happen, in the
same way you should be also anxious that it should happen to you.

464
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:56,380
There cannot be argument about it, you see
– it’s a happening.

465
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:59,480
How can you argue about the sprouting of a
seed?

466
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,400
If it does not, you cannot argue with it,
you see?

467
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,400
It has to sprout.

468
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,790
It’s as simple as that.

469
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:12,530
If it is not sprouting there’s something
wrong, all right?

470
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:18,250
Then those people who are realised who know
this, those who know Shri Vidya know how to

471
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:23,570
raise it, and raise your Kundalini, tie it
up and all that.

472
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,600
But even that, people have objection.

473
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:31,200
They don’t mind becoming naked and dancing
and doing all sorts of nonsense, but if somebody

474
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:38,080
raises the Kundalini and ties it up, they
don’t like it.

475
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,600
There is nothing to be afraid of Kundalini.

476
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:45,020
Somebody told Me the other day that English
people are very afraid of “Kundalini” word.

477
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:49,130
Now some English people who went to India
came by the back door, I believe, met all

478
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:55,760
kinds of horrid people who had no right to
talk of Kundalini, who were unholy people,

479
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,370
unrighteous people: naturally they had very
bad experiences about Kundalini.

480
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:09,381
As I say that some villager comes and puts
his fingers into the, into the holes of two

481
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:13,200
plugs and says that electricity is a horrible
experience.

482
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,820
In the same way it might have happened to
many, but there’s nothing to be frightened of.

483
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:25,430
It works out very well, and it gives you what
you are asking for.

484
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:28,570
She is your Mother, eternally your Mother.

485
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:31,170
She loves you the most than anybody can love.

486
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:33,830
She’s not going to give you any trouble.

487
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:38,710
She’s just waiting for you to have your
second birth.

488
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:47,450
So there’s nothing to be frightened of anyone.

489
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:49,730
And also about gurus, you shouldn’t quarrel
with Me.

490
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:54,880
If your guru is all right, I will Myself write
a nice letter to him.

491
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,760
But if he is not all right, he has ruined
your Kundalini, he’s ruined your Agya, he’s

492
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:06,370
ruined your chakras, then I have to tell you
that something wrong with the fellow, because you do not know.

493
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:12,040
Supposing there’s a policeman, he comes
to your house and he says there has been a thief in your house.

494
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:16,910
Do you get angry with the policeman?

495
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:21,700
In the same way you should not be angry with
Me, because if your guru is a real guru, satguru,

496
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:27,140
then I would really worship that man, I’ll
be really happy; but I have yet to come across

497
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:30,100
– they are very few, very, very few.

498
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,240
So what’s the use of being identified with
your guru?

499
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,580
He never gave you your powers, he was just
showing off his own powers, and was promising

500
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:42,911
you that today you’ll become a frog, tomorrow
you’ll become a bird and third day you’ll

501
00:51:42,911 --> 00:51:44,690
become a fish, and then amoeba, I think.

502
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:50,360
You’ll end up as amoeba, I believe!

503
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,440
[Comment from a yogini]

504
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,630
Otherwise they – she’s saying, another
thing they can tell you: if they don’t give

505
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:02,530
you anything, they’ve taken away all your
money and everything, that you must, you see,

506
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:07,100
you must detach yourself from your money,
your family, “Send your wife over to me,

507
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,430
I’ll look after your wife, you be detached,
you see.

508
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:13,620
Give me all your money, everything very nicely”
– still she’s saying that.

509
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:17,930
Then also you say that “Still, sir, I have
given you everything, still I haven’t got it."

510
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,200
So they’ll say, “Now you go to Himalayas.

511
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,340
Otherwise that’s the reason, you’d better
go to Himalayas.

512
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:25,820
Give me your palatial building, I’ll live
here very nicely.

513
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:31,120
Give all the money that you have, and you
go to the Himalayas.

514
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,790
And you’ll be an unmarried man, that’s
a better, you’d better divorce your wife.

515
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:36,460
You see, she’s the one who is standing in
your way."

516
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:41,560
And he sends you to Himalayas to freeze there
and to die.

517
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,230
[Yogini comments further]

518
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:47,270
She says, “Where is the pure person?” ….

519
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:55,620
She says, “Among ten thousand, You are the
only one."

520
00:52:55,620 --> 00:53:07,800
No – even if they are not pure, they should
not be sinister.

521
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,930
You are much greater people than they are,
because you are not realised, you do not propagate

522
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:15,790
anything, you do not preach anything.

523
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:17,800
These are not realised, nothing, they have
no authority.

524
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,980
They have nicely have their flags on and they
are collecting money.

525
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:22,980
Fundraisers!

526
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,640
All right, put your hands towards Me again.

527
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,230
Take out your sock, socks.

528
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:31,300
Now, it’s all right.

529
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:37,850
Put both the feet like this, put your hands
like that.

530
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:44,360
(You want some water?)

531
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:52,130
Close your eyes, please close your eyes.

532
00:53:52,130 --> 00:54:15,070
Now, the first thing that happens is if you
watch your thoughts, there is no thought in your mind.

533
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:19,420
That means it has crossed the Agya.

534
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:29,150
Sahaja yogis must go in a chain.

535
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:38,560
All of you hold each other’s hands, all
of you each other’s hands you hold.

536
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:45,840
Not you, not – the people who are realised
already, who are.

537
00:54:45,840 --> 00:55:03,710
You just hold each other’s hands, that’s
all.

538
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:20,900
Put your hands like that, yes.

539
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,320
Close your eyes please, all of you.

540
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,320
Please close your eyes.

541
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,800
Are you getting cool breeze in the hand?

542
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,800
No.

543
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,760
Yes, close your eyes, it will work out.

544
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:35,110
It has to work out, is the point.

545
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:42,290
It will work out, you just don’t worry.

546
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:47,160
Some of the Sahaja yogis are getting more
on the right, I think, less on the left hand.

547
00:55:47,160 --> 00:56:00,030
Should put their left hand towards Me, right
hand up, in case such a situation is there.

548
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:02,890
Feeling something?

549
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:04,330
Hot.

550
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:08,630
It’s all right.

551
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:14,360
(…) make straight, straight neck.

552
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,660
Make it straight.

553
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:31,790
Not it will, backwards, just make it straightforward
(…) Those who have come for the first time,

554
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:35,650
those who are getting cool breeze raise your
hands.

555
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:37,980
In the hand.

556
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,620
If you are getting cool breeze in the hand.

557
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,620
Good.

558
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:42,770
Both the hands?

559
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,160
Very good.

560
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,630
Please put down your hands.

561
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:51,820
Left, left, not right so much.

562
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:57,660
Right hand is the problem, what’s the problem?

563
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,850
Right hand is it?

564
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:03,020
Alright, where is your father?

565
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:08,860
Do you write to him quote often?

566
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,860
No?

567
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:15,620
Now you promise Me that you’ll go and write
to him a letter.

568
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:16,620
Alright?

569
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,620
Just promise.

570
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:21,760
Put your left hand on here, yes, and now you
promise, put your right hand towards Me.

571
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,840
What are these rings you are wearing?

572
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,560
Better take them out, is better thing.

573
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,410
Is to take them out for the time being.

574
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:36,340
And also your kala take it out for a while.

575
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,200
Just for five minutes.

576
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:44,600
You are getting something cool in the hand?

577
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,010
Nothing so far?

578
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:50,450
This gentleman here, are you getting any cool?

579
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:54,740
There only, not in the fingers.

580
00:57:54,740 --> 00:58:01,750
It will work out, it will work out.

581
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:02,920
What is he catching?

582
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,070
Just see.

583
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:06,380
Tell Me.

584
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,540
Vishuddhi.

585
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:12,160
You are smoking something?

586
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,790
Vishuddhi is very catching.

587
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:22,570
Now can you take out?

588
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:28,350
No, it’s alright, forget it.

589
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:32,110
Forget it now, let’s see.

590
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:34,750
Alright, it’s alright (hindi).

591
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,070
That also.

592
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:37,070
Accha.

593
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:39,360
Better cut it out.

594
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,980
Alright, put your hands towards Me.

595
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:48,610
Put your hand, left hand, here.

596
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:51,540
Since when are you getting this spasm?

597
00:58:51,540 --> 00:59:03,270
Since you have come to this country?

598
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:13,320
Alright, just push it like that.

599
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:21,690
Still Vishuddhi’s there, is it?

600
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:30,069
Just come here Marcus, come.

601
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:34,040
Just work out his Vishuddhi.

602
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:37,140
(Sighs) This is his Agya and this and that.

603
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:39,540
Now, have you been to any guru or someone?

604
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:43,420
(Just Vishuddhi’s here… Vishuddhi..)

605
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:44,420
No?

606
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:56,230
For this, but not to any guru as such.

607
00:59:56,230 --> 01:00:04,830
She’s great, I tell you, she was teaching
Me, She was telling Me that Nabhis are catching

608
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:05,830
on both the sides.

609
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:09,850
And what about (…) what are the chakras
catching?

610
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:15,650
You’ve been to some guru?

611
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:17,980
No one.

612
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:22,620
Have you been smoking?

613
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:26,110
You too smoking.

614
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:35,360
Are you alright?

615
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,550
Are you getting cool breeze in the hand?

616
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,620
Are you relaxed?

617
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:44,660
Keep your eyes shut, it’s the greatest thing
that can happen to anyone, just keep your

618
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,660
eyes shut.

619
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,280
What about you?

620
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:56,060
In both the hands you are now getting?

621
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:57,680
Both the hands?

622
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,680
Nicely.

623
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,680
Good.

624
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,320
What’s your name?

625
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:04,240
What’s your name please?

626
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,240
Nick.

627
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,620
What country you belong to?

628
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:09,620
Cyprus.

629
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:13,000
Cyprus obviously (says something inaudible).

630
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,040
And this lady comes from what country?

631
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,750
England.

632
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,450
Great.

633
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:23,320
From which part?

634
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,320
(Essex)

635
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,130
Very good.

636
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:48,340
You have not gone to any guru or anyone I
believe.

637
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:50,230
That’s good.

638
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:54,950
So what do you do?

639
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:57,900
You are a housewife?

640
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,900
(Lady: Psychology)

641
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:09,900
Still I must say you have maintained yourself
very well.

642
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:24,619
Otherwise when the psychologists come here
I have such a problem with them.

643
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:31,460
They are themselves suffering from psychology.

644
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:45,610
(To a child) Yes, come here, come, come, come
to Me.

645
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:58,050
Let him feel the chakras which is catching.

646
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:59,050
Are you better now?

647
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:00,050
Not yet.

648
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:01,119
Vishuddhi…

649
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,530
Are you alright?

650
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,670
Freddy?

651
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:07,950
Getting it?

652
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,090
Good.

653
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:11,360
What’s it?

654
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,500
Left.

655
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:17,390
Did you go to any guru?

656
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:18,820
No one.

657
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:20,960
Smoking you also?

658
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,390
Not much.

659
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:29,520
Put your hands there and one hand outside,
just see.

660
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:37,210
One hand outside like this.

661
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:39,090
Good.

662
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:40,970
(Hindi)

663
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:42,860
Better.

664
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:48,510
Vishuddhi is terrible.

665
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:50,390
Good.

666
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:54,380
Are you better now?

667
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:55,390
Starting.

668
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:57,410
Got it.

669
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:59,430
Better now?

670
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:01,450
It’s improving.

671
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:02,460
Yes.

672
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:10,540
It will work out, it will work out.

673
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:15,600
What have you been smoking?

674
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:22,550
Something wrong?

675
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:29,510
Hashish.

676
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:30,510
(…)

677
01:04:30,510 --> 01:05:00,580
He feels the vibrations (…) Heart.

678
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:17,690
Now, Nabhi.

679
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:26,250
Left.

680
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:28,890
Now how is it?

681
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:34,170
How is your brother now Mark?

682
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:39,450
He is out of intensive now?

683
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:42,030
Then it’s alright.

684
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:43,330
Better.

685
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:48,020
How do you find the gentleman sitting before
you, just see, here.

686
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:52,900
And the lady there.

687
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:55,340
They’re alright.

688
01:05:55,340 --> 01:06:01,840
Do you live in London?

689
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,590
Essex.

690
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:05,760
You have come all the way from Essex today?

691
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,580
Oh, I see.

692
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:09,990
In this London university?

693
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:13,020
Oh I see, I see.

694
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:15,440
Now, is better now?

695
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,720
This gentleman, are you better?

696
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:22,380
Anything whatsoever, nothing.

697
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:24,830
Warm still.

698
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:30,940
Alright, let it pass out.

699
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:34,600
What about him?

700
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,660
Much better now.

701
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,340
Alright, good.

702
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:42,540
Just see him, let’s try.

703
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:45,900
Still left, left Vishuddhi.

704
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:49,250
Left, here is left.

705
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:59,460
You are the one who has really helped Me the
most of all, I tell you.

706
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:01,910
So bring your friends also with you.

707
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:04,010
What about her?

708
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:10,090
He feels right heart, let’s help him.

709
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:12,700
[Yogi: Left Swadhishthan]

710
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:30,560
Go and ask him to ask the question about Shri
Rama.

711
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:38,210
Are there new people?

712
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:43,680
Have they got realisation?

713
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,050
Warm.

714
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:55,830
Put the left to the right, you’ll be all
right.

715
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:58,600
Who’ll come, who..

716
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:05,090
These two are realised souls, aren’t they?

717
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:23,779
So they must, they must come and see here,
you see, come and see things there, come along,

718
01:08:23,779 --> 01:08:29,940
one or two, come along.

719
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:34,859
Come along, come along.

720
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:39,790
Put yourself into bandhan.

721
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:55,130
(Shri Mataji laughs) Now come along, make
effort, yesterday you asked Me that – come

722
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:56,560
along, make some efforts now.

723
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,270
With this gentleman first of all.

724
01:08:58,270 --> 01:08:59,400
Alright, try on her.

725
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:03,839
She too had hashish so better try on somebody
else.

726
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:04,930
Now you don’t do on that.

727
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:05,930
What about you?

728
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:06,930
Come along.

729
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:07,930
What’s … Don, allow these people to work
on you.

730
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:09,200
Come along, you, come along there.

731
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,260
Be careful Don.

732
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:12,271
Work on her, those people who have not had
hashish.

733
01:09:12,271 --> 01:09:22,030
Marcus had hashish (laughter, She laughs).

734
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:36,160
Oh I see, so did you smoke cigarettes?

735
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,750
Ah, you too.

736
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:42,190
Cigarettes and hashish.

737
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:44,480
What else?

738
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,779
That’s all?

739
01:09:46,779 --> 01:09:51,500
No, you have been smoking cigarettes and hashish.

740
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:55,810
Both you have smoked.

741
01:09:55,810 --> 01:10:04,220
Both have today also, before just coming before
here.

742
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,920
Constantly.

743
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:14,800
Alright, you put him left to the right, all
of you, come along.

744
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,860
You’ll be alright.

745
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:21,480
Once you’ll find your Self you won’t smoke,
at all.

746
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:43,650
You’ll enjoy your Self (…) You all go
up to the, you see, this place.

747
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:59,960
(Yogi says that a female seeker’s father
died)

748
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:07,710
Tell her to tell her father… she has to
tell the father that he shouldn’t worry

749
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:10,450
about her.

750
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:25,460
Did you ask the question?

751
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:29,130
Now are you better?

752
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:31,300
Not feeling much in the hands.

753
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,300
Alright.

754
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:33,300
Still.

755
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,060
Alright, just come, alright?

756
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:53,640
(Hindi. Then probably to a child) Sit down, sit down,
sit down, sit down.

757
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,030
Yes?

758
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:56,410
Good.

759
01:11:56,410 --> 01:11:57,410
Better now?

760
01:11:57,410 --> 01:12:01,060
Now rub My foot.

761
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:03,270
Now let’s see.

762
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:06,590
Yes, rub it.

763
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:09,900
Rub it hard.

764
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,110
Really hard.

765
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:15,430
Rub it hard.

766
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:16,530
Hard.

767
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:19,850
With your fingers.

768
01:12:19,850 --> 01:12:20,950
Hard.

769
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:23,160
You too.

770
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:43,520
Press with both the hands, press with both
the hands.

771
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:47,640
Void is caught, catching, Void, Void catches
with this one, the left Void.

772
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:48,640
Ah!

773
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,330
Are you relaxing now?

774
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:53,540
(Seeker says yes)

775
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:55,010
Very well.

776
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:59,440
(Seeker says he is feeling suspicious)

777
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:24,350
You are suspicious of?

778
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:34,610
(Seeker: And frightened)

779
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:38,510
Suspicious and?

780
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:40,480
(Seeker: And frightened)

781
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:41,480
Shri Mataji: Frightened of whom?

782
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:42,480
(Seeker: You)

783
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,480
Me?

784
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:44,480
Why?

785
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,480
I am not as bad as hashish is!

786
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,480
Why are you frightened of Me?

787
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,480
(Seeker: I had another guru)

788
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,480
Who is he?

789
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:49,480
(Maharaji)

790
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:50,480
Who’s Maharaji this… you were not suspicious
of him?

791
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:54,230
(I’m suspicious and over it)

792
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:59,800
That’s correct, that’s good, that’s
very good.

793
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:05,370
(It’s good to be suspicious of everybody)

794
01:14:05,370 --> 01:14:06,960
No, no.

795
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:16,690
You must know who is the right and who is
the wrong type.

796
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:18,220
If you are sensitive you will know yourself.

797
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:21,580
What do you expect is to get your own powers,
isn’t it?

798
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:28,560
To become your Self, that’s what should
help you – not all other tricks of giving experiences and this and that.

799
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,140
You have to become your Self.

800
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,140
Isn’t it?

801
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:33,630
Like all others said.

802
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:35,540
Now, there’s nothing to be suspicious about.

803
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:39,460
I have not taken any money from you, nothing.

804
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:41,590
Nothing selling here.

805
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:42,590
See?

806
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:43,590
Alright?

807
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:59,890
Now, you are asking for something great, something
Self-realisation I am talking about, no experiences,

808
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:02,790
it’s self-realisation.

809
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:04,240
Yes?

810
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:13,860
Now rub it on the Void, here.

811
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:14,860
(…)

812
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:19,510
Better now she?

813
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:21,400
Agya?

814
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:42,780
She’s never been to a guru she said.

815
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:48,550
You did some pranayama also?

816
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:49,550
Pranayama?

817
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:50,550
Breathing?

818
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:51,550
(Breathing, yes)

819
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:53,250
(To a child) Just see, just see!

820
01:15:53,250 --> 01:16:06,970
Is he alright?

821
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:07,970
Really?

822
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:09,870
Where is the problem?

823
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:10,870
Come, come, tell Me.

824
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:11,870
(Sahaja Yogi: Sahastrara catching)

825
01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:12,870
He said I’m doubting.

826
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:13,870
Suspicious.

827
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:14,870
(Yogi: Sahastrara, heart)

828
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:15,870
Heart also.

829
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:16,870
Hold your breath.

830
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:18,040
Good.

831
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:33,380
Again hold your breath, hold your breath.

832
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:48,720
(Yogi: The Sushumna has a hole…doesn’t
flow)

833
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,910
Hole?

834
01:16:50,910 --> 01:17:04,060
How long were you his disciple?

835
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:12,820
(Seeker: Four, five years)

836
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:24,520
And what did you get out of him?

837
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,520
What did you get?

838
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,520
Nothing.

839
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,520
(I never mistrusted him. I still don’t completely mistrust him.)

840
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:29,520
You do not mistrust him.

841
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:35,900
(No, because I don’t know if he has done
any harm and I don’t know if he does any harm)

842
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:39,270
He hasn’t said anything about hashish and
cigarettes and why you…

843
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:46,230
(Yes, he said I shouldn’t, it’s since
when I was first his devotee I didn’t smoke).

844
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:49,490
Now you started smoking after becoming his
devotee.

845
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:53,170
So this is the achievement.

846
01:17:53,170 --> 01:18:03,810
See, if you have found your Self you enjoy
your Self so much, alright?

847
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:12,620
That you just don’t run away from your Self,
minimum of minimum, that should happen to you.

848
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:17,320
(Yogi: Mooladhara.. And His Kundalini doesn’t move)

849
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,770
Doesn’t move?

850
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:23,830
(No, I can’t feel any movement, sorry)

851
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:24,830
See.

852
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:25,960
This Raktabija’s…
