1
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:25,323
One has to see how Shri Ganesha acts
within us.

2
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:34,974
It’s very important to recognise Him,
to understand Him and to imbibe,

3
00:00:35,175 --> 00:00:41,663
otherwise, you will be wasting all His
energies staying in this place,

4
00:00:41,864 --> 00:00:47,924
living in this place, so close to Him.

5
00:00:51,674 --> 00:00:55,414
And though He is the giver of wisdom,

6
00:00:55,615 --> 00:01:02,261
I wonder how many people understand
the word ‘wisdom’.

7
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:08,180
Wisdom is the centre of gravity within us

8
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:14,519
which gives us the fulcrum on which
we rotate,

9
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,870
by which we realise that we are inclined
to the left or to the right.

10
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:33,787
This fulcrum we have to be aware of,

11
00:01:33,988 --> 00:01:38,619
because otherwise we will not know
how far we have gone.

12
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:45,698
Not only [that], but you should know
that it is so much

13
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:53,826
the centre of gravity and our fulcrum
so close to it.

14
00:01:54,027 --> 00:02:00,503
Because if your centre of gravity and
fulcrum are separated,

15
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:07,341
there’s no integration. You can be ruined,
completely.

16
00:02:08,278 --> 00:02:17,391
So wisdom means this integration between
your understanding

17
00:02:17,902 --> 00:02:24,483
and the understanding of Shri Ganesha
within you.

18
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:31,171
Going to extremes has to be corrected
in you as well, you see,

19
00:02:31,372 --> 00:02:35,050
because if you get successful with your
this kind of planning,

20
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:37,967
then you’ll go on doing this kind
of artificial planning

21
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:41,227
and not the planning of the Divine.

22
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:47,116
The Divine has its own plans and we have
to feel the plans of the Divine.

23
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:51,971
It works it out. You are just an instrument
to work it out.

24
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:59,865
So if you try to do something of your own,
something too much,

25
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:06,302
then who is going to suggest you
the balance is Shri Ganesh.

26
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:10,773
And that balance, once it’s established
in you,

27
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:17,277
you know how you should balance yourselves
and how there is no alternative

28
00:03:17,478 --> 00:03:23,306
for Sahaj Yog, no alternative; one must
know.

29
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:27,187
Everything that is living has
no alternatives.

30
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:35,896
For example, if a mango tree says that,
“I will create a pomegranate,” it cannot!

31
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:41,624
There’s no alternative. Whatever is there,
it has to see and enjoy;

32
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:44,663
but not to force its way on it.

33
00:03:44,864 --> 00:03:48,301
This is one of the things we have to
understand

34
00:03:48,502 --> 00:03:52,357
to establish our wisdom.

35
00:03:53,353 --> 00:04:03,425
Because of our concept, our idea,
our anything,

36
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:11,878
even about God for example, about
our achievements itself,

37
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,965
can be absolutely wrong if we have
no wisdom.

38
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:25,984
But in nature, if you see, those who grow

39
00:04:26,185 --> 00:04:30,381
are never bothered about what shape
they are going to take, do they?

40
00:04:30,582 --> 00:04:36,988
Does a tree measure itself up to know how
many dimensions it is going to grow?

41
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:43,610
It grows as much as it can, slowly,
steadily,

42
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:48,914
in coordination with nature it is.

43
00:04:49,115 --> 00:04:59,566
Like that, the wisdom is the one
that understands.

44
00:05:01,173 --> 00:05:04,749
It is an establishment and a state
of mind, you see.

45
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:11,147
We can reach the state of being, when
you become wisdom.

46
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:20,597
Such a wisdom outside is also expressed
so beautifully.

47
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:27,263
Such a wisdom gives you a gentleman
and a gentlelady

48
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:37,708
only in a personality which is settled
down.

49
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:42,492
If you are frustrated with a certain
problem,

50
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:46,185
if you are unhappy, if you are suppressed,

51
00:05:46,386 --> 00:05:55,754
any extreme will not allow this flower
of wisdom to grow.

52
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,740
So even in frustration you have to look
back,

53
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,521
you have to stand back and see
for yourself,

54
00:06:01,722 --> 00:06:03,675
“Why am I to be so frustrated?”

55
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:11,490
Count your blessings one by one, count
your blessings one by one.

56
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:17,904
I’ll say again, count your blessings
one by one.

57
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:19,986
Once you start counting your blessings,

58
00:06:20,187 --> 00:06:26,490
you will find in such a short time, where
are you.

59
00:06:27,864 --> 00:06:31,101
Now the extreme projections of the mind
can take you to:

60
00:06:31,302 --> 00:06:37,501
“I’m not going to face!”; although you
would like to do it.

61
00:06:42,698 --> 00:06:51,492
But in wise projection, you can see this,
that you are what you have to be.

62
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:54,736
You are saints.

63
00:06:55,826 --> 00:07:00,990
But in possessiveness let us take the wise
path – wisdom;

64
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:06,897
logically, it has to be logical: what do we
possess in this world?

65
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:16,621
Just think of one thing that we can
possess.

66
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:20,532
Except for your own Spirit, you don’t
possess anything.

67
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:26,090
Except for your evolutionary development,
you don’t possess anything.

68
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:29,260
For example, now you are a saint you’ll be
born a saint always –

69
00:07:29,461 --> 00:07:33,990
this is what you possess. The rest
you don’t possess.

70
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:40,078
It’s logical, logical. You need not to be
realised to understand what I am saying.

71
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,939
So why should people here worry about
their possessions?

72
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:53,045
When you leave this worry, this is another
wisdom,

73
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:58,696
this is a higher wisdom, which you are
developing within yourself.

74
00:07:58,897 --> 00:08:03,680
And if we leave our possessions, our
material problems are solved.

75
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:05,785
This does not mean you throw them
in the sea,

76
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,639
but the attachment to that.

77
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:14,717
Then it is solved, already solved within
yourself.

78
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:20,526
So wisdom lies in seeing yourself also.

79
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:23,825
See how wisdom is so important.

80
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:29,298
Throughout if you find, in every chakra
resides pranava –

81
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:32,246
is the life of every chakra.

82
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:38,155
Because it is the wisdom that tells you
whether you are in a chakra or not.

83
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:43,242
So how wisdom is [so] important that you
even become a sakshi

84
00:08:43,443 --> 00:08:46,704
if you have wisdom, otherwise you cannot.
You become a witness only

85
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:56,149
when you have that focal point adjusted
to your centre of gravity.

86
00:08:58,874 --> 00:09:02,100
That is wisdom.

87
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:05,977
When people tell Me about somebody
who has harmed them,

88
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:11,011
they paint such a dark picture of the whole
thing,

89
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:18,008
as if it was the another war that was
fought.

90
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:21,837
Then you go and listen to another side,

91
00:09:22,038 --> 00:09:27,435
they paint another horrible picture
of this side.

92
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:33,117
Between these two pictures you stand.

93
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:38,821
You find the one is reflecting the other,
the other is reflecting the other.

94
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:48,902
There is no end to it, it’s eternally going
on from this to that, that to this.

95
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:55,069
How do you end it up?

96
00:09:55,836 --> 00:10:04,312
Only by your wisdom, by understanding
it’s an illusion.

97
00:10:04,513 --> 00:10:08,722
The main thing is the mirror on which
it is reflected,

98
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:15,260
is just an illusion that is appearing, and
we are worried about it.

99
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:19,798
The whole illusion will drop out as soon
as you just see the mirror

100
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:24,012
and don’t worry about the reflections.

101
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:31,927
They’ll come and go: it is for you just
to witness it, that’s all.

102
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:36,751
It's not - the mirror is a mirror, which is
a solid thing,

103
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:41,074
and all the reflections are illusions.

104
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:52,278
That's how we miss all the sweetness
of our own being.

105
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:03,170
Wisdom lies in understanding that you
are the Spirit.

106
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:09,058
You are not all these illusions, you are
the Spirit, you are the Spirit.

107
00:11:09,426 --> 00:11:12,683
So we have to only see to our evolving
force:

108
00:11:12,884 --> 00:11:15,712
are we nearer it or are we out of it?

109
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:23,927
Are we moving with our evolving force
or getting ourselves

110
00:11:24,128 --> 00:11:32,631
crucified with all these artificial
misidentifications that says that,

111
00:11:32,832 --> 00:11:37,250
“You are this, you are that, you are...”?
You are nothing but a seeker.

112
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:40,935
It's a category, I have told many- a-times,
that you are a seeker

113
00:11:41,136 --> 00:11:45,913
and you have to seek. Now, what do you
seek? Is your Spirit.

114
00:11:46,114 --> 00:11:50,249
And once you have found it, establish
yourself on that. That’s what you are!

115
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:56,721
And to know that you are that Spirit itself
is so satisfying;

116
00:11:56,922 --> 00:12:04,341
is itself emitting wisdom in you which is
so joy giving,

117
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:09,341
and is nothing but love. It’s love,
I tell you.

118
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,907
I mean, I cannot go beyond this.

119
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:19,540
There’s no word in human language to say
what is love.

120
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:27,137
To Me it is nothing but silence,
everything stops at that point.

121
00:12:27,338 --> 00:12:32,119
Just feel it within yourself; where
the wisdom becomes love,

122
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:39,523
and love becomes wisdom, that’s
the real integration of life.

123
00:12:39,724 --> 00:12:45,362
Open your hearts, allow Shri Ganesha

124
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:51,646
to be settled in that, that innocence
which enhances everything.

125
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:55,691
Look at the little ones, how they came
forward to give Me flowers:

126
00:12:55,892 --> 00:13:01,140
every step, every movement was so joyous,

127
00:13:01,341 --> 00:13:05,843
was creating such a beautiful, delicate
ripple in My heart.

128
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:10,492
And it’s written as history for Me,

129
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:17,559
to see these little, little sweet, innocent
Ganeshas coming forward.

130
00:13:17,945 --> 00:13:22,330
And the wisdom becomes so powerful,

131
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:27,048
that you know the source of love
as Ganesha in you.

132
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:34,234
For Him, He did not know anybody else but
one: that which is the source of love.

133
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,232
Never questioned, never argued:
no alternatives.

134
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:51,369
No new ideas came to His mind,
just taking in.

135
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:58,180
Working it out within yourself and
the whole thing just works out.

136
00:13:58,381 --> 00:14:02,400
The more you enter into it, you will
understand that you have really entered

137
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:06,607
into the Kingdom of God where He looks
after everything.

138
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:09,474
You want a house? All right, have it!
What do you want?

139
00:14:09,675 --> 00:14:13,587
You want that? All right, have it. You have
a problem? Have it.

140
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:17,880
It’s all God’s, the whole thing. Who owns
it but God?

141
00:14:18,081 --> 00:14:22,378
He is the One who owns everything and He’s
the One who enjoys everything.

142
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:26,079
And He wants you to enjoy everything.

143
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:32,488
Only through the power of wisdom that
you can achieve Me.
