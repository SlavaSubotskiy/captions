1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,430
and also the idea is to give more

2
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,989
encouragement to handicrafts and to art

3
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:26,250
because so many times have told that a

4
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:28,590
little of clay you can take and make it

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,860
into a beautiful thing which is worth

6
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,039
such a lot so why should we exhaust this

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:37,680
mother earth why not we have few

8
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:40,890
artistic nice things instead of I am so

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,440
many things but you should go in the

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,989
shops I don't get anything don't get

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,540
silly you cannot get this you cannot get

12
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,870
that so difficult to get anything

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:56,610
natural because people have only making

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:59,489
unnatural things whatever it is in that

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,440
also you should create beauty if you

16
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,890
start creating beauty then we'll try to

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,960
preserve it and use it sparingly instead

18
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,049
of having thousands of nonsensical

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,299
things everything is possible after

20
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,360
sometime we will have to have human

21
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,009
beings who are disposable you'll have to

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,229
dispose them off how will they live on

23
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,829
this earth if you do not understand that

24
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:27,779
we have to live it on this earth with

25
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:31,079
its limitations seven telling you many a

26
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:34,649
times take two artistic things take two

27
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:38,939
handmade things more two handmade don't

28
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:44,429
go too much at least even if you have to

29
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:48,529
buy something which is say artificial at

30
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:48,529
least see really that it is artistic

31
00:01:53,990 --> 00:02:02,420
so the once you have a great desire

32
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,909
today is the day they want the whole

33
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,920
world to pray for the preservation of

34
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:09,770
Mother Earth that's why I started this

35
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,190
topic that we should pray that we all

36
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:16,849
should develop art develop for ourselves

37
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:21,590
give as presents to others and also to

38
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:26,180
use artistic things made of artists we

39
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:34,220
can have few things but artistic which

40
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:36,489
expresses art not cheap things in the

41
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,890
whole of France

42
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:43,190
what I saw was that into everything

43
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:49,970
these plastics are scripted whether it

44
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:52,280
is God it can enter into everybody

45
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:57,620
everywhere except for the brains of

46
00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:03,140
human beings it's horrible so whatever

47
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:12,049
it is in that also see that you my

48
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:16,160
artistic things not plain horrible cheap

49
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:19,370
things all right so this is what we have

50
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,890
to today also you have to pray to me

51
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:26,900
when you are doing puja that our mother

52
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:29,989
our mother please save our earth give

53
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:33,620
people wisdom that they should behave

54
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:35,720
themselves and they should be conscious

55
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,709
and every sahaja yogi should be

56
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:43,970
conscious about how much energy he is

57
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:49,489
using of electricity of telephones or of

58
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:52,280
water or of anything we have to be

59
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:55,670
frugal about it if you do not take the

60
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,530
responsibility of these things then it

61
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,579
will not penetrate anywhere else so it

62
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,579
is for you to do

63
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:11,260
you have potato in your everyday life as

64
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:14,170
a part and parcel of your life that you

65
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,970
try to save the energy of this Mother

66
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,750
Earth

67
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,750
it's very important
