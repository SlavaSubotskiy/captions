00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,055
Having a Good Tongue

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,357
Delhi India, 2nd April 1976

3
00:00:02,582 --> 00:00:03,748
I was telling you about

4
00:00:03,897 --> 00:00:06,285
how difficult it is to be a Mother and a Guru,

5
00:00:08,261 --> 00:00:12,218
because both are very contradictory functions.

6
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:16,192
And specially for a person who wants to

7
00:00:16,997 --> 00:00:18,997
be in charge of your salvation,

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,880
to be the Moksha Dayini,

9
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:25,107
it is extremely difficult.

10
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:29,358
Because the path is so delicate and so treacherous

11
00:00:30,637 --> 00:00:34,923
that all of you have to come yourselves, walk across.

12
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:37,204
And if you

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,166
fall this side or that side there is disaster for you.

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,215
I am watching your climbing

15
00:00:45,385 --> 00:00:46,905
and I see you coming up

16
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:49,733
with a Mother’s heart

17
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:51,881
and a Guru’s hand.

18
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:57,948
And then I get the glimpses of people falling.

19
00:00:58,796 --> 00:01:00,796
I try to tell them "Come up!"

20
00:01:01,622 --> 00:01:02,690
Sometimes I shout.

21
00:01:03,332 --> 00:01:04,375
Sometimes I pull them up.

22
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,781
Sometimes I love them, caress them.

23
00:01:10,608 --> 00:01:12,608
You can yourself judge, within yourself,

24
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:14,880
how much I have worked on you,

25
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,806
how much I have loved you.

26
00:01:17,762 --> 00:01:20,290
But how much do you love yourself is the point.

27
00:01:21,857 --> 00:01:24,367
I have told you that for a Sahaja Yogi

28
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:28,847
the whole thing should be decided by the witnessing power.

29
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:32,206
Now the witnessing power is silent, it doesn’t talk,

30
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:34,729
if you are a very talkative person

31
00:01:35,653 --> 00:01:37,797
then it’s not going to help you much.

32
00:01:39,604 --> 00:01:41,048
You have to come in balance.

33
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:45,252
For the first time in this incarnation I have started talking

34
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:46,551
and I get throat trouble

35
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,806
because I’m not used to this kind of talking.

36
00:01:49,647 --> 00:01:50,681
So for you people,

37
00:01:50,763 --> 00:01:53,677
it is necessary that you should not talk

38
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,242
unless and until you feel like talking.

39
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,831
And very few sentences, conclusive.

40
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:03,055
As I told you before, the tongue

41
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,615
is the master of all the organs of distraction.

42
00:02:08,517 --> 00:02:10,788
If you could master your tongue,

43
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:15,856
you are master of all of them, in a way.

44
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:19,099
Because everything has to be palatable.

45
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:22,359
For example, you look at a woman,

46
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,667
if she’s not palatable

47
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:27,179
then she may be beautiful but you don’t want to look at her.

48
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:31,360
She decides, the tongue decides, about a person.

49
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,659
If you want to eat some food,

50
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:35,918
if it is not palatable

51
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:37,653
then you don’t want to eat that food.

52
00:02:38,113 --> 00:02:39,672
It has to be palatable.

53
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:43,484
Then a thought also,

54
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:46,279
a thought has to be palatable.

55
00:02:47,272 --> 00:02:49,567
If it is not palatable, you are not going to have it.

56
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:51,629
So the deciding factor is the tongue,

57
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:52,792
the roots of the tongue

58
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:54,564
goes up to the Vishuddhi chakra,

59
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:57,485
which controls your ego and superego,

60
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:58,415
or you can say that

61
00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:02,161
the tongue is reflected in superego and ego in a way.

62
00:03:06,796 --> 00:03:08,716
Through your tongue, when you speak,

63
00:03:08,904 --> 00:03:10,889
one can make out whether you are in the realm

64
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,207
of the ego or superego.

65
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:18,078
She expresses, she decides.

66
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:24,802
But if you understand her,

67
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:26,873
then you know how to handle her.

68
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:30,688
She’s your friend

69
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:37,384
and Saraswati Herself resides in your tongue.

70
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:44,421
If you know how to handle your tongue

71
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:52,499
then Sahaja Yoga can rise very hight up.

72
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:56,257
Because when others meet you, as Sahaja Yogis,

73
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,281
they also see how the way you talk,

74
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:07,946
the way you eat, the way that things are palatable to you.

75
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:14,884
It is the tongue that decides.

76
00:04:18,022 --> 00:04:20,225
If you are really very much evolved, you’ll be amazed

77
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:24,167
that if you eat some food somewhere, immediately the tongue

78
00:04:24,258 --> 00:04:25,743
will immediately throw it out.

79
00:04:26,522 --> 00:04:29,147
It won’t have it, if it is something wrong.

80
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,112
If some prasad, so-called, is given to you, which is

81
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:34,032
given by some wrong type of man,

82
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,827
immediately your tongue will throw it away.

83
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,811
It won’t be able to take it in.

84
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:42,214
And even if you take, somehow or other,

85
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:43,678
it’s forced down in the stomach,

86
00:04:44,094 --> 00:04:46,375
still the tongue will inform the brain that throw it out,

87
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:49,166
and the brain will inform the stomach that – throw it out.

88
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:51,104
It will be unpalatable.

89
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:53,655
So the action of Vishnu

90
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:56,886
in the stomach up to the action of Shri Krishna,

91
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,140
I mean, the same personality,

92
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,804
is all judged by your tongue.

93
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,561
So, you must know how pure,

94
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:04,427
holy, your tongue should be.

95
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:08,039
But when you take the name

96
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,033
of your Mother with this tongue,

97
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:16,330
you must know it has to be the holiest of holiest.

98
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:20,828
It is very important how you use your tongue.

99
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:27,045
Those who talk very bluntly

100
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:29,646
are just the same

101
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,957
as those who talk very sweetly,

102
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:40,471
to get something out of you is the intention.

103
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:46,326
As I have told you, it controls ego and superego.

104
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:49,288
Even if Sahaja Yogis

105
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:52,282
understand that the witness is also here,

106
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:53,651
at the Vishuddhi chakra.

107
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,552
So your witnessing powers

108
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,115
will increase and decrease

109
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:01,130
according to your tongue.

110
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:04,664
Of course it controls sixteen sub-plexuses.

111
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:07,137
It also controls the muscles of the eyes,

112
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:09,882
it controls all these muscles,

113
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,285
it controls the palate,

114
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,660
it controls the teeth.

115
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,854
It controls the ears.

116
00:06:18,923 --> 00:06:22,330
But ears, you hear something you cannot control it.

117
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:26,819
Tongue you can,

118
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,552
because that is the thing which releases,

119
00:06:30,712 --> 00:06:31,712
which goes out.

120
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,767
With the ear you cannot give anything to others.

121
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,676
That is just one way.

122
00:06:39,671 --> 00:06:40,893
This [tongue] is double way thing;

123
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,889
you take in something and also can throw out something,

124
00:06:47,225 --> 00:06:48,381
it has a double purpose.

125
00:06:49,781 --> 00:06:51,156
It is a very important organ.

126
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:53,560
And that’s why we have to look after our tongues.

127
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:56,824
When the Kundalini is rising

128
00:06:57,047 --> 00:06:58,473
that means one thing is there,

129
00:06:58,494 --> 00:07:00,473
that your attention has to become subtle.

130
00:07:01,277 --> 00:07:02,277
From gross to subtle.

131
00:07:03,446 --> 00:07:05,660
But it has to become subtler and subtlest

132
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:07,649
and then it has to go beyond that.

133
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:14,248
By becoming subtle only it comes up through the Agya.

134
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:19,405
Because Agya is just like a hole in a needle.

135
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,231
So it penetrates through that to the subtleness.

136
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,583
Because of that subtleness,

137
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:29,183
your attention sees everything,

138
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:30,522
but in a subtle form.

139
00:07:31,643 --> 00:07:33,590
Now, this is a new experience for you.

140
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:37,849
That’s why you do not recognise what is that.

141
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:45,373
In a group of Sahaja Yogis,

142
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,870
you can witness these things very carefully and clearly.

143
00:07:48,587 --> 00:07:49,663
There is one person

144
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,073
whose eyes are roving still, around.

145
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:55,815
He’s a Sahaja Yogi, he’s sitting down,

146
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:58,042
he’s looking here, looking there, looking that side,

147
00:07:58,051 --> 00:07:59,171
who is coming, who is going.

148
00:08:01,392 --> 00:08:04,000
Of course, this person is still in the gross state you can say,

149
00:08:04,104 --> 00:08:06,104
though he’s got his attention up here

150
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,965
by Mataji’s pulling it out,

151
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:09,492
you see, and hanging onto it!

152
00:08:09,826 --> 00:08:12,065
But still the person himself is

153
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,560
still dragging outside into the gross.

154
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:16,862
So don’t bother about that.

155
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:19,975
But even the person who is now, say, attentive,

156
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:24,013
you can say attentive, you see, because words are not so precise.

157
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,548
Even if you notice such a person, you’ll find

158
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,458
these two forces in a very subtle way are acting:

159
00:08:30,245 --> 00:08:33,399
one is his subtle ego, another is the subtle superego.

160
00:08:35,194 --> 00:08:36,418
When you become subtle,

161
00:08:36,731 --> 00:08:39,225
suddenly you get also powers of the subtle.

162
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,334
Let us see the ego side of it.

163
00:08:43,014 --> 00:08:46,908
You start feeling, inside yourself,

164
00:08:47,418 --> 00:08:48,500
in a very subtle way, that

165
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:50,283
you do not recognise that it is ego.

166
00:08:50,735 --> 00:08:52,563
It is too subtle to be recognised.

167
00:08:53,038 --> 00:08:55,670
That you have got powers now to cure.

168
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,340
You start feeling that now you have powers to raise the Kundalini.

169
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,891
See how it goes on segmenting into it.

170
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:05,854
Then you start feeling

171
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:07,716
you have powers to express yourself,

172
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:12,143
because you think that you have learnt Sahaja Yoga,

173
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:15,450
and now you know the essence of it and you can talk about it.

174
00:09:18,523 --> 00:09:20,523
This subtle ego develops into you

175
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:24,163
and the fourth type of subtle ego develops

176
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:27,484
when you see the other person’s superego is developing.

177
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:31,062
That is the most dangerous.

178
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,022
It so happens that some people,

179
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,412
who’s superego develops now, because they have had

180
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:40,623
previous gurus, previous problems,

181
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:41,693
previous…you see

182
00:09:41,718 --> 00:09:44,750
the way they have been following religion, some mistakes and all that.

183
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:48,152
Because of their mistakes, their superego develops.

184
00:09:49,913 --> 00:09:51,845
You see something happening to them,

185
00:09:53,304 --> 00:09:55,632
say Mr X he finds,

186
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,288
that a superego is coming onto him, some negativity is flowing into him.

187
00:10:00,255 --> 00:10:02,558
So, his ego starts developing against that, a force.

188
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,103
In a subtle way.

189
00:10:05,028 --> 00:10:07,819
Now he calls it a positive force, it is a positive force, sort of,

190
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:09,044
but he over-crosses it.

191
00:10:11,637 --> 00:10:13,290
When he over-crosses that side,

192
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,154
he decides to push a superego of another person,

193
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:18,493
he trips over.

194
00:10:20,023 --> 00:10:22,784
He thinks he’s doing the right thing, of course he is doing in a way,

195
00:10:23,514 --> 00:10:24,693
but to a point.

196
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:28,983
And then he becomes very hot-tempered.

197
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:32,565
He goes on passing remarks about others.

198
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:35,294
He says harsh things.

199
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,180
That’s how the subtlest point starts.

200
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:40,879
To a point is alright,

201
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:43,870
to a point because

202
00:10:44,986 --> 00:10:47,084
in this I would say Ganesh and

203
00:10:47,885 --> 00:10:52,063
Jesus should be treated as the judging points.

204
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:56,770
Christ did not mind when he was crucified.

205
00:10:57,227 --> 00:11:00,106
Not only that but he asked for forgiveness for all those.

206
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,880
But if His Mother was even touched by somebody,

207
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,295
he would have taken out his Eleven Rudras and killed them.

208
00:11:07,702 --> 00:11:08,702
That’s the point.

209
00:11:09,492 --> 00:11:11,103
When it comes to your Mother,

210
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:13,077
then of course,

211
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:15,977
your ego and superego both have a meaning.

212
00:11:16,461 --> 00:11:17,719
But beyond that,

213
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:20,401
if it starts directed at every Sahaja Yogi,

214
00:11:21,577 --> 00:11:23,577
then you don’t know where to go,

215
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:25,885
have the balance.

216
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:27,276
For example then,

217
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:28,523
such people, anything done

218
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:30,301
to them also they identify themselves with Mother

219
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:32,171
and they think, “No, no, he has said it to me then

220
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:34,199
he did it to Mother also.” It is not.

221
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:40,211
You must know where you are criticised

222
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:41,652
and where your Mother is criticised.

223
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,629
These are two things. That’s why I said judging point is Christ.

224
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,800
When he was crucified, he accepted it,

225
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:48,503
though he was so much one with his Mother.

226
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:51,057
But still he could strike that line.

227
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:55,722
When you are crucified, you are not Christ,

228
00:11:56,144 --> 00:11:58,330
but if anybody says anything against the Mother

229
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:00,202
then of course.

230
00:12:03,544 --> 00:12:05,984
Now try to understand yourself, now you’re watching yourself,

231
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:07,773
whatever I am saying you are watching yourself.

232
00:12:07,786 --> 00:12:08,786
It is for your good.

233
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:12,081
That is how you find, somewhere,

234
00:12:12,393 --> 00:12:15,677
a person who gets a superego invasion.

235
00:12:16,176 --> 00:12:17,705
First of all superego invasion is

236
00:12:17,756 --> 00:12:19,989
very, very deep and subtle. It’s extremely deep.

237
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:22,432
It comes into you in such a manner,

238
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:25,245
that you do not understand it.

239
00:12:25,554 --> 00:12:27,554
The other person who is very positive, so-called,

240
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:30,082
he’ll think that “That person has got a negativity.”

241
00:12:30,898 --> 00:12:32,602
But he won’t know that he’s over-crossing

242
00:12:32,622 --> 00:12:35,101
his positivity towards negativity itself!

243
00:12:35,116 --> 00:12:37,236
Because once you cross this line you go to this side.

244
00:12:37,418 --> 00:12:39,256
Once you cross this line you go to this side.

245
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:42,182
So immediately you are becoming negative once you cross

246
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:44,545
this point and it’s the Sahastrara, is the Brahmarandra.

247
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:47,171
Beyond the Brahmarandra, if you are pushing down,

248
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:50,374
then you are crossing to the other side.

249
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,349
You are playing into hands of other people.

250
00:12:57,726 --> 00:12:59,880
Now, you must judge yourself and see, “Now

251
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:01,695
Hello Mr X, how are you behaving now?”

252
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,159
Immediately you become a witness, you see, witness of yourself.

253
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:08,558
Now how the superego and ego, you see sometimes in

254
00:13:08,616 --> 00:13:10,275
in some people,

255
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:11,962
sometimes the ego presses the superego

256
00:13:12,064 --> 00:13:14,581
and the superego presses the ego.

257
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:15,694
I have seen it.

258
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,766
They don’t know whether they are egoistical

259
00:13:18,127 --> 00:13:21,904
or whether they are dominated.

260
00:13:22,641 --> 00:13:23,641
They really do not know,

261
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,054
they cannot decide.

262
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,685
Because it’s such a going on,

263
00:13:26,796 --> 00:13:27,796
wobbling all the time.

264
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,134
That’s why I say, “Baith jao”

265
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,684
you must sit down, settle down.

266
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,531
See for yourself. “Am I settled?”

267
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:35,246
Watch in yourself.

268
00:13:35,944 --> 00:13:37,430
Even you can feel the force,

269
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,816
actually you can feel the force moving from this side to this side.

270
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:41,528
You’ll feel the force moving from this side to this,

271
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:43,129
try to bring it in the centre.

272
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:46,369
Now, ego and superego,

273
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:49,562
when they go on like that,

274
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:52,494
you can say wobble from one to another,

275
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:55,324
it happens like this:

276
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:58,447
at one moment you start feeling dejected,

277
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,485
frustrated, fed up with yourself.

278
00:14:00,885 --> 00:14:01,885
“Nonsense! Get out!”

279
00:14:03,196 --> 00:14:04,676
The other moment you sit on yourself,

280
00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:06,565
sit on other people.

281
00:14:07,021 --> 00:14:08,093
You ask other to “Get out!

282
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:09,665
This is bad! I didn’t like that man,

283
00:14:09,735 --> 00:14:11,121
that fellow came, that fellow caught me,

284
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:12,824
this thing happened, that thing happened.”

285
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,160
Two extremes you move to.

286
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:18,170
That’s not the way to Sahaja Yoga.

287
00:14:19,015 --> 00:14:20,015
Sahaja Yoga.

288
00:14:20,372 --> 00:14:23,294
Saha-ja means that you are a witness.

289
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:25,499
Saha-ja.

290
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:26,374
It has double meaning.

291
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,981
Sahaja is normally used for a word which is simple.

292
00:14:29,777 --> 00:14:31,133
Sahaj. You are in a Sahaj method,

293
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,670
means you are a witness, you watch it.

294
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:33,767
Look at these trees,

295
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:35,975
they are just witnessing,

296
00:14:36,988 --> 00:14:38,148
they are not saying anything,

297
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:40,371
they are just there.

298
00:14:40,877 --> 00:14:41,877
It is to be.

299
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,003
It is just to be at this point.

300
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:49,997
Are we that? Every moment, dealing with anything.

301
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:52,059
Then you will not have any organisational problems.

302
00:14:52,218 --> 00:14:53,651
You have organisational problems

303
00:14:54,156 --> 00:14:55,441
because you are not a witness.

304
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,361
You’ll find two types of people.

305
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:00,278
One who will say, “I’m suffering too much”,

306
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,114
the others who will say, “No, not me!”

307
00:15:02,688 --> 00:15:03,881
Then they interchange also.

308
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,663
You see, their attitudes interchange, it’s absurd.

309
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:12,573
But you can just know where to stop it

310
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:16,118
and become a witness, silent.

311
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:22,123
After talking for one minute, you just become silent.

312
00:15:23,503 --> 00:15:26,744
That’s the best way, I think, I can say – a practical way.

313
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:31,124
Is for your tongue, is to be silent.

314
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:34,517
As far as possible to be silent and be watching.

315
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,981
But some people are silent and brooding,

316
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:39,112
that’s the worst thing that you are doing.

317
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,311
No! Silent and watching.

318
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,545
Neither brooding, not planning how to hurt others,

319
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,340
and then suddenly your sentences will come out

320
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:52,413
which would be so filthy, so cutting,

321
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:57,948
so horrid, so full of venom,

322
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:01,657
that you think, “From where it has come? Oh God!”

323
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,126
Such silence is absolutely useless.

324
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:08,400
It should be like a river flowing.

325
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,525
The river has its own depth

326
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:14,460
and on top it is flowing, it’s just one mast.

327
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:18,242
That kind of a silence one should have.

328
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,259
Not a forced one but a silence of a witness.

329
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,964
Even such a person is talking inside, the flow of the silence,

330
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:28,842
you are one with that silence, it is filling you up all the time.

331
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:30,778
And you can witness that in every leaf,

332
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:34,492
in every movement of the leaf, you see the silence moving.

333
00:16:35,303 --> 00:16:38,537
They do not speak, but they manifest it.

334
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:41,737
In the same way you do not speak, you manifest.

335
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:44,816
Of course, human beings are higher than them because they speak,

336
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,918
but if speech becomes a burden,

337
00:16:49,256 --> 00:16:53,187
a problem, a cutting instrument, it is better not to speak.

338
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:58,937
Another thing a Sahaja Yogi must know,

339
00:16:59,414 --> 00:17:02,717
that eyes are very important for Sahaja Yoga.

340
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:03,928
When the Kundalini rises,

341
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:07,126
then the dilatation of the pupils takes place, because

342
00:17:07,455 --> 00:17:09,657
you have seen the children how their eyes are dilated.

343
00:17:09,682 --> 00:17:13,078
Just gaping at everything, what is happening.

344
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:17,495
Just gaping, silence, complete.

345
00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:20,434
Silent seeing goes on through the eyes.

346
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:22,641
And that’s why eyes are very important.

347
00:17:22,993 --> 00:17:25,906
You must learn to fix your eyes within yourself, in your heart.

348
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:27,191
Humble down, in your heart!

349
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:29,257
Fix your eyes in your heart!

350
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,417
I say that way, but I don’t know if you can do it.

351
00:17:33,323 --> 00:17:34,491
I don’t know if you can do it,

352
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:36,986
but if you could do it that’s a very good way of doing things.

353
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:39,455
Looking at everyone, gazing at everyone,

354
00:17:39,763 --> 00:17:40,779
seeing this, seeing that,

355
00:17:41,178 --> 00:17:43,289
is a very bad exercise for your eyes,

356
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:44,788
it’s a very bad habit.

357
00:17:45,182 --> 00:17:48,044
Try to keep your eyes low, on the earth, Mother Earth,

358
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:54,349
watching the lower part of the body than the face.

359
00:17:54,426 --> 00:18:00,553
Because face, if you are made that way

360
00:18:01,048 --> 00:18:02,691
that you can watch the faces is all right

361
00:18:02,711 --> 00:18:03,928
but you are not yet made.

362
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:06,089
Best thing is to see to the feet.

363
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:11,240
And your eyes will touch their gross sense, feet,

364
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:17,129
from where the sensation of vibrations go up,

365
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,922
upward, and the Kundalini rises better.

366
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:25,962
Actually those who suffer from low Kundalini rising,

367
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:30,346
if they could rub oil on their feet and wash their feet,

368
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,166
it’s a very good thing.

369
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:35,856
That’s why Christ washed the feet of his disciples.

370
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,347
I wish I could do that if you allow Me, in public,

371
00:18:38,835 --> 00:18:41,101
because the whole grossness is in the feet

372
00:18:41,383 --> 00:18:45,426
and if you touch somebody with your eyes,

373
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:47,280
realised people I am saying.

374
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,162
Their feet, most of their grossness will disappear.

375
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:53,718
And you won’t have that much problem with them.

376
00:18:53,746 --> 00:18:56,631
That’s why Christ washed the feet of His disciples.

377
00:18:57,742 --> 00:19:00,295
You also wash your feet and keep them clean,

378
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,666
so that the grossness drops out.

379
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:10,357
I have explained

380
00:19:12,103 --> 00:19:14,996
in brief way, but if you want to ask Me questions, ask,

381
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,022
because still I find that the Sahaja Yogis

382
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:20,732
are not rising as fast as they could.

383
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:23,293
Because

384
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,525
bringing Kundalini up to this, and up to this is possible for Me,

385
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,806
but taking it back into your gross being, is your own job

386
00:19:30,953 --> 00:19:31,963
which you have to do it.

387
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:37,011
In Marathi as they say, “Da adi karatza maga paiya” –

388
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:38,956
I have built the top, the dome for you,

389
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:42,003
and the dome is now to be supported by you.

390
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,499
I have taken you to the dome,

391
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,510
but you cannot bring it down,

392
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:49,360
because either you are frustrated with yourself,

393
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:51,699
by being frustrated what are you going to gain?

394
00:19:52,606 --> 00:19:54,606
Or else, you are frustrated with others.

395
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,586
Just be silent and be witnessing.

396
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:07,763
As Sai Baba has said, saburi, patience, it comes in.
