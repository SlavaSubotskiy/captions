1
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,124
Today is the first day we are having this puja

2
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,541
in this country of Austria.

3
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,208
This country is

4
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:05,792
an historical country with different upheavals

5
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,042
it has gone through

6
00:01:12,124 --> 00:01:14,792
to learn so many lessons in life.

7
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:22,416
But human beings are such that

8
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:27,083
they do not relate the calamities with their mistakes.

9
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:30,416
That's how they go on repeating

10
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,875
the same mistakes again and again.

11
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:40,042
The visit to Vienna was overdue

12
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,291
and I came on a day when we had

13
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:48,875
to celebrate the birthday of Machindranath.

14
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:59,875
It's very auspicious for all of you that he should

15
00:02:00,124 --> 00:02:06,458
be today complete his one year of life.

16
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,875
I bless him with all the flowers,

17
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:23,291
the choicest flowers, of beauty

18
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:27,166
and bliss on him, and his family,

19
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:30,124
all his relations and his family.

20
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,166
There are so many things which have been done for the first time.

21
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:48,500
I should say, for the first time I've come to Vienna,

22
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,500
to Austria,

23
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:59,249
and first time I've come to the birthday of a child,

24
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,082
on his first birthday.

25
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,124
And on an Ashtami, that is today,

26
00:03:08,124 --> 00:03:10,625
is the eighth day of the moon,

27
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:16,958
"of the moon which is increasing, shuklapakshi"

28
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:23,875
that first time all the weapons of the Goddess

29
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,541
are to be worshipped.

30
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:35,166
This was a great idea because these weapons

31
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:39,416
who work all the time,

32
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:45,416
not only to kill the evil

33
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,750
but to protect the good,

34
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,291
"were never worshipped before

35
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,750
and that today,"

36
00:03:55,082 --> 00:03:57,374
if human beings realize

37
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,249
their importance and significance,

38
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:08,082
then lots of problems of atomic bombs

39
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,249
and all these things that have been created

40
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,500
could be solved by diverting them

41
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,374
to the right direction,

42
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:20,333
using them for the destructions

43
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:27,124
"of the evil forces and not the good;"

44
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,708
also for protecting human life,

45
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,917
nourishing human life.

46
00:04:44,374 --> 00:04:47,917
The same weapons can be used in a wrong direction,

47
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,374
but, rightly used,

48
00:04:52,708 --> 00:05:00,500
they can be dedicated for the use of God's work.

49
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:06,042
All that is created by human beings,

50
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,042
which looks apparently

51
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:20,458
an instrument of destruction,

52
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:25,792
but if human beings use their wisdom

53
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,708
they will find out

54
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:35,500
that all these inventions that have come to them

55
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:42,625
from the prompting of the Unconscious,

56
00:05:43,374 --> 00:05:46,666
are for the work of God.

57
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,792
All scientific research,

58
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:52,249
everything that has been done,

59
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,708
all these instruments that you have produced,

60
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:59,249
are for the use of God.

61
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,124
In a way we can say

62
00:06:02,124 --> 00:06:06,000
that human beings have worked

63
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:13,249
to create methods as instruments,

64
00:06:16,374 --> 00:06:22,166
as social, economic, political institutions

65
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:32,082
to advance the mechanism of God's work.

66
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,666
The Unconscious has worked through human beings.

67
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,333
All these institutions,

68
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,917
if they are put to the right side

69
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:52,291
of their activity and not to the hellish activity,

70
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:58,666
they all can join together

71
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:05,708
to complete the work of the Divine.

72
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:15,083
Like, in the East people believe

73
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:20,500
that God has created this beautiful body of human beings

74
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,666
and it is for human beings

75
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:33,208
to create beautiful artistic clothes to enhance the beauty

76
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,708
of what God has created,

77
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:39,249
to glorify the beauty of what God has created,

78
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:45,416
to respect the beauty that God has created.

79
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,416
And that's what has happened

80
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,792
in many spheres of life, of human activities,

81
00:07:56,792 --> 00:08:00,000
and should have happened in all of them

82
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,792
if they had used their wisdom.

83
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:13,792
The question of knowledge

84
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,917
that I discussed before

85
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,875
is very important to understand.

86
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,416
The knowledge that was forbidden

87
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,500
once upon a time, as Adam and Eve,

88
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:33,625
has been a big problem for human beings to understand.

89
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,583
It was the case when

90
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:42,458
God created human beings first time,

91
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:47,458
apart from the celestial beings, who were perfect,

92
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:51,583
that He wanted to see

93
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,124
if these human beings could grow

94
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:59,458
in their population and in their awareness,

95
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,917
in their innocence,

96
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:09,917
they would become Self Realized.

97
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:16,042
But it was an experiment,

98
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:20,124
and the human beings failed God at that time,

99
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:25,124
because they listened to baser promotions

100
00:09:25,374 --> 00:09:26,291
or baser prompting.

101
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,917
That's how they failed

102
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,166
and they lost their innocence.

103
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:47,833
And loss of innocence is the sin

104
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:51,124
which was first committed,

105
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,042
and that sin took a different turn

106
00:09:58,249 --> 00:10:00,042
for human beings.

107
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:04,124
Now, that knowledge, what I've said,

108
00:10:04,124 --> 00:10:06,750
is not this real knowledge.

109
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,583
That was the avidya, the artificial knowledge,

110
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,374
the knowledge that "I am something,"

111
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:19,833
that "I am the doer", the ego."

112
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:25,374
Till the animal stage there was no ego,

113
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,833
and then the ego started growing.

114
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,583
We can say that's the beginning

115
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,249
of the original sin:

116
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:35,374
that "I am something.

117
00:10:35,374 --> 00:10:37,374
I am doing something."

118
00:10:37,374 --> 00:10:40,249
"It's I who can do it". All right?"

119
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:41,416
So God said,

120
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,917
"Let's see. Let's see their little courage,

121
00:10:46,124 --> 00:10:48,083
and let them decide."

122
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:51,042
So the plans were changed,

123
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,416
one had to think now that we should

124
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,291
get incarnations on this earth

125
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:01,416
to help these people, to guide them,

126
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,917
to put them into balance,

127
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:08,416
to put them into proper understanding of dharma,

128
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:15,208
so they keep to that balance.

129
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:20,833
But every time this "I" refused to accept the balance.

130
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:28,249
And this "I" goes very far from reality.

131
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:34,374
Today also, when we come to Sahaja Yoga,

132
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:36,833
I see people,

133
00:11:37,374 --> 00:11:39,625
they don't grow very fast.

134
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:43,249
Because of this "I" they have questions,

135
00:11:44,124 --> 00:11:48,082
they have doubts, they have problems.

136
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,708
Because of this original sin

137
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,708
people cannot grow very fast.

138
00:11:57,042 --> 00:12:00,374
That, "I am the one, I am free.

139
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,833
Why that? Why this?"

140
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,958
Who are you to ask questions?

141
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,750
Who has made you?

142
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,124
Have you made yourself?

143
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:13,958
What did you do to become a human being?

144
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:18,291
Why this kind of egoistical behavior towards God?

145
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,124
"Why God has made us? Why this thing?"

146
00:12:21,124 --> 00:12:23,833
Who are you to ask any question?

147
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,708
But it is so, the questioning goes on,

148
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,708
and such people are very dangerous

149
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,833
for Sahaja Yoga.

150
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:38,374
If they have to come for puja, I'm worried,

151
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,374
not because anything will happen to puja,

152
00:12:41,374 --> 00:12:44,333
but we may lose them completely.

153
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,917
Such egoistical stupid people get lost.

154
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:52,208
As a mother I have simple compassion and love for them,

155
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:58,000
and I feel sad that they could have been saved.

156
00:12:58,249 --> 00:13:00,666
But this questioning mind of theirs

157
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,541
can drown them.

158
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,666
This is the basic original sin

159
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,333
that human beings have created.

160
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,458
Apart from that,

161
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,666
we had problem that we have come

162
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,333
from animal stage to this stage.

163
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:22,541
So there are animal brutal conditionings within you.

164
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:27,333
Then we have gone through other conditionings,

165
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:32,708
which were created in the history

166
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,208
by the same mister "I"

167
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:37,708
who has started institutions,

168
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,333
who started organizing religions.

169
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,000
For example, take Christianity.

170
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:47,583
Christ came here to break your ego.

171
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,541
On the contrary, people built a big ego out of it.

172
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,500
Now, there are some Sahaja Yogis

173
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,500
who believe that

174
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,166
Sahaja Yoga is a Christian Sahaja Yoga

175
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,124
or a Hindu Sahaja Yoga.

176
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:05,416
Still that lingers on, that lingers on,

177
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,291
that it is a Christian Sahaja Yoga.

178
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,124
"For Christians it has to be Christian Sahaja Yoga"

179
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,625
for Hindus it should be a Hindu Sahaja Yoga.

180
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,166
"For Muslims it is a Muslim Sahaja Yoga;

181
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,750
it must relate to Islam,"

182
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,000
because they can't get out of their own conditioning,

183
00:14:22,249 --> 00:14:23,625
so it must relate to that,

184
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,833
it must explain everything that is there.

185
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,000
They can't get out, you see?

186
00:14:28,249 --> 00:14:30,500
It could be also a Catholic Sahaja Yoga

187
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
or a Protestant Sahaja Yoga.

188
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,124
Could be even deeper than that.

189
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,124
Like that, you see, it goes on.

190
00:14:37,124 --> 00:14:39,042
So, you pull Sahaja Yoga

191
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:40,583
into your own categories,

192
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,166
into your own small little cups.

193
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,000
But it's just the other way round.

194
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,249
Sahaja Yoga is the ocean, is a universal thing,

195
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:51,833
it is a MahaYoga.

196
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:54,416
"It is not meant for Christians, Hindus, Muslims"

197
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:59,042
it is meant for human beings as they were.

198
00:15:00,124 --> 00:15:02,750
Have you got animals who are Christians,

199
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,708
Hindus or Muslims?

200
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,708
This all comes because of the original sin only,

201
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,124
that we are something, we are Christians,

202
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:12,416
we are Hindus, we are Muslims.

203
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,166
In Sahaja Yoga, one has to understand

204
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,583
that all the rivers, whether it is the River Ganges

205
00:15:19,124 --> 00:15:20,875
or the River Yamuna

206
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:23,042
or it is the River Thames

207
00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:25,124
or River Danube, any river,

208
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:29,082
that all of them flow into the same ocean and become the ocean.

209
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,541
They say that when all the rivers

210
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,291
flow in the River Ganges,

211
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:37,374
they are all called as Surasari, means "the River of the Gods."

212
00:15:37,374 --> 00:15:40,083
No more people call them by the different names

213
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:43,541
of the tributaries that are there.

214
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,416
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga is the ocean.

215
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,875
You cannot name it.

216
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:52,500
Do not try to find its identity with other things.

217
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,750
If you start doing that, then your mind

218
00:15:55,082 --> 00:15:59,750
will start becoming that small little cup.

219
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:04,042
And moreover, if you are coming from some organized religions,

220
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:06,958
its very important to understand that organized religions

221
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,917
make your cup even stronger, it doesn't dissolve.

222
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,541
If it is a disorganized religion,

223
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,708
then it is a cup of earthenware,

224
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,541
which can dissolve into this ocean.

225
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:19,249
But if it is a solid, nice porcelain,

226
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:23,958
Meissen, there is no possibility.

227
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,124
Then you are adhering to all that conditioning,

228
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:31,374
all that solidness, and then it's very difficult.

229
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,958
All the time you have to bring in Christ

230
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:36,208
or you have to bring in Mohammad

231
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,083
or you have to bring in Zoroaster,

232
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:42,208
or someone like that who should be there to guide you.

233
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:45,249
Now your guidance is your Spirit,

234
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:46,833
which is unlimited,

235
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,042
so you don't have to bring any one of Them.

236
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,458
They are all within you.

237
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,500
They are all part and parcel of you.

238
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,625
But to stick on to one person is again

239
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,625
a sign that you are not expanding.

240
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:01,458
You know that you are all.

241
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,833
You have got Shri Krishna within you, who is awakened,

242
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,541
you have got Christ within you,

243
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:08,249
you have got Ganesha within you,

244
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,458
you have got Brahmadeva within you,

245
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:12,792
and you have got Mohammad within you.

246
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,416
"And you have got all of Them:

247
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,541
Moses, everyone, within you"

248
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,583
so how can you be identified with one person?

249
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,458
The reason is, you are still conditioned,

250
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:26,416
and you want to drag it into your own conditioning.

251
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:34,000
So try to bring it at a position where there is no conditioning.

252
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,833
We can see our conditioning worse works so much

253
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,042
with our style because,

254
00:17:40,374 --> 00:17:50,291
as human beings, we have a habit of forming a closed sect,

255
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,875
"whether it is ourselves,

256
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:56,166
first we close ourselves as "I." "I am XYZ."

257
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,291
Then we can club together as,

258
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:05,291
say, "We are, say, people who use fork and knives".

259
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,833
There could be people who just use

260
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,208
the fork and knives this way can be clubbed together,

261
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,374
the others who use this way can be another way.

262
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,082
See, it goes on like that,

263
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,917
all kinds of stupidity

264
00:18:17,124 --> 00:18:18,833
that human beings have to club together.

265
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,416
All right, use the way you like, makes no difference.

266
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:25,208
You eat the same food, it digests the same way, it works the same.

267
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,583
But as far as the outside is concerned,

268
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,458
when it comes to human activity,

269
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,500
they will use the fork and spoon in a different way,

270
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,708
somebody will use their hands, fingers,

271
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,917
and somebody will, I don't know, may use daggers.

272
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:40,042
I don't know how they can manage to go to what limit.

273
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,708
So, this is what it is.

274
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:46,750
In doing something, in doing any activity,

275
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:51,124
then only human beings make it a closed circuit,

276
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,958
that "This is how we do it. This is how they do it,"

277
00:18:54,249 --> 00:19:00,583
how it is, the method of another party or people.

278
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,249
This groupism is the worst of all,

279
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:07,082
and is against the laws of nature.

280
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:12,208
You can be individual, as far as your appearance is concerned,

281
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:20,083
as far as your hair color is concerned,

282
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,124
or your eye color is concerned

283
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,458
that's that God has created you that way.

284
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:29,083
But all other things that you have created are dead.

285
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:33,083
All other clubbing methods you have created

286
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:36,750
are absolutely of no value.

287
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,458
They are just mythical.

288
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:40,792
There's nothing truth in it,

289
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:43,291
nothing that should be worthy considering.

290
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,333
It is just a myth!

291
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,583
So one has to understand that there is nothing

292
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:52,666
like a Sahaja Yoga which is a Christian Sahaja Yoga,

293
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,666
Sahaja Yoga which is a Protestant Sahaja Yoga

294
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,583
or a Catholic Sahaja Yoga.

295
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,291
I find this at a very subtle point,

296
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,792
where people talk of collectivity,

297
00:20:04,082 --> 00:20:06,958
that they don't understand that we are not collective,

298
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,750
because we have so many tags,

299
00:20:10,082 --> 00:20:11,625
you see, attached to us,

300
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:18,082
like the conditionings of our own doings.

301
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,083
It could be in Switzerland,

302
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,750
it could be in Austria,

303
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,792
it could be in Rome, or it could be in India, anywhere.

304
00:20:26,082 --> 00:20:28,082
These conditionings, we have to get rid of.

305
00:20:28,082 --> 00:20:30,958
We should know we are human beings, created by God,

306
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:36,792
and whatever is within us that is real, created by Him,

307
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:41,249
is the only thing that we have to be

308
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,208
and all the rest of conditionings

309
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,082
we should try to get rid.

310
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:48,042
Everything is complementary.

311
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:50,374
From this place you have to learn something,

312
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,458
from that place you have to learn something.

313
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,333
Every place has something to learn

314
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:58,500
and to understand.

315
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:03,166
And there is nothing that can be retained

316
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:07,000
by some people as something higher or lower.

317
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:10,583
But of course, where this ego has developed more,

318
00:21:11,082 --> 00:21:13,500
this original sin has developed more,

319
00:21:14,082 --> 00:21:15,833
there is a possibility

320
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:22,166
that such human beings must have created more conditioning.

321
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,792
Naturally the conditioning is much more.

322
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:29,208
Or where they have been not at all moving

323
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,249
about religion,

324
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:34,333
about God, and have been sticking on,

325
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,082
like, you can say, in Africa and all these places,

326
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,333
could be that the conditioning

327
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:43,792
could have been by the other forces,

328
00:21:44,082 --> 00:21:47,082
called as Adibhautik,

329
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,666
means the ones which are created

330
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,666
out of what God has created.

331
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,541
Like, if they see the moon,

332
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:57,541
they are afraid of the moon,

333
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:58,875
if they see the trees,

334
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,875
they are afraid of the trees.

335
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:05,792
Sort of a mythical ideas about the nature itself.

336
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,666
See, so there are two styles,

337
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,208
as you always know.

338
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,917
One is where they create mythical ideas

339
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,541
about the nature,

340
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:18,917
the mythical side of nature,

341
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,166
that is Adibhautik

342
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:24,000
and Adidaivik are the mythical ideas

343
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,083
about what you can produce,

344
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:32,166
you are God, you are the devas,

345
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:33,792
and you want to create this.

346
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:35,416
"I'm this, I'm that."

347
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:39,166
So there are two types of conditionings which work out,

348
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,500
and in modern times it is such a confused thing

349
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,583
that both these sides,

350
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,625
I don't know where they act.

351
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:49,166
For example, the other day I was coming

352
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:55,458
near the cemetery in Vienna,

353
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,082
and I was amazed that it was a cemetery

354
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:01,249
but it was catching on right Swadisthana.

355
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:03,917
So I said, "All the bhoots must be acting now,

356
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:06,374
because I can't understand how can

357
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:10,666
a cemetery have a right Swadisthana?"

358
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,208
This is how it can be explained,

359
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,374
that all the bhoots are now active,

360
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,708
or maybe they are again born, you see.

361
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,792
They must have been dead hundreds of times,

362
00:23:20,042 --> 00:23:21,666
they must have created graves after graves

363
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,833
and only there are empty graves, and they are active now.

364
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:27,124
Or maybe that the bhutas themselves are active,

365
00:23:27,124 --> 00:23:28,166
they are no more there,

366
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:30,833
they have all disappeared from there. It could be that.

367
00:23:31,124 --> 00:23:33,374
So we have to judge now on vibrations

368
00:23:33,374 --> 00:23:35,082
and not on our understanding

369
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:39,124
or what we think or what we understand

370
00:23:39,124 --> 00:23:40,374
through this brain.

371
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:44,500
By asking questions and by talking too much about it,

372
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,374
you cannot understand Sahaja Yoga.

373
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,082
For Sahaja Yoga you have to have

374
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,875
that super state of mind,

375
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,875
where you can receive vibrations,

376
00:23:52,124 --> 00:23:54,500
can feel vibrations and have to be

377
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,374
absolutely compromised on them.

378
00:23:57,374 --> 00:24:02,458
If there is still the tag of that ego so much

379
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,416
that you still question Sahaja Yoga

380
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:06,541
and think no end of yourself,

381
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:08,124
it is better that such a person

382
00:24:08,124 --> 00:24:10,042
should not attend the pujas,

383
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:12,875
not attend the pujas. It is kind to himself.

384
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,917
It is being nice to himself that

385
00:24:14,917 --> 00:24:17,917
such a person who has doubts should not attend a puja,

386
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,000
because puja is only meant for people

387
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,708
who have achieved, received that state of mind

388
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,917
which is called as Nirvikalpa,

389
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:27,750
where there is no vikalpa, where there is no doubt in your mind.

390
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,625
If there are still doubts in your mind,

391
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:32,666
your mind is still very powerful,

392
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,625
and it is going to put you down.

393
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:37,833
So either before puja you tell your mind to keep quiet.

394
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:40,124
"Tell him not to talk now,

395
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:43,708
Better keep quiet, now I have to ascend"

396
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,792
and I have to receive the blessings of the Divine.

397
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:50,124
"So just keep quiet, and if you cannot keep quiet

398
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:53,374
then I cannot ascend."

399
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:56,458
I have told you many a times it is like a donkey,

400
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:59,208
mind is just like a donkey.

401
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,458
If you go behind the donkey, it kicks you,

402
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,083
it will tell you,

403
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:07,083
"that you are the bad man, you are the worst man"

404
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,083
all the self-pity will come into you.

405
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:11,875
If you go ahead with the donkey,

406
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:15,583
then he'll put his ears to you, you can hold him like an ego, you see.

407
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:18,541
You can go wherever you want, do what you like, "What's wrong?"

408
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,416
It will not control you.

409
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:22,500
If you sit on top of the donkey

410
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,500
it will still play about with you, to see how you work out.

411
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:31,333
So if you allow the mind to go here and there,

412
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:34,792
through your eyes or through your attention, or anywhere,

413
00:25:35,124 --> 00:25:38,208
or through your tongue or your senses, it will say, "All right."

414
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:40,458
It will eat the grass on the sides, it won't move.

415
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,875
It will move this side, eat some grass, that side.

416
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,792
Gregoire: At this stage, as You speak about it,

417
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:46,833
should I quickly translate for the French

418
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:48,166
who don't understand English?

419
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,625
Oh, you want to translate the whole thing?

420
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,124
Gregoire: I can in two minutes.

421
00:25:51,124 --> 00:25:53,333
I think later on, Gregoire, would be better,

422
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:57,792
if you could translate, because the flow is better now all right?

423
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:06,249
So this donkey, the donkey wants to eat the grass.

424
00:26:06,249 --> 00:26:08,917
He knows that you don't mind him eating the grass.

425
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:10,708
All right, it goes round, eats grass,

426
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:13,042
all sorts of dirt, filth, whatever it is.

427
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:15,833
Whatever you allow he eats, goes on eating,

428
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:17,708
all filthy things, all filthy thoughts,

429
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,875
all dirty thoughts and every sort of thing,

430
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:21,500
without questioning, you see?

431
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,625
Only in Sahaja Yoga they come here and question,

432
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,374
but not when they have to eat filth and dirt and all kinds

433
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:31,042
of unholy things and sinful things, they never question.

434
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,249
Then they'll say, "What's wrong?"

435
00:26:33,249 --> 00:26:36,166
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga they will question.

436
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:38,458
Which is the holiest of holy?

437
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:41,166
Which is the greatest of greatest?

438
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,166
Only these gates are open to you.

439
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:46,249
That's how you get it otherwise it is not,

440
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,750
it's prohibited to all the people to achieve this.

441
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:59,042
The water that washes My feet is the ambrosia,

442
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:02,249
is the tirtha,

443
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:06,082
which was even prohibited to doctors in olden days.

444
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,291
Vaidyas were not allowed, and they had to fight for.

445
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:11,625
Only the Gods were allowed to drink it.

446
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,291
Only the Gods were allowed to drink it.

447
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:16,708
Today you are placed at the position of Gods.

448
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:19,166
But are you capable of that?

449
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,124
Are you deserving that?

450
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:23,833
Or you are still questioning,

451
00:27:24,082 --> 00:27:26,249
you have still problems?

452
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:29,166
Then it is better you are prohibited.

453
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:33,708
It's a rare thing that you should take that ambrosia.

454
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:36,541
It's in the Devi Purana Bhagavatam,

455
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:39,666
if you read, that they were prohibited to take it.

456
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,042
So this is what it is,

457
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:44,166
that the mind goes like a donkey.

458
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:49,583
But if the donkey knows the one who is the rider,

459
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:52,333
knows his ways,

460
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:55,291
and he knows how to control the mind

461
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:57,958
and he knows where it has to work,

462
00:27:57,958 --> 00:28:01,042
the same donkey, the same instruments,

463
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:02,249
the same institutions,

464
00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:05,124
the same things you have got around you,

465
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:09,166
will take you there with a faster speed,

466
00:28:10,249 --> 00:28:12,500
with a very comfortable thing.

467
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,249
So tell your mind today,

468
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:18,249
that we have had enough of it,

469
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,583
playing with the mind.

470
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:25,042
Now we want to be there in the realm of God.

471
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,458
Tell your mind, fully, tell your mind.

472
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,583
It is important.

473
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:04,124
This is the mind which has taken you to all kinds of things

474
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:07,042
it has given you all the filth and dirt and all that.

475
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,666
So just tell your mind.

476
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:31,249
May God bless you!

477
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:34,000
So for today's theme,

478
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,583
we should say that we have to achieve

479
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:39,792
our innocence within ourselves,

480
00:29:40,249 --> 00:29:43,249
and feel the innocence of the Virata.

481
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:47,208
The question of Ganesha Virata,

482
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:49,083
we can say, or Virata Ganesha,

483
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:53,208
where, in the Virata, the innocence we have to feel,

484
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:58,124
so that we become innocent, our sins are washed out,

485
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:04,208
that we are cleansed by that innocence,

486
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:08,583
"so that this "I-ness" is lost from you,"

487
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:13,124
this original sin is washed away from us,

488
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:17,833
and we become that beautiful being

489
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:23,583
who is the proud child of God,

490
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:31,249
and who is the prize of this creation.

491
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,249
May God bless you!

492
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:37,833
Now you can translate, Gregoire.

493
00:30:38,124 --> 00:30:39,666
It's all right. You can translate.

494
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:41,583
I know it is long, but sometimes

495
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:43,583
I find that if the flow is not kept...

496
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:46,208
Gregoire: I'm sorry, Mother, I should not have interrupted.

497
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:48,208
No, it's all right, it's all right.

498
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:57,917
You can replay, and in that background

499
00:30:57,917 --> 00:31:00,124
you will be able to, keep it low,

500
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:02,333
so that you can spontaneously

501
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:04,416
go on saying something.

502
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:07,917
Will it be all right? To replay?

503
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:14,000
That will give you a proper...

504
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,958
Gregoire: I was just thinking three minutes for the French,

505
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,249
and three minutes for the Italian,

506
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,541
in a very condensed manner.

507
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:19,500
You can?

508
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
Gregoire: I can, yes.

509
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,875
All right.

510
00:37:10,124 --> 00:37:13,666
Many people ask Me, before also, that,

511
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:16,249
"Mother, why we became like this?"

512
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:20,208
Why didn't God just made us aware of ourselves,

513
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:22,708
without committing all these mistakes?

514
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:28,083
"And why we had to go through this all vicious circle?"

515
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:31,333
At that time, I didn't want to say that

516
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,708
you have committed the original sin,

517
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:35,458
that you have disobeyed God.

518
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:38,000
Otherwise things would have worked out in a different way,

519
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:39,458
not have been so lengthy.

520
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:42,333
Because if you tell them that, then there is another thing

521
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:45,583
that happens to them is that they become left-sided

522
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:47,374
that they start feeling guilty about the original sin, you see.

523
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:52,042
So we have to jump from ego to the original sin part of it.

524
00:37:52,374 --> 00:37:57,042
But that part of you avoid, only one can say, in the beginning,

525
00:37:57,249 --> 00:38:00,708
that evolution could not take place

526
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:03,249
without this freedom being given to you, you see,

527
00:38:03,249 --> 00:38:05,249
because freedom was first tested,

528
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:06,792
that you were given a freedom.

529
00:38:07,042 --> 00:38:08,458
You had a nice place to live in,

530
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:12,792
you lived in the complete protection of God,

531
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:15,208
in the garden of Eden, you can say,

532
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:17,500
in the beautiful... everything was wonderful.

533
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:19,374
Nothing was missing there.

534
00:38:19,374 --> 00:38:21,583
But, despite that, human beings, you see,

535
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:22,958
when they had the freedom,

536
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:26,333
just the freedom was going to be tested,

537
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:30,124
immediately they took to these baser things, you see.

538
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:32,958
And that is the way God had

539
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:34,958
to then change the whole plans,

540
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:39,333
because the baser things of life were attractive,

541
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:43,042
even with all the blessings that they had.

542
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:46,583
All the animosity and the, we can say,

543
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:48,958
all the animal feelings, we can say,

544
00:38:49,374 --> 00:38:51,333
were still attractive to human beings,

545
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:54,958
and that's what was most surprising.

546
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,958
And when these things happened,

547
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:59,042
naturally the freedom itself

548
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:01,792
had to go through the test of improvement.

549
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:07,833
And that test was all this whole creation of human beings

550
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:09,083
that took place.

551
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:11,000
But to tell them all that

552
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,666
"That it is only the original sin which has created a problem."

553
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:14,750
Then they feel then,

554
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,416
"Oh, God, why did You create the original sin?"

555
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:20,083
So it is better to tell them that it is inevitable,

556
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,208
for your evolutionary process,

557
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,208
that your freedom must be tested,

558
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:27,792
because if you have to enter

559
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:30,000
into the supreme freedom,

560
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:31,333
you must first know

561
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:33,083
whether you can bear it or not.

562
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:34,792
And in seeing that ...

563
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,166
So, it took so many years

564
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,333
for human beings to grow into it, to understand that

565
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:44,792
the man cannot bear anything. He cannot bear freedom,

566
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:47,291
he cannot bear money, he cannot bear position,

567
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:49,958
he cannot bear comfort, he cannot bear anything.

568
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:52,333
And that's what now we are seeing in Sahaja Yoga also:

569
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:55,082
when they get comfort, they they are just sitting down again.

570
00:39:56,082 --> 00:39:58,625
When they get any blessings of material wealth,

571
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,666
it will happen which it was, again the same,

572
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,541
that Garden of Eden is coming back to you,

573
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:06,416
and when it starts coming back to you,

574
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:09,416
again you go back to the same stage. It's not good.

575
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:13,291
Now you must understand that you have to be supreme,

576
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:14,958
so you must master all this.

577
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:16,625
Nothing is important, nothing is important,

578
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:18,416
only the Spirit is important.

579
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:19,958
Then only you can get out of ...

580
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:23,166
This is also can act as a temptation for you, you see.

581
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,833
All the blessings that are coming to you are temptations.

582
00:40:27,082 --> 00:40:28,042
So you should be prepared.

583
00:40:28,042 --> 00:40:32,082
Nothing is more important than the Spirit, you see.

584
00:40:32,082 --> 00:40:35,833
We are prepared for any kind of thing to achieve the Spirit.

585
00:40:36,249 --> 00:40:39,166
We are not bothered as to what blessings we get or anything.

586
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:41,708
But what we want is the freedom of Spirit

587
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:43,958
which is not hankering after anything,

588
00:40:44,374 --> 00:40:46,333
hankering after material things,

589
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:49,458
so that you will be like a lamp

590
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,750
which is giving light,

591
00:40:52,042 --> 00:40:54,082
without getting involved into the lamp itself.

592
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:56,625
Whether it is of gold or silver or anything,

593
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:01,833
it can burn, the light, even if it is made of mud.

594
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:04,166
That's what is to be achieved by Sahaja Yogis,

595
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:07,792
to be understood because this is a very precarious stage where,

596
00:41:08,082 --> 00:41:10,750
I find, people are again drifting down.

597
00:45:22,124 --> 00:45:24,917
So now we have to humble down ourselves,

598
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:28,833
to say, "I have not known anything, Mother, so far, I have to know."

599
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:31,249
Because, this is the knowledge of the root,

600
00:45:31,583 --> 00:45:32,583
which you do not know.

601
00:45:32,917 --> 00:45:34,042
This is a new knowledge for you. What can you question about?

602
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:36,458
You don't know anything.

603
00:45:36,708 --> 00:45:39,083
You have to know about the knowledge of the root.

604
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:40,583
So humble down yourself,

605
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,541
and then only, you will receive the blessings of this new growth.

606
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:50,291
That is the growth that is inward, inside, the Antar Yoga.

607
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:53,541
Unless and until you humble down, it won't work out.

608
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:54,792
You have to humble down,

609
00:45:55,042 --> 00:45:57,792
because as soon as you start asking questions,

610
00:45:57,792 --> 00:45:59,792
it's your ego that is asking questions.

611
00:46:00,042 --> 00:46:02,333
So humble down and to grow into it,

612
00:46:02,666 --> 00:46:07,917
and to go further with the knowledge of the roots.

613
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:14,416
It is surprising that in India only this knowledge

614
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,541
has been really sought after,

615
00:46:16,792 --> 00:46:18,708
and people have gone very deep down.

616
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:21,750
That's why every one of them had to come to India.

617
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,416
Even Christ came to India to know about

618
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:29,666
how people are searching it out, to support them, to help them.

619
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:35,541
So it is important that the knowledge of the root has to be done

620
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:39,583
in the area where it is more possible.

621
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:42,750
"It is easier to do where the roots are not disturbed"

622
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,208
and that's what was the country, India,

623
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:47,000
where people searched it out.

624
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:49,000
"But when they started growing out again,

625
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:50,708
they became stupid and foolish"

626
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:53,333
and when we see them, we see them, they're outside.

627
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:57,416
But we don't see what tremendous work

628
00:46:57,792 --> 00:47:00,541
the seers have put in India, tremendous.

629
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,416
I mean, you take one of them and it is sufficient

630
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:05,124
to give you a full idea of Sahaja Yoga.

631
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:09,666
You take a simple person, a very simple person like,

632
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:15,416
say, Sai Nath, who was, to look at, very simple,

633
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,000
but what tremendous ocean of knowledge he had.

634
00:47:18,416 --> 00:47:20,458
Who was not educated or anything.

635
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,875
Nobody knows where He was born, what happened,

636
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:25,541
from where He came and where He lived,

637
00:47:25,792 --> 00:47:27,666
and how He came up to that age.

638
00:47:27,666 --> 00:47:31,458
No one knows about His background.

639
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,666
Or you take Adi Sankaracharya,

640
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:38,416
or you can take Kabira, or anyone.

641
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,792
For example, you take Machindranath.

642
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:44,416
If you read about Machindranath, you won't know,

643
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:49,042
you'll think it's some sort of a mysterious knowledge he's giving.

644
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,583
It's a tremendous work they did!

645
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:55,000
They went into all the left and the right, and everything they did,

646
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:58,042
all kinds of experimentations.

647
00:47:58,291 --> 00:48:01,042
If you see the books they have written about the Nav Naths,

648
00:48:01,042 --> 00:48:03,541
the Nine Nathas, and about Machindra's life.

649
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:08,541
Machindranath went into such depth, and he found out so much

650
00:48:09,042 --> 00:48:11,208
about the places where women were rulers.

651
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:15,042
I think it must be the Belgian place he must have been,

652
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:17,124
"where women were the rulers and

653
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:19,000
husbands were just like cabbages"

654
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,249
and this and that and all kinds of things He discovered and then,

655
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,792
what happened and how he tried to cure that.

656
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:27,208
It's the movement in another direction, you see,

657
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:29,042
in the root direction, that how

658
00:48:29,249 --> 00:48:31,792
these roots have gone and given rise

659
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:36,124
to such horrible trees here and there and that's how he worked out.

660
00:48:36,124 --> 00:48:41,249
And it's such a symbolic thing that you to understand their work,

661
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:43,833
you have to be really very deep

662
00:48:44,082 --> 00:48:48,249
and very penetrating for which

663
00:48:49,082 --> 00:48:53,208
the human mind so far is not able to see

664
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:55,042
the amount of work they have done.

665
00:48:55,249 --> 00:48:56,792
It's not possible to see.

666
00:48:57,082 --> 00:49:00,249
Like, if you see Adi Shankaracharya's descriptions

667
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,917
or that even Markandeya's description about your Mother,

668
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:08,000
it's remarkable how little-little things He could see.

669
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,708
From where, from what angles.

670
00:49:10,082 --> 00:49:15,082
And every little bit of Mother he could see,

671
00:49:15,082 --> 00:49:16,833
as a child would see,

672
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:19,249
you see, absolutely close to the Mother.

673
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,374
That means the innocence was complete and perfected.

674
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,124
Otherwise you can't see these points that they have seen,

675
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,875
all the little things like the three folds of the Mother.

676
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:30,291
How can anyone see,

677
00:49:30,541 --> 00:49:33,750
but child can see that three folds of the mothers are there,

678
00:49:34,082 --> 00:49:36,083
that she has three folds in her body.

679
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:38,166
Only a child can see.

680
00:49:38,541 --> 00:49:40,249
It's tremendous, I tell you,

681
00:49:40,249 --> 00:49:42,374
it's tremendous that innocence

682
00:49:42,374 --> 00:49:45,625
their penetration and their courage.

683
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:49,082
Need real courage to grow into that penetration.

684
00:49:49,374 --> 00:49:53,500
So innocence is the thing which one has to achieve first of all,

685
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:57,541
but it should not be like this through Christ or through Ganesha,

686
00:49:57,875 --> 00:49:59,958
it should be you who should have it.

687
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:03,166
Means you are, you are the innocence.

688
00:50:03,416 --> 00:50:05,000
You don't have to say that,

689
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:07,291
you don't have to come through someone.

690
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:12,875
You are that, you just directly can have.

691
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:16,958
That business is meant for people who are not realized,

692
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:18,833
meant for people who are stupid,

693
00:50:19,124 --> 00:50:21,750
meant for people who can not directly attain.

694
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,708
You all can directly attain it.

695
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:25,833
That is your blessing, that's the greatest thing

696
00:50:26,082 --> 00:50:28,374
that you can directly achieve all that.

697
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:31,750
But you have to get to that position of innocence

698
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:34,875
by which you become so subtle, so sukshma,

699
00:50:35,124 --> 00:50:38,166
because innocence is the subtlest thing that you enter into

700
00:50:38,166 --> 00:50:42,750
all the areas to know the knowledge of the roots,

701
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:46,374
knowledge of the Tree of Life.

702
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:50,625
And it's not meant for the stupid egoistical nonsensical people.

703
00:50:50,625 --> 00:50:53,000
They become rakshasas I tell you, they are rakshasas.

704
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:55,166
So we are not going to go their way,

705
00:50:55,541 --> 00:50:57,082
we have to go the other way round.

706
00:50:57,082 --> 00:50:59,500
So we have to humble down within ourselves

707
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:02,374
and try to awaken your innocence,

708
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:05,625
once that is the holy innocence,

709
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,666
that pavitra innocence within you.

710
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:20,708
In Sanskrit language there's no word for innocence, to the surprise.

711
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:24,875
Because for them whatever is the holy, auspicious, everything,

712
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:28,291
there's no word, separated from innocence,

713
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:33,082
because they can't think that there can be innocence

714
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:35,000
existing in the air like that.

715
00:51:35,249 --> 00:51:38,124
It has to be inside something, you see,

716
00:51:38,374 --> 00:51:43,124
it is always sort of a cup can only contain the water like that.

717
00:51:43,374 --> 00:51:44,500
So they can not think,

718
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:48,249
they can not think of water hanging in the air like that, you see.

719
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,082
It has to have some cup.

720
00:51:50,416 --> 00:51:52,124
"So they will say "auspicious time,"

721
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:55,625
"auspicious person" or

722
00:51:55,958 --> 00:51:59,833
"auspicious thing", "auspicious night",

723
00:52:00,124 --> 00:52:01,374
"auspicious day."

724
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:06,541
Everything is contained,

725
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:08,541
container, like a container.

726
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:11,500
The container that can have innocence, you see.

727
00:52:11,833 --> 00:52:15,750
So the auspiciosness. Again, auspicious. It's an adjective.

728
00:52:17,374 --> 00:52:22,750
There is nothing like saying that this is

729
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:24,958
a solid innocence, the shubbha.

730
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:27,166
Shubbha itself is an adjective,

731
00:52:27,416 --> 00:52:30,416
there's no noun for innocence.

732
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:33,416
Innocent it can be, but innocence itself

733
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:36,000
doesn't exist for them

734
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,166
Because it exists everywhere that is innocent.

735
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:41,708
It's such a wider idea,

736
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,875
it's a wider idea of the Virat Ganesha.

737
00:52:46,249 --> 00:52:50,082
When He is in the whole of Virata,

738
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:53,416
how can you put Him down as вЂ˜innocence'?

739
00:52:55,374 --> 00:52:57,833
Is so much subtle,

740
00:52:58,082 --> 00:53:01,958
too subtle to be made into a noun.

741
00:53:03,374 --> 00:53:05,249
too subtle a thing,

742
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:07,958
and we have to become that subtle.

743
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:12,500
May God bless you all!

744
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:44,750
You can start washing My Feet.

745
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,458
First, what we can do,

746
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:51,625
that those who have not washed My Feet

747
00:53:51,875 --> 00:54:03,792
please raise your hands вЂ“ so far. вЂ¦He has not washed?

748
00:54:06,291 --> 00:54:08,750
All right, come.

749
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,750
These are the twenty-one names,

750
01:15:27,374 --> 01:15:29,333
these are the Twenty-One Names

751
01:15:29,666 --> 01:15:35,500
of Shri Vishnu which is the aspect of your evolution,

752
01:15:36,083 --> 01:15:37,416
of your dharma.

753
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,625
First the sustenance and then evolution.

754
01:15:41,666 --> 01:15:46,000
That's the Father within you.

755
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:51,625
And so first because you are all seeking your evolution

756
01:15:52,792 --> 01:15:57,000
we invoke the twenty-one powers,

757
01:15:57,208 --> 01:16:04,291
twenty-one powers of this Father aspect of God.

758
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:06,083
Twenty-one powers.

759
01:16:07,208 --> 01:16:11,666
These are the twenty-one names which represent

760
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,374
the twenty-one powers of evolution within us.

761
01:16:17,875 --> 01:16:20,625
Sushumna Channel has got

762
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,291
twenty-one powers.

763
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:30,082
You can translate, in French it's better.

764
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:36,917
Vishnu, Vishnu, it's the Vishnu power or,

765
01:16:37,124 --> 01:16:39,083
we can say, the Narayana.

766
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:40,958
Vishnu is the Father.

767
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:11,249
Krita Yuga. This is the Krita Yuga.

768
01:22:11,249 --> 01:22:14,500
Krita means when where it will be effective,

769
01:22:15,958 --> 01:22:17,792
when where it is going to be effective.

770
01:22:18,042 --> 01:22:19,958
The work will be done. This is the Yuga,

771
01:22:19,958 --> 01:22:21,500
the times where it will be done.

772
01:22:21,792 --> 01:22:23,082
Krita Yuga.

773
01:22:23,333 --> 01:22:25,708
This is the special time which is in between

774
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:27,124
Kali Yuga and Satya Yuga,

775
01:22:27,374 --> 01:22:30,082
is the Krita Yuga where things will be done,

776
01:22:30,333 --> 01:22:32,042
work will be done.

777
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:33,333
Resurrection time

778
01:22:33,333 --> 01:22:34,583
where your hands will speak.

779
01:22:34,833 --> 01:22:38,458
This is the thing. You see. Translate it.

780
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:42,249
"Krita Yuga. "Kri" means "to do."

you awaken the principle of the whole universe,

783
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:06,000
the principle of the universe and Pratye

784
01:35:06,208 --> 01:35:11,458
means you give also the experience of that,

785
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,875
so that he is the one who generates the principle

786
01:35:16,291 --> 01:35:18,875
and also he gives you the experience.

787
01:35:31,291 --> 01:35:34,625
pratye, pratye is the experience that proves,

You give your own pratye, means you give your experience

by which it proves that you exist.

791
01:46:14,291 --> 01:46:17,124
It should be "You are God in man", it would be better.

792
01:46:17,708 --> 01:46:19,708
God in man.

793
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:25,708
He is not man, by any chance,

794
01:46:26,374 --> 01:46:28,374
how can you call Him?
