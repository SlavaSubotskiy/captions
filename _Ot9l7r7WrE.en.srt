1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,960
Good evening ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,960
Mataji is on the way and will be with you in short time.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,440
I thought it opportune

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,360
few minutes to run through by a recapitulation

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,600
the various aspects of the mechanism that lies within us

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,160
for those people who have come for the first time - excuse me -

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,640
many who might not have heard the earlier lecture in which

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,960
various aspects of the chakras and the two sides of the subtle body,

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,840
the left and the right side and then the central channel

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,640
were discussed and explained.

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,640
And perhaps I can recapitulate a little on the

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,280
nature or quality of the chakra that

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,400
is expressed and the purpose

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,720
of Kundalini awakening and the process of Self-Realisation.

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,960
Many of you will be familiar with the

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,840
word "chakra" but for those who are not,

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,480
it's simply an energy center within us at a very subtle level

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,960
which expresses itself in the gross

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,800
as the plexuses of the autonomic nervous system.

20
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,000
It expresses itself in seven plexuses.

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,840
We have the Mooladhara chakra

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,560
which is part of that chakra

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,400
which we refer to as the Kundalini

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,040
and which lies in the gross body at the area

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,960
right at the tip of the sacrum bone, at the coccyx,

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,800
and so it relates to the pelvic plexus, the sacral plexus,

27
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,720
the coccygeal plexus and one other plexus that

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,120
is located in that area.

29
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,600
So the Mooladhara chakra

30
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,920
is that center which controls our sex,

31
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,000
it controls the whole organic structure

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,760
both muscular and [skeletonic] of that area

33
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,480
so controls such organs as the prostate gland

34
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,800
and in men and women of course the sex organs themselves

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,120
and so diseases that are related to this area

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,960
are very much a matter of

37
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,960
equipped investigating and fixing

38
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,960
damage which may have occured at the Mooladhara chakra.

39
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,360
Also the psychosexual problems as well

40
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,160
could be very much affected and corrected

41
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,120
by Sahaja Yoga at this center.

42
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,920
So Mooladhara chakra is the base,

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,320
it is in fact the center which Mother has nominated

44
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,920
as Australia's part in the whole mechanism of this universe.

45
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,640
At a very subtle level

46
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,720
countries play a part in the whole nature of evolution

47
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,960
and in a very incomprehensible way.

48
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,560
But as you develop in Sahaja Yoga you begin to understand

49
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,080
Australia has a very vital role

50
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,600
as the root. Mooladhara means

51
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,400
the root, the root that on which everything stands.

52
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,120
And so as you deepen in Sahaja Yoga you'll understand

53
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,840
what vital role we have to play.

54
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,120
In fact India is that center which is in the sacrum bone

55
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,440
which is really a part of Mooladhara chakra

56
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,400
and it's the triangular bone in which the Kundalini sits.

57
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,800
It's the center of purity, it's the center of holiness

58
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,960
it's the center in which the Kundalini itself resides

59
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,800
dormant and sleeping as the residual energy

60
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,760
which at an appropiate time in our evolution

61
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,480
spiritually has to rise.

62
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,720
So closely connected is the Mooladhara

63
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,920
and the Kundalini

64
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,280
and they are considered the first chakra.

65
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,400
The quality as I said, of the Kundalini is purity and holiness.

66
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,720
The quality of the Mooladhara chakra is innocence

67
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,440
and out of innocence comes wisdom

68
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,960
and with that wisdom comes obedience.

69
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,840
All of these are qualities of the Mooladhara chakra,

70
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,440
which we find beginning to manifest

71
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,600
as this Kundalini energy begins to rise and purifies these centers.

72
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,400
This is the center which gets so badly damaged by

73
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,160
all sorts of negative forces which due to our

74
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,200
licentious life due to all sorts of

75
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,160
rather bizarre attitude towards sex,

76
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,080
all sorts of impure relationships,

77
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,200
all sorts of the unholy relationships

78
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,200
which can and do damage that center.

79
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,720
It's a center which is our chastity, both in men and women,

80
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,120
and if our chastity is assaulted,

81
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,000
then this center becomes quite badly damaged.

82
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,160
It can be fixed, of course. This is the whole point that

83
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,840
Self-Realization, that each of these centers

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
can be managed in such a way that any damage can be neutralized

85
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,000
and in such a way that the spiritual ascent can be a growing,

86
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,960
tremendous force within each one of us.

87
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,400
But the damage is there especially in the west.

88
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,840
Mother has often said that this center in Mooladhara

89
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,200
is the most damaged center in the west,

90
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,400
just as in India this center of Nabhi chakra

91
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,760
is the most damaged in the east.

92
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,240
If I say to you that the Mooladhara

93
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,280
damage represents a sin against the Mother,

94
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,120
the holiness, the purity, then you might begin to understand.

95
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,840
If I say that this center here,

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,280
where the damage has occurred in the east,

97
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,720
is in a way a sin against the Father

98
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,400
the all protective Father, the Father that looks after everything,

99
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,960
then when we see so much corruption

100
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,440
and so much graft and so much of this abuse in the east

101
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,920
we know that they must surely therefore doubt that

102
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,120
how the Father will in fact provide all that is necessary.

103
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,360
So we've gone about damaging our Mooladhara chakra in the west

104
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,720
and of course people in the east, through their corrupt activities,

105
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,880
through their acquisitive attitudes,

106
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,720
through their materialistic obsessions

107
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,880
have damaged so badly this center

108
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,600
which is referred to as Nabhi chakra.

109
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,840
Getting back to the Mooladhara chakra you noticed

110
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,240
how is connected to the left hand channel which rises

111
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,760
as you probably read in some of the readings [today],

112
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,120
as the Ida nadi,

113
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:33,040
as the left hand side of the subtle body.

114
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,080
And it rises and it becomes what we call the superego.

115
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,960
The next chakra of Swadisthan

116
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,360
is yellow, the yellow one. Just wait till Mother comes.

117
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,680
So this Swadisthana chakra, as Mother has explained,

118
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,080
it's the creativity within us,

119
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,080
it's the center which gives us our projections,

120
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,200
it's the center which makes us capable of thinking

121
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,400
and rationalizing and working things out.

122
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,360
It's also the source of the pure knowledge of the Divine.

123
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,560
It's also the place where all pure knowledge,

124
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,960
all the pure conditionings take place and settle themselves

125
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,600
in such a way that we become

126
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,560
ready for our spiritual ascent.

127
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,760
It's also the center which gets very badly damaged

128
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,000
by impure knowledge and by too much thinking,

129
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,120
and too much planning and too much analyzing and rationalizing.

130
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,960
You notice how it's connected on the right hand side

131
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,680
by this yellow channel which

132
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,880
is called as Pingala nadi and terminates in this yellow balloon

133
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,440
in the opposite side which constitutes our ego.

134
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,720
This ego is our rational brain, it's the part of our being which

135
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,720
thinks and mantains and analyzes.

136
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,840
It's also the side of our brain, if we like to put it that way,

137
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,760
which seeks power, ambition, wants to dominate

138
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,120
and in its worst form, aggress others.

139
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,720
So in a way this two channels have been there for our use

140
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,600
in our spiritual ascent but in so many ways we often abused them

141
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,960
by misusing the left side

142
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,960
through too much emphasis on emotional life,

143
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,440
too much emphasis on worship without the connection,

144
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,280
too much emphasis on our conditioning,

145
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,040
too much emphasis on using spirits,

146
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,760
all the things which we've talked about in the preceeding lectures.

147
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Whereas on the right side we've damaged

148
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,160
those aspects of the chakras to the right

149
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,240
which relate to our projections, our overthinking,

150
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,160
our rational thoughts, our dominating attitudes

151
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,920
and all of those things which have

152
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,080
created so many imbalances in the chakra.

153
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:37,200
Because the chakra is a pure, vital center of energy,

154
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,880
intact and in its own way pure and untraveled.

155
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,440
What we do to it by imbalances of either to the left or to the right

156
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,680
we cause a constriction of or even sometimes a detachment

157
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,640
of part of that center in such a way that

158
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,600
we can even end up with such diseases as cancer.

159
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,800
Cancer is in fact a complete

160
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,680
brake down, a construction which is lead to a separation

161
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,200
of one aspect of the center, which in term causes

162
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,040
a separation in the cellular structure of the body

163
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,480
and of course run away cancer.

164
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,200
Is the uncollective, if you like,  expression of that damage.

165
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,080
Then we have the Nabhi chakra which is the centre, as I told you,

166
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,720
which is often quite badly damaged in the east

167
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,720
as much as the Mooladhara chakra

168
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,720
is the one which we damage in the west

169
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,360
so too the Nabhi chakra is the one which due to

170
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,720
too much emphasis on money, too much graft and corruption,

171
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,480
too much doubting that God the Father who look after us

172
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,840
and provide for us in every way

173
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,960
and so therefore damaging this center.

174
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,200
This is the problem of the Nabhi chakra.

175
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,040
But the essence of the Nabhi chakra relates to our evolution

176
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,960
it relates to the principle of the family life,

177
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,960
it relates to the means by which we evolve in other words.

178
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,800
Family structure is an integral part to the evolution

179
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,680
and so if Mother appeared to emphasize family life last evening,

180
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,720
if She appeared to emphasize motherhood,

181
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,000
if She appered to emphasis the quality of love within motherhood,

182
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,320
not child bearing but motherhood,

183
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,200
then understand what She is saying -

184
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,560
we have to evolve to higher beings.

185
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,280
When we move from the human stage,

186
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,080
when we move from the animal stage into the human stage

187
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,080
we knew that we had to move higher and higher.

188
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,800
Now we've reached that epitome of evolution as a human being

189
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,400
and we have to now reach the higher levels going further

190
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,320
of becoming a spiritual being.

191
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,600
Now if She is here to do the job,

192
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,600
if She is here to takes us through that next stage in our evolution

193
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,800
just keep yourself in that frame of mind where

194
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,720
it's a spontaneous happening that has to take place.

195
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,240
It's the terminal point, if you like, in the principle of evolution

196
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,240
as epitomized by this center here.

197
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,120
And so if She speaks forcefully

198
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,760
about the qualities of a loving mother,

199
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,760
if She speaks strongly about the nature of family life

200
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,040
and how it is broken down in the west

201
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,120
and if She openly admits that some aspects of Indian way of life

202
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,200
are not quite right,

203
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,240
but predominantly there are many areas which are

204
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,200
tremedously important and could be well emulated in our country

205
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,480
please understand She is not supporting

206
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,720
just in a nationalistic way the Indian way of life,

207
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,680
She is supporting those eternal qualities of evolution

208
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,800
which thank God had been retained in that country which is still,

209
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,760
potentially and in reality, the greatest spiritual country

210
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,480
that's now in existence in this world.

211
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,720
So this center is the center of our evolution

212
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,640
and it epitomizes the quality of joy through family life,

213
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,200
of satisfaction. It relates to our material wellbeing.

214
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,880
So if we don't have a good Nabhi chakra

215
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,240
quite often we'll have problems with money.

216
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,960
Or the other way around if we have problems with money

217
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,640
or are constantly obsessed about material things,

218
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,880
so too we will have a very damaged Nabhi chakra.

219
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,760
And of course all the organs that relate to this centers

220
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,280
have to be taken into account.

221
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,120
If you are suffering diseases

222
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,480
of the organs of say the stomach, the liver,

223
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,160
the spleen, the pancreas, the kidneys all of these areas,

224
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,760
it is either relating to the Nabhi chakra or the Swadisthana chakra.

225
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,720
And then the heart chakra in a word is the center of security,

226
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,880
the security within us.

227
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,280
In the center it's that center of security

228
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,880
of knowing with certitude that Almighty God,

229
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,800
through the quality of the Mother of the universe, Jagadamba,

230
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,240
that She will provide that nothing can assail you,

231
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,400
nothing can bring you down, that you become fearless,

232
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,800
that no matter whether you are a king or whether you are a beggar,

233
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,160
that nothing, nothing can assail you,

234
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,880
nothing can break the confidence that you are a human being

235
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,600
and that the Mother of the universe is looking after you.

236
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,160
That's the quality of the center heart, the sacred heart.

237
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,800
Then we have the left heart which relates to

238
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,640
the quality of motherhood,

239
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:50,280
that security again which a baby must feel in the womb,

240
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,200
which a child feels in the arms of the mother.

241
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,360
It's the quality of security, of that caliber.

242
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,760
And so if there's a dis-relationship between the mother

243
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,360
and those other members of the family

244
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,680
or you and your attitude towards your mother is not harmonious,

245
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,680
then this left heart center will be in trouble.

246
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,400
And so too on the right hand side is the center of the father.

247
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,080
the father is the protector, the father is the one who takes care

248
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,840
in a very firm, forthright way, as epitomized by Shri Rama.

249
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,400
The great incarnation of Vishnu who came on the earth to show

250
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,600
just how important it is to have that quality of fatherhood.

251
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,880
Responsibility to the society, responsibility to the family,

252
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,200
responsibilty to his wife and to his children.

253
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,800
And so this is the center in which the father becomes

254
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,720
that secure example within us

255
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,480
wherein we feel and those around us feel

256
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,760
that absolutely nothing can assail us, because we epitomize

257
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,280
that quality of fatherhood which gives that security.

258
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,320
And so diseases related to the lungs, the heart

259
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,640
and many other subtler, smaller organs in that area

260
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,840
are related to this center.

261
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,400
Then we have Vishudhi chakra about which Mataji spoke last night.

262
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
This is the center of the throat.

263
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,400
This is the center of Shri Krishna,

264
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,280
the next incarnation of Shri Vishnu.

265
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,040
And His incarnation was that of

266
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,960
showing us that we are part of the whole,

267
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,920
showing us that there is an All-pervading God,

268
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,560
showing us that we have to realize the Akbar, the Great.

269
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,680
Allah hu Akbar. God is great.

270
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,600
And we have to know with certitude that this All-Pervading God

271
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,080
is the one who gives us that spiritual ascent.

272
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,840
We have to have self-esteem, neither loving ourselves too much

273
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,080
nor loving ourselves too little.

274
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,360
And so it's the center of self-esteem.

275
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,960
On the one side if we are feeling guilty

276
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,120
or if we are feeling the desire

277
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,600
to constantly allow others to aggress us and to dominate us

278
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,960
we'll have problems on the left hand side.

279
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,680
If we are in fact loving ourselves too much

280
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,680
and not reflecting the Akbar,

281
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,040
if we are loving ourselves too much then we aggress others,

282
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,960
we become dominating, we use our language badly,

283
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,960
we are often very, very sharp with our tongue and very hot tempered.

284
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,040
This gives us problems on the right Vishuddhi and this may manifest

285
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,040
in most of you as stresses and tensions of the neck muscles,

286
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,760
it may relate to thyroid problems,

287
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,360
it may relate to coughs and colds in the throat and the bronchitis

288
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,840
and so it goes on. I need not to go far.

289
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,960
Then finally, not finally but second, last chakra

290
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,920
is the Agnya chakra which is known

291
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,640
possibly to many of you as the third eye.

292
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,080
This is in fact the center of the lord Jesus Christ.

293
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,360
It's the holiest of holy center

294
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,840
that it was opened two thousand years ago

295
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,240
by the lord Jesus Christ and His Mother Mary.

296
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,400
It's a center which establishes within our brain,

297
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,800
within our enlightened awareness the principle of Spirit.

298
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,600
It's the center which exemplifies

299
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,760
the purpose of Christ's incarnation

300
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,640
that not only that we had to crucify this ego,

301
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,000
which was so prevalent, but that the Spirit had to ascent,

302
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,200
that we are not this physical body, we are the Spirit.

303
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,440
And in order to achieve this we have to be forgiveness.

304
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,960
We have to be forgiveness first to ourselves

305
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,440
and to everyone around us.

306
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,640
This was the message of the lord Jesus Christ and His ascent

307
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,840
in the sense of His resurrection is the message at the Agnya chakra.

308
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,160
And so as the Kundalini passes through all these centers

309
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,200
and comes to Agnya chakra,

310
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,640
what actually happens is that these two

311
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,960
useful devices, up to this point,

312
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,440
these two useful balloons called ego and superego,

313
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,400
actually become absorbed, they become sucked in

314
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,720
at the time when the Kundalini rises and enlightens this center.

315
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,320
The egos are karmas

316
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,760
and the superego all of those sins so called

317
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,960
that we've committed in the past, all get sucked in

318
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,880
and so the message of Christ

319
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,240
that He died for our sins becomes a reality.

320
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,000
But until the Kundalini rises and passes this center,

321
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,240
this sucking in process cannot happen.

322
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,360
What Christ said cannot become an actualization

323
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,640
until you get your Realization,

324
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,280
until the spiritual ascent takes place.

325
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,280
So it's fundamental that this energy of the Holy Spirit within us,

326
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,960
this Kundalini should rise,

327
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,600
enlighten the centers and give us our second birth.

328
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,080
And where is the second birth take place?

329
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,840
It takes place at the Sahasrara.

330
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,360
So many times we've read of

331
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,720
so many things which relate to the top of the head.

332
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,880
So often we've puzzled ourselves over the nature

333
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,760
of this fontanel bone in a baby which pulsates

334
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,920
and which closes at the age of twelve and becomes calcified.

335
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,640
Thoughtful people who pondered on this - why is it calcified ?

336
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,160
What's the subtle reason for this?

337
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,080
And in what way does it disconnect us from the Divine?

338
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,880
The way in which we were born as a child.

339
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,480
This is the center which has been opened

340
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,680
in this era, in ths age, in your lifetime by Shri Mataji.

341
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,920
This is the center which had to come.

342
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,160
This is the center where the Spirit makes its final ascent

343
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,960
and put you in touch with

344
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,720
and you become part of the All-Pervading God.

345
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,800
And so when this center opens

346
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,640
you get the connection with the Divine.

347
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,720
What Christ said about being born again becomes an actualization.

348
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,640
It's not a self-certification, it's an actual experience

349
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,040
in which you begin to feel this energy

350
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,600
which is dormant and that is sacrum,

351
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,960
manifesting at the top of the head.

352
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,080
You feel it as a cool wind emitting from the top of the head and

353
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,760
as if blowing upwards onto the palm of the hand.

354
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,760
And you begin to feel it blowing onto the hands.

355
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,440
You feel it in fact as a fountain of energy

356
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,680
which flows down over your body and you enjoy the bliss.

357
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,120
At first you may feel heat, you may not feel that bliss or joy

358
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,360
but increasingly as the Kundalini rises

359
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,160
and you develop your Realization you begin to know the Brahma,

360
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,200
you begin to know the energy of God.

361
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,720
You become all of those things

362
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,880
which all the great incarnations said you had to become.

363
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,720
You become the Spirit.

364
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,120
And so if Mother is the One who can do the job

365
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,840
we shouldn't be too circumspect about it.

366
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,800
If She is the one who can raise the kundalini in thousands

367
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,960
and can convince a rather skeptical person like myself -

368
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,840
when I first got my Realization,

369
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,960
not by intellectual or rational reasoning

370
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,840
but by the simple joy on the faces of the people

371
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,160
who gave Me the Realization,

372
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,880
by seeing the transformation in their life,

373
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,480
by watching physical diseases disappear

374
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,240
in a relatively short time, quite often instantly.

375
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,200
I humble myself down and I say, "Perhaps She is this,

376
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,880
perhaps She is this, perhaps we are in the myths

377
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,360
at a time in our evolution when

378
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,720
a great incarnation is here on the earth.

379
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,120
Perhaps there are forces which very naturally at that time,

380
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,600
come to delude us and to mislead us

381
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,640
and I have to be careful about but [more than everything]

382
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,560
I have to be a little bit logic when say, "what if She is?"

383
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,960
So many people might

384
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,920
go away from a meeting like this and say

385
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,040
"Perhaps this is blasphemy".

386
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,360
Of course you are free to make up your mind but I urge you

387
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,040
to ask the question in your heart,

388
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,280
ask the question on the Kundalini, because you have that power.

389
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,880
You can put your hands up to Her

390
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,160
and if it's emitting those cool vibrations

391
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,600
then that cool vibration

392
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,080
is the flow of the energy of Almighty God which is telling you

393
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,680
that before you is sitting Truth.

394
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,200
You have to reach a logical conclusion but more than that

395
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,480
you have to experience something

396
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,800
which settles your mind at rest and says

397
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,640
"I have achieved the ultimate".

398
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,960
If Shri Mataji is the incarnation of the Holy Spirit,

399
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,280
and so many thousands of people around the world

400
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,200
now recognize that She is,

401
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,600
then is it right that we keep it in the dark?

402
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,160
Is it right that we don't announce it?

403
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,920
Is it right that perhaps in five years time when

404
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,960
so many people have reached that level of suffering

405
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:48,960
and confusion that it's almost an impossible task to retrace,

406
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,600
is it right that we withdraw and hold back and don't tell you?

407
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,800
In fact many of you who are so critical,

408
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,360
not in this audience but around the world,

409
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,920
will say "Why didn't you tell us? Why didn't you tell us?

410
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,760
If only you've told us we at least could have

411
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,040
made our own mind up and satisfied ourselves."

412
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,920
So if we declare

413
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,960
and utter

414
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,200
the very, very clear statement that Shri Mataji

415
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:27,040
is in our opinion the incarnation of the Holy Spirit,

416
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,600
see it through both sides.

417
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,960
If you want take it as a hypothesis.

418
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,280
If you feel the vibrations and are secure in that knowledge

419
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,600
that knowing who Mother is in your heart, enjoy it.

420
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,600
But [either] way whether you remain open as a scientist

421
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,880
keep it as a hypothesis,

422
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,080
or you feel Mother in your heart and you enjoy

423
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,640
the beginning of your final spiritual ascent,

424
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,560
whatever it is, don't be too hasty.

425
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:04,400
Don't judge, because it can [unclear] you

426
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,360
somebody who has never quite achieved

427
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,040
the final, the ultimate, that they wanted to achieve.

428
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,920
We often wonder how to speak to people too,

429
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,680
to arrive at logical conclusions.

430
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,240
It's always a difiicult thing, I think you must understand.

431
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,480
If Mataji is this being?

432
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,840
How to put it in such a way that

433
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,200
A who reached those logical conclusions

434
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,360
and B to don't allow the intellect to be, create such a barier

435
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,320
that it prevents you from the spiritual ascent?

436
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,800
Christ has said as well, you know,

437
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,440
that "I will send you a Counselor, a Comforter,

438
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,680
the Holy Spirit who will teach you all things."

439
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,560
If Mother is that,

440
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,280
what is She doing when She is teaching you all things?

441
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,960
What is She doing  when She is comforting you by

442
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,000
purifying these centers and by advising you

443
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,320
and couselling you so sweetly?

444
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,280
If She is the energy of the Holy Spirit,

445
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,560
God's manifestation, the power of God Almighty

446
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,280
then allow it to take place.

447
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,080
These things have been predicted so often

448
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,920
in Scriptures, which possibly many of us haven't read.

449
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,400
I 've now seen them, so many people have seen them around the world.

450
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,320
The Markandeya Purana,

451
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:36,080
in which is clearly stated that Adi Shakti had to take birth...

452
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,080
Yes, Mataji has asked me to introduce this in this way.

453
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,280
Yes, because you see, there is a little problem, all right?

454
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,040
I'll speak, I'll speak to you, I'll meet you all. May God bless you.

455
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,240
Have patience. Little bit he has to talk. It's important. All right?

456
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,280
The Markandeya Purana has clearly said Adi Shakti has to take birth.

457
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,960
So many Hindus who know this. Mohammed spoke of the Mehdi.

458
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,400
[unclear] for those who speak out of it.

459
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,960
There have been predictions,

460
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,200
there have been predictions which clearly said

461
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,680
and even to the point which the date was given

462
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,400
whether it's [unclear] people,

463
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,360
such as Jeane Dixon, or the real seers

464
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,120
such as happened two and three and five thousand years ago,

465
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,800
in which it was said that

466
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,760
at this time, at this very time

467
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,600
there would be a great Mahayogi

468
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,480
as it was said, who would take birth,

469
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,680
to lead people out of this confusion

470
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,280
and to give them Self Realization,

471
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,480
so that they in fact today will know their own master.

472
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,960
so that they could heal their own bodies,

473
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,160
so that you could close the hospitals.

474
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,160
All these things have been said in the Scriptures.

475
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,760
The Devi Bhagavatam, the Markandeya Purana.

476
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,240
Such great writers like Adi Shankaracharia said,

477
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,160
"Only by the grace of the Mother

478
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,080
can Self Realization be attained".

479
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,280
In other words even gurus themselves

480
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,760
have received the Self Realization at the Feet of the Holy Mother.

481
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,560
This is something which even in conventional catholicism although

482
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,560
unfortunately so much of conventional catholicism

483
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:35,200
is considered now to be rather,

484
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,400
I don`t know quite what word to use. But

485
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,880
rightful attitude within the church,

486
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,640
that so many Catholics believe,

487
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,800
strongly in the role of the Mother, the role of the Virgin Mary

488
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,600
and Her importance in the whole of life`s Christ.

489
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,680
It`s clearly been said but

490
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,480
as Mother has said Christ could not say very much at that time.

491
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,920
So I want you just to

492
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,280
think about this a little, but

493
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,680
when you reach the conclusion that perhaps She may be It,

494
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,440
perhaps, She may be It, give yourself a chance.

495
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,040
So many people are offended by

496
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,280
a direct state. It challenges the ego too much.

497
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,680
And when that happens,

498
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,720
what occurs is that a big barrier has placed across, at this point

499
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,400
and your Kundalini cannot rise. You cannot experience it.

500
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,440
So what you should do is desire from your heart

501
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,600
that "Mother, please give me my Realization."

502
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:46,160
Say it humbly, ask for it, and if it occurs

503
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,240
let it grow as an experience and as it grows

504
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,760
you can then find out the truth for yourself, in a very precise way

505
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,400
using the vibratory awareness which Mother will teach us.

506
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,640
At the session on Sunday, when we come

507
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,360
we will show you how to use the vibratory awareness,

508
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,960
how to balance up taking balances on the two sides.

509
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:16,120
But for now get the experience established.

510
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:21,680
Don't fall into the trap which so many of us are falling into

511
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,840
of creating a barrier at this point which prevents us

512
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,560
from even achieving the state of Self-Realization.

513
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,360
It`s the love of God, it's the energy of the Almighty God.

514
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,600
It's the pure bliss, it's the consciousness and it's the truth.

515
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,280
And you have to achieve it.

516
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,600
All the scriptures have said it so if

517
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,280
you have to achieve it, and if Mother can do the job,

518
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,200
just enjoy it and allow to become a spontaneous happening

519
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,760
in your own awareness and know it consciously

520
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,200
so that with your eyes closed

521
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,480
you begin to feel this vibration in the hand.

522
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,760
We switch the air conditioning off at the end of program as we know

523
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,280
so that you can really

524
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,640
tell your brain to go to sleep for a little while and just feel it.

525
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,440
This is what it is.

526
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,600
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to take it so long but

527
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,200
I just wanted to

528
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,240
invite you to be a little more open,

529
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,120
because we will be the ones that are to play.

530
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,360
If we didn't tell you who Mother was, and you walked away from it,

531
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,200
if you are a genuine seeker. So we have to say it to you.

532
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,920
Ladies and gentlemen, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi!

533
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,960
To all the seekers of truth I bow.

534
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:08,040
I must say Dr. Warren has done a good job.

535
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:17,160
Perhaps you don't understand that the situation is quite

536
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,720
different in the western countries.

537
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:30,120
I don't have to have any introduction in India,

538
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,440
nor anybody has to give any apologies all the time, you see,

539
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,000
trying to convince getting this,

540
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,080
that into the whole argument

541
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,960
to prove that I'm the truth and that I'm genuine,

542
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,640
that there is no hanky panky about Me.

543
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,160
It's very embarrassing for Me to say it.

544
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:58,480
And the background is like this, when I came to Australia this time

545
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,600
from all over the world, all the Sahaja Yogis who are in the west -

546
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,840
we have many in every country -

547
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,240
and they have wrote that

548
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,720
"this time Mother must say who She is, is important.

549
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,120
Because the questions like this, "Then how can You do it?

550
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,840
How can it be easy? Are You the one who is doing?

551
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,880
All kinds of questions come in.

552
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,080
And I just told them, "Please don't do it. It's not easy

553
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,760
for a western mind to accept it". You see, they'll all come on you.

554
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,240
And yesterday also I told you the same thing.

555
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,680
And it was accepted by many people

556
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,640
because they felt the cool breeze.

557
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,840
They did feel the cool breeze coming out of their heads

558
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,480
but some did not.

559
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,640
And because they did not feel it, they challenged

560
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,120
and they were angry about it

561
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,640
Now, the position is like this

562
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,200
that so far if your mind has been guiding you properly

563
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,200
there was no need for Me to say anything.

564
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,840
We are living in the atmosphere of great confusion.

565
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,680
Tremendous confusion exists.

566
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,760
We don't know what is good what is bad.

567
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,480
Some people say that it's better to have an unmarried life.

568
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,240
Some say it's better to have the married life,

569
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,000
some say it's better to keep the children out in the school,

570
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,840
some say it is not.

571
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,960
The governments don't understand whether communism is all right

572
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,960
or capitalism is all right. Economics is dwindling.

573
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,200
They don't understand what is happening.

574
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,520
So the result of all our enterprises is very confusing.

575
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,760
And we don't understand really what is right and what is wrong.

576
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,680
So we use whatever we think right, as the right.

577
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,840
But whatever we think as right,

578
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,880
is it coming from something absolute or from relative,

579
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,800
because we are conditioned people?

580
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,560
For a lady who, say, comes from a catholic church

581
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,240
she wouldn't like Me to tell her that

582
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,480
I am the Comforter or I am the Holy Ghost. She won't like it.

583
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,920
But I would ask her one question:

584
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,800
supposing if I am how will she recognize Me?

585
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,280
If supposing tomorrow Christ comes here

586
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,160
how would she recognize Christ? It's a very apologetic, you see,

587
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,080
low based type, which really I didn't want to start it,

588
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,200
because it takes you down to such a level

589
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,520
that you just don't want to talk about it.

590
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,640
But it happens with the western people.

591
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,040
You have to stoop down too low to convince them who you are.

592
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,280
Of course you are not going to crucify Me, I know,

593
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,240
but you'll crucify yourself if you don't accept it that's the point.

594
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,360
Because I have a concern,

595
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,640
I have to do this job

596
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,240
and I have to do it with great care that

597
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,640
you are very great seekers

598
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,680
you have been seeking truth for ages now

599
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,160
and the time has come for you to get it.

600
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,360
And this is the time your western ego stands up and says that

601
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,480
"How can that be? Why it is You? You see.

602
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,760
So I said, "All right, you do it, I don't mind.

603
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,720
if you can do it I do nothing.

604
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,560
The problem is this ego is such a

605
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,720
thing that we are never aware of it

606
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,880
we are never aware that it's a ego that is working it out.

607
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,680
Like Hitler. When he destroyed people,

608
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,600
he was never aware that he was doing it just to satisfy his ego.

609
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,880
He thought that what he was doing was right.

610
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,680
And all of them who do such things always believe that it is right.

611
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,120
So this is a problem. And then the question comes in that

612
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,200
"Mother you might be also doing it out of ego".

613
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,720
Possibly. One can say. That could be so.

614
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,360
But what is my gain out of that ego, is nothing.

615
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,720
As it is you know I'm a very happily married,

616
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,600
woman of a very rich family,

617
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:05,240
I don't need anything from you, I am in a very great position.

618
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,480
But why am I concerned is the point.

619
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,160
Now put your mind on this position,

620
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,960
"that just now we do not ask any questions".

621
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,120
"Let's have it first of all, let have our Spirit.

622
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,440
If She is saying "I'm going to give you the Spirit"

623
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,200
all right, have it. No harm.

624
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,320
Afterall I have done no harm to anyone so far.

625
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,960
There's none who can say

626
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,560
that I have harmed anyone or somebody has lost.

627
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,480
Today with me there was a little child with a limbed hand.

628
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,400
The child could never have been cured

629
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,440
through medicine as it is, could never have.

630
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,840
All the life the child would have had the limb like that.

631
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,520
But within ten minutes with Sahaja Yoga the child was cured.

632
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,920
It's a fact, I'm telling you the truth.

633
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,760
But that doesn't mean that you should believe Me.

634
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,760
But by believing Me you are not the loser.

635
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,840
On the contrary it is just the other way round.

636
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,280
The whole situation is the other way round thing.

637
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,200
It's like the river Ganges is flowing

638
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,280
and you have to fill your pitchers.

639
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,320
Now, they don't expect Me to fall at your feet.

640
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,000
"All right, you take your Realization". It's too much.

641
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:16,480
But I've done one thing, that the way other incarnations

642
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,720
came and talked - human beings are not easy people,

643
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,760
they are really complicated,

644
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,800
full of their ego. They live with their ego,

645
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,040
morning till evening they float within their ego.

646
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,320
So they are not going to accept anything

647
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,400
unless and until somehow you bring it down

648
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,280
to a point where they receive their Realization.

649
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,760
This is exactly My father told me

650
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,160
that "You have such and such vision, You have to do it.

651
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,800
But don't write about it and don't talk about it

652
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,600
till you have found out an en masse method

653
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,640
by which you can give en masse Realization. This is My job

654
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,600
for which I have come on this earth.

655
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,760
And he told Me that "If you write a book,

656
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,440
it will become another Bible.

657
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,360
If you say anything it will become another saying

658
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,560
and people will just use it to pamper their ego".

659
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,640
And they have crucified all the people like this.

660
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,000
Now while in India you see people understand

661
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,840
because they are educated as I told you.

662
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,960
There's this book

663
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,200
which is a prediction written by Brighmuni who is the,

664
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,480
I should say the originator of astrology in India,

665
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,640
thousands of years back.

666
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,440
And he wrote a book called Nadi Granth,

667
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,960
which was the original book he wrote, in which

668
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,520
he has mentioned about these things happening.

669
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,960
Was revised 300 years back

670
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,840
and was said that in 1970 this work will start by someone

671
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,960
and I started my work in 1970.

672
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,520
Because you do not know, it is so describing details

673
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,880
how to recognize the Holy Ghost.

674
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,200
Christians don't know much about Holy Ghost at all.

675
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,240
I would say that they don't want to know also.

676
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,560
They have never read any other book

677
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,400
to know what is the Holy Ghost is.

678
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,200
But there are all the descriptions in details given

679
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,560
as to how to recognize the Holy Ghost.

680
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800
But I must admit that this work

681
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,240
I have never done before of giving en masse Realization.

682
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,400
This is the first time I have been able

683
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,680
successfully to do this job which I have to work out.

684
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,600
It's a great penance I have to go through

685
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,640
by which I learned

686
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,240
what problems human beings have,

687
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,840
their permutations, combinations, everything.

688
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:32,000
And they are so many that now you see you have seven chakras.

689
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,240
Seven chakras and three gunas so tewnty one.

690
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,120
Then raised to power, say all these centres

691
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,280
have got different, different number of petals

692
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,280
raised to power all these

693
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,640
you have permutations and combinations

694
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,080
so you can imagine how many permutations and combinations you have.

695
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,720
So first you have to be brought to the basic points,

696
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,320
you see, where the problem is, to the basics,

697
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,280
and then to realize what can one do

698
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,200
to take the Kundalini

699
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,280
out, here,

700
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,760
by which method one can do it. It's a technique.

701
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,240
It's the technique of the divine laws you see.

702
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,840
This is too subtle a work within us but the movement

703
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,600
of the Kundalini stops at the first point

704
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,840
or at the second point or at the third point.

705
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,880
Now what is the method by which you can raise it, you see?

706
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,920
Now this I had to first find out what's the problem

707
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,760
with the human beings are. So I did not only study human beings

708
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,960
but I also went to all these horrible bhoots

709
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,800
to find out what they are doing to you,

710
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,520
how they are. Very close I went to find out

711
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,920
how they are spoiling your chakras.

712
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,840
Then the drugs I studied with some people

713
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,400
who had taken drugs and all that, what is going wrong with them,

714
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,760
what is spoiling them.

715
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,040
Then there are people who had problems, physical problems.

716
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,200
To study the physical problem was very easy for Me

717
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,040
because I know what is this physical body is,

718
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,960
but I did not know what you say it in the medical terminology

719
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,160
because these are your words not of God.

720
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,720
So I studied medicine for that. Then the psychologists,

721
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,280
I thought the psychologists are creating another problem.

722
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,720
They are not understanding what they have to say.

723
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,520
Except for you, I would say the rest of them were half baked.

724
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,040
something wrong with them. So then I realized

725
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,320
that they are treating people who are pathologically

726
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,240
upset or who are pathological cases.

727
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,560
And they do not know how to protect themselves

728
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,720
from these pathological things you see,

729
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,200
and they just handle the situation as they have.

730
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,040
It's like putting your hand into the hole of a snake, you see

731
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,760
And then they are getting a bite and because of that you see

732
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,360
they become exactly the same what their patients are.

733
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,600
And then they start universalizing

734
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,040
that particular pathological problem to the whole world.

735
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,480
That a person, they meet a man who is a pervert,

736
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,400
say for example himself Freud was a perverted man

737
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,320
He had relations with his mother.

738
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,040
So first he must have met somebody.

739
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,720
I give him all the chance you see.

740
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,720
Maybe he is born like that I don't know

741
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,720
but he must have met someone whose mother

742
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,640
must have had bad relation or something like that

743
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,320
and he must have treated this fellow.

744
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,800
By treating him he must have got that upon himself.

745
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,200
Now he made it an universal

746
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,360
truth for everyone that everybody has this within them.

747
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,040
It's absolutely wrong.

748
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,160
It's an absolutely wrong staff.

749
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,120
I mean in India if you tell anybody

750
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,480
they'll laugh "God, we have nothing to do".

751
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,720
There was a gentleman, Freud fellow, he came

752
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,400
and started criticizing, something he wrote, an article,

753
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,280
and people wrote him back answer saying that “Now you the Freudian,

754
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,800
you go back to England. You are not wanted here”.

755
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,200
He's an Indian but they said,

756
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,200
“We don't want you here.We understand all these things better."

757
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,280
Because traditionally Indian mind has understood so many things,

758
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,800
and this trial and error method that we know

759
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,480
that this is all nonsense people are talking.

760
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:10,280
But because you people are naive and great seekers,

761
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,920
moreover there is also ego problem,

762
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,600
I have to balance it somehow and that's why

763
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,360
today, because I told Dr. Warren that I had told you

764
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,840
that I don't want to tell these people and you were the people

765
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,360
who telephoned to Me and called to Me that “Mother should be clear”,

766
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,560
and we did it and there is an opposition. So now you pay for it.

767
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,760
And that's why he wanted to make an apology for everything.

768
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,120
There's nothing to be apologetic. There's nothing to be apologetic.

769
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,560
It is for you to receive it.  Is the, position is very different.

770
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,440
It is you who have to ask for it. It's My...

771
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,640
No gain for Me. I have nothing to gain from you.

772
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,160
I have to give you something. And when I have to give you something

773
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:57,760
then you have to get it yourself and not to doubt another.

774
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,440
What will you get by doubting?

775
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,720
What are you going to get out of it?

776
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,920
So first of all to put down your mind in proper shape

777
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:09,760
because it was too much of a shock yesterday to many people.

778
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,120
[Best done] there are people who said that "All right,

779
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,800
today let Warren talk about these things and pacify them", you see.

780
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,040
It's like pacifying a son-in-law who is angry.

781
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,480
All right, so this has worked out. I hope you people understand

782
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,760
that there is no need to feel disturbed.

783
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,440
We have to get our Realization.

784
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,280
On the contrary if you do not get it you must worry about it.

785
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,480
That's not a good thing.

786
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,480
You must all get your Realization.

787
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,960
Now this is the seventh chakra we were talking about.

788
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,800
Seventh chakra is the chakra where the limbic area

789
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,160
in the brain, you see the limbic area is there.

790
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,560
This limbic area is covered with all the seven chakras.

791
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,120
For example if you start from here

792
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,440
from the back where the protrusion is there,

793
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,920
is the Mooladhara chakra which is down here.

794
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:15,080
So when you people have problems with sex,

795
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:20,040
say, a person who has led a perverted sex life,

796
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,920
gradually, this chakra gets influenced

797
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,600
and a person becomes mentally soft, as you can say.

798
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:33,360
He starts getting you see hallucinations and

799
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,320
sometimes he loses his balance also.

800
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,120
[Descend] because the effect is on the brain.

801
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,160
So I'm just trying to explain to you these seven chakras

802
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,400
around the limbic area which is the Sahasrara,

803
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,880
the last chakra, and how it affects.

804
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,440
So now the second chakra is Swadisthana

805
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,160
which is round that Mooladhara, here at the back.

806
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,040
Now Swadisthana is the chakra

807
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:07,680
which as he said on the gross

808
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:13,400
looks after your liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas

809
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:17,360
and your uterus, on the gross, on the physical level.

810
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:22,600
Also is responsible for

811
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,200
giving you more creativity

812
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,680
future thinking and also can be damaged

813
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,840
if you do, overdo that

814
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,200
or if you try to take to something

815
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,800
that is unauthorized as God is concerned.

816
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,240
So it affects both ways.

817
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,720
Now when this happens what are the problems, let's say.

818
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,760
First problem comes in that when you

819
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,640
the central portion is out of gear

820
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,440
this center shows results on the brain here.

821
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,040
And the effect on the brain is that,

822
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,240
first supposing you are suffering from diabetes

823
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,280
- take one example of diabetes - your eyes will be affected.

824
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,080
You have seen diabetic people go on losing their eyesight gradually.

825
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:15,960
And they become big because it is on the optic lobe

826
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,560
sitting here and controls the optic lobe.

827
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,320
So when you get diabetic

828
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,320
that oppression of this centre

829
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:31,840
or you can say the lethargy

830
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,880
of this center,

831
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,280
makes your eyes week gradually

832
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:42,000
because there is something wrong in the void.

833
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,080
something wrong with the  Swadishtana chakra.

834
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,560
I will tell you in short, because seven chakras we have today.

835
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:52,360
So now the higher chakra than that is the Nabhi chakra.

836
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,720
Nabhi chakra is left and right on your head here at the back, here.

837
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:04,000
Now this is the centre of, as he said, of your seeking.

838
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,120
and you are seeking money

839
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:14,320
or you are seeking power or you are seeking love,

840
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:19,320
all these things get indicated in this part of your head.

841
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:23,000
And that's how the Nabhi chakra gets caught.

842
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:28,400
Now you can see when the Kundalini rises, also in the brain.

843
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,840
You can find out what chakra is catching because that is the portion

844
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,040
if you put your hand you'll find is still, still very hot.

845
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,440
The chakras which are all right, that portion in this line,

846
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,640
where the, all the centers are placed is soft.

847
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,240
But where the chakras are wrong you can see it there.

848
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,080
Now this is tallied also that you feel, on the left hand,

849
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,440
this is the Nabhi chakra's finger or the right hand.

850
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,760
Some sort of a sensation of burning, maybe numbness

851
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,600
or whatever it is to show that these chakras are out.

852
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,560
Also you can see that the Kundalini is rising

853
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,680
that the Kundalini has stopped there

854
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,720
and She is moving here and there

855
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,480
and you see the pulsation like that.

856
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:16,040
So it's all tallied up. You can see for yourself clearly.

857
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,440
So this is the Nabhi chakra which is very important

858
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:25,920
because it is your seeking. So it has to be put in balance.

859
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,280
After that comes the higher chakra, called the heart.

860
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,720
Is a very important chakra.

861
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,200
Because this chakra is placed in the center here.

862
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:42,360
This is actually is the fontanel bone area just in the center, here.

863
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,240
Now the pulsation of the Kundalini

864
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,720
is felt here first when She has not pierced through.

865
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,640
But when She pierces then you start feeling actually

866
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,840
the cool breeze coming out of that portion.

867
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,600
But in the beginning maybe due to the little friction

868
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,640
between the Kundalini and this portion of the head

869
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,360
maybe you might feel hot or because of other things also

870
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,840
inside the chakras.

871
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,760
But gradually Kundalini corrects you and you find

872
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,920
the cool breeze coming out of your head.

873
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,920
So this is a very important chakra is heart chakra.

874
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,760
Now this heart chakra is so made you'll be amazed,

875
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,560
that heart is the one which has the Spirit,

876
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,760
also it has the center heart,

877
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,480
which is the Mother's.

878
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,680
So this chakra is the most important chakra

879
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,760
in the last happening of the Kundalini.

880
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:39,680
Unless and until this breaks through it won't work out

881
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,760
So motherhood is important,

882
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,280
motherhood in your temperament and motherhood as a blessing to you,

883
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,720
all these things play a big part.

884
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,760
And that's why motherhood is very important

885
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,720
that you have to respect motherhood.

886
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,040
Freud did just the opposite, of insulting.

887
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,480
I mean this is anti-God activity

888
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,640
because the Kundalini won't come up

889
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,080
if you have no respect for motherhood.

890
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,760
Maybe your mother may be a bad woman, all right, but in general

891
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,760
you must have respect for motherhood.

892
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,400
Or if you are a mother or if you are a woman

893
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,880
you must have respect for yourself as a mother.

894
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,880
The men should also have respect for mother.

895
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,560
Motherhood is a very important part of Sahaja Yoga,

896
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,080
where you find that the heart chakra

897
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,360
is this called as the Brahmarandra.

898
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,800
Randra means the hole

899
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,760
and the Brahma is the divine power that is spread out.

900
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,840
So this is the hole which has to be broken

901
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,600
or is to be pierced through

902
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:43,800
and this is what is the actualization of baptism.

903
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,600
This is what is the real baptism.

904
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,600
It is not just artificial that anybody can put hand on your head

905
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:55,080
and say: "All right, now you are a Christian" or "You are a muslim"

906
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,320
or "You are a Jew". It is not so.

907
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,640
This has to actualize within you.

908
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,880
Now this happens when it comes up through this one.

909
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:09,160
In front of that here, if you find,

910
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,840
is a part of the Nabhi chakra a little bit here,

911
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,280
you can feel it sometimes.

912
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,040
But here actually is the Vishuddhi chakra, if you see.

913
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,040
This is the Vishuddhi chakra.

914
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,040
This is the Vishuddhi chakra means at this point

915
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,360
your throat is controlled.

916
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,240
But it is the center where this Vishuddhi chakra

917
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,880
Shri Krishna becomes the primordial Being, the Akbar.

918
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:38,680
So when you are not one with the whole,

919
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:44,640
when you are detached from the whole, this becomes very problematic.

920
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,960
Now, I have to tell you something about cancer,

921
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,320
because it is threatening the world today.

922
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,360
Is very simple, can be cured.

923
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,000
A little bit I will have to tell you about cancer,

924
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,440
how it develops in a person,

925
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,160
whether he may be a good man or a bad man is not the point.

926
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:03,960
As it is cancer is built up every moment and is broken up

927
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,560
because when the sympathetic nervous system

928
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,360
which is looked after by these two powers within us

929
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,040
goes into overactivity,

930
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,440
like the left and the right, the movement is so strong

931
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:21,960
that it breaks the chakra, and the chakra moves apart.

932
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,120
And the relationship with the whole,

933
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,360
which is here with the whole, with the Medulla oblongata

934
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,320
gets disconnected.

935
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,120
Then anything on the left or the right,

936
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,960
it is triggered by something, which I have told you before.

937
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,320
This triggering when it takes place, it really gets seperated

938
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:43,760
and the cells start growing on their own,

939
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,960
they become malignant, means they are separated from the whole.

940
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,560
Any man who behaves like that,

941
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,280
who is broken from the whole, who doesn't understand of the whole,

942
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,280
is a malignant person.

943
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,240
So the malignant cell starts growing in such a way

944
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,840
that that cell whenever it touches another cell,

945
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,840
that also becomes malignant.

946
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,280
You may develop a nose very big,

947
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,840
or ears very big, or a tongue very big,

948
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,120
not related to the general growth of your body.

949
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,600
So the controlling point of the whole is lost.

950
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:20,800
Now [this is come] when it starts, you see, this [thing] really

951
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:25,480
becomes a very big obstacle here, the Vishuddhi chakra.

952
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,600
Is very important.

953
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,720
But when it starts developing here the whole,

954
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:34,200
what you call, the pressure, comes up here,

955
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,600
which starts spreading on the sides.

956
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:41,080
Moreover to add to the problem, to add to the problem,

957
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,280
if you have been to wrong gurus, and wrong people

958
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,040
your void gets caught up, your void, the ten centers.

959
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,080
These are the ten centers here.

960
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,760
So we have eleven centers

961
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,880
and these are the destroying forces of Shri Kalki,

962
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,520
means our Lord Jesus Christ when he's going to come again,

963
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,760
on the white horse, is this one.

964
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,240
And this is called as sambar.

965
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,040
At the equal level of the head

966
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,720
and here there are eleven forces

967
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,640
which are the destructive forces which come into play.

968
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,440
Sometimes this side is more or sometimes this side is more,

969
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:22,520
But when it starts working out, it starts destroying you

970
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,200
and you may get any disease

971
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,240
which is really destructive gradually to you.

972
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:32,040
It can work out as any incurable diseases,

973
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,600
any disease that eats you off, all those things will start

974
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,720
and this portion of the head is a very important one.

975
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,960
You are not supposed to bend this before anyone.

976
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,640
You should not bend this before anyone,

977
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,040
but when you have found out the right person, you can do it.

978
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,080
Before Realization, I do not allow anybody

979
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,560
to touch My Feet, at any cost.

980
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:00,840
But if they are realized and approved as people

981
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,920
who have started their vibrations cool,

982
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,400
then only they are allowed to touch My Foot.

983
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,240
That has to be very discrete, you see,

984
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,960
because maybe the force is so much there, that you might faint.

985
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:16,880
So one has to be careful as to see if you can bear it.

986
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:21,040
So I was saying it is the other way round thing that works out.

987
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,120
Now what Sahaja Yoga does is that it's the power

988
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,840
that is flowing through the Sahaja Yogis who are here.

989
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:33,920
And even my photograph has the power. If it has it has.

990
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,680
This can be used

991
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,920
for giving vibrations to that part which is suffering.

992
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,280
or that center which is not all right.

993
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,880
People don't talk in the language as the doctors do.

994
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,360
They just say what center is out.

995
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,680
If they say Ekadesha is forming,

996
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,040
that means there's a possibility of it turning into a cancer.

997
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,880
Because cancer as I told you is built in, all the time,

998
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,760
with overactivity and again neutralised

999
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,600
by parasympathetic nervous system.

1000
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:06,120
But the cancer that is going to settle down, is indicated here

1001
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,600
and you start feeling a throbbing over here

1002
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,560
of the Parashakti as it is called.

1003
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,080
But not necessarily. It can be the other way round also,

1004
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,200
when it is one of the symptoms, I would say,

1005
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:21,040
but can be that, if you feel here that kind of a

1006
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,760
heaviness or that kind of a pulsation here,

1007
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,240
not necessarily that you are going for a cancer.

1008
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,640
But it's one of the symptoms one can feel,

1009
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,320
one of the sympthoms which you can.

1010
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,760
But the best way is not to talk about the diseases,

1011
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,960
but better to talk about the subtle thing, which are the chakras.

1012
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,920
If your chakras are in perfect state,

1013
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,400
if you can correct your chakras properly,

1014
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,400
then you will have no problem of any kind.

1015
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,880
So now we have here up to Vishuddhi chakra,

1016
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,760
and this is the Agnya chakra

1017
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,600
about which I have told you yesterday.

1018
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:58,080
So we have all the seven chakras in the brain.

1019
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:02,520
Now the kundalini is brought up through this Agnya chakra

1020
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,280
and enters into this limbic area which is the kingdom of God.

1021
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:09,560
But here all these seven chakras get related to each other,

1022
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,200
because these are the seats of the chakras.

1023
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,160
And that's how the integration start taking place.

1024
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,760
When little bit of integration is worked up,

1025
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,800
this opens out and the Kundalini passes out.

1026
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,640
This is what is the real knowledge.

1027
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,680
But people are so much enamored by their ego,

1028
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,560
by their own ideas that anybody who says,

1029
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,200
"All right you wear this dress you become a yogi.

1030
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,400
You take this name you become a yogi.

1031
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,680
Like this falsehood with which they live.

1032
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,640
You should not live with falsehood,

1033
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:44,720
because falsehood is not the way the life is. Life is reality.

1034
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,840
And it is such a beautiful thing to know the reality.

1035
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,120
because reality is nothing but glory and beauty.

1036
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,160
One should not be convinced if somebody says

1037
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:56,760
"All right you take this name. Your name is swami, such and such.

1038
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,840
or they say you are a phalaan [Anand Kakad] like

1039
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,400
This is not to be believed in,

1040
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,640
because this is you are deceiving yourself.

1041
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,680
There is no need to change your name. Nothing is needed.

1042
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,320
The change comes within.

1043
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,280
You should not be satisfied with this changing of the dress.

1044
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,600
Supposing you wear a tail coat or you wear an ordinary coat

1045
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,120
makes no difference inside, does it?

1046
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,640
In the same way, if you color your clothes

1047
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,360
and go round saying that: "I'm such a yogi" and all that...

1048
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,600
Remember that this is misleading

1049
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,480
Don't take to these things. You should not mislead yourself.

1050
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,440
You must fix yourself up to it.

1051
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,280
Now if you take drugs also, in the same way

1052
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,400
it harms you very much in your awareness and your brain,

1053
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:41,320
and you find that there is a problem on the right hand backwards.

1054
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,840
Most of them must also give you on the right hand side a problem

1055
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:48,040
because here the superego touches on the right hand side.

1056
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,280
Now those people who are extremely aggressive

1057
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,640
and have taken to aggressive methods and all that,

1058
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,200
this left side gets caught up.

1059
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,960
Now you must see, the nature has built within us

1060
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:03,240
a beautiful balancing phenomenon.

1061
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,720
Supposing you are a person who is very hard working.

1062
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,960
You work very hard, you go for the future

1063
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,840
and you do all kinds of things with your mind,

1064
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,960
and all the time you are planning and this and that,

1065
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,840
the right side you are working on.

1066
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,800
Actually you are working through your brain

1067
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:16,920
and your brain must go out.

1068
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,760
But no all such people even till the end,

1069
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,320
they'll go to their grave, they are very alert in the brains.

1070
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:26,600
Nothing goes wrong with the brain but the heart.

1071
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,240
Heart is the one that is caught up.

1072
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,560
You'll be surprised that never a person who is mad,

1073
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,000
gets a heart attack.

1074
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:38,160
Because he is on the superego. Now, he is using his left side.

1075
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:39,960
He is using his left side.

1076
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:44,800
He should get his heart, but he gets his brain out.

1077
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:48,320
Just imagine the balancing forces that are working in you.

1078
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,640
Actually when you get your first attack

1079
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,080
remember that you are overdoing it. Stop it at that moment.

1080
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,600
It's an indication coming to you from nature.

1081
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,800
But we know, we'll have an operation and again go like a big horse.

1082
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,120
There's no need.

1083
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,760
There's no need. But another thing is that in Sahaja Yoga

1084
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,040
you really settle down in the center.

1085
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,960
You don't have this problems of going to extremes,

1086
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,240
or getting to extreme behaviors,

1087
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,560
and you get to a point where you really realize

1088
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:24,000
that you are the Spirit and you are the absolute being.

1089
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,160
It's not any ego and superego

1090
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,680
because then you don't say that I did this.

1091
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:34,480
Like supposing there's a lady who came with Me to America

1092
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,600
and she called herself a [moron].

1093
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,840
And she said: "Mother, You must give him Realization".

1094
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:39,960
I said: "I'm trying.

1095
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,600
So breaking my hands on the working morning till evening

1096
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,600
I'm trying but what to do, I can't do it now."

1097
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,520
I said: "All right you are a realized soul, you give a certificate".

1098
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,840
She said: "How can I give a false certificate?

1099
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:54,760
Because it is not there". You start speaking in the third way.

1100
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,960
You say: "It is not there." "It is not coming."

1101
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:00,080
"It is not working." You don't say: "I'm not working it out."

1102
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,160
You don't say that "I'm not doing it" or "I am doing it."

1103
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,600
What you say that, "I'm trying but it doesn't come out",

1104
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:10,280
"It doesn't come out". It, you start talking in a third way.

1105
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,320
And that is what happens to you, you lose your ego.

1106
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,040
In Sahaja Yoga also we have seen,

1107
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,840
some people who come to Sahaja Yoga,

1108
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,960
get into ego trips, because it's a habit.

1109
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,800
It's a very bad habit in the West to get into ego trips.

1110
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,760
You see, just they jump into some imaginary balloons,

1111
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,640
I don't know what, and they start thinking: "I am this, I am that".

1112
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:33,280
I'm quite frightened to see this fellow was quite a normal person

1113
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,760
till yesterday. Now what has happened to him?

1114
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,840
So you see this ego is such a thing

1115
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,320
that if one egoistical person comes in

1116
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,240
the another can take up from that person.

1117
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,160
It's such a horrible stuff is.

1118
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,560
They are very contagious, very contagious.

1119
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,360
and that's how you will find that

1120
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:51,400
one egoistical now, if the husband shouts the wife will shout.

1121
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,240
And the wife shouts then the husband beats.

1122
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,560
If supposing, one person just stops,

1123
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,080
not shouting, it will calm down, definitely.

1124
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,800
But the contagious disease goes on increasing

1125
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,360
that the children become shouters. It goes on like that.

1126
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,920
So the ego is a thing that one does not feel it,

1127
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:10,720
does not understand it and it goes on destroying you, all the time.

1128
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,960
And the ego gives you a self-importance, but not self-esteem.

1129
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,920
It doesn't give you self-esteem.

1130
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,520
It just gives you self importance, unlimited.

1131
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,160
But what have you achieved?

1132
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,240
So, to be the Spirit you become a humble person.

1133
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:28,960
You need to become absolutely humble.

1134
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,800
One gentleman once told Me

1135
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,880
that, "I've heard you are doing such great things.

1136
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,760
And I've known you for 25 years.

1137
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,640
I did not know that you are Mataji Nirmala Devi.

1138
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:43,320
I only knew you as Mrs. Shrivastava wife of such and such".

1139
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:48,320
And he was the High Court,

1140
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,440
Hague High Court's, German he is.

1141
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,040
And so, I said "All right".

1142
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,840
He said, "No, you are coming tomorrow to my house.

1143
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,960
You have to give me Realization. I never knew."

1144
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,840
So I said, "How did you come to know?" He said, "We have a...

1145
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:02,880
He is from the royal family, another maharaja,

1146
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,960
who had your photograph in his pocket.

1147
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,280
And he took it out and put it to his head". So I said,

1148
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,040
"What's the matter?" He said, "You see,

1149
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,760
I have a very bad heart trouble and Mataji cured me.

1150
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,360
So he said, "Look at the photograph". And he said, "Oh, God.

1151
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:15,560
This is Mrs. Shrivastava.

1152
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,000
I knew her for 25 years. I never knew she could even speak.

1153
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:22,840
So She speaks and not only She speaks to all them

1154
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,040
He said, "We can't believe it this woman could speak.

1155
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,760
Because what I known her for this, is she's a very quiet person".

1156
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,040
So for all practical purposes I'm a very quiet person.

1157
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:36,760
And then he, you know, then came and he got his Realization.

1158
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,040
And he's such a humble man, you won't believe.

1159
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,720
He's such a humble man. He said "I've found it".

1160
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:44,280
He's a very learned personality.

1161
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:48,200
There is so many like that, we have an ambassador of Spain

1162
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,560
who was another humble man, you see. And he came to Me and he said

1163
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:54,080
"Mother give me Realization, I've come to know about it.

1164
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,440
Of course on that level I don't talk to people.

1165
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:57,960
He got his Realization

1166
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:01,040
and if I'm sitting, say, on a chair he would not sit.

1167
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,640
He will sit on the ground.

1168
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,800
The governor of Kashmir, I think.

1169
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,600
This is a very different style thing in India is.

1170
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,760
I must tell you, we people are very different.

1171
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,280
Even a garbage cleaner becomes such a big governor here

1172
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:16,160
that it's impossible to talk. It's a very funny thing.

1173
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,720
I'll tell you a story.

1174
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,920
Once a garbage cleaner came to our house, you see.

1175
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:23,200
And I said, "All right, this is an extra garbage, you throw it away"

1176
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:26,360
So he said, "All right, I'm willing to throw it away, the garbage,

1177
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,920
but how much are you going to pay me? I said, "All right,

1178
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,120
if you say, I'll give you some 10 pounds or something.

1179
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:34,400
He said, "You Indians, you don't know any laws, rules, regulations

1180
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,640
this, that and started shouting at Me.

1181
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:40,960
And this gentleman of the Hague High Court,

1182
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:44,720
the chairman of Hague High Court, the judge was standing there.

1183
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,600
He came out, he said, "Why are you talking so loudly to her?

1184
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,600
This is not the way to talk to a lady.

1185
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,120
He said, "What do you know about laws?"

1186
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,800
He's the one who's in charge there.

1187
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,800
"Oh, you Indians, I know how terrible you are,

1188
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,000
you have no idea of laws".

1189
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,760
You see, he was the one who was taking bribe from Me actually,

1190
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,760
and he was telling off this fellow like this. There is no humility,

1191
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,840
there's no respect.

1192
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,520
A garbage cleaner talking like to the head

1193
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,640
of the organization which is dealing with law,

1194
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:13,760
who has written so many books on human laws, can you imagine?

1195
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:17,200
There is no sense of proportion in people, that, what are we?

1196
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,880
Why should we be so boastful, arrogant and rude.

1197
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:24,520
It's not good, it's not human, it's like animals behavior.

1198
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,520
It's not a good thing. We have to be gentle,

1199
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,280
absolutely gentle, because we are human.

1200
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,120
God has given us so much. What blessings God has given us.

1201
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,800
I find Australians still very much better

1202
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,760
than any other western people, I must tell you,

1203
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:41,720
whatever people may say about you. That's my experience is.

1204
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,240
And I always tell everybody "You have to learn a lot from them,

1205
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:47,320
because they are innocent people, they are simple and innocent,

1206
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,160
and all the time they want to know what's wrong with them.

1207
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,640
They are simple people. They want to know about it.

1208
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,600
But I'm just telling you be careful about this mister ego.

1209
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:59,520
He's a horrible stuff, it always comes up for nothing at all,

1210
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:03,800
and is of no use. It's an empty vessel that makes too much noise.

1211
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:08,400
So now today, we are going to again have the session of Realization,

1212
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,360
and this is the seven chakras on the limbic area.

1213
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,320
When you get the Realization, all these chakras

1214
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:19,720
get completely enlightened within you, as you progress,

1215
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,360
and all your centers get absolutely enlightened,

1216
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:27,960
and you get all these different deities awakened within you.

1217
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:31,200
Then the power that, you see, you receive first, is

1218
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,560
that you receive complete bliss and joy.

1219
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,920
Of course in the west, people feel joy at the last I must say.

1220
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:43,600
But mentally they understand, they become very equipped mentally.

1221
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,680
Dr. Warren, who is sitting before you, he was the same.

1222
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:47,800
I've seen with all of them.

1223
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,040
First, they become mentally very equipped.

1224
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:51,720
They know so much because, you see,

1225
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,680
the whole knowledge comes into their head first,

1226
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,320
for their brains are more developed.

1227
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,560
While the people who have heart more developed

1228
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,200
they first feel the joy.

1229
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,640
You know the Fiji people who were here yesterday, day before,

1230
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,760
I said: "How are you feeling?". "We are feeling the joy".

1231
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,760
Ananda [ra], there's a joy coming out.

1232
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:10,600
Because their hearts are open. So that is what happens to people

1233
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,880
who are too much mentally involved.

1234
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:17,320
This is what happens to them. And those who are

1235
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:20,240
involved in the heart, they start feeling the joy, doesn't matter.

1236
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,640
But the growth takes place, a transformation takes place.

1237
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:27,040
Overnight people have given up their drugs,

1238
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,320
their diseases, so many things have happened.

1239
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:33,800
But you must know that truth can be little shattering,

1240
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,840
to your preconceived ideas.

1241
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:40,720
But God cannot remain with you as He wanted to be.

1242
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:45,080
He is what He is, He will be what He has to be.

1243
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,960
You cannot command God

1244
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:50,960
that "You stay like this. Now I'm going to organize you."

1245
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:56,000
He has organized everything for us, we cannot organize for Him.

1246
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:01,000
He works the way He works, every time, every minute.

1247
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:04,360
for Him is all perfect.

1248
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,120
And for you also it will be because

1249
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,600
you will be living in the present.

1250
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:13,800
When you start living in the present, every moment is dynamic.

1251
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:19,400
You really become a dynamic person, not a cabbage, not a mad man,

1252
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:24,000
but a dynamic, wonderful person, who's rid of all his problems.

1253
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,760
Dr. Warren himself had

1254
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,720
blood pressure, I don't know all sorts of problems he had.

1255
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,920
And it's all got corrected. But there are so many

1256
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,640
who are sitting here, at least there are 30, 40 people

1257
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:36,080
who will tell that, how they got cured of their problems.

1258
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:39,800
So you all should just think that here is somebody

1259
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:45,520
who is just here for your benefit.

1260
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,200
And there's nothing to worry.

1261
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,440
That's all he was trying to tell you

1262
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,000
and I have to tell you the same.

1263
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,480
But this Sahasrara has to open out.

1264
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:58,160
In a way, if you start doubting Me, Sahasrara doesn't open.

1265
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:01,280
Because I am there. I must tell you I'm in the Sahasrara.

1266
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,400
That's the way, I am there.

1267
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:06,000
You can find out later on when you find pressures on you head,

1268
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,600
you have to take My name, otherwise doesn't open out.

1269
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,240
What can I do about? I am there.

1270
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,800
So you have to just not accept me or surrender

1271
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,480
or what are you going to surrender?

1272
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:18,040
Except for ego what do you have to surrender?

1273
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,720
So there's nothing to be surrendered

1274
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,080
nothing to be given to Me, nothing.

1275
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:26,480
Just you have to take more, become deeper and deeper and deeper,

1276
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,160
and a personality who is enriched.

1277
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,200
But in Sahaja Yoga there are no courses,

1278
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,760
nothing of the kind. You have to work it out,

1279
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:36,520
come to the center, it's a collective happening,

1280
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,440
It's not a single person, sitting at home.

1281
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,600
You all have to come,

1282
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,360
make your progress, progress further and further.

1283
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,240
You'll be looked after very well, with love,

1284
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,600
and you will see how people are transformed,

1285
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,200
how gentle they are, how nice they are, how kind they are.

1286
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,680
Maybe one of them may turn out to be egoistical,

1287
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,280
so you just treat him as a mad man. Can be, you see,

1288
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,080
who is used to this thing they go back, for again circle,

1289
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,480
and again they come back. But doesn't matter.

1290
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:06,480
So I have to request you that you must come on a Sunday

1291
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:09,680
where I would like to meet you all and today let us see

1292
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,120
how many of you feel the cool breeze.

1293
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:16,000
Now I would request you to take out your shoes and sit in a way

1294
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:22,040
that you are touching the Mother earth with both the feet.

1295
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,520
Sahaja Yoga is only meant for true seekers,

1296
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,920
not for people who are false people

1297
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:45,640
or who want to satisfy themselves with falsehood.

1298
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:51,440
You have to ask for truth and if you ask for truth, you will get it.

1299
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:02,800
Now the first thing as I told you before,

1300
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,200
you have to understand that

1301
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,920
you should not feel guilty. That is very important.

1302
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,560
Now somebody started arguing with Me,

1303
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,200
that "God has told me to feel guilty". Now again I don't know

1304
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,240
which God has told you. You see, all these ideas you you give up.

1305
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:23,160
Please do not feel guilty at all, because

1306
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:28,080
I'm saying that God is forgiveness, God is love.

1307
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,360
He's anxious to give you Realisation.

1308
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,760
He's extremely anxious that you should get it. The time has come.

1309
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,520
This is the Last Judgement. You see the resurrection time.

1310
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:41,880
You have to get it, there's no other way out

1311
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,880
for Him also because He has to save His creation

1312
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,920
and His creation are human beings.

1313
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,920
So please for Heaven's sake do not feel guilty.

1314
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:53,240
This is a very important time. If you are feeling guilty,

1315
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,440
you just tell yourself that "Mother I'm not guilty".

1316
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:57,920
That is the first condition,

1317
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:02,520
that you should not feel guilty at all at this time.

1318
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,600
All right. Then the second condition is that

1319
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,240
you close your eyes and put your hands towards Me.

1320
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,640
So that you understand that there is no mesmerism.

1321
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,960
Or for what I should mesmerize you? There is no...

1322
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,040
But you see you have to close your eyes and please

1323
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:21,200
don't open your eyes, because when the Agnya chakra,

1324
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:26,160
when your eyes are opened Agnya chakra

1325
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:28,800
doesn't allow the Kundalini to pass through,

1326
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,720
So please do not open your eyes till I tell you.

1327
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:34,320
Because as I told you, there is no mesmerism, nothing.

1328
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:35,960
It works like sunshine.

1329
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,320
So just pur your hands towards Me like this,

1330
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:42,560
on your lap, very comfortably. Very comfortably be seated.

1331
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,160
Extremely comfortably you all should sit down.

1332
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:50,320
Put both the hands with your fingers little bit stretched.

1333
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:56,160
And close your eyes. You can remove your spectacles, will help you.

1334
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:59,160
Or any malas(garlands) or anything you are wearing in your neck,

1335
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:02,080
which is heavy. If there's something heavy, or may,

1336
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:07,040
please take it out. Also one has to be

1337
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,760
little bit loose in the waist.

1338
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,280
If a, it's very tight something on the waist, you see,

1339
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,920
may be not good.

1340
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:17,040
So something, or in the neck, necktie or something,

1341
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,680
should be also loosen.

1342
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,800
Please put your hands towards Me. Just this.

1343
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,000
Please take out your spectacles please,

1344
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,360
because it affects your eyesight also,

1345
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,280
It might improve your eyesight.

1346
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,240
Both the hands towards Me.

1347
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:47,200
Both the hands towards Me, like this, on your lap.

1348
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:00,480
Now, as I told you, the left hand is the desire.

1349
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,640
So keep the left hand as it is.

1350
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,760
But as I tell you, you have to move the right hand.

1351
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,640
But don't open your eyes, please.

1352
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,760
Please don't open your eyes.

1353
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:13,800
Just don't open your eyes, that is very important.

1354
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:20,720
You must sit still and don't do any movements.

1355
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,560
Just keep it still.

1356
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,440
You need not bend your head or push it back.

1357
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:27,960
Make it straight, that's all.

1358
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,960
But no pressure on your neck.

1359
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:34,800
Sit in a way that is comfortable to begin with.

1360
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:44,240
Now, we have to put our right hand on the heart.

1361
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:48,960
Just on the heart. And to say,

1362
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:54,240
"Mother, I am the Spirit", with all confidence.

1363
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,840
Say it thrice.

1364
01:18:56,040 --> 01:19:00,080
Because you are, you are the Spirit, no doubt.

1365
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:02,040
And that Spirit has to manifest

1366
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:05,240
to show you what glorious thing you are.

1367
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:09,200
You are not your ego, you are not your mind,

1368
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:12,760
you're not your body, but you are the Spirit,

1369
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,400
the reflection of God Almighty within you.

1370
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:19,240
So say it on your heart.

1371
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,800
Steady down, steady, steady down.

1372
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:29,680
Put your left hand towards Me, left hand towards Me, yes.

1373
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:34,080
Steady down, steady. You must steady yourselves.

1374
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:42,800
Now put down this right hand on the stomach, on the left hand side.

1375
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,800
And with full confidence you have to say,

1376
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,520
to awaken your principle of primordial master within you,

1377
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53,640
to say "Mother I am my own master, I am my own guru,

1378
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:57,040
I am my own guide".

1379
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,360
Ten times.

1380
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,840
Because, if you are the Spirit

1381
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:06,120
then the Spirit guides you through vibratory awareness.

1382
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,800
And once you said, "I am the Spirit",

1383
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,360
you have to accept all the aspects of Spirit

1384
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:16,240
by saying that "the Spirit is my guide and I am the Spirit".

1385
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:20,120
Please say it ten times.

1386
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,640
Now put your attention

1387
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,480
there where you have put your hand and say that,

1388
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:49,600
"Mother I am the master, I am the guru, I am my own guide".

1389
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:55,880
This is to awaken within you. Say it with confidence, please.

1390
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:01,040
Now

1391
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,360
put your left hand towards Me

1392
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:09,040
and right hand towards the stomach, I said, on the stomach.

1393
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:12,960
Press it with your fingers.

1394
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,720
On the left side.

1395
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:19,160
Now if you have said it ten times

1396
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,720
you put the hand again on your heart.

1397
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,680
Again go back to the same point, that you are the Spirit.

1398
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,240
That's the second point. So you have to say,

1399
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,800
"Mother, I am the Spirit", but twelve times,

1400
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,720
because this center has got twelve subplexuses,

1401
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:40,440
twelve petals. So you have to say, "Mother, I am the Spirit".

1402
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:43,040
This is very good for all the people who have heart attacks,

1403
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:46,800
heart troubles, heart problems, it's very good for them.

1404
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,280
This is the mantra.

1405
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:56,280
This is the chanting.

1406
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,760
Now raise your right hand on the Vishuddhi chakra,

1407
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:13,240
left side of your neck.

1408
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:18,240
That's the Vishuddhi. Left hand side of your neck.

1409
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:23,400
This is the center which goes out of gear in many people

1410
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,600
because they feel guilty.

1411
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:31,760
It's very simple. So you have to say: "Mother I am not guilty".

1412
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:35,960
Left is very much catching.

1413
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:49,040
For anything whatsoever.

1414
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,200
Don't think of your guilt, of the past.

1415
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,440
Forget it, because you are going to be transformed.

1416
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:58,960
As I told you yesterday an egg has to become a bird.

1417
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,680
Then does not matter, the egg whatever specks it has.

1418
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:06,680
it's finished once the shell is out.

1419
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,400
So just say sixteen times,

1420
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:13,960
"Mother I am not guilty, I am not guilty".

1421
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,640
Now you are entering into the temple of God

1422
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:31,200
and a guilty person cannot enter.

1423
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:34,720
Because you are the Spirit, how can you be guilty?

1424
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,360
You cannot be guilty because you are the Spirit.

1425
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,640
Come back to the same point. Because you are the Spirit

1426
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:45,280
you cannot enter

1427
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:48,760
into the idea of guilt.

1428
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:54,680
Spirit is never attached to any such ideas.

1429
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,120
Good.

1430
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:03,680
Now put the right hand on your forehead.

1431
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:09,600
Across. At this point you have to say:

1432
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:14,080
"Mother, I forgive everyone". You have to forgive everyone.

1433
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:17,840
Please forgive everyone,

1434
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,440
because the Spirit is the forgiving force within us.

1435
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:28,080
Christ forgave people who crucified Him.

1436
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:31,560
And not only that, but he asked God,

1437
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,480
His Father to forgive them,

1438
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:36,360
for they did not know what they where doing.

1439
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,760
In His name you have to forgive.

1440
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:43,680
Forgive everyone. Just forgive everyone.

1441
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,200
It's very easy to say that.

1442
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:53,240
And you just say it and it works out. It's amazingly

1443
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,920
powerful.

1444
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:02,360
Now put this hand steadily on your head, on top of your head.

1445
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,920
Now you'll find it's rather heavy in the center part.

1446
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:11,320
Try to press it with your palm a little bit.

1447
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:15,480
At this time, you have to say: "Mother, give me Realisation".

1448
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:18,800
Because I cannot cross your freedom. You are free.

1449
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,880
So you have to just say: "Mother, please give me my Realisation",

1450
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,160
at this point.

1451
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:28,360
Say it seven times, because there are seven centers.

1452
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,680
Now just put you hand upper four inches

1453
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:50,960
and see if there's a cool breeze coming in.

1454
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:56,080
Now try with another hand. Put right hand down

1455
01:25:56,280 --> 01:26:00,440
and left hand you try if there's a cool breeze coming in.

1456
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:46,720
I think it has worked out.

1457
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,520
You can put both the hands towards Me now.

1458
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:51,720
It's like raising the mountains I tell you.

1459
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,120
It's really like raising the mountains.

1460
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:58,200
Now put your both the hands up in the sky. Let's see.

1461
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:02,160
Just like this, higher.

1462
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:06,680
And ask the question, "Mother is this

1463
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:09,200
the breeze of the Holy Ghost?".

1464
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,800
Just ask in your heart,

1465
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:16,040
"Is this the cool wind of the Holy Ghost?"

1466
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:18,200
"Is this the Brahma shakti?

1467
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,960
Is this the All Pervading power of God?"

1468
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:24,160
Just ask the question.

1469
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:27,960
Only these questions will give you answer as answer.

1470
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:31,200
And now you can ask also, "Mother are you the Holy Ghost?"

1471
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:37,080
Let's see. "Mother are you the Holy Ghost?" Ask three times.

1472
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:49,640
It is start working faster with that question.

1473
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:55,160
Felt it? Now put down your hands,

1474
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,600
and see for yourself,.

1475
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,440
Slowly open your eyes.

1476
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:05,280
See if it works in your hand a kind of a sensation flowing in.

1477
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:18,600
Now we'll then show you also

1478
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,320
how to protect yourself,

1479
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,760
because once you are realised, you're like that,

1480
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:27,200
absolutely a newly born

1481
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:30,240
or newly awakened seed.

1482
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:34,240
So you are to be protected and how to protect yourself

1483
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:38,440
nicely, and how to give Kundalini awakening,

1484
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:41,160
both things Dr. Warren will show you,

1485
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,520
how to raise your Kundalini yourself

1486
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,440
and how to protect yourself when you go out.

1487
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:49,720
And I hope you will make it convenient all of you

1488
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,440
to come and see Me on Sunday.

1489
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,640
Thank you.

1490
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:02,280
Dr Warren: Just put the left hand at the level of the Kundalini,

1491
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:05,760
and the right hand at above and at the front

1492
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:10,760
take it down, back and up. This is the manner of turning it.

1493
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:16,320
So lift it, putting your attention to the Kundalini,

1494
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:20,280
take it right up, give it a twist,

1495
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:25,160
and knot it once, and bring your hands down.

1496
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:31,000
Again we raise it. Hands down at the Kundalini. Turn it.

1497
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,280
Up,

1498
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,320
and raise it

1499
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:41,480
above the head and twist it, and knot it once.

1500
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:46,600
And this time three times for the three channels."

1501
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:50,080
Three sides, three gunas. - Dr Warren: "three knots".

1502
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:52,720
Three powers.

1503
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:56,400
Dr Warren: "Whirl it and knot it once.

1504
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,800
Turn it

1505
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,920
and knot it twice.

1506
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:02,800
Turn it

1507
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:05,760
and knot it three times and just bring your hands down

1508
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:07,200
and put them towards Mother.

1509
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,920
Open your fingers out.

1510
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,880
and see if you're feeling it.

1511
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,120
Now ask them to give bandhan. [unclear]

1512
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:20,440
Dr: Now the second aspect, as Mother said is to protect yourself.

1513
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:23,000
We do this by what is called a bandhan.

1514
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:26,040
It's like an umbrella we are putting over ourselves.

1515
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:29,040
-Dr Warren: So we put our hand... -SM: Your aura is to be protected.

1516
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,720
So the aura is to be protected.

1517
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:34,080
Dr. Warren: "We put our left hand towards Mother

1518
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:38,080
and our right hand over the side at the lowest chakra.

1519
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:40,600
And we come over the top

1520
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,720
and down once,

1521
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,920
back twice, seven times.

1522
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:50,360
Again over, three times

1523
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:53,400
back over, four times,

1524
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:56,720
back over, five times,

1525
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,480
six and seven.

1526
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:03,800
Put your hands back up, too.

1527
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,720
You protected yourself by a bandhan,

1528
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:09,160
which simply means a bond of love.

1529
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:14,960
There is another thing one has to know, that

1530
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,120
when this is a power of love flowing through your hands now,

1531
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,080
it's a power of love.

1532
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,480
We have to steady it of course, we have to know

1533
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,920
what it is, how it works, how you have to give Realisation.

1534
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,680
Now you can give realisation to people.

1535
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:32,920
You can cure people. All these powers you have got now.

1536
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,760
But first you must steady yourself.

1537
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:38,040
Steadiness is very important in Sahaja Yoga, to begin with.

1538
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:41,760
And then you will be amazed that if you are standing somewhere,

1539
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:44,960
if there's an accident, accident will be avoided.

1540
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,800
You tell somebody, the person will feel healed.

1541
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:50,280
It's a tremendous thing because you're tremendous,

1542
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:53,000
but you have to feel that within yourself.

1543
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,480
You must practice it first of all

1544
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,800
and then test it if you have got it or not.

1545
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,960
But not with doubts, but with confidence

1546
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:02,960
that you are now the saints.

1547
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:07,080
You are the prophets as William Blake has said

1548
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:11,400
that God of man is described these times, God of man,

1549
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:16,600
will become prophets and the prophets

1550
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:20,360
will later on, make others prophets.

1551
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:22,680
And this is exactly what is happening.

1552
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,160
Another person is William Blake

1553
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:27,040
who has completely described Sahaja Yoga.

1554
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:30,760
So I would like to meet you personally when you come there,

1555
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:36,880
and I hope we'll be able to provide you with good lunch also.

1556
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
It was very kind of you, all of you, to come down and meet Me.

1557
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:47,240
I've been very anxious to meet you all. May God bless you.

1558
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,600
What's it? Dr. Warren: It's o.k.

1559
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,120
It's talking too much.

1560
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,640
Dr. Warren: For those people who don't know the address,

1561
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:56,960
I think it's well implanted in your mind

1562
01:32:57,160 --> 01:33:00,760
that 172 Albert Road,

1563
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,440
Stratfield, 10 o'clock on Sunday.

1564
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:06,720
And ask them to bring salt, sugar and oil.

1565
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:09,880
Dr Warren: "As I've told before Mother's requested you to bring

1566
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:14,320
salt, about half a pound, something like that.

1567
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:17,480
Salt and sugar and a small bottle of water.

1568
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:21,600
She will vibrate it for you to have your own vibrated drinking water

1569
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:25,440
and some oil, because you may need it for massage purposes

1570
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:27,320
or otherwise for healing.

1571
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:31,040
so salt, sugar, about half a pound

1572
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,320
a bottle of water and some oil.

1573
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,160
it can be olive oil, it can be... SM: White sugar.

1574
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,760
But white sugar please, white sugar.

1575
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,920
More of the sugar cane, if they can get. Of the sugar cane?

1576
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:43,800
Dr. Warren: Yes, it's that sugar. SM: That's what you get.

1577
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,600
So 172 Albert Road,

1578
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:51,120
Stratfield, on Sunday at 10 o'clock.

1579
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:53,240
And we'll be there.

1580
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:57,000
Those people who wish, you can come along and

1581
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:01,760
Mother will be cooking some lunch so you can take lunch with us.

1582
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:03,720
Thank you very much ladies and genlemen.

1583
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:06,680
We look forward to see you there.
