1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,720
Welcome to all of you.

2
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,400
This great country is also passing through a crisis.

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,680
Nowadays I feel there are so many things that are happening

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,000
which you could never dream before.

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,160
And at this time you all have arrived

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,960
bringing peace and joy to all of them.

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,800
So I thank you for that.

8
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,680
The strife and the strain which is on human beings is

9
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:11,040
perhaps because they are not yet worthy of God's blessings.

10
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,560
Still, as God has created them,

11
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,000
He tries to do His utmost

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,360
to see that human beings are kept comfortably

13
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,640
alright on this Mother Earth.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,520
He creates all kinds of beautiful things as you see

15
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,560
and the whole cosmos is in unison

16
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,440
and working out something very great today.

17
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,480
This new revolution that has started,

18
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,160
very, very silently,

19
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,560
today is taking it's shape

20
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,960
and is providing a new future for all of us.

21
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,440
You see those big, big trees, that are on top of your head

22
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,600
and as long as you are sitting here no fruit will fall upon you.

23
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,160
It's not because I am here

24
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,120
but because this Mother Earth knows

25
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,960
that there are such great saints sitting here

26
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,880
and She is not going to disturb.

27
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,000
This place was called as Shrigaav I was told,

28
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,720
means the village of the Goddess.

29
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,920
And this fruit is called as Shriphal,

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,880
meaning the fruit of the Goddess.

31
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,520
But actually if you see, a coconut is something like our Sahasrara

32
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,680
and is very auspicious because it can absorb lot of vibrations,

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,120
as if it has got its realization.

34
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,200
As you people can absorb My vibrations,

35
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,400
this fruit can absorb also My vibrations,

36
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,400
in the greatest amount.

37
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,600
So we are here today

38
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,480
in a very big way

39
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:33,320
to advertise the coming of the New Age.

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,360
The coming of

41
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:45,359
the Golden Era, people have talked about.

42
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,240
Here we are to say

43
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,280
what is reality, what is truth, what is joy.

44
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,520
Here we are to manifest that and also

45
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,720
to create a commotion or a movement

46
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:19,320
in the cosmos so that this new awareness

47
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,520
is established in the cosmos

48
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,160
which will enlighten this country

49
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,160
and the people of this country.

50
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,960
Also you will pick up the threads of this movement within yourself

51
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,120
which is a very subtle movement going on.

52
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,560
At this moment we are in a strife of an intellectual

53
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,560
who tried to describe

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Shri Rama and Shri Krishna, in a slurring manner.

55
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:06,320
And this is the time I want to bring your attention

56
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:14,720
that if this intellectual strife to use the intelligence

57
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,200
to bring down all the ideals which enlighten our path,

58
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,920
which gives us the guideline and an aspiration,

59
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:33,440
then our lives become absolutely mundane, useless, joyless.

60
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,489
It's very easy to condemn an ideal life,

61
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,480
but to attain that life is very difficult.

62
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,880
And some people, because they cannot attain it,

63
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,760
try to condemn it so that they feel that they are no less,

64
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,840
no way less than those great lives.

65
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,360
All these ideals are created, these images are created,

66
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,400
everywhere in the world by the Divine power

67
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,840
and people look at them

68
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:27,320
and think that these great lives are beautiful,

69
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:34,040
though they have suffered a lot, but there is so much of

70
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,520
deeper understanding

71
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:46,680
and deeper balancing and a deeper love.

72
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:56,440
These ideals are very important for human societies

73
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,360
otherwise they will be absolutely living in a relatively

74
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,600
and they will have no absolute measure

75
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,040
to find out what is right and what is wrong.

76
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,320
In Sahaja Yoga we are here first of all

77
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,960
to get connected with God Almighty,

78
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,280
with His power, the All-Pervading Power of Chaitanya.

79
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,960
By that we become our own master,

80
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,760
in the sense that we get our own guidelines.

81
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,200
If some Sahaja Yogi has not achieved that much

82
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,240
then is a serious thing.

83
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,240
At least a Sahaja Yogi should be able to see,

84
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:50,200
at the minimum of minimum, what is wrong with that person.

85
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,960
To cleanse yourself and to put yourself right is of course,

86
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,280
is a very important duty of every Sahaja Yogi.

87
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,240
But these things are not to be taken

88
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,759
as condemnation of yourself by any chance.

89
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,760
And you should not be identified with those problems that you have

90
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,276
but try to face them and cure them.

91
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,880
Many a times I have heard Sahaja Yogis saying

92
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,480
that Indians are very simple people

93
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,720
they are not complicated, Mother,

94
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,760
so they can achieve their ascent much faster.

95
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:48,040
But it's not that. It is very different for all of you, very much.

96
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,760
And despite all the complications, and all kinds of brain washing,

97
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,400
and all kinds of book reading and all kinds of so-called seeking,

98
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,800
and all that nonsense one has gone through,

99
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,680
you have come out of it,

100
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,040
you have washed yourself completely

101
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,480
and today you are there united together to face

102
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,440
all that is absurd,

103
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,320
all that is false, all that is wrong.

104
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,880
It has to be a very formidable army for us

105
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,600
because if you see around, even in this country,

106
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,840
you call it not complicated,

107
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,760
there are many who are all the time to complicate others

108
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,640
and to destroy all their ideals, destroy all their visions

109
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,160
and brainwash them.

110
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,280
So you have to be very alert yourself

111
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,640
and you have to be very conscious,

112
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:04,840
that it is you who is going to build up this great image

113
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,880
of ideal people,

114
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,720
not one ideal life but ideal people in all collectivities.

115
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,920
Now on your way to our tour,

116
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:29,160
you are now on the threshold of entering into a new dimension,

117
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,720
it is a subtler dimension,

118
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,215
and this subtler dimension is within ourselves.

119
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:45,400
And there lies your own being as your Spirit.

120
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,520
It sees you as separate,

121
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,000
your Self is separate from yourself.

122
00:10:54,280 --> 00:11:00,120
All these identifications have to be dropped out,

123
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,920
all kinds of misidentifications.

124
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,840
I was reading one of the marriages lists and all that,

125
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,360
somebody says that they will marry Indians,

126
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,880
some say we will not marry Indians,

127
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,240
some say, we will not change the country,

128
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,360
some say they will change the country.

129
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Even after Sahaja Yoga (...)

130
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,920
if we stick on to one country as our own

131
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,720
then I must say that we have to give up those limitations.

132
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,200
The time has come. Of course you have the choice.

133
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,560
Nobody is going to force you to do anything

134
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,600
but it also expresses your personality

135
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:05,440
that you still are lingering on to these small, small limitations.

136
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,240
As I have told you many a times

137
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,680
God created only one world.

138
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,760
Of course He created varieties just to create beauty.

139
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,000
But how blind we are

140
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,120
that we think we are different people,

141
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,040
we are of different countries, of different races,

142
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:40,320
of different castes, communities, cities -

143
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:47,360
then little, little rows, then houses.

144
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:55,040
I would say we become from human beings to rats and rats to worms

145
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,480
and then I don't know what is the situation later .

146
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:06,080
Let's open our heart, let's become great,

147
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,520
we have to be like lions,

148
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:15,680
not to be small and creepy people like worms.

149
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,440
There are many worms everywhere in the world.

150
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,480
We are specially chosen people to be something great.

151
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,920
So open your heart. That's the main problem.

152
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,320
This ego covers the heart

153
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:39,040
and makes you feel that, “Now I am an Indian, I am a Christian,

154
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,200
I am this thing, I am that thing.”

155
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:51,600
Now if I say to someone that you are not to go to temple,

156
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,600
then I must be

157
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:01,320
a very cruel person to say that not to go to a temple.

158
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,200
But they go to a temple and come back with such a big

159
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,480
entity on their heads.

160
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,080
Then they go to churches.

161
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,560
The other day I had a very bad experience of a lady

162
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,440
who went to a church in France

163
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,720
and she has become

164
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,840
something like a minister, maybe something like a pope.

165
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,200
I mean something very funny you know, nothing normal.

166
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,760
I couldn't discover it, when I asked she said, “I went to a church.”

167
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,600
“Why?”
“Because they arranged a marriage there." “Why?”

168
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,200
“Oh, they wanted to have a big social event

169
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,160
so they wanted to have a marriage.”

170
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,600
But you could just have a registered marriage, finish it off.

171
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,880
Why do you want to go to a church, where all dead bodies are buried?

172
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,040
To get back some of them on your heads?

173
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,080
So we have to be prepared to

174
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,080
give up all the shackles of nonsense from our heads.

175
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,760
All kinds of things there are, so much of conditionings

176
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,200
come down even to the colour scheme,

177
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,880
then it's all conditioning.

178
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,840
This is too much, not good!

179
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,920
All funny, funny ideas

180
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,440
and anything funny and nonsensical that comes up,

181
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,480
such funny brains picks it up.

182
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,520
The other day I was telling a lady about her food,

183
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,440
that a new idea has come that you should not eat any salt and sugar,

184
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,440
I mean just imagine!

185
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,560
Salt is so important for our breathing.

186
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,840
If you ask any doctor, I mean,

187
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,080
I don't know what's happening to the doctors!

188
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,960
And sugar is so important for our combustion.

189
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,960
But anybody says anything you people just jump at it

190
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,240
and you people just try to be

191
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,000
impressed by all these ideas,

192
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,960
and start torturing yourself.

193
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,480
Last but not the least I feel now,

194
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,720
I've seen the program on Gnostic,

195
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,920
Gnostic  g-n-o.

196
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,080
And I was thinking, it comes from where g-n-o?

197
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,920
In Sanskrit language 'gnya', 'gnya' we call it.

198
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:57,560
We call it gnya or gya, anyway, that means 'to know'.

199
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,560
Gnostics means the one who knew.

200
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,880
When St. Thomas came to India, He came via Egypt

201
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,720
and He wrote all about it, what is to know.

202
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,120
And He said, it's a personal experience of everyone,

203
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,440
just He described all Sahaja Yoga there.

204
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,280
And also He said, why should God make you suffer?

205
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,480
He is the most loving and affectionate father,

206
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,520
blasting all ideas of Christianity.

207
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,640
Also so many Hindus believe like that, Muslims believe like that,

208
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,840
that you must suffer.

209
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:42,840
So now somehow or other the exposure of the truth is also coming up,

210
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,200
and also there is a kind of a turmoil going on,

211
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:55,440
a kind, I would say a tremendous dynamic effects

212
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,560
are seen on human mind today,

213
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,960
that it starts thinking: 'What is this?'

214
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,600
And you are the answer.

215
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,080
You are the one who is going to convince them.

216
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,560
As somebody was saying that, “Mother, why not we make every year

217
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,000
as a great year of propagation of Sahaja Yoga,

218
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,280
propaganda of Sahaja Yoga, (Hindi word)?”

219
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I said, alright. You want to make a year,

220
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,200
by that if something happens, let us have.

221
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,960
But like our five-year plan in India

222
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,720
I don't want to do all the documentation

223
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,560
and write files and files and files, nothing comes out.

224
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,960
But today if you decide that

225
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,760
we are the ones who have to manifest this greatness on this Earth.

226
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,200
We are the ones who have to do all this.

227
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,320
How can we be weak people? How can we be possessed people?

228
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,600
How can we be fussy people?

229
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:06,000
How can we be the people who are not saints?

230
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,920
We have to come out of all our pettiness, all our conditionings

231
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,320
and of all the things of our ego,

232
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:21,280
but not to fight it but through meditation, through witness state.

233
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,320
You have to be the witness now you are travelling.

234
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,520
When you are travelling, normally the witness state

235
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,520
is how to criticize something.

236
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,680
They never see the good points, they'll say, “Oh, look at that,

237
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,920
this colour should not have been used,

238
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,440
that's not good, that's not good.”

239
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,480
What is good is to be seen,

240
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,560
what is good in you, how much good you can have

241
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,400
and what is good in other people.

242
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:59,320
This time I am telling you that on your way, on your tour,

243
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,960
I hope you will all enjoy it very much more

244
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,480
and you’ll feel the manifestation of your Spirit,

245
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,040
all around you, within you

246
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,960
and in other people.

247
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,080
May God bless you.

1
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:20,351
Now I was aware of it all

2
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:21,695
That

3
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,195
One very big

4
00:20:23,703 --> 00:20:25,703
Revolution is happening

5
00:20:26,123 --> 00:20:27,821
And that's about it to London

6
00:20:27,996 --> 00:20:29,276
I had very big lecture in London

7
00:20:30,172 --> 00:20:31,686
That revolution slowly

8
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:33,926
It was happening
in a good manner

9
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:37,111
But today she is
coming to your aid

10
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:42,424
She stands in your head
and you are her opponent

11
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:45,166
If anyone

12
00:20:46,138 --> 00:20:47,190
Became a Hindu

13
00:20:47,214 --> 00:20:49,761
So he takes the saffron
flag and goes to rent it

14
00:20:51,443 --> 00:20:52,461
If anyone

15
00:20:56,016 --> 00:20:57,818
Buddha became

16
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:02,460
Know the Buddha

17
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:07,534
The Buddha who received the light

18
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,849
But the one who considers us
Buddha takes on another flag

19
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:15,020
But in Sahajayoga

20
00:21:15,591 --> 00:21:17,591
He does not go out
with any flags.

21
00:21:19,607 --> 00:21:21,090
It has its own focus.

22
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:27,571
Now our first focus in India
is, 'My wife is not okay.

23
00:21:29,245 --> 00:21:31,245
My son has no job.

24
00:21:32,341 --> 00:21:36,009
My son has no job.

25
00:21:37,611 --> 00:21:38,928
and

26
00:21:40,436 --> 00:21:43,492
After we left, our eyes were,

27
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:49,839
You start looking around,

28
00:21:49,864 --> 00:21:51,864
So those eyes can see

29
00:21:52,903 --> 00:21:55,863
That is what we have
been doing till date

30
00:21:56,411 --> 00:21:57,407
How much it

31
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:01,267
How poorly it is made.

32
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,634
What a sight!

33
00:22:04,412 --> 00:22:06,020
where is our focous

34
00:22:07,115 --> 00:22:10,403
how can be so
comfortebal in such away

35
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:12,717
Are you

36
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:16,425
Yes, who wants to spread the
shadow all over the world

37
00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:20,485
And for all the world to enjoy,

38
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:25,068
What kind of lights do they use!

39
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,615
Just like the big light
houses on the sea,

40
00:22:31,122 --> 00:22:35,056
how can we do so
easily without you ?

41
00:22:36,612 --> 00:22:39,267
But there is also so little of it

42
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:43,342
And sometimes I am very surprised
to see that insignificance.

43
00:22:45,682 --> 00:22:48,014
As I said to you
today, I tell you,

44
00:22:48,864 --> 00:22:52,108
That, for the sake of
marriage, girls or boys said,

45
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:55,124
I want a girl only

46
00:22:55,615 --> 00:22:57,615
Only Maratha's
son should be seen

47
00:22:59,218 --> 00:23:02,211
then what will happen
when he freez ?

48
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:08,267
Yours! Then, 'Mataji,
this is what happened and that's it

49
00:23:08,324 --> 00:23:09,418
Back to another cry

50
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,956
Then our hope is Mataji
we cannot leave fast

51
00:23:16,852 --> 00:23:17,985
Then Die without food

52
00:23:19,826 --> 00:23:21,272
Why should you tell me

53
00:23:22,256 --> 00:23:27,573
I believe it is best to
be comfortable in a meal.

54
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,979
what is fasting ?

55
00:23:29,566 --> 00:23:32,816
There is a snake, or a
scorpion, that rode on a limb

56
00:23:35,888 --> 00:23:38,434
Such trivial ones

57
00:23:39,005 --> 00:23:41,005
And extremely compressed

58
00:23:41,831 --> 00:23:44,418
Today people of our
country can make

59
00:23:44,418 --> 00:23:47,504
progress evenin
sahajayoga due to tendency

60
00:23:47,877 --> 00:23:51,296
These people say, you are a saint.
Because you are so naive

61
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:56,177
Such is their opinion. There will be.
You mean I have no disagreement.

62
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,127
But Sahayogi is simply
naive and does not work.

63
00:24:02,928 --> 00:24:07,000
First, we need wisdom and
understanding that we have today

64
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:08,860
Standing on the edge

65
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:15,241
These petty ideas.

66
00:24:15,527 --> 00:24:18,500
If we want to get married,
we will do it in our

67
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:21,436
we are sahajayogi By the way,
we are comfortable with sahajayogi

68
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:23,885
Will work The word 'walk'
is too much for you.

69
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,280
ok anything will work .
so which are you ?

70
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:28,325
which king you are,says
everything will work out!

71
00:24:29,817 --> 00:24:32,718
But the word 'walk'
should go smoothly.

72
00:24:33,702 --> 00:24:34,816
What is going on ?

73
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:40,537
Instead of saying
'okay' or 'okay,'

74
00:24:41,331 --> 00:24:43,331
isn't this all shivaji maharaj ?

75
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:49,179
Let us take a look at
these things and see

76
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:51,950
That we have come to Sahajayoga

77
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:54,052
It's not just for selfish reasons

78
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:57,682
That is what we came
to find ourselves

79
00:24:57,979 --> 00:25:00,142
For what the mothers
have given to the mother

80
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,282
That we should open
our hands to others

81
00:25:04,806 --> 00:25:07,882
And we should see that
people should enjoy it

82
00:25:08,953 --> 00:25:10,440
They should be given love

83
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:13,858
But people with
narrow-mindedness

84
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,256
How to cure, then go into the pain
of fun in the room, Mataji Maja

85
00:25:19,499 --> 00:25:20,658
Pain in hand

86
00:25:21,213 --> 00:25:22,134
Will happen

87
00:25:23,483 --> 00:25:25,282
I got a job

88
00:25:25,392 --> 00:25:27,004
The hour went by

89
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,745
Will happen

90
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:34,035
Do you deserve to be under
the umbrella of your mother?

91
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,434
Think about it

92
00:25:37,156 --> 00:25:39,156
Those fine ideas

93
00:25:39,608 --> 00:25:44,418
And apart from the contractions,
today I believe you are in the desert

94
00:25:46,164 --> 00:25:48,652
If you are wondering whether
fresh baked vegetables

95
00:25:48,677 --> 00:25:51,116
have been cooked in the
house, then it will be hard

96
00:25:54,044 --> 00:25:56,044
That's your wackiness

97
00:25:57,162 --> 00:26:00,221
Increased views and hours
are mind-blowingly great

98
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:04,735
You belong to this
religion of that religion

99
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,505
We are not of any religion

100
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,552
Religion is ours

101
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,344
We belong to no one's religion

102
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,656
We are yogis what religion
do we mother to religion

103
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,594
With a bit of it those
who are practicing this

104
00:26:23,935 --> 00:26:25,731
Let the days of
snake-eating come now

105
00:26:26,437 --> 00:26:28,831
Diagnostics Let
Your Kids Have Fun

106
00:26:31,593 --> 00:26:33,593
Many styling your

107
00:26:33,957 --> 00:26:36,290
Cut out the bad ideas.

108
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:42,780
Unless you eliminate
those petty ideas

109
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,655
by then

110
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:50,915
If a kite is tie with
stone, it cannot fly

111
00:26:52,391 --> 00:26:53,524
Your flight

112
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:55,810
Could not happen

113
00:26:57,206 --> 00:26:58,203
Just like our lives

114
00:26:58,806 --> 00:26:59,997
We are done

115
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:02,096
In all

116
00:27:02,952 --> 00:27:04,281
In terms of content

117
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,371
Sahajayoga  stands.

118
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:10,257
And your All

119
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:12,876
The kingdom of God is brought.

120
00:27:13,939 --> 00:27:15,939
But it should be
worth sitting there.

121
00:27:17,128 --> 00:27:18,850
Thoughts should be independent

122
00:27:19,358 --> 00:27:23,180
Thinking that I got into
this clan I thought something

123
00:27:23,362 --> 00:27:25,362
Maratha of 96 clan

124
00:27:25,552 --> 00:27:27,098
Or I become brahmin

125
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:31,011
Content is all over us

126
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:34,060
liar again.

127
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:35,242
With credit

128
00:27:36,837 --> 00:27:38,837
Ashamed of sahajayogi

129
00:27:40,781 --> 00:27:42,234
I am sahajayogi

130
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,966
I'm free.

131
00:27:44,735 --> 00:27:47,961
I'm on the alert.
You told me something

132
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,985
And I'm not gonna do it

133
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:52,739
I stand at liberty

134
00:27:53,112 --> 00:27:55,112
I have autocorrect enabled

135
00:27:55,405 --> 00:27:57,018
You don't teach me anything

136
00:28:01,668 --> 00:28:03,827
Get away from all relations

137
00:28:04,755 --> 00:28:08,942
You will not be able to come up
like lotus until you swallow it all

138
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,154
Until then your anything
No use and no fun

139
00:28:18,336 --> 00:28:20,336
Now, if we have a
campaign like this

140
00:28:23,844 --> 00:28:28,749
In Pune, Come at Savarkar Statue

141
00:28:30,757 --> 00:28:31,921
so what you do there ?

142
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,600
So there were
thousands of people

143
00:28:37,965 --> 00:28:39,310
Unpleasantness

144
00:28:39,817 --> 00:28:40,845
If you want to teach

145
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:43,095
Thousands of people will leave

146
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,696
Run away

147
00:28:45,363 --> 00:28:46,944
Because there is Unpleasantness

148
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,269
But in the court of love

149
00:28:52,062 --> 00:28:54,062
Get rid of it all.

150
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:59,233
It is not ready.
All of this wears off in the dirt

151
00:29:03,684 --> 00:29:05,684
By breaking into this paradigm

152
00:29:07,248 --> 00:29:09,248
Stand in Sahajayoga

153
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,592
It should not weak

154
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,467
It should be strong

155
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:16,549
This is new

156
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:19,049
Such people should
be raised today

157
00:29:19,763 --> 00:29:23,730
thousands of mahatma gandhi
Thousands of lenin were raised

158
00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:29,854
thousands of like Abraham Lincoln
were raise like People should say

159
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:32,803
But there is no difference

160
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:36,679
That is what the nose,
the mouth and the feet are like

161
00:29:37,702 --> 00:29:39,702
Just look at how far the
soul has reached the light

162
00:29:42,424 --> 00:29:46,571
And we are saints,
we are saints.

163
00:29:47,602 --> 00:29:49,602
All this is a disorder

164
00:29:51,046 --> 00:29:53,046
It's a stigma for us

165
00:29:53,712 --> 00:29:58,866
We will break it down,religion and
all and forget about everything

166
00:30:00,143 --> 00:30:02,252
Unless you decide to

167
00:30:02,665 --> 00:30:04,665
You will not benefit at
all in the sahajayoga

168
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:07,259
And for us too, it's Trouble

169
00:30:11,052 --> 00:30:12,486
Let's get bigger

170
00:30:13,557 --> 00:30:15,557
The sea went anywhere

171
00:30:15,961 --> 00:30:17,316
That nobody is in the mind

172
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,471
That is our sea of Alibaug

173
00:30:22,249 --> 00:30:23,847
or is a Mumbai sea

174
00:30:24,902 --> 00:30:26,508
The ocean is ocean

175
00:30:26,865 --> 00:30:28,464
Such a saint is a saint

176
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:31,395
Which is a sign of saint and

177
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:34,946
The main symptom of this
is that apprehension

178
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,813
Artificial

179
00:30:37,845 --> 00:30:41,095
Beyond the artificial
small shrines

180
00:30:42,032 --> 00:30:43,232
Their vision is relaxed

181
00:30:43,882 --> 00:30:45,233
Very endearing

182
00:30:48,185 --> 00:30:53,113
At that time as a call for
cooperation, the whole world refuses

183
00:30:53,914 --> 00:30:55,576
The key is how we
become what you are

184
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:59,623
We are gonna do
whatever you want

185
00:31:00,432 --> 00:31:02,924
We are this we are that

186
00:31:03,844 --> 00:31:05,333
Who are you lets see

187
00:31:06,515 --> 00:31:08,515
So what do we do

188
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:13,427
Just get rid of this
illusion of stupidity

189
00:31:14,594 --> 00:31:16,594
You can remove
this with kundalini

190
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:20,014
Today they are cheearing
me for Adi Shakti ,so do it

191
00:31:21,323 --> 00:31:23,844
What happen with it but
what is the benefit.

192
00:31:27,002 --> 00:31:28,349
If ours

193
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,003
In cheers

194
00:31:31,073 --> 00:31:32,527
You forget all

195
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,225
Are under our mother's feet

196
00:31:36,058 --> 00:31:38,227
And this universe is made by her

197
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:43,796
We are special sahajayogi
from that world

198
00:31:44,431 --> 00:31:46,035
If you think about it

199
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:49,209
Then your own
perception will change

200
00:31:49,812 --> 00:31:50,993
And about self

201
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,226
Whichever is wrong ideas

202
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:54,942
they fix it

203
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:56,498
Among themselves

204
00:31:57,157 --> 00:31:57,921
love

205
00:31:59,373 --> 00:32:02,662
Not only that, but huge power

206
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:05,682
One is living among themselves

207
00:32:06,023 --> 00:32:06,764
Be aware of that

208
00:32:07,597 --> 00:32:09,597
And we with a great power

209
00:32:09,843 --> 00:32:11,237
Come together

210
00:32:11,602 --> 00:32:12,874
And with this power

211
00:32:13,318 --> 00:32:15,318
You will notice that
We are about to be saved

212
00:32:18,632 --> 00:32:21,887
Today some hindi language
known people who has come so

213
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:28,111
I always told to Marathi people
That you try to learn Hindi

214
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:31,099
Because its your
national language but

215
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:32,602
Will have to say to
Hindi people also

216
00:32:32,603 --> 00:32:35,609
Is it good to learn
a little Marathi

217
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:41,357
Although I think that The Marathi
language is a bit too powerful

218
00:32:41,357 --> 00:32:46,354
And its depth can not come in
any language okey leave Sanskrit

219
00:32:46,378 --> 00:32:49,859
After this any
Colloquial language has

220
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:56,477
For Kundalini Marathi language
is very smooth and very

221
00:32:59,732 --> 00:33:01,069
In use

222
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:04,672
However, the place of
Hindi language is very high

223
00:33:04,697 --> 00:33:07,855
and ever Marathi people
should know Hindi language

224
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:09,986
Similarly, you people also
have a Marathi Language

225
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,858
learning should not be difficult

226
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:15,855
What am I talking about today

227
00:33:15,855 --> 00:33:18,605
That of the big revolution
We stand on the post

228
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:24,603
Right now in front of us
It is a big request that

229
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:29,546
We are sahajayogi
Have earned yoga

230
00:33:29,859 --> 00:33:36,603
we are not like that Which
are full of dirty thoughts

231
00:33:36,603 --> 00:33:39,305
Who do not love each other

232
00:33:39,329 --> 00:33:43,553
and one Have violent
tendencies towards each other

233
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:48,102
We are yogis We gonna
join all over the world

234
00:33:48,102 --> 00:33:52,357
We are especially representative

235
00:33:52,357 --> 00:33:57,916
And we are saints and the
characteristics of saints

236
00:33:57,916 --> 00:34:01,169
Its in us Must seen

237
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:04,656
When it show everyone

238
00:34:04,656 --> 00:34:07,653
It will be understood that
Sahaja Yoga is a special thing

239
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,605
Otherwise people will think
that your sahajayogi then what?

240
00:34:10,605 --> 00:34:13,360
Your habits are the same
Your ways are the same

241
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,856
You fight likewise The
group bet is the same in you

242
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:20,358
All your values
Like that of others

243
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:23,358
So what about Sahaja Yoga?

244
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,857
In Sahaja Yoga we have
externally Received nothing

245
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:32,355
But the strong power
inside We live in

246
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:38,256
And all our world
have this power today

247
00:34:38,256 --> 00:34:42,258
See that The power is
inhabited by all of us.

248
00:34:42,258 --> 00:34:48,753
It is roaming inside us Her
beautiful environment inside

249
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,236
Made up and mutual
love and we know

250
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:58,832
Not so much, every
moment, Power feeds us

251
00:34:58,832 --> 00:35:01,979
Binds us to each other

252
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:06,225
This power is the formula of
the whole world that we got

253
00:35:06,225 --> 00:35:11,723
And when we found it We
do such useless things

254
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:17,227
Of course Ready to destroy life

255
00:35:17,432 --> 00:35:22,931
We have to evaluate ourselves Will
have to know what is our value

256
00:35:22,931 --> 00:35:26,687
And what did we
understand our life

257
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:30,436
I see that

258
00:35:30,436 --> 00:35:33,433
To quarrel is a human nature

259
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:35,932
Whatever happens to
him They start fighting

260
00:35:35,932 --> 00:35:39,183
Like this with dog
cat I am not even seen

261
00:35:39,685 --> 00:35:42,184
If anything happens It
becomes a matter of quarrel

262
00:35:42,184 --> 00:35:47,435
Even if love is something
Sahaja Yoga is only for love

263
00:35:48,684 --> 00:35:52,524
Movement just love movement

264
00:35:52,548 --> 00:35:55,278
And you are sitting
in the same movement

265
00:35:55,686 --> 00:36:03,436
A very beautiful and very sweet
This is the environment I travel to

266
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:09,664
But it can happen when
your subtlety Be so deep

267
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:16,288
That we can see that we are
representative of divine

268
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:20,905
Divine doing this job
from us What a great thing

269
00:36:21,034 --> 00:36:23,536
To achieve this unique thing

270
00:36:23,536 --> 00:36:29,534
You need to be aware of yourself
Be and be your own personality

271
00:36:29,534 --> 00:36:33,254
Give her such a
huge strain Tease

272
00:36:33,254 --> 00:36:37,283
Today is the first day
When everyone has come

273
00:36:37,283 --> 00:36:41,784
See how well everyone is sitting It is
a matter of great pride for a mother.

274
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:44,784
That all my children here
are gathered from the world

275
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:53,033
But every time I want
that you become aware

276
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:56,285
You have to know that Mother
is doing very big revolution

277
00:37:10,971 --> 00:37:12,527
You guys

278
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,606
Watch you wake up

279
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:18,042
That our mother

280
00:37:18,097 --> 00:37:19,487
That is a very big achievement

281
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:22,161
Which will wipe out all the universe

282
00:37:23,272 --> 00:37:25,804
This is a very big achievement

283
00:37:26,502 --> 00:37:28,502
Is doing and you

284
00:37:28,795 --> 00:37:30,396
We are in limbo.

285
00:37:32,148 --> 00:37:37,233
May god bless you
