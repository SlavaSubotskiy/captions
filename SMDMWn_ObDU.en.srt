1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,833
Today we have gathered here to do Shri Krishna Puja.

2
00:00:16,374 --> 00:00:24,583
We have to understand clearly that Shri Krishna

3
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:30,042
is a very, very important deity within us

4
00:00:31,374 --> 00:00:34,958
because He is the Vishnu,

5
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,167
who resides in the Void,

6
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,917
in the Nabhi.

7
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:52,708
He is the one who generates Dharma within us.

8
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:56,958
When you got your realization I didn’t tell you,

9
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:59,583
“Don’t do this. Don’t do that.”

10
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:05,000
I never told you that “This is not good. That is not good.”

11
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,500
You just did it

12
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:14,209
because Shri Vishnu was awakened within you.

13
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:17,375
He is in the Void

14
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:21,917
and if He is awakened

15
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:30,042
He brings you to the light,

16
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:33,958
removes your ignorance, removes your darkness,

17
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:38,458
and you start seeing that

18
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,833
whatever you were doing was destructive for you,

19
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:49,042
and that’s how the dharma is established.

20
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:53,125
Of course, the Dharma was established also

21
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:59,750
by all the ten Gurus who came on this earth,

22
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:04,416
the prophets, who taught us about dharma.

23
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:18,583
So this combination of Shri Vishnu

24
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:22,375
and the ten Gurus

25
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:28,209
is to establish Dharma within us.

26
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,541
Now this Dharma is taught by prophets,

27
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:33,625
as you have seen everywhere.

28
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:37,416
They have said, “Don’t do this. Don’t do that.”

29
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,209
They have talked of Ten Commandments.

30
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:46,583
Every prophet has talked about Dharma, what is to be done,

31
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:51,416
up to a point when Christ also had to talk about it

32
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:55,958
and He says, “Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

33
00:02:56,375 --> 00:03:04,666
But Shri Krishna is the one

34
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:10,750
who says that “I come on this earth

35
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:21,209
when there is a glani, means demise, of Dharma.”

36
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,833
When the Dharma becomes weak

37
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,583
then He comes on this Earth,

38
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:30,792
and then He destroys the people

39
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:36,416
who are responsible

40
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:45,875
for bringing Dharma to this level of doom.

41
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,875
The second thing He says, that

42
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:55,500
“I protect the saints. I protect the saints

43
00:03:56,875 --> 00:04:04,708
and I kill all those who are devils or who are satanic,

44
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,708
who are destructive.”

45
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:08,750
These are His promises

46
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:13,625
which He gave long time back as Shri Krishna.

47
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:18,833
As Vishnu we know Him only as the one

48
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,167
who is the giver of Dharma, mainly.

49
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:27,375
But all His potent qualities really were expressed

50
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:29,875
when He came as Shri Krishna.

51
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:33,458
At the time of Shri Rama also these qualities

52
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:36,833
could not be expressed in that way.

53
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:42,125
So Shri Krishna’s first half of His life

54
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,875
He spent in Gokul and Vrindavan

55
00:04:45,334 --> 00:04:53,000
where He showed His beautiful expression of His character,

56
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,458
as He made it,

57
00:04:57,917 --> 00:05:01,125
what He calls as Leela, Leeladhara,

58
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:06,334
the one who said that you become a witness;

59
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:11,250
you witness the whole world like a drama,

60
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,917
Sakshi Swarupa.

61
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:19,958
And then once you see the whole world as just

62
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:27,625
a child watches, in a child-like mirth and joy, you enjoy life.

63
00:05:28,042 --> 00:05:29,375
That has happened to you people

64
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,833
that you have become like citizens of Vrindavan and Gokul,

65
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,917
the way you are enjoying yourself,

66
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:42,625
enjoying each other’s company, enjoying the bliss of God.

67
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,917
Then He showed also by killing Kaliya,

68
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:48,583
by killing Putana and other people,

69
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:55,875
that if anybody tries to trouble such joyous children of God,

70
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:02,125
He is the one who will definitely protect

71
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:06,750
and kill all such evil forces which are troublesome.

72
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:12,084
But later on He becomes the king,

73
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,625
and when He becomes the king

74
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,374
He uses His powers in a different way.

75
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:24,792
First of all, if you see His own uncle, His own relation,

76
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:28,625
His own uncle, mother’s brother, was Kansa,

77
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:31,167
and was such a bad man.

78
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:35,833
So Shri Krishna didn’t spare him, He killed him.

79
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,458
He killed so many people.

80
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:42,583
Before becoming the king, He killed so many people.

81
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:50,334
Now what does that mean, that His own uncle He killed?

82
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:58,375
One quality that He has, which Christ had, we can say,

83
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:04,374
or so many saints had, is forgiveness.

84
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,583
He did not believe in forgiveness.

85
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:14,167
He’s the only one who said that, “I have to punish.”

86
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,875
We have to have somebody who should punish also.

87
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:20,000
If you are like Shiva,

88
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:23,209
then Shiva used to even love rakshasas

89
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:28,250
and in His innocence He used to give them also blessings.

90
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:35,250
But Shri Krishna did not believe in forgiveness at all

91
00:07:36,084 --> 00:07:40,167
because it was important that there should be

92
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,708
somebody with a very stern mind,

93
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,958
with such a stern understanding that a devil is a devil,

94
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:50,792
and devil must be killed.

95
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:56,750
He has done in His lifetime,

96
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,125
if you see, killing of so many people.

97
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,958
That doesn’t mean that we have right to kill anybody.

98
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:06,167
He was Shri Krishna; we are not.

99
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:10,666
We have to forgive because we are human beings.

100
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:14,708
Once we forgive we transfer all our anger,

101
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:23,416
all our attitude of taking revenge, to Shri Krishna.

102
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,042
He takes over.

103
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:30,334
Once you say that “I forgive,” then He takes over,

104
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,625
because He does not forgive.

105
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:38,875
He will immediately take over from you

106
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:43,334
and if it is justifiable, if it is necessary

107
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:49,375
He will punish the people who are torturing saints,

108
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,666
who are destroying the dharma.

109
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,292
Now it is very surprising

110
00:08:56,583 --> 00:09:00,334
that whatever is preached by the person,

111
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:05,084
that area becomes just the opposite of it.

112
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,042
Is very surprising.

113
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,375
Like we said that Christ said,

114
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,833
“Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

115
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:20,084
Christians are the worst as far as their eyes are concerned.

116
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:27,125
In the same way, in the Hindu religion it is said that

117
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,375
everybody has the spirit.

118
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:36,625
Still the Hindus believe in the different castes and communities

119
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,625
and fight with each other.

120
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:47,250
Everything that was preached, just the opposite of it is followed.

121
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,374
If you read even Koran, in the Koran,

122
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,334
Mohammed Sahib has all the time

123
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,292
said about rahmat, means compassion.

124
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,375
But you don’t find it anywhere.

125
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,416
He has not said about shariat,

126
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:02,167
He has not said of many things

127
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,666
which are being practiced by Muslims, just on their own.

128
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,458
He never said that women should cover their face

129
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,042
or cover their heads,

130
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,917
but it is practiced and not practiced but vengeance.

131
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:21,833
So what it shows to us is this, that whatever is preached,

132
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:26,541
just the opposite of that people try to do.

133
00:10:29,084 --> 00:10:33,917
And when such things happen, the dharma goes down.

134
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:40,000
Now as you know that Krishna, His country is America.

135
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,292
He rules over America.

136
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:50,833
So it is a rich country because Shri Krishna is Kubera.

137
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:54,958
He is the Lord of wealth.

138
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:59,084
So, He has given wealth to America.

139
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:07,250
Then He is Vachana, means communication.

140
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:13,541
His another quality is that He is the one who communicated.

141
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:18,541
It was He who danced with gopis and gopas.

142
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,958
It was He who transferred His powers to them.

143
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:32,583
So the communication part is one of His greatest qualities

144
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:35,334
that is working in America.

145
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:40,917
So they are going just the opposite way

146
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:44,125
that if there is a war, say, with Saddam Hussein,

147
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,458
so America is going.

148
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,500
If there’s Korean War, America is going.

149
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:54,541
Everywhere there is any problem, America has to go.

150
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,125
I mean, one can ask question,

151
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,125
“Who are you? Why, why are you bothered?

152
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,416
Keep to your own country enjoying yourself.

153
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,625
Why are you sending troops all over?

154
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,375
Why are you looking after everyone?”

155
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,334
Even the formation of UN and all that is done

156
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:11,666
under the guidance of the Americans.

157
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:14,334
They play a very important part

158
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:18,292
in the formation of this United Nations

159
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:24,000
and one world and peace and all sorts of things.

160
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:30,833
But actually, if you see, the main thing that Krishna had taught,

161
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,708
they are missing.

162
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:35,750
They are all right for communication.

163
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:39,583
They are all right for establishing

164
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:42,750
relationships between countries.

165
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:47,334
But the worst thing they have done is that there is no dharma,

166
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:51,334
no idea of dharma, no morality.

167
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:55,917
Democracy without morality.

168
00:12:56,374 --> 00:13:01,875
To talk of morality in America is something out of the blue.

169
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:06,875
They cannot understand anyone who talks of morality.

170
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:11,583
Now, of course, the pangs of their doings

171
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,000
is really torturing them.

172
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:19,500
And also they are realizing, some of them,

173
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:23,125
that because of immoral behavior

174
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:28,167
they have come to a point where

175
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,833
sixty-five percent people of that country who are Americans

176
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:39,583
may suffer from some disease or may just die out

177
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:42,292
at a very young age.

178
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:47,833
When it is coming

179
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:55,167
as a starking

180
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,375
information is a shock.

181
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:06,416
But despite that, despite all this,

182
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:09,917
they are still going on with it and thinking that

183
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:15,167
“No, no, no, it’s all right. It’s not for us. What is there to worry?”

184
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:19,792
Now His punishments have started,

185
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,167
which they don’t realize how the punishment has started.

186
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:29,125
Now supposing somebody is leading an immoral life

187
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:34,084
and as a result he develops some disease.

188
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:39,125
Now this disease is not curable.

189
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,042
They try everything to find out the ways and methods

190
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,917
of curing these diseases which are coming

191
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:49,875
out of immoral living. They cannot.

192
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:56,458
It’s an impossible task for all the medical sciences of America

193
00:14:56,708 --> 00:15:00,833
to find out how to cure these particular diseases

194
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,583
which are coming out of immorality.

195
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:06,917
But the worst part is that they cannot even say

196
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:11,209
that immorality is wrong.

197
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:17,541
They cannot even openly admit that immoral behavior

198
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,292
leads to these things.

199
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:26,292
And this immorality is completely neglected

200
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,500
in a country of Shri Krishna where He was born,

201
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,833
always He says, just to establish morality.

202
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,167
Artificial morality, that is there,

203
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:45,084
like the Islamic talk about or the Christians talk about

204
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:50,750
or Hindus talk about, is artificial, where they are hypocritical.

205
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:53,541
They follow one code of conduct

206
00:15:53,958 --> 00:16:01,042
and another they have for themselves secretly adopted.

207
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:05,125
But America is an open thing.

208
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:08,875
Whatsoever they are doing they are not hiding it.

209
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:11,458
They say, “We don’t believe in hypocrisy.”

210
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,541
So they are not hiding it.

211
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:17,875
And this has led this country, such a vast,

212
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,833
beautiful, rich, prosperous country,

213
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:24,750
into such a ditch that I do not know

214
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,875
how it is going to recover unless and until

215
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,750
it takes to Sahaja Yoga.

216
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:37,416
Now another thing what dharma does to a normal person?

217
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:41,125
A dharmic person is the one who is always

218
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,875
introspective by nature.

219
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:51,167
He tries to see, “Am I doing things all right? Is it correct?”

220
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:56,708
He doesn’t allow his mind to justify wrong things.

221
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,250
That is one of the signs of a real dharmic person.

222
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,209
He may not be a Sahaja yogi.

223
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:08,708
But he will ask himself, “Is it right or is it wrong?”

224
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:14,458
But that capacity is completely gone in America.

225
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:17,833
They never try to introspect themselves.

226
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:22,374
On the contrary, they always say, “What’s wrong?”

227
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,500
Those people who go on like this

228
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:34,583
will definitely fall into a mess of things

229
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:42,500
that will have no moral conductor, moral guidance.

230
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:51,500
It is introspection which gives you a awakened conscience.

231
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:55,374
It’s conscience which tells you, “This is wrong.”

232
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,875
They may be guided in one part.

233
00:17:58,292 --> 00:18:00,917
For example, you see, they might say that

234
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:05,500
“We are all right in administration,” maybe, or,

235
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:12,374
“We are all right for, say, our railways, our shipping,

236
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:17,374
our other things, or maybe other economic banks

237
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,374
or whatever it is.”

238
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,708
But all these things are extremely superficial

239
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:26,625
for human beings and they are outside.

240
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:32,250
The inside is all managed by the conscience

241
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:38,374
and also through moral inspection of yourself.

242
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:41,416
People say, “Mother, what is this conscience is?”

243
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,292
This conscience is there.

244
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:49,042
It is there all the time, but a person who has to be

245
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:53,250
conscious about it. “I have a conscience”.

246
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:57,500
And this conscience has to answer.

247
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,625
That conscience that is within us is,

248
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:07,666
is the light of Shri Krishna within us even before realization.

249
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,708
As you know, the ascent takes place, of Kundalini,

250
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,334
through the Sushumna which is guided by Mahalakshmi.

251
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,416
She is the power of Shri Krishna.

252
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,958
By listening to your conscience

253
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:34,666
you develop a proper channel of Mahalakshmi within yourself.

254
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,583
But the people who have no conscience,

255
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,209
in a particular line it’s not so; it is in every line, in every way.

256
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,375
Otherwise, one chakra will be all right,

257
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:47,167
another chakra will be in jeopardy.

258
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:51,500
So the conscience has to be referred to,

259
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:55,292
which is beyond rationality. It is not rationality.

260
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:58,917
Something may look like rational to kill somebody

261
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:00,875
or to snatch somebody’s money

262
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:05,209
or to grab somebody’s land. May seem.

263
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:10,042
But conscience will tell you that this is not right.

264
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,875
At a time when people invaded so many countries

265
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:17,750
and tried to overpower them,

266
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,708
it was America which was the only country,

267
00:20:21,084 --> 00:20:24,416
you must understand, never went out of their bounds

268
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,374
to become empires.

269
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,084
Very surprising, what kept them there.

270
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,416
Because at that time when all this nonsense was going on

271
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:38,917
all over the world, and that era when people

272
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:41,209
didn’t mind subjecting other people,

273
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,666
taking away their lands and becoming this thing,

274
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,250
America had stopped at that time.

275
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,334
Before doing that, they had done once for all.

276
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,958
They had occupied the area, they became the landlords,

277
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:59,167
they became this. Of course they were foreigners.

278
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,708
But after having done that,

279
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:05,541
the era when the people started expanding their empire,

280
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:08,917
they did not do it.

281
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:13,125
Now what is the reason? Why they didn’t do it?

282
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,500
We should ask a question:

283
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,666
when others were expanding their empires,

284
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
why did not America do it?

285
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,875
The reason is very simple.

286
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:28,750
At that time some great people with great conscience

287
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,167
were born in that country

288
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:35,042
and they guided that country.

289
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:39,666
Like, you can say, Washington was there.

290
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:45,541
Of course, there were so many people, whom if I name there,

291
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:47,666
there will be a big list of those people.

292
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,084
But if you see their character, their life, the way they lived.

293
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,625
Abraham Lincoln, if you see his life,

294
00:21:54,084 --> 00:21:57,000
full of conscience, full of conscience.

295
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:02,666
And they didn’t allow the nation to be drifted away

296
00:22:03,084 --> 00:22:06,084
to the ambition of gathering other countries

297
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,750
and making them their slaves and ...

298
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:11,625
This they didn’t do.

299
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:17,917
So in the first place when the,

300
00:22:18,334 --> 00:22:20,833
when, I should say, Columbus went there, conquered them,

301
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:26,375
and tried to … actually, he didn’t do much.

302
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:29,458
But Spanish and then others, and then Anglo-Saxons,

303
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,541
all of them, when they conquered that country,

304
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,666
once they settled down there,

305
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:41,541
as if that era was over for them once for all,

306
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:45,334
and then they started talking about freedom,

307
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:50,042
of democracy, of higher values.

308
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:57,666
But the karmas of their past,

309
00:22:58,292 --> 00:23:03,458
the way they killed so many aboriginals,

310
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:06,500
so many Red Indians,

311
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,042
will not be forgiven by Shri Krishna

312
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:16,917
unless and until now they take to Sahaja Yoga.

313
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:21,708
Despite that time when they did not try

314
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:25,541
to overpower other countries and to spread their empire

315
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:31,750
and do all kinds of cruelties, like Hitler, they didn’t do that.

316
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,416
And they always stood for something that is justice …

317
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:37,625
tried to, I mean, at least.

318
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,666
Then they became hypocritical also but on the whole,

319
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:45,042
on the face of it, they tried to show

320
00:23:45,374 --> 00:23:48,374
that they are for uniting the whole world.

321
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:53,458
They are against racialism, against fundamentalism, all these,

322
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:59,209
I mean, just some sort of an idealism they propagated.

323
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:06,000
But despite all that, all these ideas of self-destruction

324
00:24:06,374 --> 00:24:08,917
started working in them.

325
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:14,334
So I would say it is nothing but their karmas

326
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:18,541
are working against them.

327
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:25,292
And that’s how the violence is so much rampant there.

328
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,416
So many diseases, so many things,

329
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:34,209
it is very remarkable that all these troubles have started

330
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:38,750
very, very recently in America,

331
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,958
because the exposure is coming up.

332
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:48,374
To add up to that, we had lots of false gurus

333
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:53,958
who went there and captured

334
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,792
innocent, simple people who were seeking the truth.

335
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,416
We have lost so many of them in America.

336
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:05,917
Also there, I would say, in the atmosphere where these

337
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:09,334
curses of the people whom they had killed,

338
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:14,625
which reacted, and they took to something that was wrong.

339
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:17,666
Why should they have taken to wrong things

340
00:25:18,042 --> 00:25:21,500
as far as their personal life is concerned?

341
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:24,125
Freedom was given to them

342
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:28,625
but they thought freedom is there also to ruin themselves

343
00:25:29,084 --> 00:25:32,375
or to make a mess out of their lives.

344
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:36,708
This is a wrong idea which worked in them.

345
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:39,500
Then the whole idea became collective.

346
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,583
When it became collective they found out that people

347
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,750
like all those things that are destructive.

348
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:48,292
So, we have Hollywood there,

349
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,375
we have all such organizations and musicians

350
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:59,875
and big, big, we can say, destructive forces

351
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:08,000
which have formed groups and militant organizations

352
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:15,625
which openly say that “We are that.”

353
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,833
For example, only in America we have satan’s,

354
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:27,500
satan’s organization, devils’ organizations.

355
00:26:28,084 --> 00:26:32,292
Then there’s witchcraft. Openly.

356
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:38,000
Openly, they are registered organizations in America,

357
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,958
when nowhere in the world you can have such a thing

358
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:43,292
that this is a black magic organization,

359
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:45,250
this is a witchcraft organization,

360
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:48,833
openly they are registered there.

361
00:26:49,334 --> 00:26:52,541
So to such an extent they have gone;

362
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,458
and accepted collectively.

363
00:26:56,917 --> 00:27:01,583
The reason is the punishment.

364
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:07,708
That’s why America is the most difficult place for us,

365
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:11,500
for Sahaja Yoga.

366
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:14,583
One must have real sympathy for them.

367
00:27:15,084 --> 00:27:19,583
They are now passing through the phase of punishment,

368
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:24,958
because their forefathers did all kinds of wrong things

369
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:30,375
and they, too, never accepted Dharma as a principle of life.

370
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:34,375
They thought that Dharma means killing your freedom;

371
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:39,334
dharma means it takes away your personal, private life

372
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:45,458
into the hands of something else.

373
00:27:45,917 --> 00:27:50,875
So to establish Dharma in America,

374
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,375
what can we do?

375
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:56,541
I’ve been to America at least ten times

376
00:27:56,958 --> 00:28:00,292
more than I’ve been to Russia

377
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:07,958
and I want to really somehow or other bring to their notice that

378
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,500
"You have lost your Dharma."

379
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,374
But this will never appeal to them

380
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,042
because they are very egoistical.

381
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:17,458
If you tell them like that, then they’ll be very angry.

382
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:20,334
On the contrary, those who tell them, like Rajneesh

383
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:24,167
and all these people, “Oh, this, no dharma,” their weaknesses,

384
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:27,875
their egos are pampered. Then they are very happy.

385
00:28:28,334 --> 00:28:30,875
So it’s a difficult task in that country

386
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:35,458
to make people understand that you are under punishment,

387
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:38,625
that this punishment you can only overcome

388
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:41,292
if you become Sahaja yogis.

389
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:45,334
With Sahaja Yoga their dharma will be awakened

390
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:51,209
and all their punishments and all their curses will be over.

391
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:54,209
It is America which needs Sahaja Yoga much more

392
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,416
than any other country.

393
00:28:56,875 --> 00:29:00,375
My concern for America is for the same reason.

394
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:03,375
I’m not saying so much about South America

395
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:06,250
but more about the North America.

396
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:09,750
But even in South America, what I found is

397
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:18,334
that it is a kind of a nation

398
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:26,374
where they have no guidance at all about Dharma, no guidance.

399
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:30,084
Openly they are doing carnival, this, that.

400
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:35,708
I mean, how can you do it in a country, all those things?

401
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:39,666
They are following the footsteps of North America.

402
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:43,000
Like in North America they have that Halloween nonsense.

403
00:29:43,374 --> 00:29:44,833
I mean, imagine openly on the street

404
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,125
doing Halloween nonsense.

405
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,042
So they are following carnival.

406
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:52,416
To them, “Ah, what a thing it is to go to Rio,”

407
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:56,416
as if there is a very big achievement and going into that carnival

408
00:29:56,792 --> 00:29:57,917
from all over the places.

409
00:29:58,374 --> 00:30:02,583
From Australia people are coming down.

410
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:09,167
All this is working against them very much.

411
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,875
Their situation is so bad in so many ways

412
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:20,000
that it is not easy to explain why they are going to that limit.

413
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:26,625
Like thirteen-year-old girls are made into prostitutes in Brazil.

414
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,458
Openly.

415
00:30:31,334 --> 00:30:35,375
All their trees are cut in Amazon. Openly.

416
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,875
Whole smuggling is done, openly.

417
00:30:39,334 --> 00:30:41,750
Their politicians are corrupt.

418
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:45,583
There, I mean, so much of black magic there,

419
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,917
so much of black magic. Openly that.

420
00:30:49,374 --> 00:30:55,375
They are just following the footsteps of North America.

421
00:30:55,875 --> 00:31:00,833
The Dharma is like this Catholic Church is there.

422
00:31:01,334 --> 00:31:04,792
What is it going to teach them Dharma, this Catholic Church?

423
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:08,374
So they go to church, they do everything

424
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:14,792
and they come back home with same ideas that they have.

425
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:19,374
There are countries and countries which are so very poor.

426
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:25,000
So that shows that Kubera’s attention is not on that country.

427
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:29,042
Normally, poor people are dharmic, normally.

428
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:31,833
Because you see, money gives them these ideas

429
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:35,167
to do all nonsensical things and ego.

430
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:40,750
Normally, the poor people are dharmic but there it is different.

431
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:44,209
They indulge into black magic too much.

432
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:47,374
They were telling Me that it is the black magic

433
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:50,209
which came from Africa and they have accepted.

434
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:54,250
But so much it is developed in South America

435
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:57,792
that it is impossible to understand that

436
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,000
how they have accepted this nonsense

437
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:04,792
so easily to curse themselves.

438
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,000
Now, we have to understand that these problems

439
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:13,666
also exist within ourselves, on our Vishuddhi Chakra.

440
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:20,375
If we have to keep our Vishuddhi Chakra all right,

441
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:26,167
we have two sides as you know, is the left and the right.

442
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:34,374
So the right side is the Vishuddhi Chakra which is speaking,

443
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:37,958
which is talking about Dharma,

444
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:43,708
which is on the aggressive side, we can say.

445
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:48,084
Now those people who are aggressive,

446
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,375
who talk in an aggressive manner,

447
00:32:50,792 --> 00:32:56,666
who are, say, trying to dominate others by their talks,

448
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:01,250
are the people who are right-sided.

449
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:06,250
I’ve seen people, those who really do wrong things.

450
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:10,792
Say, a person, a servant steals something.

451
00:33:11,374 --> 00:33:15,374
You call him, he’ll be so rude to you that you’ll be amazed.

452
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:17,084
This man is so rude.

453
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:22,375
How can he, how can have been able to steal something?

454
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:26,917
He’s not afraid; he’s answering you back so nicely.

455
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:29,625
So those people who are right-sided

456
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:32,583
can cover up any sin that they have committed,

457
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,250
any wrong they have done,

458
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:38,000
any murder they have done, by their talk.

459
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:43,334
It could be a talk which is very aggressive, blatant.

460
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:47,875
People might think, “Oh, how can that be?

461
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:51,458
This man is telling so loudly everything,”

462
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:54,917
and you just, you are stunned and you think,

463
00:33:55,292 --> 00:33:58,334
“No, it’s not possible. How can a person who says this thing ?”

464
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:02,958
In this way we, too, as ordinary human beings,

465
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:07,917
indulge into all kinds of nonsensical things

466
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:12,292
and then we try to justify it by talking,

467
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:15,042
wriggling out of it.

468
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:21,917
You know as many criminals, war criminals,

469
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:25,917
have come out of it by just talking,

470
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:29,750
by creating stories, by showing something like that.

471
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:33,209
That also is with all human beings,

472
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:36,666
they have this capacity to say something

473
00:34:37,084 --> 00:34:41,334
by which to hide whatever wrong you are doing.

474
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:43,958
But it is never realized by them

475
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:49,084
that whatever harm you have done is not going to be forgiven

476
00:34:50,334 --> 00:34:53,833
and will be less forgiven when you talk like this,

477
00:34:54,374 --> 00:34:57,250
because Shri Krishna is finished.

478
00:34:57,792 --> 00:35:03,167
If you start justifying, rationalizing all your wrong things,

479
00:35:03,792 --> 00:35:08,708
then you will be punished and you will be punished very badly

480
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:13,792
in so many ways that you will not know how to get it out of it.

481
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:18,833
Physically, mentally, emotionally, every way you’ll be.

482
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:26,708
So our Right Vishuddhi we have to have a temperament,

483
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:31,625
a culture, a style, a behavior

484
00:35:32,084 --> 00:35:34,875
which has got the quality of Shri Krishna,

485
00:35:35,292 --> 00:35:40,458
which is called as madhurya, means melodious, melodious.

486
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:45,416
We should talk in such a manner that it should be melodious.

487
00:35:45,917 --> 00:35:48,958
The person who listens to you,

488
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:57,000
listens as if he’s listening to the flute of Shri Krishna.

489
00:35:57,458 --> 00:36:01,750
The voice of a Sahaja yogi should be sweet like that.

490
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:07,541
When you talk to someone it should be melodious.

491
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,084
It should not be aggressive, at all,

492
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,458
but on the contrary it should be melodious.

493
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:17,833
It should not be sarcastic; it should not hurt another person.

494
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:22,917
Any word that hurts others cannot be coming

495
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:25,875
from the proper type of Right Vishuddhi.

496
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:30,042
So in no way one should hurt.

497
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:35,250
I wish all the Sahaja yogis develop that melodious voice

498
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:39,209
of Shri Krishna as their Vishuddhi is awakened.

499
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:45,792
Madhurya, in his behavior, madhurya is – you see,

500
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:50,792
while talking to someone there are so many gestures by which

501
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:55,000
you can express your madhurya.

502
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,625
For example, specially in Italy and other places,

503
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:02,833
I’ve seen people use too much of their hands.

504
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,917
This is also Shri Krishna’s style.

505
00:37:05,374 --> 00:37:07,125
So they use their hands in such a way

506
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,209
that sometimes you don’t understand what they are meaning.

507
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:13,875
And sometimes it can be quite aggressive also,

508
00:37:14,292 --> 00:37:15,875
the way they use their hands.

509
00:37:16,292 --> 00:37:19,209
Now, the hands must be used in such a way

510
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:22,625
that it should create madhurya.

511
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:28,209
I’ve seen this in Russia or specially in Eastern blocs

512
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:32,000
where people, they have to express their love

513
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:37,125
– [just put like this, it’s cold] – if they have to say namaste.

514
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:40,084
The whole expression is so sweet,

515
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:46,750
and also their heart is very full when they see Me.

516
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:49,209
So they don’t know how to express it.

517
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:53,917
So they just put their hands like this.

518
00:37:54,374 --> 00:37:56,541
Or they feel shy, they do like this.

519
00:37:57,084 --> 00:38:01,167
Very, very sweet things they express through their hands,

520
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:06,958
through their eyes. It is the tears, you see,

521
00:38:07,374 --> 00:38:15,000
that really create such clouds of, I should say,

522
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:18,042
very dense clouds of compassion in My heart

523
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:23,000
when I see their eyes expressing their love for Me.

524
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:28,708
Everything, the tears, everything, that’s the face,

525
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:34,292
the eyes, the hands, all these belong to Shri Krishna.

526
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,917
So in their behavior, in their talking,

527
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:42,042
how they express themselves.

528
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:44,250
You can use the same eyes

529
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:46,708
for showing your temper and getting angry.

530
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:49,958
Many people use eyes for controlling others.

531
00:38:50,374 --> 00:38:53,833
They’ll put their eyes like this, stare at someone, try to control.

532
00:38:54,334 --> 00:39:00,541
They may use their eyes also for condemning someone.

533
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:05,374
Also sometimes they use, sort of spit at someone

534
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:12,000
or try to show the tongue to insult someone.

535
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:19,292
So in the behavior also we must have a kind of a sweetness.

536
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:22,875
Like when I went to, went to England first,

537
00:39:23,374 --> 00:39:26,209
I was, you see, I learnt English in My own way.

538
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:28,666
But when I went there newly they said,

539
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,084
“Now, if you have to say word like ‘thought’

540
00:39:31,375 --> 00:39:34,084
you must say ‘thought’.” I said, “What?”

541
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:37,792
“You must take out your tongue and say ‘thought’”.

542
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:41,625
I said, “Is absurd. Why should you take out your tongue?”

543
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:45,167
He said, “Unless and until you take out your tongue like that

544
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,958
is not something, proper expression.”

545
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,375
So I said, “This is English. You have developed

546
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,833
some nonsensical things, to show tongue at it, everyone.”

547
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,167
Even a child, you know, when he gets angry

548
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,833
automatically he shows his tongue.

549
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:06,292
So you see all these expressions are – and making faces now,

550
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:09,833
as they say that ‘stiff upper lip,’ you see.

551
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:13,375
You must have heard about that, with a nose like that, you see,

552
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:16,833
snooty nose or a face where you just make your faces

553
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:23,458
and make a crooked face just to tease someone

554
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:28,583
or to make an expression out of your nose.

555
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:30,375
Also people do it like this, you see,

556
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:33,666
to show as if you are sneezing at that person.

557
00:40:34,167 --> 00:40:36,708
All these things, expressions, are coming

558
00:40:37,209 --> 00:40:43,833
out of Shri Krishna’s grace, but the power of that is madhurya,

559
00:40:44,374 --> 00:40:47,625
is the sweetness, the melodiousness;

560
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:54,084
the rapport should be so sweet that that rapport should create

561
00:40:54,541 --> 00:40:57,708
tremendous joy and tremendous happiness.

562
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:02,541
As you have heard the song of Baba Mama’s on My eyes:

563
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:07,042
only I looked at him, I say with that glance

564
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:10,500
– that generated that beautiful music in him.

565
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:14,917
So, as far as possible, as far as possible,

566
00:41:15,334 --> 00:41:18,833
try to put your eyes on the greenery; that’s the best.

567
00:41:19,334 --> 00:41:23,750
Then it soothes down and also you develop

568
00:41:24,209 --> 00:41:26,917
the soothing quality of the greenery.

569
00:41:27,374 --> 00:41:30,000
I always tell people that “Better see the greenery around,

570
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:31,666
how it soothes your eyes.”

571
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:35,666
In the same way you should try to soothe

572
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:38,917
the other person when you talk to that person.

573
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:40,875
The person must melt.

574
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:45,167
Instead of that, if you start arguing and fighting with that person,

575
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:46,750
that person will never melt.

576
00:41:47,084 --> 00:41:51,209
On the contrary, you’ll be adding fire, more fire to that person.

577
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:55,541
That was the quality of Shri Krishna, is the madhurya,

578
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,792
and that it is expressed in His lifetime

579
00:42:01,209 --> 00:42:05,250
how He beautifully managed to say things

580
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:11,875
in His own sweetness, specially in His childhood.

581
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:16,209
The another quality which Shri Krishna has, which

582
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:22,708
we can express through our Right Vishuddhi, is diplomacy.

583
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:25,042
But there are two types of diplomacies:

584
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:27,917
one is genuine; one who is artificial.

585
00:42:28,374 --> 00:42:33,042
In the genuine diplomacy you do not have to take to

586
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:37,416
a certain standard or you don’t have to read some books

587
00:42:37,917 --> 00:42:41,125
to know what is diplomacy.

588
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:44,708
Is a genuinely it comes to you.

589
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:48,375
It, the whole thing works very sweetly,

590
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:51,833
in such a genuine manner.

591
00:42:52,292 --> 00:42:55,042
I, I have used it many-a-times Myself,

592
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:57,875
and you all can use it also many-a-times.

593
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,292
That’s only possible if you don’t get angry with them;

594
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:04,416
not possible if you are angry.

595
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:08,875
Now, there’s a story I’ve told you about some,

596
00:43:09,334 --> 00:43:10,666
this Gagangiri Maharaj.

597
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,084
I went to meet him and he was very angry

598
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,209
because he could not stop the rain.

599
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:18,000
He was supposed to stop the rain.

600
00:43:18,374 --> 00:43:19,958
And I was all drenched.

601
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:22,042
And he was so angry and he said that

602
00:43:22,374 --> 00:43:24,625
“Is it my ego You are trying to control?”

603
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:27,541
and like that he started little bit fighting with Me.

604
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,833
I said, “No, that’s not the reason.”

605
00:43:30,334 --> 00:43:33,541
He said, “Why? Why did You not allow me to stop the rain?

606
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:34,708
You are all drenched.”

607
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:37,583
I said, “Because you are a sanyasi

608
00:43:37,917 --> 00:43:39,209
and you bought a sari for Me.

609
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,374
I would not take a sari from a sanyasi.

610
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,833
So I had to get drenched, for your sake.”

611
00:43:44,334 --> 00:43:48,792
The whole thing finished off.

612
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,583
The whole anger, temper, finished off.

613
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:55,917
This is how we have to melt people.

614
00:43:56,375 --> 00:44:01,583
The diplomacy is not convincing anybody

615
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:05,750
with his intellect or by temper or anything

616
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:12,084
but it is to melt away another person by your goodness,

617
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,917
by your good words, by your sweet words,

618
00:44:15,334 --> 00:44:17,167
by your forgiving nature.

619
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:22,250
This quality He had and He tried this on many people.

620
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:25,374
It worked on some; it did not work on some.

621
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,375
He didn’t feel it’s a failure.

622
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,875
It’s the reaction of the another person

623
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,375
which is important to be seen.

624
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:36,292
So this quality of Right Vishuddhi you should have,

625
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:41,458
is to talk to others and melt them away.

626
00:44:41,792 --> 00:44:45,917
I hope in America people develop this quality

627
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:50,250
and try to improve relations with each other.

628
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:53,583
Actually, to talk to they are very sweet, I must say.

629
00:44:54,042 --> 00:44:55,625
They get very friendly with you.

630
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,625
You give them any number of presents,

631
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,666
they’ll be very happy but they’ll never give you any present.

632
00:45:01,084 --> 00:45:03,042
You call them for dinner, anything,

633
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:06,209
they’ll ten times they will come to your house for dinner

634
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:08,541
but they will never call you for dinner.

635
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,416
You see, they are very friendly as long

636
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,334
as you are doing anything for them.

637
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:17,292
But when it comes to returning it they find it difficult;

638
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:21,292
they don’t do it. So, you see the whole thing amounts

639
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:24,917
to be a very sweet exploitation of another person.

640
00:45:25,416 --> 00:45:28,334
This is what is to be understood that by sweetness

641
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:32,125
you are not going to exploit anyone but by sweetness

642
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,375
you are going to melt that person and bring him to the level

643
00:45:36,792 --> 00:45:42,209
that he can understand what is goodness.

644
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:45,666
Now, about South America, I’ve already told you

645
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:50,750
that they are extremely simple and innocent people.

646
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:54,042
They are very poor, simple, innocent,

647
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,500
but what has entered them into is this black magic,

648
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,792
and which they are now realizing, luckily,

649
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:05,000
that this is black magic which is troubling them.

650
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:07,917
But somehow they have depended on it so much,

651
00:46:08,334 --> 00:46:09,416
on the left side.

652
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:12,042
They feel very guilty about it; they feel very bad.

653
00:46:12,374 --> 00:46:14,750
All the time you find them absolutely guilty.

654
00:46:15,209 --> 00:46:16,708
Their whole behavior is that

655
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:19,250
as if they have done something wrong

656
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:22,541
but they do not know how to correct themselves.

657
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,583
So for us is important not to feel guilty about anything.

658
00:46:28,042 --> 00:46:30,625
We are all Sahaja yogis.

659
00:46:31,042 --> 00:46:33,708
How can we have guilt after all, when we are the spirit?

660
00:46:34,084 --> 00:46:35,833
Spirit cannot have the guilt.

661
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,084
So this guilt has to go away.

662
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:43,583
But by guilt what do we do, what we lose is the witness power,

663
00:46:44,042 --> 00:46:47,125
because when there is a guilt we put it here, the guilt is there.

664
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:50,042
But we cannot see.

665
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:53,750
We cannot witness what’s wrong

666
00:46:54,209 --> 00:46:56,167
and we do not want to face the difficulty,

667
00:46:56,458 --> 00:47:00,374
our mistakes or the difficulty we have.

668
00:47:00,792 --> 00:47:02,875
Just put it as a guilt here, finished.

669
00:47:03,209 --> 00:47:05,209
Is stored up there nicely, guilt.

670
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:07,292
But we do not want to face it.

671
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:11,792
For example a man, say, or a woman is very cruel by nature.

672
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:15,708
Then suddenly she realizes that she has been cruel

673
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:18,084
or whatever it is. So she puts it down there,

674
00:47:18,416 --> 00:47:20,292
“Oh, I’ve been very bad. I’ve been very cruel,

675
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:24,458
this thing, that thing.” But she doesn’t face it.

676
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:27,250
Facing means she should know, “Why was I cruel?

677
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:29,708
What was the need for me? I should not have been cruel

678
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:33,541
and now I will not be cruel anymore.” That finishes off.

679
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:37,500
But, “I’m very guilty about it. I’m very guilty about it,”

680
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,958
doesn’t help. On the contrary, you know,

681
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,875
what are the problems are of the guilt,

682
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:46,583
and the same problems are today faced by South America.

683
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:49,958
When I went there I was surprised that in Brazil

684
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:55,750
the man who was the topmost there talked to Me in a manner,

685
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:58,583
“Oh, we are, we know we have lots of defects.

686
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,084
We know we are no good,” this, that.

687
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:04,708
What I just say, why doesn’t he correct?

688
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,292
If he knows this is the mistake, this is the thing,

689
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:12,833
why shouldn’t he correct? Then he told Me that

690
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:15,750
“You write to me all the things You found wrong with us.”

691
00:48:16,209 --> 00:48:17,958
And it was really very sweet of him.

692
00:48:18,416 --> 00:48:22,000
So then one journalist came and we told him.

693
00:48:22,334 --> 00:48:24,458
And now I think they are doing something about it.

694
00:48:24,792 --> 00:48:27,375
They are trying to improve it and things will improve definitely.

695
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:32,375
But on the contrary I found that Russia is very different.

696
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:35,958
In Russia they never said, “We are guilty,” or anything,

697
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:38,917
nothing of the kind. They never said so.

698
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,209
They said, “That time is over now.

699
00:48:41,541 --> 00:48:44,792
We are in the kingdom of God. Finished.

700
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:49,167
So that is over. We are now in the Kingdom of God

701
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,209
and we have to enjoy life.” Everything positive.

702
00:48:53,541 --> 00:48:55,792
Never talked of their past, of their governments

703
00:48:56,167 --> 00:49:00,708
or this happened, or Stalin or Lenin or anyone.

704
00:49:01,167 --> 00:49:04,250
They were not concerned. They were above it.

705
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:06,958
“So why should we worry?” They said, “Why should we worry?

706
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:08,792
Let them fight. Let them do what they like.”

707
00:49:09,209 --> 00:49:11,833
They don’t want to know anything about their politics,

708
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:15,167
about their problems or anything.

709
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:17,375
They think, “Our problems are solved.

710
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:19,541
We are now realized souls.

711
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:22,750
We are enjoying ourselves. Let us enjoy.”

712
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:26,375
Very straight-forward way of understanding Sahaja Yoga.

713
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:28,833
But I’ve seen people, they write to Me

714
00:49:29,209 --> 00:49:31,625
ten pages of their confessions as if I am a priest,

715
00:49:32,042 --> 00:49:35,375
Catholic priest, you see, all about their, what they have done,

716
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,833
this they have done, and I don’t want to read it.

717
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,958
Just throw it or I burn it off.

718
00:49:41,416 --> 00:49:43,917
So they try to confess. There’s no need to confess.

719
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:48,084
There’s nothing to say. And not to dwell upon

720
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:51,625
what wrongs you have done, but now enjoy what you have got it.

721
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,583
It’s like this: supposing a beggar is made a king, all right?

722
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,374
Then he should enjoy his kingdom, should behave like a king.

723
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:01,708
But still he remembers his past more,

724
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:03,666
so anybody who passes by he says,

725
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
“Give me five rupees or five pounds.” It’s like that.

726
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:10,374
Once you are in the Kingdom of God,

727
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,833
know that you are in the Kingdom of God.

728
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:18,125
But this black magic business is very, very dangerous

729
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:20,209
and it can act through anyone.

730
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:23,541
It can act through your relations, act through your friends,

731
00:50:23,917 --> 00:50:25,250
act through anyone.

732
00:50:25,541 --> 00:50:28,833
So one has to be very careful that you do not become,

733
00:50:29,209 --> 00:50:32,084
because of your guilt business or whatever it is,

734
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:36,167
you become vulnerable to black magic.

735
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:39,250
It can ruin you. It can ruin your families.

736
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:42,583
Even if you are a Sahaja yogi it can ruin you.

737
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:46,666
So this guilt business has to be given up completely.

738
00:50:47,084 --> 00:50:49,583
You should not be guilty. Guilt is put into you.

739
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,666
Somebody can say, “Oh you are so bad.

740
00:50:52,084 --> 00:50:54,958
You didn’t do this for me. You didn’t do that,”

741
00:50:55,292 --> 00:50:57,209
or something like that. They put ideas.

742
00:50:57,583 --> 00:50:59,875
Then you start feeling, “Oh, I should have done this for them.

743
00:51:00,167 --> 00:51:03,125
I should have. It was wrong on my part,” or something,

744
00:51:03,416 --> 00:51:04,375
and then the guilt starts.

745
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,541
Instead of doing something for that person

746
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,833
or instead of understanding that this all nonsense,

747
00:51:10,292 --> 00:51:13,374
they go on brooding on that, brooding and then suddenly

748
00:51:13,708 --> 00:51:19,625
they find they are in the trouble of getting possessed

749
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:22,792
or being affected by black magic.

750
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:26,958
So one has to forget it and get into the atmosphere

751
00:51:27,374 --> 00:51:32,375
where you know that you are now in the kingdom of God.

752
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:36,458
For Shri Krishna, whatever is to be said is less than

753
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:38,958
what He’s said always, I always feel,

754
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:46,375
and that His main work is through our brain.

755
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:50,917
That is Virata. He works through our brain.

756
00:51:51,416 --> 00:51:53,666
And as Shiva works through our heart,

757
00:51:54,042 --> 00:51:55,875
He works through our brain.

758
00:51:56,374 --> 00:52:01,958
And after Sahaja Yoga, after enlightenment,

759
00:52:02,374 --> 00:52:05,958
all the subtleties of the brain and the knowledge

760
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:10,084
starts manifesting and expressing itself.

761
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:12,334
But the greatest thing that happens,

762
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:14,541
that integration takes place in your brain.

763
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:16,833
It’s not that your heart wants one thing

764
00:52:17,292 --> 00:52:19,167
and your brain wants another thing.

765
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,000
The integration takes place.

766
00:52:21,334 --> 00:52:22,917
And when that integration takes place

767
00:52:23,334 --> 00:52:26,583
it’s so easy to lead a very dharmic life.

768
00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:31,374
Even without thinking about it, without reading about it,

769
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:33,666
you just become dharmic.

770
00:52:34,042 --> 00:52:36,000
You are not to be told that you have to be dharmic.

771
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:39,583
Innately you become dharmic because your brain,

772
00:52:40,042 --> 00:52:44,209
which normally is used for rationality,

773
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:46,541
for justifying all that is wrong,

774
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,292
becomes dharmic, becomes divine.

775
00:52:51,666 --> 00:52:55,167
This is the greatest thing that Shri Krishna does to you

776
00:52:55,583 --> 00:53:00,458
is to make your brain, brain itself dharmic.

777
00:53:00,917 --> 00:53:10,000
It becomes a vehicle of understanding Dharma,

778
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:20,209
of leading a dharmic life and of standing firmly on Dharma.

779
00:53:20,666 --> 00:53:27,250
It’s the brain; it is the brain which really,

780
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:33,750
mostly, takes you away from Dharma, apart from black magic.

781
00:53:34,334 --> 00:53:39,042
But once your Sahasrara is opened out,

782
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:45,042
Virata is expressed.

783
00:53:45,458 --> 00:53:47,625
Then you are amazed at yourself.

784
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,375
The one who was indulging into everything thinking,

785
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:53,375
“This is pleasure. This is my right. I should have done it.

786
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:55,458
Who else can tell me?” and all that,

787
00:53:55,792 --> 00:53:58,750
suddenly you become a prophet.

788
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:02,334
This is the greatest blessing of Shri Krishna

789
00:54:02,666 --> 00:54:07,875
that He is Virat, and the Virat is your brain,

790
00:54:08,374 --> 00:54:12,458
and the brain of God Almighty is Virat.

791
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:15,500
So this is what one has to realize,

792
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:19,374
that after realization a person gets ideas

793
00:54:19,708 --> 00:54:23,334
which are always constructive, and if they are not,

794
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:25,334
then you are not yet a Sahaja yogi.

795
00:54:25,792 --> 00:54:30,084
Constructive and dharmic, that is very, very important

796
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:35,334
for us to understand, where is our mind going?

797
00:54:35,792 --> 00:54:42,625
Is it contradicting, it is telling something else than what it is?

798
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:47,792
We have to just keep a watch and you’ll be amazed to see

799
00:54:48,167 --> 00:54:52,167
how your brain has changed its ways.

800
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:56,250
The upside brain has become normal.

801
00:54:56,666 --> 00:55:03,374
This you can get very easily if you just meditate

802
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:09,833
every day and see for yourself how the expression

803
00:55:10,292 --> 00:55:15,458
of your Sahasrara is penetrating into your being

804
00:55:15,917 --> 00:55:18,917
and is acting in your life.

805
00:55:19,334 --> 00:55:23,125
Then all the powers of Sahaja yogi will be manifested

806
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:27,583
and you don’t have to anymore doubt yourself,

807
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:30,292
and others will never doubt you.

808
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:32,875
May God bless you.
