1
00:00:01,563 --> 00:00:05,813
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:16,188
Some of you have found the truth,

3
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:22,813
some of you have not found it fully,

4
00:00:23,562 --> 00:00:27,562
and some of you have not found it at all.

5
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:37,563
But if you look around in today's situation,

6
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,306
you'll have to agree there's a big turmoil going on.

7
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:48,556
Countries after countries are taking

8
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:52,430
to all kinds of wrong things.

9
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:55,806
Lot of cold war is on,

10
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,556
people are killing each other,

11
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:06,181
destroying beautiful places,

12
00:01:09,556 --> 00:01:13,931
cutting each other's throat for nothing at all.

13
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:20,806
They are all human beings created by God.

14
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,430
God Almighty has created them

15
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:28,931
and has brought them to this level of human awareness.

16
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:32,931
At this juncture

17
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:38,556
one can't see where are we going in a collective way.

18
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,431
This is, where have we to reach --or

19
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:52,430
is it our destiny?

20
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,430
Is this the destiny of human beings,

21
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:02,806
to be destroyed by each other

22
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:08,056
for land or for anything else?

23
00:02:09,306 --> 00:02:12,806
Think of the whole world as one,

24
00:02:14,056 --> 00:02:17,931
and think what's happening all over:

25
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:21,056
every day we read newspaper,

26
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,681
every day there is some sort of a horrible news

27
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:30,181
about horrible things people are doing to each other,

28
00:02:30,556 --> 00:02:32,681
for no rhyme and reason.

29
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:41,681
We have to think, what is the destiny?

30
00:02:43,056 --> 00:02:45,430
Where are we going?

31
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:52,806
Are we going to hell or to Heaven?

32
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:59,431
What is our situation around? Can we help it?

33
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:05,556
What's wrong with human beings is

34
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:15,430
they are still in the complete control of ignorance

35
00:03:15,806 --> 00:03:18,430
I would call it ignorance.

36
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:22,431
And in that ignorance, in that darkness,

37
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:27,306
they are doing these horrible things.

38
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:34,306
Nobody wants to understand that what we are doing

39
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:39,181
is nothing but complete destruction.

40
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:43,056
Is that our destiny,

41
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,931
that we are going to get destroyed completely?

42
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:50,806
What good are we doing?

43
00:03:52,806 --> 00:03:57,056
Under the name of some sort of nationality

44
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,306
or maybe some religion

45
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:04,806
-- all kinds of things which are good --

46
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,430
but we are doing all wrong things.

47
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,556
Fighting.

48
00:04:11,056 --> 00:04:14,306
Fighting is not the only thing.

49
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,056
We hate.

50
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:23,681
Anybody who can excite our hatred

51
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:31,181
is very much adorable, very much liked,

52
00:04:31,556 --> 00:04:35,056
and under his guidance we form groups.

53
00:04:36,931 --> 00:04:43,306
All this is coming because this is the Last Judgment.

54
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:47,681
I have told you this is the Last Judgment.

55
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:53,430
And this Last Judgment will really decide

56
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:58,556
who are to be saved and who are to be doomed completely.

57
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:03,430
It's a very, very serious thing.

58
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:12,430
All of those who are aware should think about it.

59
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,056
Little patchwork here

60
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,430
and a little patchwork is not going to help.

61
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,430
Whatever you may try,

62
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:26,430
unless and until you transform human beings,

63
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:28,806
they cannot be saved.

64
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:38,306
This transformation is not an impossible thing

65
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:40,931
-- it's not difficult.

66
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,430
This is the time for transformation,

67
00:05:44,806 --> 00:05:47,430
this is a chance for transformation.

68
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:53,681
And within us is placed the power,

69
00:05:54,806 --> 00:05:58,056
as Tao has described,

70
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,681
is the mystical feminine Power within us.

71
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:04,556
All of them have described it,

72
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:09,056
I'm not the first person to say that;

73
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:15,430
but nobody has been able perhaps so far

74
00:06:17,056 --> 00:06:21,430
to understand it or to accept it,

75
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:24,430
that it should happen to you.

76
00:06:27,931 --> 00:06:33,430
You are born not only to be human beings,

77
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,306
but you have to be superhuman.

78
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,431
You have to enjoy yourself.

79
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:44,556
Your life should be enjoyable, it should be blissful.

80
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:47,056
It should not be a curse:

81
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,056
morning till evening worried about this, worried about that.

82
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,056
That is why you are created.

83
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,430
God had no intention of creating people

84
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:04,931
who will be all the time worried how to quarrel,

85
00:07:05,306 --> 00:07:07,306
how to fight, how to save;

86
00:07:08,556 --> 00:07:13,431
but people who will live in complete harmony,

87
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:16,681
peace and joy.

88
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,806
That's why we are created.

89
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:24,430
That is our destiny -- that is,

90
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:27,681
not just I am telling you, but it's a fact.

91
00:07:28,306 --> 00:07:36,431
So we have to be, we have to be transformed.

92
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:40,556
This transformation is not difficult.

93
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:48,306
But what I find, people get satisfied with anything

94
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:52,430
Hindus will go to the temple;

95
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,181
they'll think, "Oh, we have done a great thing."

96
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:57,931
Christians go to the church;

97
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,431
they'll think they have done very good.

98
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:04,806
Muslims will go and pray and think that they are great.

99
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,430
What have they achieved?

100
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:10,306
Face yourself, please.

101
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:14,430
Face your limitations.

102
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:16,931
Face your tribulations.

103
00:08:17,306 --> 00:08:20,431
Face your problems and see for yourself:

104
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:23,806
have you been able to solve your problems?

105
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:33,430
Have you been able to save yourself from calamities?

106
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:40,431
Maybe big calamities may come to destroy people who are,

107
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:44,430
who are doing harm, maybe.

108
00:08:45,806 --> 00:08:48,306
That may be the wish of God.

109
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:51,431
But what is your wish?

110
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:54,430
Why don't you think that

111
00:08:54,806 --> 00:09:01,181
"I have to be a person who is a store,

112
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:06,556
who is a source of joy and love"?

113
00:09:08,056 --> 00:09:12,681
I am not only talking, but I want you all

114
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:15,306
to get your Self-realization.

115
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,430
What is Self-realization

116
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:21,430
-- is to know your Self. You don't know your Self.

117
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,306
You don't know.

118
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,431
You are living in this world without knowing your Self

119
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:29,431
-- can you imagine?

120
00:09:29,931 --> 00:09:31,681
You don't know what you are.

121
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:35,306
You don't know that you are the spirit,

122
00:09:36,556 --> 00:09:42,056
and that you are the source of knowledge,

123
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,306
of pure knowledge.

124
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:47,306
I find people sitting in a meeting,

125
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:51,181
listening to some babaji

126
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:55,681
who is telling them some story, very happy.

127
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:02,306
This is not going to give you the reality and the truth.

128
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,931
If you want to have reality and truth,

129
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,556
then please try to understand

130
00:10:09,056 --> 00:10:11,431
that something has to happen

131
00:10:12,056 --> 00:10:15,431
to you, some transformation has to take place.

132
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:18,430
You are not yet subtle enough,

133
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:20,806
you haven't got those subtleties,

134
00:10:21,306 --> 00:10:23,430
till you reach that point --

135
00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:27,431
for which you don't have to leave your family,

136
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:30,681
you don't have to leave your children,

137
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:38,681
you don't have to leave your household and go to the jungles.

138
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,430
There's no need to do all that.

139
00:10:43,056 --> 00:10:46,556
It's nice to say that "All right, you all take sanyasa

140
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:50,056
and give all that belongs to you to me."

141
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:54,806
It's such a stupid idea.

142
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,430
These are emergencies today.

143
00:11:00,556 --> 00:11:05,306
We are living in a very emergent conditions

144
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:07,181
-- try to understand.

145
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:09,681
And I want to warn you

146
00:11:10,181 --> 00:11:12,556
that if you don't go deep into yourself

147
00:11:13,056 --> 00:11:15,806
and find out what you are,

148
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:20,931
and take to your transformation,

149
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,431
anything is possible.

150
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:27,806
All kinds of diseases are coming up,

151
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:32,681
all kinds of new problems of children coming up,

152
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,931
all kinds of national problems are there,

153
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:40,430
all kinds of international problems are there,

154
00:11:40,931 --> 00:11:43,806
that people can't help it.

155
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:52,306
So we have to get out of this and become a solid,

156
00:11:52,556 --> 00:11:55,681
a personality of truth.

157
00:11:56,306 --> 00:11:58,306
We don't know what is the truth is.

158
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:05,430
We are worse than animals whose eyes are open,

159
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,556
while our eyes are closed.

160
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,431
Is not to condemn yourself in any way,

161
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:18,181
but to make you alert and aware

162
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:21,931
that human beings have to change.

163
00:12:22,431 --> 00:12:26,431
Otherwise it's just, you come to My lecture,

164
00:12:26,931 --> 00:12:30,556
tomorrow you come to another lecture -- that's all.

165
00:12:31,056 --> 00:12:34,431
It's a everyday sort of a nice entertainment.

166
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:41,181
But when I see the destiny,

167
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:44,556
I don't know how many will be ruined,

168
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,681
how many will be finished.

169
00:12:48,306 --> 00:12:50,181
What will happen to them?

170
00:12:50,556 --> 00:12:52,806
What diseases they will get,

171
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,931
what problems they will get?

172
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,556
What will happen to their children,

173
00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:01,931
what will happen to their country,

174
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,056
and what will happen to the whole world?

175
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,306
Just widen your vision.

176
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:15,181
My vision is that all the people of the world

177
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:18,056
should get transformation.

178
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,306
We have enemies within ourselves,

179
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,806
and when they talk of jihad,

180
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:31,931
they talk that you fight your enemies within yourself.

181
00:13:32,431 --> 00:13:34,431
What are these enemies?

182
00:13:35,806 --> 00:13:39,431
These days, the worst is greed.

183
00:13:40,806 --> 00:13:43,181
There is greed.

184
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:48,931
With that greed people can do anything they want to

185
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:53,431
All kinds of things are happening out of greed.

186
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:59,056
They'll have money, they'll have all kinds of facilities,

187
00:13:59,431 --> 00:14:04,306
but still this greed is such a satanic will of,

188
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:07,556
that you don't even see what you have.

189
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:12,431
And you want to have more and more, deceive people,

190
00:14:13,056 --> 00:14:15,931
deceive your government,

191
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,806
deceive everyone and manage it.

192
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:32,056
Then, another worse thing we have is anger.

193
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,306
Anger doesn't allow you to see things as they are.

194
00:14:40,056 --> 00:14:44,056
We develop anger for small things:

195
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,431
like you have come to this country --

196
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:58,430
I've seen people who are angry because of different color.

197
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,431
I can't understand.

198
00:15:04,181 --> 00:15:06,556
God has made different colors;

199
00:15:06,931 --> 00:15:11,181
other we all would have looked same, like military,

200
00:15:12,056 --> 00:15:14,431
and life would have been miserable.

201
00:15:14,806 --> 00:15:17,681
So the color has been created by nature.

202
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:23,556
So the whites or blacks -- what is the difference?

203
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:27,430
I just don't understand.

204
00:15:27,931 --> 00:15:33,681
Because such a myth is going on.

205
00:15:34,931 --> 00:15:37,806
With this myth we are fighting.

206
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,556
The whites are fighting with the blacks,

207
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:44,556
and the blacks are fighting with the whites.

208
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:53,931
And then they go also for burning their skin in the sun,

209
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:58,430
getting skin cancers.

210
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:01,056
I just don't understand.

211
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:04,431
There's no logic, there's no balance

212
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:08,430
in us to see that what we are doing.

213
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:14,431
Why are we wasting this precious time,

214
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:17,681
when we have to get transformation?

215
00:16:18,806 --> 00:16:21,931
This anger can be with anything;

216
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,430
anything one can develop anger.

217
00:16:27,931 --> 00:16:33,181
Is like a human failing, which is very common.

218
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,806
For the smallest thing people can get angry.

219
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,931
And they like it, because with that they can oppress others;

220
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,430
they could be aggressive.

221
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:48,681
So they want to have this anger within them,

222
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,556
and with that anger they try to dominate others.

223
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,681
This is the biggest problem:

224
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:02,430
why do we want to dominate others,

225
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:05,430
why do we want to oppress others,

226
00:17:06,056 --> 00:17:09,181
and why do we want to take control of others?

227
00:17:09,556 --> 00:17:11,556
We can't control ourselves;

228
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:15,181
why are we wanting to control others?

229
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:17,556
What is the need?

230
00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:23,931
Then, there are attachments:

231
00:17:25,056 --> 00:17:29,806
attachments to their houses,

232
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:35,181
to their lands, to their children, to everything.

233
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:41,931
But tomorrow you won't be here.

234
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:46,431
You'll go with open hands.

235
00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:50,306
You can't carry anything with you.

236
00:17:51,556 --> 00:17:56,806
So such attachment to things:

237
00:17:58,056 --> 00:18:01,056
they're very particular about their cars,

238
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,181
about their house, maintain it.

239
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:09,430
But what about yourself? Are you all right?

240
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:16,556
Inside, are you absolutely calm, peaceful and joyful?

241
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,431
Why are you wasting your energy

242
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,681
in getting angry with others?

243
00:18:37,056 --> 00:18:46,806
That's the sign of life that will be also destroyed.

244
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:59,431
If you look at another person he has, say, weaknesses,

245
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:04,931
apart from money, for women -- is very common --

246
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:08,430
or women having for men.

247
00:19:09,556 --> 00:19:13,181
To get attractive, for what?

248
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:16,806
Everybody has to get old.

249
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:23,806
What have you achieved by running after women,

250
00:19:24,306 --> 00:19:28,430
running after other sex?

251
00:19:29,556 --> 00:19:34,430
You have no sense of dignity, no sense of honor.

252
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:37,806
If you are -- as long as you wear very good clothes

253
00:19:38,181 --> 00:19:40,430
you are regarded wonderful person.

254
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,430
This is not the way.

255
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:47,430
We have to introspect and see for ourselves:

256
00:19:47,931 --> 00:19:49,931
why are we doing this,

257
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,430
wasting our energy into nonsensical thing?

258
00:19:58,056 --> 00:20:03,306
So many people I meet are really half-mad and far gone;

259
00:20:03,556 --> 00:20:05,931
some of them are full-mad.

260
00:20:07,431 --> 00:20:09,431
And what they tell Me, that

261
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:12,306
they wanted to marry a particular woman

262
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:14,431
and a particular man or anything,

263
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:18,556
and that's how they got it. I mean, how fragile!

264
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:23,431
That's not being very great.

265
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:29,931
You have to be very, very strong within yourself.

266
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:35,056
Feel your Self. Your Self is the spirit,

267
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,806
is the reflection of God Almighty within you.

268
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,931
You can be very strong,

269
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,181
you can be very healthy

270
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,431
and you can be absolutely balanced,

271
00:20:46,931 --> 00:20:48,681
if you become the spirit.

272
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:54,181
You have heard so much about spirit and spiritual life

273
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,430
-- but have you reached that point?

274
00:21:01,681 --> 00:21:05,181
Even when you read, say, Zen system,

275
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:10,181
Tao system, Bible, Koran, anything,

276
00:21:12,181 --> 00:21:16,431
do you know how to reach that point of the spirit?

277
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:19,431
Not yet. Not yet.

278
00:21:20,181 --> 00:21:22,430
You have to know that;

279
00:21:22,806 --> 00:21:25,306
because you are very great,

280
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:28,431
you are very precious,

281
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:32,430
and you are so beautiful within.

282
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:35,806
But you are not aware of it.

283
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:39,056
You have to become that.

284
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:43,431
That becoming is very important,

285
00:21:44,056 --> 00:21:49,431
and for that already God Almighty has organized within you

286
00:21:50,806 --> 00:21:54,556
which is called as kundalini,

287
00:21:56,431 --> 00:21:58,431
which can be awakened,

288
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:03,806
and its awakening can give you Self-realization,

289
00:22:04,431 --> 00:22:08,931
can give you self-knowledge which we call "Atma sakshatkar."

290
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,556
That's what is very, very important in your life to have it.

291
00:22:14,056 --> 00:22:15,431
And when it is free --

292
00:22:16,056 --> 00:22:18,806
you can't pay for it, how much can you pay?

293
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,430
-- when it is absolutely free,

294
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:28,431
why don't you take your Self-realization,

295
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,056
and why don't you grow?

296
00:22:32,556 --> 00:22:35,681
Instead of fighting in the name of religion.

297
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:42,181
Every religion has said "You know thy Self."

298
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,681
Mohammed Sahib has said very clearly,

299
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:51,681
"At the time of resurrection your hands will speak."

300
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:55,430
Are they speaking?

301
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:58,931
Hindus know about it,

302
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,431
that we have to get our Self-realization.

303
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:07,430
No use just listening to these babajis and giving them money.

304
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:17,306
All this kind of rituals

305
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:21,431
that we have been doing, our forefathers have been doing:

306
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,056
what have we achieved? Nothing.

307
00:23:26,784 --> 00:23:30,181
So now, it's important for us to know

308
00:23:30,556 --> 00:23:36,430
that we have to have our evolution,

309
00:23:38,056 --> 00:23:41,430
reaching to the point of Self-realization.

310
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,430
If we were perfect there would have been no problem

311
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:50,681
If we were self-realized people

312
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:53,681
there would have been no problem.

313
00:23:55,181 --> 00:23:57,430
All kinds of selfishness,

314
00:23:58,056 --> 00:24:03,556
all kinds of limits we have put upon ourselves,

315
00:24:04,306 --> 00:24:07,056
all kinds of conditioning and ego

316
00:24:07,556 --> 00:24:13,430
which has been working our life and have been ruining us,

317
00:24:13,681 --> 00:24:16,931
we have to get over it.

318
00:24:17,014 --> 00:24:19,769
And once you get over it, you get united.

319
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:22,894
Nobody has to tell you that you get united.

320
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:27,018
You lose all misidentifications.

321
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:31,767
The time is running short.

322
00:24:32,517 --> 00:24:34,517
I've been now here for the last,

323
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:36,892
I don't know, twenty years or so.

324
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,766
I worked very hard,

325
00:24:40,267 --> 00:24:44,142
but what I find that people don't realize

326
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:46,517
what they are supposed to do.

327
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:55,767
They like people who will just say something very simple

328
00:24:56,517 --> 00:24:59,517
-- all right, it's a little entertainment.

329
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:06,517
So the whole humanity has to understand

330
00:25:07,892 --> 00:25:13,767
that destiny of destruction is to be avoided.

331
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:17,767
Complete destruction is to be avoided.

332
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:24,017
And very simple is that you enter into the Kingdom of God

333
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:27,766
-- which is very easy: you don't have to pay anything,

334
00:25:28,267 --> 00:25:30,642
don't have to work out anything.

335
00:25:32,017 --> 00:25:34,142
You take your Self-realization,

336
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:40,142
and then at home you spend about ten minutes meditating.

337
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:48,517
Only your mind is all the time justifying your misbehavior.

338
00:25:48,892 --> 00:25:52,766
I call it "misbehavior" because it's against you.

339
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:57,766
It's against God's wish,

340
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:01,767
it's against humanity

341
00:26:02,267 --> 00:26:05,892
and it will destroy all the human beings.

342
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:12,267
All these misidentifications have to be dropped,

343
00:26:12,766 --> 00:26:16,142
and you have to know that we are all one.

344
00:26:17,392 --> 00:26:21,766
We are all one, we are all global,

345
00:26:23,142 --> 00:26:27,017
we are not separated by color,

346
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:31,766
race or religion, nation -- no.

347
00:26:33,142 --> 00:26:34,766
We are all one,

348
00:26:34,892 --> 00:26:40,369
and that oneness should not be established by slogans

349
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,741
or by shouting,

350
00:26:42,766 --> 00:26:46,267
but should be that oneness is to be felt within.

351
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:51,767
It's not artificial.

352
00:26:52,267 --> 00:26:55,766
It has to be real, very real oneness,

353
00:26:56,142 --> 00:26:58,766
and that comes to you once you realize

354
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:02,017
that you are part and parcel of the whole.

355
00:27:04,392 --> 00:27:10,392
Religions have brought you up to this point of awareness

356
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:14,892
-- not for fighting, not for killing.

357
00:27:18,017 --> 00:27:20,142
Why, why?

358
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:23,892
Human beings have diverted themselves.

359
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:29,267
Because of complete ignorance of righteousness.

360
00:27:30,392 --> 00:27:39,017
Because of complete greed of oneself:

361
00:27:40,517 --> 00:27:46,392
oneself, just yourself, or your family at the most,

362
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:49,142
or your relation.

363
00:27:51,392 --> 00:27:53,684
Why do you want to delimit yourself?

364
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,766
You are the spirit.

365
00:27:56,184 --> 00:28:02,766
Spirit is the ocean, ocean of knowledge,

366
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:06,642
is the ocean of love,

367
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:10,642
is the ocean of all blessings.

368
00:28:11,892 --> 00:28:14,767
So we have to decide.

369
00:28:15,392 --> 00:28:18,017
Today I have to request you,

370
00:28:18,642 --> 00:28:21,392
that there's not so much time left.

371
00:28:21,892 --> 00:28:26,767
We have to decide that we have to become the spirit

372
00:28:27,392 --> 00:28:30,142
That's all the religions have taught.

373
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:37,142
But how to do it was not so much explained,

374
00:28:38,766 --> 00:28:40,642
and it didn't work out.

375
00:28:41,017 --> 00:28:44,892
Some of them did get it but they were outcasted.

376
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:47,517
Nobody listened to them.

377
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:51,017
Even people killed them and tortured them, crucified them.

378
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:59,517
But now, please, all of you try to understand

379
00:28:59,892 --> 00:29:02,267
the value of your life.

380
00:29:03,517 --> 00:29:05,767
Why are you a human being?

381
00:29:06,142 --> 00:29:08,017
Why are you created?

382
00:29:08,642 --> 00:29:10,642
What is the purpose behind it?

383
00:29:10,892 --> 00:29:15,517
Are we going to be driven by nonsensical ideas?

384
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:26,742
Are we going to be finished by all sorts of dividing factors?

385
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:31,517
No, no, we are all going to get your Self-realization,

386
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:36,142
and we are going to understand the value of our life.

387
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:42,267
The problem is, you'll get your realization

388
00:29:42,642 --> 00:29:46,517
in the sense the power within you will rise.

389
00:29:46,892 --> 00:29:48,766
It's very well organized;

390
00:29:49,142 --> 00:29:52,267
actually, God is a great creator.

391
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:58,517
How He has balanced and how it works out is remarkable.

392
00:29:59,017 --> 00:30:01,766
Every individual He has done it.

393
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:07,267
With that happening, is not sufficient.

394
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:11,766
You enter into, say, a palace

395
00:30:12,267 --> 00:30:15,767
and then you go round and see for yourself

396
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:18,642
how beautiful you are,

397
00:30:19,142 --> 00:30:22,392
what beautiful things God has made for you.

398
00:30:23,892 --> 00:30:26,392
Then grow into it.

399
00:30:26,766 --> 00:30:29,517
Once you have grown into it,

400
00:30:30,017 --> 00:30:35,392
then you will realize what a great thing you are:

401
00:30:36,642 --> 00:30:44,766
the greatest gem, the greatest person, so loving.

402
00:30:46,017 --> 00:30:47,766
There have been some

403
00:30:48,267 --> 00:30:51,392
-- they have become just statues.

404
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:57,267
Nobody tries to understand what were they doing,

405
00:30:57,766 --> 00:30:59,392
how they were there.

406
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:10,425
So, tonight we can have the experience,

407
00:31:11,142 --> 00:31:14,766
the experience of the spirit.

408
00:31:15,142 --> 00:31:18,892
Is a very unusual, rare thing.

409
00:31:19,392 --> 00:31:21,267
It never used to happen like that.

410
00:31:21,766 --> 00:31:25,267
But it is now, so why not take advantage of it?

411
00:31:27,517 --> 00:31:31,642
Please, be ready for that,

412
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:36,142
accept it, take it, and become.

413
00:31:36,766 --> 00:31:38,767
Becoming is the point.

414
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:41,767
What you become is the point.

415
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:48,517
And what you make out of this whole human civilization

416
00:31:49,017 --> 00:31:52,642
is your problem, not Mine.

417
00:31:53,892 --> 00:31:56,267
I can help you.

418
00:31:56,766 --> 00:31:58,766
I can work it out.

419
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:06,142
So I would request you all to now be ready for Self-realization.

420
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:10,766
It's much better,

421
00:32:11,267 --> 00:32:14,767
but those who do not want to have cannot be forced.

422
00:32:16,766 --> 00:32:19,642
So it's better such people leave,

423
00:32:20,017 --> 00:32:23,142
leave the hall if they don't want to have.

424
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:28,766
May God bless you all.

425
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:58,392
Firstly, you don't have to do anything

426
00:33:01,267 --> 00:33:04,766
-- meaning also, don't think what I have said.

427
00:33:07,267 --> 00:33:12,142
Try to keep your thoughts very peaceful,

428
00:33:13,517 --> 00:33:17,642
and I'm sure all of you can get your Self-realization.

429
00:33:19,267 --> 00:33:21,766
But how many will grow?

430
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:26,767
Because you have to come to the follow-up,

431
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:32,392
then you have to practice it in the centers

432
00:33:32,892 --> 00:33:35,517
-- and it works out.

433
00:33:36,017 --> 00:33:39,892
Little bit time you have to give to yourself,

434
00:33:40,766 --> 00:33:44,142
and to this global problem.

435
00:33:45,766 --> 00:33:48,142
You have to dedicate yourself to that.

436
00:33:48,766 --> 00:33:52,766
Is very important: you have to dedicate yourself.

437
00:33:53,392 --> 00:33:56,642
That doesn't mean that you have to become sanyasi

438
00:33:56,892 --> 00:34:00,017
or you have to be busy with this for twenty-four hours -- nothing.

439
00:34:00,642 --> 00:34:06,142
But this dedication will make you so much

440
00:34:08,142 --> 00:34:09,892
one with yourself,

441
00:34:10,517 --> 00:34:12,766
with the whole universe,

442
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:16,892
that I don't have to tell you that you dedicate

443
00:34:17,392 --> 00:34:20,392
-- you'll dedicate by yourself.

444
00:34:23,766 --> 00:34:26,766
So please don't stay here

445
00:34:27,017 --> 00:34:29,392
if you don't want to have Self-realization.

446
00:34:29,892 --> 00:34:31,767
Nothing will happen to you.

447
00:34:32,392 --> 00:34:37,642
Please leave the hall in case you don't want Self-realization.

448
00:34:51,017 --> 00:34:56,767
What you have to do is not to do anything;

449
00:34:58,517 --> 00:35:01,142
to put just your hands towards Me.

450
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:06,142
Of course, if you are wearing shoes better take them out,

451
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:09,642
because Mother Earth is very important.

452
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,767
Please put both the hands towards Me.

453
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:29,767
You don't have to pray,

454
00:35:30,267 --> 00:35:31,766
you don't have to say anything; just

455
00:35:32,267 --> 00:35:34,766
put your hands towards Me, just like this.

456
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:51,766
Now please close your eyes.

457
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:57,517
It is important. Please close your eyes.

458
00:36:07,392 --> 00:36:12,267
This power, kundalini, is placed in the triangular bone,

459
00:36:14,766 --> 00:36:18,766
known as sacrum, means "sacred",

460
00:36:19,267 --> 00:36:28,267
and it rises through six centers of the parasympathetic,

461
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:32,267
and ultimately pierces through

462
00:36:36,392 --> 00:36:39,267
the fontanel bone area

463
00:36:39,642 --> 00:36:42,017
which was a soft bone in your head,

464
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:45,017
on top of your head.

465
00:36:50,017 --> 00:36:53,267
When you were a child, it was a soft bone.

466
00:36:53,767 --> 00:36:56,766
It pierces through that,

467
00:36:58,517 --> 00:37:01,392
and enters into the subtle energy

468
00:37:03,392 --> 00:37:10,892
of all-pervading Power of divine love.

469
00:37:13,766 --> 00:37:16,517
They call it by different name.

470
00:37:17,017 --> 00:37:22,142
They call it "Paramachaitanya" -- some call it "chaitanya."

471
00:37:23,766 --> 00:37:27,142
Some call it as "ruh."

472
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:33,766
You may call it by any name -- is the love, love of God.

473
00:37:35,517 --> 00:37:37,767
Once you get connected with you,

474
00:37:39,142 --> 00:37:43,142
when you start feeling on your fingers

475
00:37:45,392 --> 00:37:47,267
some sort of a breeze.

476
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:50,766
First some people will get hot, doesn't matter;

477
00:37:52,267 --> 00:37:54,392
but then it cools down

478
00:37:54,766 --> 00:37:58,517
and you get the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, as they call it.

479
00:38:01,142 --> 00:38:03,267
And it starts flowing.

480
00:38:05,142 --> 00:38:08,767
You can now raise your left hand

481
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:12,892
on top of your fontanel bone area.

482
00:38:13,517 --> 00:38:16,766
Keep your eyes shut, and see for yourself

483
00:38:17,017 --> 00:38:21,517
if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

484
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,392
You can move your hand.

485
00:38:36,642 --> 00:38:38,892
Now see with your right hand

486
00:38:39,766 --> 00:38:42,392
if there's a cool or a hot breeze

487
00:38:42,766 --> 00:38:45,892
coming out of your fontanel bone area,

488
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:49,267
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

489
00:38:49,766 --> 00:38:51,267
See for yourself.

490
00:38:51,642 --> 00:38:53,892
Bend your head; better is to bend.

491
00:38:54,517 --> 00:38:56,517
Please bend your head.

492
00:38:58,267 --> 00:39:01,517
Again put your right hand towards Me

493
00:39:03,017 --> 00:39:08,767
and see for yourself with the left hand,

494
00:39:09,392 --> 00:39:15,267
see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

495
00:39:15,766 --> 00:39:18,767
If it is hot it's all right, doesn't matter.

496
00:39:19,267 --> 00:39:22,642
It is coming because of the heat within you.

497
00:39:39,142 --> 00:39:44,142
Now all those who have felt cool or a hot breeze

498
00:39:44,766 --> 00:39:47,267
in their hands or on their fingers,

499
00:39:47,766 --> 00:39:50,392
or out of the fontanel bone area

500
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:52,766
-- this is the real baptism --

501
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:55,766
please raise both your hands.

502
00:40:04,766 --> 00:40:06,142
Just imagine:

503
00:40:06,766 --> 00:40:10,642
you are the soldiers who are going to save the world

504
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,766
from its destruction.

505
00:40:14,267 --> 00:40:16,392
Try to understand your importance.

506
00:40:17,892 --> 00:40:20,392
You can put down your hand.

507
00:40:20,767 --> 00:40:24,766
Everyone practically has felt it.

508
00:40:25,267 --> 00:40:27,267
That means you are already matured

509
00:40:27,766 --> 00:40:29,642
to get your spiritual life.

510
00:40:29,892 --> 00:40:32,642
You are just on the brink of it.

511
00:40:33,142 --> 00:40:35,267
That's how you got it.

512
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:40,767
It's last jump to reality.

513
00:40:41,267 --> 00:40:45,766
Now, you should know what is this, what are you,

514
00:40:46,766 --> 00:40:48,767
what is your spirit

515
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:53,642
and what you can do; what are your powers are,

516
00:40:53,892 --> 00:40:56,017
what are spiritual powers.

517
00:40:56,517 --> 00:40:58,267
For this I would request you

518
00:40:58,766 --> 00:41:01,142
to first to come to the follow-up program,

519
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:06,392
and after that you can join any one of the centers

520
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:09,892
which are closer to you and work it out.

521
00:41:10,517 --> 00:41:12,767
We have to work for the whole world.

522
00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:16,767
You should know there are eighty-five countries

523
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,766
which are following Sahaja Yoga.

524
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:25,517
And surprisingly, black country like Benin,

525
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:28,766
we have twenty thousand Sahaja yogis.

526
00:41:29,142 --> 00:41:31,892
Only three years back I started there.

527
00:41:32,392 --> 00:41:36,766
And in England it's more than sixteen years

528
00:41:37,267 --> 00:41:41,767
I've been working here, and after that also:

529
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:44,892
all the time, every year.

530
00:41:45,517 --> 00:41:47,017
But somehow

531
00:41:52,642 --> 00:41:57,392
their growth is very much there,

532
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:06,517
but not subtle growth, not within ourselves.

533
00:42:10,767 --> 00:42:16,517
The growth is within, and you'll enjoy,

534
00:42:17,017 --> 00:42:19,766
very much enjoy the reality.

535
00:42:20,142 --> 00:42:23,892
The reality is beautiful, absolutely beautiful.

536
00:42:25,517 --> 00:42:27,392
May God bless you.

537
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:33,767
They want to sing one song

538
00:42:34,517 --> 00:42:38,017
which was written in the twelfth century

539
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:41,766
by a saint in India and is sung in all the villages,

540
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,642
but nobody knows the meaning of that.

541
00:42:45,767 --> 00:42:49,767
The meaning is that "Oh Mother,

542
00:42:50,392 --> 00:42:52,892
give me the union, 'Jogwa'

543
00:42:53,642 --> 00:42:54,892
-- give me the union.

544
00:42:56,267 --> 00:43:00,767
I will give up my bad habits. I'll give up my temper. I'll give ..."

545
00:43:01,392 --> 00:43:02,766
You don't have to do it.

546
00:43:03,017 --> 00:43:05,766
Now you'll give up automatically.

547
00:43:07,267 --> 00:43:10,142
The light that you'll have, itself,

548
00:43:10,517 --> 00:43:14,267
automatically you will give up, automatically.

549
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:16,517
You don't have to do anything.

550
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:19,517
But you have to meditate.

551
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:23,766
About ten minutes, it's not much.
