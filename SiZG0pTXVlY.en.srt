1
00:00:02,375 --> 00:00:06,083
How are you? Please,

2
00:00:07,542 --> 00:00:13,250
What’s your name? REPORTER: My name is David [Cooper?], I am (inaudible)

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,083
Can You tell me why You have come along

4
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:18,500
to Northampton here this week?

5
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:19,542
SHRI MATAJI: Why I have come here?

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,625
REPORTER: Why You have come along here were you invited by a....

7
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:27,125
SHRI MATAJI: It’s a sort of a… kind of a message I have,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that a discovery has been made now of a method.

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,834
REPORTER: Is this the first time that You’ve come to Northampton?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,375
SHRI MATAJI: No, I’ve come before also.

11
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,041
REPORTER: And what sort of response did You get then?

12
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:46,291
SHRI MATAJI: Response was, I wouldn’t say very good.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,917
No newspaper didn’t come at all.

14
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,291
Yesterday also there was no one, it’s very surprising.

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,333
REPORTER: You found a lot of people were very skeptical, did You?

16
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:57,625
SHRI MATAJI: I don’t know what they were like,

17
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:00,458
because no-, nobody came, you see.

18
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:02,166
REPORTER: That was the Guild Hall as well?

19
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:05,208
SHRI MATAJI: No, Guildhall yesterday we had lots of people, yesterday.

20
00:01:05,417 --> 00:01:07,542
But as far as the newspapers were concerned,

21
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,792
We met some people here.

22
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:12,959
But most of them came to see Me, when I came here first.

23
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,999
They were sort of a labor class people.

24
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,500
They were suffering from all kinds of maladies

25
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:21,709
like possessions and things, and one gentleman just got up

26
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:24,625
and started walking all around the places and talking like …

27
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:26,542
it was a bit funny.

28
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,917
REPORTER: In fact, You were in Bedford last night, weren't You?

29
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,000
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, I was there.

30
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:31,166
REPORTER: And how did that go?

31
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,041
SHRI MATAJI: Very good, very well.

32
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,875
REPORTER: It went very well. In the past, I understand, that You’ve, um,

33
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:39,375
You’ve helped heal an awful lot of people? SHRI MATAJI: Yes.

34
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:42,125
REPORTER: Can You give me some examples of some of the more,

35
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:45,166
extraordinary healings You’ve done?

36
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:47,875
SHRI MATAJI: Anything, you see, like cancer.

37
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,792
Then, we can say, blood cancer specially.

38
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:55,417
A Sahaja Yogini has cured one friend's blood cancer.

39
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:58,917
Then diabetes.

40
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,750
REPORTER: In fact, I understand, on one occasion You had

41
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,709
a blind woman cometo see you, is that right?

42
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:06,542
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, blindness — if the eyes are open.

43
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,291
REPORTER: Which one was that exactly? What was happening?

44
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,000
SHRI MATAJI: That is due to a possession, on the backside,

45
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,000
the optic lobe we have here.

46
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,667
You see, if that gets possessed by a live entity,

47
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,959
your eyes are open but there’s darkness, you can’t see anything.

48
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:23,000
And if you know how to open that and get rid of the possession…

49
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,709
And the deaf person hearing, yeah…

50
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:27,834
REPORTER: You’ve actually cured deafness as well, have You?

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,583
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, I did. There in Geneva it happened.

52
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:32,458
REPORTER: Do You — I mean, it’s very difficult for people

53
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,208
to actually understand how it’s done.

54
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:36,500
I mean they, you know, it all seems just a bit mystical and, you know …

55
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:38,792
SHRI MATAJI: Yeah. It is nothing mystical, I tell you,

56
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:40,875
there’s nothing mystical.

57
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,750
Like we see a flower becoming a fruit.

58
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,417
We take it for granted, isn’t it?

59
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:51,250
Do we find it mystical ? Because we see it every day.

60
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:55,041
But there is something, some power that does that, doesn’t it?

61
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,458
Supposing you become

62
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,999
the owner of that power, say, or if you have that power within you.

63
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,667
You can also do many things.

64
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,583
REPORTER: But, nonetheless, I mean,

65
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:10,291
if I have an illness I go to see a doctor, he gives me tablets or so on…

66
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,750
I mean, to actually to come and see You

67
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,709
and You say I’ve got the power within me to cure myself…

68
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:17,667
I mean, how do you actually get this power?

69
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:21,208
SHRI MATAJI: You see, what happens: when you become realized,

70
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:24,250
or we become — it’s called twice-born —

71
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:27,542
then you become collectively conscious, you become.

72
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,792
It is not that I just tell you

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,291
and it’s a brain treatment or something,

74
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,792
or brainwash, that I say,

75
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:36,417
“All right, now you have become this and this.”

76
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:40,083
You really become, that you start feeling them —

77
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,417
they are centres on your fingertips.

78
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:45,000
REPORTER: So you actually feel them? SHRI MATAJI: On the fingertips.

79
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,917
You can, everyone can feel it very clearly.

80
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,542
REPORTER: So this is like a guide, this is the way to diagnose

81
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,083
SHRI MATAJI: Diagnosis. You see, you are the doctor,

82
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,917
you are the diagnosis, you could be patient also.

83
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,041
And you are the medicine.

84
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:00,959
REPORTER: So once you’ve diagnosed what's wrong…

85
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:04,208
SHRI MATAJI: Then you should know how to cure a particular centre.

86
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:07,375
For example, now, which is the Christ centre? It’s this one.

87
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,959
These two are Christ centres,

88
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,041
in the pituitary and pineal. Now what are the diseases you get?

89
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,458
All the diseases of the eyes you get out of it.

90
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:19,542
Others are possessions.

91
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,999
You see, people are mentally depressed, this, that —

92
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,000
all this is due to the problem of this centre.

93
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,125
There could be ego problems also.

94
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,166
People are egoistical, you see, and very bombastic,

95
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,208
and they try to destroy others with their ego.

96
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,583
All these problems can be solved if you can awaken Christ within you.

97
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:41,250
Because it’s said that He died for our sins.

98
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:46,709
REPORTER: And using this healing method You've got, that actually awakens powers [of healing]

99
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:49,583
SHRI MATAJI: Yes. You just have to say Lord's prayer before Me

100
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:52,834
and He awakens because I am connected with Him, you see.

101
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,583
So when you say something to Me,

102
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:57,083
that connection is just made, and that is awakened,

103
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,083
and there is ego and superego in your head, which are sucked in,

104
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,625
means your actions — that is your karmas —

105
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:04,500
and your sins all are sucked in.

106
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:06,375
Once they are sucked in, this portion opens up.

107
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,500
When this opens up, you get the the Kundalini up.

108
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,375
That is, it’s very simple, you know, because it’s all done.

109
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:16,375
For example, now look at this. To look at this, looks very simple,

110
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,959
but it might be quite complicated inside.

111
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,166
And it has taken years to make it.

112
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:24,875
So the whole thing has taken ages to make it. This human body

113
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,500
has come out of amoeba to this stage;

114
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:31,583
even from matter to this stage. All that is built within you.

115
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:35,000
Not only that, but what is going to happen to you

116
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,999
is also existing within you in your heart; the Spirit.

117
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:41,875
Now, only thing, that last [ ] breakthrough has to take place.

118
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,750
That is also built within you, that is sahaja —

119
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,417
means built within you. It is born within you.

120
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:50,875
Sahaja is “born within”. So it’s all within you.

121
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,083
And just if somebody knows how to do the job,

122
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,166
the one who could have capacity…

123
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,125
Like the Mother Earth has the capacity to sprout the seed.

124
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,083
We can’t do it otherwise, if you do grow, do anything, you can't.

125
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:05,917
It’s a living process. But the Mother… Mother Earth can help.

126
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,041
You put it there and you get it.

127
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,208
In the same way, it is supposing I have the capacity, I can do it.

128
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:13,625
Supposing you get the light tomorrow, you can do it.

129
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:15,750
You can enlighten another person.

130
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,083
One enlightened person can enlighten another person

131
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,500
but he has to be enlightened first of all.

132
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:23,041
REPORTER: Do You find that, I mean, as You say, I mean,

133
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,999
once people have seen You and discovered how it can work,

134
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,291
they can spread the word? SHRI MATAJI: Yes.

135
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:31,166
REPORTER: But nonetheless You say You met a lot of skeptical people last time.

136
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,750
Do You think that that is the basic problem I mean that…

137
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,917
through this healing process You have

138
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,625
could be much more widely used and sort of...

139
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:41,875
SHRI MATAJI: You see, but I’ve seen people who come for healing,

140
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,750
just get satisfied at that point when they are healed up.

141
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,166
They don’t go further.

142
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,125
You see you must say that God also has common sense;

143
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,999
that He would like to only heal people, normally,

144
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:56,583
like we would like to only construct,

145
00:06:56,834 --> 00:07:00,959
improve, or repair those lamps which will give lights, isn’t it?

146
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,542
So those who are not going to work it out;

147
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,709
the interest is less.

148
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:06,792
But still it works, I mean, it’s compassion,

149
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:09,041
so it cures, people get cured, no doubt.

150
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,875
But out of them I find very few really come to Sahaja Yoga,

151
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,375
who come through healing. But those who have seeking of the Spirit

152
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,750
they are a special category of people.

153
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,792
They are extremely beautiful people

154
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:22,041
and they are seeking. Maybe they are taking drugs,

155
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,583
going to wrong gurus, whatever they are doing.

156
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:25,917
That’s a different point.

157
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,959
But they are seekers, basically they are seekers of the truth

158
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,583
and they are the best people.

159
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:34,083
And they are the ones who are meant for Sahaja Yoga,

160
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,750
not the people who just want their body to be all right.

161
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,125
What’s the use of having the body, what are you going to do with it?

162
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,917
You see, this body might have a meaning.

163
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,999
And those who are finding the meaning are the best helped.

164
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,000
Of course, they get rid of all their maladies

165
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,291
and everything that’s… as a by-product.

166
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,792
But that’s the main thing, that’s important.

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,875
REPORTER: I understand that Your husband, in fact,

168
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,208
holds a very eminent position. SHRI MATAJI: Yes, he is.

169
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:58,041
REPORTER: Can You tell me a little bit about that?

170
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:03,083
SHRI MATAJI: He is elected as Secretary General.

171
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:04,583
REPORTER: Of what exactly?

172
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:08,125
SHRI MATAJI: Of one international organization you have,

173
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,000
a one agency you have in this country,

174
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:14,458
called as International Maritime Organization,

175
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:17,792
which has got 134 nations

176
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,208
who have elected him. And that’s how we are here.

177
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:24,000
REPORTER: Do You find… I mean, his work

178
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:27,000
must be so completely different to Yours.

179
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,583
SHRI MATAJI: No, it’s quite just the same, I feel,

180
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:34,709
because My work only works out how I meet people, isn’t it?

181
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:39,875
And when I meet the people, I find they like My work.

182
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,166
I help his people also sometimes, you can say,

183
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,041
for something wrong with them.

184
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,166
But it never collides with My work at all, I find,

185
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,041
because you are so…

186
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:52,208
you become so loving and affectionate and so tolerant

187
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:55,000
that you just don’t feel anything else.

188
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,917
It’s very nice to meet new people because…

189
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,792
Because of him I’ve gone to many communist countries,

190
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,083
I visited China and visited Russia…

191
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,333
All these places I could not have visited.

192
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:09,250
REPORTER: I think, um…

193
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,041
I mean, You must have a great deal of difficulty

194
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,792
convincing people that You are a genuine, bona fide

195
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:18,125
person, You know, it’s a little bit dangerous.

196
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,917
Do You find that there is, um, problems with people who are

197
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,333
extreme, sort of extreme people who are... ?

198
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:24,041
SHRI MATAJI: You see, it depends on what country you are.

199
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,959
Say, in India it’s not difficult at all, because they understand this,

200
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,083
They know, they have had an education on this,

201
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,875
that the one who awakens the Kundalini is the real person.

202
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,999
You see, they can see the rising of the Kundalini,

203
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,375
they can see the pulsation of the Kundalini,

204
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,709
they can feel the pulsation here.

205
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:40,041
It’s all told them, so they know about it.

206
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,583
I don’t have to work out with them.

207
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:44,959
But if otherwise the…

208
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,458
most of the seekers in other countries also have

209
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:52,000
come to right conclusions, because they have had a very bad time.

210
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,583
So they have come to right conclusions, I mean it’s not so difficult.

211
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:56,917
But of course, you know,

212
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,250
that if there’s too much mental projection, then rather difficult.

213
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,375
But it doesn’t matter.

214
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,792
REPORTER: Are there fakes in this country?

215
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:05,583
SHRI MATAJI: So many. Most of them are.

216
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,208
REPORTER: I mean, they must be Your biggest headache,

217
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:08,750
I should think, maybe.

218
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,083
SHRI MATAJI: They are not only Mine but of all the seekers.

219
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:13,959
And that’s very true.

220
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,375
They really ruin seekers. I’ve known people, they make money,

221
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:21,041
put these people out of jobs, out of their lives,

222
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,750
make them abnormal, sick like cabbages,

223
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,125
they take away… the children are ruined…it's horrible.

224
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,500
Some of them get epilepsy, some of them get cancer…

225
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:36,542
all kinds of diseases. Some people become blind.

226
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:37,625
They all punish them-

227
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,291
REPORTER: You don’t in fact charge anything, do You?

228
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,458
SHRI MATAJI: No no no. No no.

229
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:43,792
REPORTER: Then how is, Your trips round the country,

230
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:46,000
to different countries and around Britain and so on,

231
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,291
how are they actually funded then?

232
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,709
SHRI MATAJI: You see, it is mostly funded by My husband.

233
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,208
Mostly he’s a generous man.

234
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,458
REPORTER: That’s lucky, isn’t it!

235
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:54,583
SHRI MATAJI: He’s generous.

236
00:10:54,792 --> 00:11:00,000
Otherwise also I have My some income of My own.

237
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,875
REPORTER: How much would You estimate

238
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,959
that You spend trying to spread the word, a year?

239
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,792
SHRI MATAJI: Well, I can't say that, I’m not good at accounting,

240
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,625
but I would say that when I travel,

241
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:12,999
for example, supposing I go to any other country,

242
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,417
sometimes Sahaja Yogis think that I should not pay

243
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,333
for their salvation, you see.

244
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:20,417
So out of their self-respect they pay My traveling sometimes,

245
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,875
but they don’t pay Me but to the travel agency or something they,

246
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,291
buy tickets for Me at the most, that’s all.

247
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:28,875
But not much, it’s not much per year.

248
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,208
REPORTER: Where have You traveled this year?

249
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,291
SHRI MATAJI: Now, this year, let’s start.

250
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:38,125
When… where did I go, can you…?

251
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:43,709
Now, I came from America…

252
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,875
Geneva, Austria, Belgium,

253
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,959
Spain, Portugal, France,

254
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,999
Germany… Russia, I went to Russia, Uzbekistan.

255
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:55,959
REPORTER: And this is all this year, is it?

256
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,625
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, this year, yes... REPORTER: You must be worn out.

257
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:01,959
SHRI MATAJI: Do I look that? Now I’m sixty. I’m sixty now.

258
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,625
REPORTER: Really? SHRI MATAJI: Yes, I'm sixty years of age, really.

259
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:06,375
REPORTER: You don’t look sixty years old at all.

260
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,999
REPORTER: How did it all start for You then,

261
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,625
I mean, right at the beginning?

262
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,792
Well, say, I mean, most people know very little

263
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,542
about this sort of thing, me included.

264
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,834
But how did that actually all start in the beginning for You?

265
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,709
SHRI MATAJI: You see, actually I was aware of it

266
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:21,250
from My very childhood, as you are aware, say, for example,

267
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,917
you are aware you are a human being. In the same way I was aware.

268
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,542
I was absolutely aware of Me, and My mission,

269
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,709
and what I… why I’m here, what I am.

270
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:33,333
Everything  I was aware of from My very childhood.

271
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:39,208
But I was working out how to do it in en masse happening.

272
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:41,667
It would be for the masses.

273
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,583
My father himself was a realized soul

274
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:47,041
and he was a member of the Parliament and Assembly in those days,

275
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,709
and he was the only Indian to be elected.

276
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:52,250
Indian Christian to be elected, I should say.

277
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,125
My brother also is a Minister of… what is he Minister of?

278
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,500
Communications and something else.

279
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:01,041
REPORTER: So, I mean, I suppose in India,

280
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,083
I mean, that it’s not as difficult to actually, um

281
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,000
... to make people understand.

282
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,333
It’s only when You start traveling abroad?

283
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:11,542
SHRI MATAJI: Oh, Indians understand much better.

284
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,750
REPORTER: That’s what I was saying.

285
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,333
SHRI MATAJI: But abroad is the problem. Because, you see, they…

286
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:17,500
they are naive, they don’t know.

287
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,542
You see, Christ’s life was only for four years.

288
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,333
He couldn’t tell them much about it; about the Holy Ghost.

289
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:23,834
It’s all a mystery, you see.

290
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,500
The Christianity could not give that, because they never went

291
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:29,208
into the search of it, you see, the deeper of it.

292
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,458
Just reading Bible, telling some sort of an interpretation

293
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:33,834
doesn’t give you anything.

294
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,959
So the second birth part of it they didn’t work out.

295
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,959
And that’s why I find people got lost more,

296
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:45,041
because of these gurus coming, giving them some ideas, this, that…

297
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,125
And they sort of are hypnotized also to a great extent.

298
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,166
All these people are hypnotized, brainwashed,

299
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,709
then they, some of them went into drugs.

300
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:56,625
You see, so many things, they are all self-destroying.

301
00:13:56,875 --> 00:14:00,375
That’s how I found people very much confused, very much confused.

302
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,500
Of course, the people in India

303
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,875
say, for example, of this entrepreneur,

304
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,208
He knows I am a saint.

305
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:09,458
So he treats Me like a saint, it’s a very big thing,

306
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,333
and then he'll come to receive Me and…

307
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:13,250
that even the Prime Minister of India,

308
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,792
Mr. Lal Bahadur Shastri,  My husband was his secretary,

309
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:19,375
but he used to come and see Me often, in the car, you see.

310
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,458
So in India it’s a… saint is higher than all kings

311
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:24,417
and everyone put together, you see.

312
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:28,333
So they know how to respect a saint, even for popularity.

313
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,917
REPORTER: Do You find that, I mean… to call Yourself a saint…

314
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,792
do You find that the people in England…

315
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:35,917
SHRI MATAJI: They are not so much.

316
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,125
REPORTER: You know, they're not…they're not quite as keen…

317
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,542
SHRI MATAJI: (unclear...) the saints, I think.

318
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,208
No, they care more for politicians.

319
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:43,999
REPORTER: That’s right, that’s right.

320
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,583
I mean, do You find, You know, sort of…

321
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:48,542
I mean, You are little bit insulted by them sometimes?

322
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:49,834
SHRI MATAJI: Aah, it’s all right.

323
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,750
REPORTER: I mean, You firmly believe in what You do, obviously, and

324
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,792
it must seem incredible to You when other people [ignore?] it.

325
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,417
SHRI MATAJI: It’s all right. You see, after all they are children,

326
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,458
they don’t understand. That’s all I can say.

327
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,709
Because they are still children in spiritual life, you see.

328
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:07,625
But they are not going to crucify Me this time, isn’t it?

329
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,250
So it’s all right.

330
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,208
REPORTER: Now, when You make these trips

331
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:13,500
to towns like Northampton and so on,

332
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:15,500
You got several people with You.

333
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:18,041
Does this team come with You every time?

334
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,625
SHRI MATAJI: No, they are from this place, some of them are now

335
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:23,999
and some of them are there also. Of course all the others

336
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,000
they have come from Australia.

337
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,291
And we have an ashram in South London.

338
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,291
So they are staying there, so they just came around here.

339
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,417
And these two are from -

340
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,667
he’s working in London, he is also there.

341
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:41,917
And these three gentlemen are from Bedford. He is from Bristol.

342
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,291
REPORTER: Oh I see. SHRI MATAJI: But there is nothing like that,

343
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,000
is that a team or anything.

344
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,083
Anybody who feels like can come around if they’re free, because…

345
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,750
REPORTER: So anyone who is available for You, to help…

346
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,750
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, they can just to help Me,

347
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,542
because if it’s a big group and all that, so they can help Me.

348
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,875
REPORTER: I see, all right, I see.

349
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,542
Well, thanks very much for Your time.

350
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,250
SHRI MATAJI: Thank you very much. But I think you should ask

351
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,083
one more question if you can, say, about Kundalini,

352
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,625
because those who have read about Kundalini

353
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,125
would be interested to know.

354
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,750
Is that, is said that, you see, lots of books

355
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,417
have been written about Kundalini,

356
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,542
that it’s very dangerous, it is very (this thing?), and all that.

357
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,208
But it is not at all.

358
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:19,542
You see, thousands of people I’ve given realization. Thousands.

359
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,250
It has never put anybody into danger at all.

360
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:27,542
But those who are naïve, those who are unholy persons,

361
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,291
who have no idea of a spiritual life, you see,

362
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,291
if they try tricks, you see,

363
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,583
like sex, you see, through sex and all that nonsense,

364
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:39,667
then it feels insulted, and then there are problems.

365
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,667
REPORTER: How can it be dangerous then?

366
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,709
SHRI MATAJI: Beg your pardon? REPORTER: How, You said, it can be dangerous

367
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:45,250
if it's not used properly?

368
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,875
SHRI MATAJI: You see, like we could say that

369
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:50,250
if I don’t know this instrument and I put My hand into something,

370
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,917
I may get a burning, but it doesn’t mean this is dangerous,

371
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,291
that is because I don’t know how to work it…

372
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,959
REPORTER:That is basic, I mean, if you don’t understand it's

373
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,917
like putting your finger in an electric light socket...…

374
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:02,125
SHRI MATAJI: That’s what, you see. That’s like that, you see.

375
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,333
But they try to do it

376
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,417
and then they try to write books about it.

377
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,125
It’s something surprising, isn’t it?

378
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:11,291
I haven’t written any book so far.

379
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,083
REPORTER: So, that’s obviously, You know,

380
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,542
sort of the thing you've got to try and make clear to people.

381
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,709
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, you have to. And then, you see,

382
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:21,834
when you get realization, you automatically become righteous,

383
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,417
I don’t have to tell you “Become righteous.”

384
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,709
Because the religion is enlightened within you.

385
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:28,166
You automatically become. I don’t tell you that “You don’t drink,”

386
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,417
you just don’t drink, because you don’t enjoy it any more.

387
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,417
You don’t smoke, because you just don’t enjoy it; don’t take drugs.

388
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,500
Just you just don’t do it because it’s all enlightened,

389
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:37,625
because a new priority has come.

390
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:40,583
Like if there’s light in this room, suddenly you start seeing

391
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,166
where’s the position of everything,

392
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,125
and you know, if you walk this way, you’ll be hit.

393
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,500
In the same way, enlightenment means that

394
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:48,333
automatically you become righteous.

395
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,041
REPORTER: What is Your success rate in full for healing people?

396
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,875
SHRI MATAJI: What is?… REPORTER: What is Your success rate

397
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,583
for healing people who come to see You?

398
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:56,291
SHRI MATAJI: Success? REPORTER: Successful or have helped them.

399
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
REPORTER: How many times do You actually heal people

400
00:17:58,709 --> 00:17:59,667
compared to the number of people who come to see You?

401
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,792
SHRI MATAJI: Oh, some people just come, for ten minutes is sufficient.

402
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,417
Our president Sanjiva Reddy, the first president,

403
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,083
he was coming from England… America.

404
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,750
His operation had failed, he was just in a very bad shape.

405
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,166
I just went to see him

406
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:19,000
and he didn’t know I was Mataji, but he knew Me as Mrs. Shrivastav.

407
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,542
And suddenly our High Commissioner told him,

408
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,417
“This is Mataji Nirmala Devi.”

409
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,583
So his wife said, “I’ve heard You have cured so many people,

410
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:28,041
so just cure my husband.”

411
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,583
I put My hand only for ten minutes, you’ll be surprised.

412
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:32,041
He was just, then — he got it.

413
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,875
REPORTER: This can happen every time

414
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,166
when You get somebody come to see You?

415
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,458
SHRI MATAJI: Not always. Some people take more time,

416
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:39,959
some people take less time.

417
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,709
It depends on if they are complicated,

418
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:46,750
you see, they take more time, some of them do.

419
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,583
You see, for example, supposing I have to break through, now.

420
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:52,333
And if you are just there, you will out.

421
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:55,041
REPORTER: Are there some people You just simply can’t heal?

422
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:00,375
SHRI MATAJI: Some people… I don’t know, but, you see…

423
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,125
I don’t know, I don’t remember of someone

424
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:06,125
who came to Me and was not healed so far.

425
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,041
Some might have been, I don’t know.

426
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,917
But those who came, you see, assiduously —

427
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:15,667
I don’t think, isn’t it?

428
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,917
As far as I remember, I should say.

429
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,166
REPORTER: Yeah, You've done quite a lot.

430
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,000
SHRI MATAJI: You see, there are so many I have, it has happened,

431
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,792
even these people are healing, you see.

432
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:25,875
So there’s no end to it. Imagine,

433
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,667
one person is Me, I can remember for Myself,

434
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,458
but there are so many they are healing, and

435
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:32,959
I just forget about it, I just don’t remember.

436
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,709
Once I had gone to a program, I was just sitting.

437
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:38,000
One gentleman came, he just touched My feet.

438
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,125
I said, “Who are you?” He said, “You forgot me?”

439
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,750
I said, “Why?” I said, “I’m sorry.”

440
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:45,041
He said, “I’m the father of such and such girl,

441
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,917
whom You cured in two minutes time,

442
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,166
who was going to die, and this and that in the hospital.”

443
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,667
I said, “Really?”

444
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,834
I tried to remember, I said, “Who was this?” you see.

445
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,333
Then with very great difficulty I remembered,

446
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:58,125
because it was so quick.

447
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,542
I had gone to see somebody else

448
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,583
and on My way back he caught hold of Me.

449
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,083
And there she was. She was cured in such a quick manner

450
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,750
that I'd forgotten all about it. REPORTER: Really?

451
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:09,959
Well, I suppose, the proof is in the pudding, isn’t it?

452
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,000
SHRI MATAJI: Yes. And moreover, what I’m saying

453
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:15,250
it is not important. What is important is to become Spirit.

454
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,625
Healing is not important.

455
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:21,166
You see, because everyone has to die in any case, isn’t it?

456
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:25,166
What is important  that you have to become the Spirit.

457
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,792
That is. And then you heal others.

458
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:32,375
Not only yourself, you can heal yourself and heal others also.

459
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,625
REPORTER: All right, very good... Well, as I say,

460
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:36,333
thank You, thank You for Your time.

461
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:38,417
SHRI MATAJI: Many incurable diseases you can put,

462
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,083
but that’s not the main job, I think.

463
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,917
REPORTER: Yes. I think that’s probably the thing

464
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,375
that a lot of people are most interested in.

465
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,667
SHRI MATAJI: I agree, yes. YOGI: Excuse me, Mother.

466
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:52,792
When you asked me[UNCLEAR] in Paris, and Mother took it very well,

467
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:54,709
but they described Her as a man.

468

[YOGINI SPEAKING]

469
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,208

470
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:00,667
REPORTER: I think you are speaking to the wrong person.

471
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:01,959

And he also said I’m a He, you see, put My photograph.

so many things - like Me, also, as you said, I am just…

SHRI MATAJI: Our style is like this. Is this all right?

00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,625
SHRI MATAJI: You can ask

to put their hands towards My photograph also.

495
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:51,709
My photograph has vibrations.

You see, they have got realization from My photograph.

497

Yes, really, they have been cured from My photograph.
