1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:11,730
in this totality a world has to be

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:14,420
created of people by the people who have

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,420
no fear

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:27,700
this fear has to do behind all this

5
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:32,970
nonsensical nervousness is fear so for

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:38,019
that what she does is to give a Vida

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:41,290
under her protection you are beyond fear

8
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:43,480
you are protected but if you don't want

9
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:47,440
to believe in yourself and you don't

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:51,100
believe into her protection then nobody

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:59,949
can help because everything is mythical

12
00:00:51,100 --> 00:01:03,010
for you in every venture that we take up

13
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:06,479
we should not have any fear because God

14
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:10,570
is with you is a fact - the truth

15
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:14,080
you just try but when you try through

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:16,030
your ego you fall into the trap of fear

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,970
I have seen egoistical people are the

18
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:22,450
most frightened people and panicked

19
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:26,650
because they panic others and so they

20
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:28,870
think they can be panicked one day when

21
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:33,280
the English were here first of all in in

22
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:36,130
India we are all frightened of them now

23
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,440
I see that in England every English

24
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,720
family is threatened of others

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,840
they only open a [ __ ] of the door to

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,090
see who is there and shut it the so

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,400
frightened I'm surprised that they say

28
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:50,920
English we're over us here and we were

29
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,470
soapy which before them and now they are

30
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,700
the ones who are frightened of us

31
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,900
because when a person who is egoistical

32
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:01,060
tries to dominate others he sees himself

33
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:04,060
in the mirror and thinks that the other

34
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:07,420
person will dominate that's how this

35
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:10,420
fear crÃªpes creeps in inter minds and we

36
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:15,940
start getting all kinds of these stupid

37
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:21,120
Tantrums out of this mythical fear the

38
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,120
fear is created by our ego

39
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,490
a person who is no ego he'll have no

40
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,640
fear because you are not harmed anyone

41
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,800
why should you have any fear and such a

42
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,880
man are such a woman will be looked

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:39,300
after by God because God takes over when

44
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:43,020
you surrender your ego to God he takes

45
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,270
over but those who have ego he says all

46
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,250
right go ahead use your ego try to

47
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:54,200
protect yourself cut your throat

48
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:59,010
that's what it so when I talk of total

49
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:02,120
benevolence I am talking about your own

50
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:05,090
total benevolence so first is the fear

51
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:09,930
we should go out of your mind completely

52
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:12,210
if you believe in the Almighty God will

53
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,060
say you are Almighty God is Almighty

54
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,890
this thing is all lip-service if you

55
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,470
believe that god is almighty and you are

56
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:22,980
connected with god then why should you

57
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:25,230
have any fear of anything but when we

58
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,440
say don't have here another extreme

59
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:32,310
comes up we don't have fear we can do

60
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:35,340
what we like we can perform everything

61
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,900
ourselves we need not tell anyone you

62
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:41,220
have to tell God whatever you are doing

63
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:47,550
you have to take permission you have to

64
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:50,610
inform in his garb are in his coat that

65
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:54,120
sir you have son they are thinking of

66
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:56,480
doing such a system but you think you

67
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,480
are God

68
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,330
we are not and that's why the another

69
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,409
part of lawn fear is this kind of an

70
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:08,650
arbitrary behavior which is very

71
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:16,419
dangerous for sahaja yoga for yourself

72
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:20,620
or for everybody else the second fear I

73
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:22,769
mean I have is that if I tell you

74
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,769
anything

75
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:28,389
99% of you understand is for your

76
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:31,300
benevolence is for your good but there

77
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:34,690
is one percent of people who can just

78
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,400
react because they have too much ego and

79
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:40,419
they won't take it because they don't

80
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,400
think of their own benevolence they

81
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:45,780
don't understand that if I am telling

82
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:51,729
them anything it is just to give them

83
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:54,550
completeness totality but on the

84
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:58,449
contrary they take a very wrong attitude

85
00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:02,289
this is another non sensitive so now one

86
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:05,139
has to develop a kind of a indifference

87
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:07,840
to this kind of people who unnecessarily

88
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:11,169
go to the other limit of their own

89
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,419
destruction I don't want to see what is

90
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:16,110
the point in everything that I am

91
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:18,310
Telling only I can tell you who else I

92
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,590
have to tell you what's wrong with you

93
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,070
what you have done wrong and then you

94
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,070
must change
