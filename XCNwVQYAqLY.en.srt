00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Diwali Puja Talk November 1, 1981 Chelsham Road Ashram, London, UK

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today I told you about the importance of Lakshmi principle

3
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:14,914
within us and

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,722
and the three processes

5
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,099
through which we pass.

6
00:00:24,283 --> 00:00:26,776
First is the Gruha Lakshmi.

7
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:30,332
Actually, this is celebrated mostly on the thirteenth day

8
00:00:29,736 --> 00:00:31,736
of the moon, where they say that

9
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,824
the housewife has to be given some present.

10
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:35,866
And the best thing she can have is a some sort of an utensil.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So people give her some utensils, actually

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
it’s a very mutual thing, because

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
if you give an utensil, she is supposed to cook for you.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It’s a very sweet way of suggesting that you cook something for us.

15
00:01:11,386 --> 00:01:15,343
Then the fourteenth day is very important,

16
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:24,531
because that is the day the Goddess as a power,

17
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:31,680
as a power, because it was Kartikeya who killed Narakasura, the devil.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,402
And he was one of the worst of all, could not be killed.

19
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:45,584
So Shiva and Parvati were married

20
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:50,885
for this special purpose to produce this powerful Shaktiputra,

21
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:55,037
means the son of the Shakti, known as Kartikeya.

22
00:01:56,922 --> 00:02:00,484
And He was just born to kill this horrible devil,

23
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,420
called as Narakasura.

24
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:09,385
And He killed. That is the day, fourteenth day.

25
00:02:09,934 --> 00:02:11,934
It is something like Halloween, that day.

26
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:14,612
Because that is the day they opened

27
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:21,737
the gates of hell and put all the devils into hell.

28
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:28,057
And that’s why that day one has to rest in the morning time as long as possible.

29
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:31,907
So that let all the devils be put in nicely

30
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:36,274
because some of them might be hanging around still.

31
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:40,124
It’s better to allow them to get out.

32
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:43,147
I mean in the realm that you are

33
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:45,860
you do not feel much their existence.

34
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:49,981
But if you were in the realm of subconscious area or collective subconscious,

35
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:54,123
people see even some of the spirits

36
00:02:54,193 --> 00:02:56,198
and also can feel their existence,

37
00:02:56,278 --> 00:02:58,138
they see the black spots and all that.

38
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:04,276
So that day is very dangerous,

39
00:03:04,623 --> 00:03:08,005
but because Narakasura was killed,

40
00:03:09,954 --> 00:03:12,043
people celebrated.

41
00:03:12,142 --> 00:03:17,218
That celebration is expressed next day,

42
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:21,905
which that day is the day of Diwali they say.

43
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:25,868
That is the day they also worship Lakshmi, because

44
00:03:26,743 --> 00:03:29,217
they think that

45
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,429
that’s the day Lakshmi was born on this earth

46
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:36,830
from the sea as I told you last time.

47
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,447
Then the day of the New Year comes in afterwards,

48
00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:47,356
because in India in the north,

49
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:50,759
that’s the time people finish their crops

50
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:56,440
and they found that day was very good to celebrate the New Year.

51
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:58,226
And,

52
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:07,155
that is actually more, sort of, we can say is a social thing in India,

53
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:09,701
we need not use that,

54
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,915
what ever suits us. You can have your own New Year. Because in the south,

55
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,940
say in Maharastra they have another New Year, as I told you where

56
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,759
Shalivahana in his dynasty started another

57
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:27,483
calendar and they celebrate that.

58
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:30,849
So all these things are nothing is rigid

59
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,214
about anything, one must know. Nothing is rigid.

60
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:37,813
Rigidity comes from ignorance.

61
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:41,632
It’s all for you, for your joy and happiness.

62
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:44,418
The whole festival system is for your happiness

63
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:48,225
and not for the happiness of the time or date.

64
00:04:48,536 --> 00:04:52,550
It’s for you, so it should be adjustable according to your

65
00:04:53,713 --> 00:04:56,625
needs and understanding.

66
00:04:57,984 --> 00:05:00,896
And also according to your

67
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,120
national way you live.

68
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:08,260
They should be no addiction to any

69
00:05:08,277 --> 00:05:13,109
particular type of culture, a particular type of ideas.

70
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:16,822
It’s all for you. All these festivals are for you, not for gods.

71
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:18,745
They don’t have these festivals.

72
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:22,060
It’s only for you people these festivals are there.

73
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:26,203
And when you celebrate them, that’s only for your joy and your happiness.

74
00:05:26,562 --> 00:05:29,020
And that’s how you should celebrate in a way

75
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:32,999
that gives you the greatest amount of happiness.

76
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,506
And the festivals, all the festivals of the world must be celebrated.

77
00:05:37,818 --> 00:05:40,378
The more you are festive, the happier it is.

78
00:05:41,155 --> 00:05:43,769
Why miss the chance, you see.

79
00:05:44,162 --> 00:05:49,800
So as Sahaja Yogis you can celebrate, you can’t put yourselves in yawn.

80
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:06,460
So as a Sahaja Yogi you don’t belong to any particular

81
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,937
caste or community anymore now, you belong to universal caste.

82
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:13,512
Once you start belonging to the universal thing,

83
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:16,763
then you can celebrate all the festivals of all the religions.

84
00:06:16,963 --> 00:06:18,714
And have the best of it.

85
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:24,164
All the year out, you can celebrate all the festivals. Know about them,

86
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:26,526
the more you know, the better it is.

87
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:29,251
And have all kinds of sweets,

88
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:32,840
whatever you use, whatever type you use, in whatever

89
00:06:33,146 --> 00:06:36,542
areas and countries and cultures. And that’s how

90
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:42,497
we have to be more festive.

91
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:47,097
Now the last day is very important,

92
00:06:47,246 --> 00:06:50,092
is a very universal day I should say, called as

93
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,705
Bhaiya Duja, this day,

94
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:56,453
or they call it also in Marathi Vao Dijum,

95
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:00,313
different names. The brothers and sisters day.

96
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:10,434
Now the brothers’ and sisters’ relationship

97
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,440
has to be very, very strong. And the purity of that relationship

98
00:07:16,974 --> 00:07:18,376
is to be maintained.

99
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:23,027
It is not necessary that you should be born as brothers and sisters,

100
00:07:23,387 --> 00:07:24,470
not necessary.

101
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:28,380
But you are born, because if you are

102
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,427
realized souls you are born as brothers and sisters.

103
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:35,906
So that purity must be maintained in the society of Sahaja Yoga.

104
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:42,303
Very important, that we should try to develop this

105
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:48,083
situation that brothers and sisters

106
00:07:48,407 --> 00:07:53,369
are something very pure. Their relationships are very pure.

107
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:58,903
And they should not be at all challenged.

108
00:07:59,308 --> 00:08:02,832
It is so much so that even if you call somebody your brother,

109
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:08,119
he is your brother and the more you develop this relationship,

110
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:13,351
the better your left Vishuddhi will be. Because left Vishuddhi

111
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,540
is the relationship with God as a brother

112
00:08:17,787 --> 00:08:20,344
or with a Goddess as a sister.

113
00:08:21,595 --> 00:08:26,662
So, Shri Krishna’s sister, as you know was

114
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:30,360
born to Nand

115
00:08:30,604 --> 00:08:34,055
and Shri Krishna himself was born in a prison.

116
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:38,000
So there was an exchange that took place.

117
00:08:38,862 --> 00:08:43,838
They had to replace Her in His place.

118
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,798
And then when Kamsa,

119
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:55,882
the uncle of Krishna, tried to kill that girl,

120
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:58,141
She went into the sky

121
00:08:58,785 --> 00:09:03,238
and like a lightning She said that “Your killer is still living in Gokul,

122
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:07,842
is still there.” So this lightning that we see,

123
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:11,582
is representative of that power,

124
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,820
which we call as Vishnumaya, is the sister’s. If your sisterly feelings

125
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:20,560
towards women are good and strong,

126
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,129
your left Vishuddhi will be very good.

127
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,533
It has many other qualities.

128
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:31,780
For example a person, who has a very good left Vishuddi,

129
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:34,533
is a very confident person.

130
00:09:36,027 --> 00:09:39,109
Not only that, but whatever he says comes out true.

131
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,783
Even by mistake, he says something, it comes true.

132
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,798
It’s a very powerful center left Vishuddhi is.

133
00:09:51,713 --> 00:10:00,376
Such a person, whenever he speaks to, say, criticize something

134
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:04,639
or to cut down something or to be against something,

135
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:08,188
then it has the power to crash

136
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:15,087
all that he doesn’t want. See like, you can say

137
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:19,643
Christ, His left Vishuddhi

138
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:23,789
is expressed through His relationship with Mary Magdalene.

139
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,100
When He stood up and said that

140
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:35,399
“Those who have not committed any sin can stone her,” so this is His power.

141
00:10:37,164 --> 00:10:42,328
The sin of the people just crashed them completely;

142
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:45,884
they were finished, because the sin was there. And the sin was

143
00:10:46,106 --> 00:10:51,403
of left Vishuddhi. There was no purity. And when there is no purity,

144
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:54,442
the person who is so pure says such a thing,

145
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,953
all these people lost their powers; they couldn’t even stone.

146
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:06,143
Now this sister of His was born later on as Draupadi

147
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,147
and that to very near the place we have been to, Vani,

148
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:15,069
you know, where we saw. Gavin do you remember when we were going to Nagpur?

149
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:23,074
Near Vani she was born, that place and there’s a very big temple of that.

150
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:29,058
She was called as Draupadi and you know how Shri Krishna tried to save

151
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:31,136
Her chastity.

152
00:11:32,253 --> 00:11:35,878
Now people,

153
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:42,317
I have heard, are trying also to say things against Mary Magdalene

154
00:11:42,695 --> 00:11:46,991
and against Christ and all kinds of things, you see. This is the sign of

155
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:51,061
the decadence of our brains and of our morality

156
00:11:51,182 --> 00:11:54,747
that we cannot see purity in any relationship.

157
00:11:56,226 --> 00:11:59,510
We cannot see any purity in any relationship.

158
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:03,419
So we as sahaja yogis have to develop

159
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,057
more of that. Instead of that what I find that people,

160
00:12:08,557 --> 00:12:12,272
specially in the West, try to think whom we are going to marry whom.

161
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:16,012
These relationships are established, is wrong.

162
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:21,632
There is no need to go on organizing marriages

163
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:24,988
and playing these games of romance and all that.

164
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:27,994
If marriage has to take place, it will take place.

165
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:30,677
But don’t spoil the atmosphere.

166
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:33,142
There are some people who are just like

167
00:12:34,143 --> 00:12:37,507
barbers, who try to organize marriages

168
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:41,083
you see and take a great pride in arranging marriages

169
00:12:41,082 --> 00:12:43,416
with this one to that one and that one to that one.

170
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,533
Is not a desirable thing; one should not do it. There’s no

171
00:12:49,491 --> 00:12:53,058
virtue in these things, is to organize marriages all the time.

172
00:12:53,922 --> 00:12:55,922
When the marriage time comes,

173
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:56,872
it takes place.

174
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Now at the time of Mohammed Sahib

175
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:06,825
a big question arose, because there were very few man

176
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,658
many ladies of all age groups.

177
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:12,346
And they didn’t know what to do, how to save these girls

178
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:15,308
because so many men died in the war.

179
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:21,427
So then they asked, “What to do now at this juncture in a position, when such

180
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:24,879
a catastrophe is there and so many women are

181
00:13:24,924 --> 00:13:28,306
there, and very, very few men?” Then He said, “All right, you can marry

182
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:32,296
four or five wives and you can marry in any age group.”

183
00:13:32,386 --> 00:13:34,386
Because if you have to

184
00:13:34,886 --> 00:13:38,983
live with dharma, means marriage, means collective sanction,

185
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:41,483
not without marriage.

186
00:13:41,664 --> 00:13:43,664
So He said, “All right, you can even marry five times,

187
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:46,494
but you must marry, without marriage you cannot live.”

188
00:13:48,997 --> 00:13:50,997
And that is why He was particular

189
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,463
that every person should be married and should have no relationship

190
00:13:55,508 --> 00:13:56,895
without marriage, was sin.

191
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,480
Instead of that now Muslims think that it

192
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:01,783
is there right to marry five persons.

193
00:14:01,828 --> 00:14:04,196
I mean, when the men are more and women are less.

194
00:14:06,835 --> 00:14:09,973
Is a wrong thing. You have to find out the solution.

195
00:14:10,336 --> 00:14:14,835
And at that time the relationship between

196
00:14:15,846 --> 00:14:19,066
even the sisters and brothers had to delimit,

197
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:20,914
because there was a big problem.

198
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:26,561
So He said, “All right, the children born of the same parents cannot marry,

199
00:14:27,061 --> 00:14:29,844
but cousins could marry,” that time.

200
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:33,951
Now that time is changed, all right,

201
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:36,546
it’s not that time. We are not on war,

202
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:40,405
there is nothing happening like that. There is no such problem.

203
00:14:40,905 --> 00:14:42,905
So let us develop now our

204
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,837
pure relationship of brothers and sisters.

205
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:49,685
Actually, first time when we had this

206
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:52,633
this Diwali function, I asked people

207
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:55,133
to find one sister for yourself.

208
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,861
Every gentleman must have one sister,

209
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:06,560
to find out one. And then that is the day, I said, let us start this way

210
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:12,568
that next time when we meet on another day called as

211
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:16,297
Rakhi Purnima,

212
00:15:16,478 --> 00:15:20,075
that you tie the rakhi in the hand, the same brothers and sisters.

213
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:23,808
In India also we did like that and it worked very well.

214
00:15:24,308 --> 00:15:28,283
But there the relationships are so strong. Once Dhumal, you see,

215
00:15:28,783 --> 00:15:31,876
I think tied it to Raulbai.

216
00:15:32,194 --> 00:15:34,957
And now even if I say something to Raulbai, he doesn’t like.

217
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,845
It exceeded to that extent. It’s so sweet you know.

218
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:43,756
And even Dhumal’s wife respects Raulbai as an elder sister, you see.

219
00:15:43,983 --> 00:15:47,928
It’s very sweet. Like that many relationships are established.

220
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:50,096
And next year I think Raulbai

221
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:54,531
became the sister of one of our trustees, who was no more there.

222
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:57,269
And she always carried on all that

223
00:15:57,314 --> 00:16:00,510
relationship, and they also, I mean imagine.

224
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,423
The whole thing is that, that relationship is so special,

225
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,923
so close and so pure.

226
00:16:11,154 --> 00:16:13,154
And such a relationship one should develop

227
00:16:13,882 --> 00:16:16,588
with a lady, any woman

228
00:16:17,088 --> 00:16:20,277
or any friend you want to have.

229
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:23,716
One should remember that it cannot

230
00:16:23,897 --> 00:16:26,394
cross a certain limit, there has to have a maryada.

231
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:28,248
Otherwise they will become brothers and sisters

232
00:16:28,247 --> 00:16:29,881
and then they marry, it’s not possible.

233
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:34,571
So we have to have the boundaries; that is very important.

234
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,300
In Sahaja Yoga we have to have maryadas

235
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:41,370
and boundaries. And one of them is this: that once you call somebody

236
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:45,256
brother or a sister, is absolutely pure relationship.

237
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:48,341
Little further we’ll go with that

238
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:52,342
and that the relationship with a, as I have told you before,

239
00:16:52,842 --> 00:16:59,141
that with your, say, husband’s younger brothers

240
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:02,235
is just like that they are like your younger brothers,

241
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:04,651
all of them, husband’s younger brothers

242
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:07,823
or younger Sahaja yogis than your husbands, are.

243
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,607
The other way round is for all the ladies,

244
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:23,555
we can say, all the men, their wives, elder ladies, elder to your wives,

245
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:26,915
are like sisters, elder sisters.

246
00:17:27,737 --> 00:17:30,529
I mean this relationship is so sweet and

247
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:33,477
gives you a certain amount of understanding

248
00:17:33,571 --> 00:17:36,149
how much distance is kept with whom,

249
00:17:36,406 --> 00:17:38,728
with whom to be free and with whom to have the distance.

250
00:17:39,228 --> 00:17:41,960
And this must be maintained with such a beautiful way

251
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:45,910
that this purity is not corrupted.

252
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:51,070
You keep to pure standards. This is

253
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,622
the nourishment of Sahaja yoga, is the nourishment

254
00:17:54,879 --> 00:17:56,879
of your growth, purity.

255
00:17:57,095 --> 00:17:59,878
Purity is the most important thing for us,

256
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:08,314
purity in every way. If you are pure, you will not do anything

257
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:17,180
that is, we can say, that is not pure.

258
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,977
So first of all you’ll be pure yourself

259
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:24,207
and you’ll accept purity, you’ll appreciate purity,

260
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:28,240
you will be sustained by purity. Any impurity will not collaborate

261
00:18:28,862 --> 00:18:32,549
or try to compromise with you.

262
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:38,461
That’s why purity is your Mother’s name.

263
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,326
You know that My name is purity.

264
00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:45,798
And this purity is such that it pures everything,

265
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:47,773
it just purifies.

266
00:18:47,949 --> 00:18:50,646
The purity should be such that it should purify,

267
00:18:52,444 --> 00:18:54,444
otherwise that purity has no meaning.

268
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:59,915
For example, a soap purifies, all right. But you don’t purify the soap.

269
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,883
Do you clean the soap? I mean some crazy people might be.

270
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:07,991
I know some people, who even wash

271
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:10,491
the tap and also the water.

272
00:19:13,465 --> 00:19:16,739
And that’s why, that’s why

273
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:21,228
this water, which is the purifier, water is the purifier,

274
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:23,769
water purifies us physically.

275
00:19:25,121 --> 00:19:29,401
And also our poisons are driven out of our liver

276
00:19:29,495 --> 00:19:32,689
also by water. Water is a very great element

277
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:34,743
element in removing all problems.

278
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:38,074
You use water for so many things; you know how it works it out.

279
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:44,962
So this Lakshmi, which is purification, was born out of water.

280
00:19:45,462 --> 00:19:48,042
That’s why She was called as Mary as I told you.

281
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:52,430
And I’m also called as Nira, meaning born out of water.

282
00:19:57,189 --> 00:20:00,503
So one has to understand that today’s message

283
00:20:00,638 --> 00:20:05,533
is that we inculcate purity.

284
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:13,051
We should not cheat ourselves. It is easy to cheat, but we should inculcate

285
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:16,615
purity within ourselves

286
00:20:17,331 --> 00:20:26,823
as a matter of our own maturity, as our own decoration, as our own beauty

287
00:20:27,323 --> 00:20:33,279
and not just because it’s a laborious thing

288
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,178
or it is a very hard thing, not like that.

289
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:42,211
It should be achieved with great pleasure and happiness.

290
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:44,711
How do we like to have a bath

291
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,510
or to be clean and to be presentable?

292
00:20:48,751 --> 00:20:52,405
In the same way we should try to clean our thoughts.

293
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,008
Just by paying attention to them, we can clean them.

294
00:20:57,112 --> 00:21:00,877
Thoughts must be made clean. First of all why have thoughts at all.

295
00:21:02,671 --> 00:21:06,020
But even if you have, have clean and pure thoughts.

296
00:21:07,469 --> 00:21:12,558
Even if you have to have, don’t have thoughts full of arrogance,

297
00:21:13,058 --> 00:21:15,058
aggression or of fear.

298
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:17,608
Some people think that if you have thoughts of fear

299
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:19,677
it’s a very good thing; “Oh I'm frightened,

300
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:23,665
I am afraid.” It’s impurity. Why should you be afraid?

301
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,890
That means your left Vishuddhi is catching.

302
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,939
There’s no need to have any fear of any kind;

303
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:34,439
no need to have any fear of any kind.

304
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:37,732
If you have to have fear

305
00:21:38,103 --> 00:21:39,762
that means there’s something wrong with you.

306
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:43,290
If you believe that God is above all,

307
00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:46,213
you are a realized soul and that

308
00:21:46,713 --> 00:21:48,713
God is going to look after you,

309
00:21:49,213 --> 00:21:51,213
that He is your father,

310
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:53,454
that He’s open His gates to you,

311
00:21:53,954 --> 00:21:55,472
what is there to be afraid of?

312
00:21:55,972 --> 00:21:58,820
Many people think that way that if you have the fears,

313
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:02,824
you are humble. Humility is different

314
00:22:03,065 --> 00:22:05,065
from a frightened person.

315
00:22:05,436 --> 00:22:07,436
It’s absolutely a egible thing

316
00:22:07,548 --> 00:22:09,168
it has nothing to do with humility.

317
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:12,590
So to be humble is different

318
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,198
and to be frightened is different. For Sahaja yogis

319
00:22:18,914 --> 00:22:23,389
it is very easy to find out through their vibratory awareness

320
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,277
what is fear and what is humility.

321
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:33,385
As humility will give you vibrations and fear will catch all your left side.

322
00:22:39,189 --> 00:22:43,229
So our purification of our mind

323
00:22:43,427 --> 00:22:45,820
comes through certain methods

324
00:22:46,104 --> 00:22:48,104
of understanding ourselves.

325
00:22:48,604 --> 00:22:51,815
First of the understandings one has to have

326
00:23:01,907 --> 00:23:07,758
is that we are born

327
00:23:08,258 --> 00:23:11,508
in a family, born in a society, born in a so-called

328
00:23:12,008 --> 00:23:13,152
religious sect or whatever it is.

329
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:22,215
So all these fixations have put into us certain amount of impurities.

330
00:23:23,212 --> 00:23:26,266
Which may give us ego, superego, anything it might give us.

331
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:32,145
So to keep it pure and simple is:

332
00:23:34,137 --> 00:23:37,066
take to water element as much as you can.

333
00:23:38,277 --> 00:23:43,341
It helps both ways, it helps ego, it helps superego. Take to water element.

334
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:51,387
And that is what Lakshmi is. Lakshmi is the one that gives you

335
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:53,887
the Mahalakshmi Tattwa.

336
00:23:54,387 --> 00:23:58,357
From the Lakshmi only the Mahalakshmi’s principle comes in.

337
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,818
And this is after the purification through the Lakshmi process.

338
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:05,318
Christ has said, “If you want

339
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,244
I can give you gold, gold parts,

340
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:10,966
you can live with it.

341
00:24:12,105 --> 00:24:16,456
But those who love Me will only enter into the Kingdom of God.

342
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,956
And I will eat with them,”

343
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,179
means those who are pure only I will eat with them.

344
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:23,679
I will not eat with people, who are impure.

345
00:24:26,168 --> 00:24:31,308
He was so, I mean, every, all the incarnations are aware of it,

346
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:35,068
that they have to be with the pure people

347
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:38,678
and they have to help the pure people. But He so clearly said it

348
00:24:40,277 --> 00:24:42,277
that if you want Lakshmi,

349
00:24:42,423 --> 00:24:44,708
you can have it, that’s money.

350
00:24:46,661 --> 00:24:50,778
But that’s not Mahalakshmi, so from Lakshmi to Mahalakshmi state.

351
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,142
You’ve already got

352
00:24:53,146 --> 00:24:55,714
your realization, you do not know how much you have got it already

353
00:24:56,214 --> 00:24:59,267
You are already having the Mahalakshmi principle within you.

354
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:02,381
And what is the Mahalakshmi principle? That’s the point.

355
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:04,299
Can I ask this question?

356
00:25:13,675 --> 00:25:15,675
What is the Mahalakshmi principle within you?

357
00:25:20,464 --> 00:25:22,688
It’s all for the Spirit.

358
00:25:23,578 --> 00:25:25,157
It’s all for the Spirit.

359
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,330
No, no. But you have a power.

360
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,315
You have got MahaLakshmi’s powers within you, do you know that?

361
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:37,428
The pleasure it gives you.

362
00:25:37,511 --> 00:25:37,845
hmm?

363
00:25:37,928 --> 00:25:39,465
The pleasure it gives you.

364
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,038
Beg your pardon?

365
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:41,623
The pleasure it gives you.

366
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:42,302
The pleasure?

367
00:25:42,345 --> 00:25:42,843
Yes.

368
00:25:42,886 --> 00:25:43,822
No, no, no.

369
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:45,922
The power of giving realization.

370
00:25:47,108 --> 00:25:49,579
Go ahead still, little more, more.

371
00:25:49,654 --> 00:25:53,072
Pleasure is not a power.

372
00:25:53,972 --> 00:25:58,391
Pleasure is what you enjoy. But you have a power of Mahalakshmi.

373
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,891
Sustaining power.

374
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:04,428
Sustaining power.

375
00:26:05,786 --> 00:26:12,542
That’s no power. Power means, you have that power to do something.

376
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:19,593
The power to spread Sahaja yoga.

377
00:26:19,693 --> 00:26:21,693
The power to spread Sahaja yoga Mother.

378
00:26:22,193 --> 00:26:25,457
That’s rather vague, particular one.

379
00:26:25,614 --> 00:26:27,614
Power to give realization.

380
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:32,711
To evolve Mother.

381
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:37,326
To evolve.

382
00:26:37,826 --> 00:26:39,826
But to evolve is your own.

383
00:26:40,326 --> 00:26:42,326
Power is what you do to others.

384
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:50,046
The whole thing I told you just now. Is to purify.

385
00:26:52,338 --> 00:26:58,928
You have the power to purify. How do you cure people?

386
00:26:59,926 --> 00:27:06,061
By purifying them. All right?

387
00:27:08,851 --> 00:27:13,255
Now just think how you purify others, by talking to others

388
00:27:13,755 --> 00:27:15,755
you can purify them.

389
00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:24,302
By touching others, you can purify them. By looking at them,

390
00:27:24,802 --> 00:27:26,175
you can purify them.

391
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:29,657
One person who is a realized soul,

392
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:33,479
purifies the whole atmosphere. The atmosphere is purified.

393
00:27:33,979 --> 00:27:35,979
Since I’ve come, it has been warm enough.

394
00:27:40,163 --> 00:27:45,257
You purify everything. You purify this light, do you notice that?

395
00:27:46,852 --> 00:27:48,852
You’ve awakened the light.

396
00:27:53,932 --> 00:27:55,932
Now what other powers you have?

397
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:05,600
To raise the Kundalini.

398
00:28:07,195 --> 00:28:09,195
That’s awakening.

399
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,396
See Kundalini is many powers, is many-folded.

400
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,543
You purify yourselves,

401
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,839
others and yourselves.

402
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,508
Some more powers are there. Now come along, let’s have it.

403
00:28:25,451 --> 00:28:27,678
You all have those powers and you are not aware of them

404
00:28:27,658 --> 00:28:29,397
this is the best part of it.

405
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:34,834
You can’t follow it. Now let’s have it.

406
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:37,148
Power over time. Arranging time to suit yourselves Mother.

407
00:28:40,024 --> 00:28:42,024
Power over time.

408
00:28:42,524 --> 00:28:44,524
Arranging time to suit yourselves.

409
00:28:45,173 --> 00:28:47,173
That’s not a power of Mahalakshmi.

410
00:28:48,341 --> 00:28:50,819
That’s another one I’ll tell you who does that.

411
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:58,627
Balance.

412
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:07,932
It gives balance between ego and superego?

413
00:29:07,949 --> 00:29:11,407
That’s true. That is one of them. But that is guru power.

414
00:29:11,424 --> 00:29:13,154
That is the guru’s power.

415
00:29:13,654 --> 00:29:14,865
Balance comes from guru.

416
00:29:18,196 --> 00:29:20,620
See Mahalakshmi is water, so now you tell Me.

417
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:23,785
To cleanse.

418
00:29:24,285 --> 00:29:27,936
That’s done now, the cleansing is done. Water else water does?

419
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:34,558
Satisfied.

420
00:29:35,058 --> 00:29:37,058
Now coming to the part.

421
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:41,625
It quenches the thirst, the spiritual thirst.

422
00:29:42,979 --> 00:29:46,410
You can quench the spiritual thirst of people, tremendous power,

423
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,910
because when you give realization

424
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,788
that the seeking is over.

425
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:58,058
All right? Then another one now come along. What other powers?

426
00:30:02,048 --> 00:30:03,206
Think of the water,

427
00:30:07,753 --> 00:30:11,713
nourishment, you nourish.

428
00:30:13,327 --> 00:30:17,048
You give spiritual nourishment to people through your power;

429
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,922
even if you are standing there you are nourishing others.

430
00:30:24,172 --> 00:30:26,172
Then dissolvement,

431
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:30,462
you dissolve their ego and you dissolve their super ego.

432
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,195
All these powers you own after realization.

433
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:41,605
Just think of it. What else?

434
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:45,930
Divinity.

435
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:48,059
That’s very vague

436
00:30:48,188 --> 00:30:50,188
because divinity

437
00:30:50,354 --> 00:30:54,436
is how to relate it to water. People won’t understand it, so let us put it

438
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,170
other way round. What is it?

439
00:30:57,633 --> 00:30:59,633
Cool down emotions.

440
00:31:00,615 --> 00:31:03,111
To coll down emotions.

441
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:05,165
You become a cool down person

442
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:08,038
very good,

443
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:17,041
very good. You become cool,

444
00:31:18,432 --> 00:31:23,808
cool personality. You have cooling effect, very good, water else.

445
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:27,100
You carry others. You can carry others.

446
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:30,269
You can, very gently

447
00:31:31,326 --> 00:31:32,952
and also drown some of them.

448
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,485
Drown into the love,

449
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,655
into the ocean of love.

450
00:31:43,155 --> 00:31:45,941
But you can also push them

451
00:31:46,441 --> 00:31:50,764
with two running jumps, all right. That also can be done.

452
00:31:53,715 --> 00:31:57,951
It has another very great quality that water permeates

453
00:31:58,674 --> 00:32:03,089
into the smallest particle. It goes the roots, I mean suck into the roots.

454
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:08,786
So Mahalakshmi power you just see the roots of the person. You just

455
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:10,381
know where the problem comes from,

456
00:32:10,881 --> 00:32:11,944
you jump at it

457
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:16,012
actually it is the awareness, it is the intelligence,

458
00:32:16,512 --> 00:32:21,246
suck the truth part of it which gets enlightened.

459
00:32:21,746 --> 00:32:26,414
And you understand that now where is the problem, you just go near the root

460
00:32:26,914 --> 00:32:31,712
and you suck and you can be easily sucked, you permeate.

461
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:35,586
You see, when you are sitting near a person

462
00:32:36,903 --> 00:32:39,095
then you tell Me, “Mother, this is catching at the back,

463
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:40,300
the person doesn’t know.”

464
00:32:41,691 --> 00:32:43,691
You have permeated. Your personality has

465
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:45,708
permeated into that person. He doesn’t know.

466
00:32:45,762 --> 00:32:48,921
You have permeated into that person and you are feeling the roots,

467
00:32:49,421 --> 00:32:51,421
where is the problem.

468
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:53,921
The water is flowing into that being.

469
00:32:54,495 --> 00:32:56,983
The divine water is flowing into that being

470
00:32:57,297 --> 00:33:01,873
and the obstruction is felt through that divine water

471
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,689
and you can say that this is catching that is catching.

472
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,080
So permeate, permeating

473
00:33:09,209 --> 00:33:11,925
and the another one is the glistening

474
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:19,509
of the water is so your glistening your skin becomes very radiant.

475
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,534
And the last of all is the reflection.

476
00:33:26,814 --> 00:33:28,814
A person, who sees you,

477
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:33,653
sees his own reflection. He gets frightened.

478
00:33:35,118 --> 00:33:37,118
With Me, it this happens sometimes.

479
00:33:37,618 --> 00:33:38,687
I don’t mean anything

480
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:42,346
bad to anyone but people are unnecessarily frightened of Me

481
00:33:43,551 --> 00:33:44,878
because they see their reflection.

482
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:49,506
So when they reach you they see their reflection can be very aggressive

483
00:33:49,857 --> 00:33:53,446
because they see their reflection. They can be very hard on you

484
00:33:53,946 --> 00:33:55,946
because they see their reflection

485
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:07,468
and if it is clear-cut water, then you see the depth of that person.

486
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:11,416
If you are clear-cut Sahaja yogi

487
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:19,457
you feel the depth clearly and they can see through - the spirit shines.

488
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,630
These are the qualities of water

489
00:34:26,123 --> 00:34:27,390
within us.

490
00:34:29,716 --> 00:34:33,948
The more of that I would say specially in My body

491
00:34:35,153 --> 00:34:37,153
the water I actually buffer

492
00:34:37,653 --> 00:34:39,653
to protect the charkas.

493
00:34:39,737 --> 00:34:41,737
If I don’t have water in the body

494
00:34:42,045 --> 00:34:45,655
I may have problems. So it acts as buffer

495
00:34:46,828 --> 00:34:48,828
also it soothes your

496
00:34:50,377 --> 00:34:54,317
epidermal cells; you can say it soothes your blindness.

497
00:34:54,727 --> 00:34:58,807
You see, if there is no moisture /?/ blindness/dryness in all that.

498
00:35:00,386 --> 00:35:02,386
It soothes everyone

499
00:35:05,553 --> 00:35:11,074
and there are other types of powers of water, which we know of

500
00:35:11,574 --> 00:35:13,574
when it comes out of your eyes

501
00:35:15,992 --> 00:35:17,992
it expresses your compassion,

502
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,230
your love, your emotions.

503
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,970
That is the only thing

504
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:30,076
out of all the elements which expresses emotions,

505
00:35:33,453 --> 00:35:36,066
water power /?/.

506
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:42,790
Water has other qualities also which physics people know hydrostatics

507
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,740
it has the pressure.

508
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,790
It has the pressure

509
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,110
and a person who exists

510
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,921
like a Sahaja yogi

511
00:35:52,421 --> 00:35:56,473
will definitely put a pressure on others. He will not, he will not

512
00:35:56,973 --> 00:35:59,857
aggress but there will be a pressure and pressure.

513
00:36:00,357 --> 00:36:04,352
And another person if he receives one then he

514
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:07,931
will gets the advantage of you, but if he doesn’t want to receive it

515
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:12,850
then he feel pressurize and feels little bit dominated.

516
00:36:14,249 --> 00:36:16,249
Your neibhours, your family people

517
00:36:16,749 --> 00:36:19,025
at the beginning they feel a pressure because

518
00:36:19,225 --> 00:36:22,758
the body achieves a kind of a weight

519
00:36:24,696 --> 00:36:27,940
and that’s how the Guru Tattwa is formed out of you.

520
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:32,088
And if there is salt

521
00:36:33,217 --> 00:36:36,420
that's Guru Principle then the weight is even more.

522
00:36:39,168 --> 00:36:43,413
So today for water should really

523
00:36:43,913 --> 00:36:48,179
know that the water is a very holy thing

524
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:51,503
and in our pujas also we use

525
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,030
specially this thing dignifies

526
00:36:54,380 --> 00:37:01,194
the Kundalini that means the Kundalini is the water jar

527
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:07,887
or the carrier of Aquarius. And this is the age of the Aquarius. So how

528
00:37:08,177 --> 00:37:13,397
important is this water and the water is the carrier

529
00:37:14,347 --> 00:37:20,921
of divine love, is the best carrier. And this is the time

530
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:25,749
of Aquarius means the Kundalini is made of divine water.

531
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:34,274
So the whole idea of celebrating

532
00:37:35,313 --> 00:37:41,692
today the Lakshmi’s day is to understand that in us

533
00:37:42,192 --> 00:37:46,660
She has become the Mahalakshmi. By that we have so many powers

534
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:49,183
of which we are not aware, I mean we do not

535
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:51,982
know also that we are realized souls. Some of us, we do not know

536
00:37:52,482 --> 00:37:55,562
and that we have those powers within us that we can permeate into others.

537
00:37:56,062 --> 00:37:58,472
We can project our personalities to others.

538
00:37:58,684 --> 00:38:00,684
We can find out what’s wrong with them.

539
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,724
We can find out about ourselves. We can go into ourselves, we can go into -

540
00:38:05,936 --> 00:38:12,072
our permeation is like water is moving, is flowing all the time. And this

541
00:38:12,976 --> 00:38:16,489
is a very important thing that we should be aware

542
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:18,054
of: our powers that we have achieved.

543
00:38:18,381 --> 00:38:22,055
Then we will start respecting ourselves then the Rajalakshmi comes in

544
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,136
and then the Gruhalakshmi comes in

545
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:27,447
and everything comes with in when we become aware

546
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:32,412
of what we have achieved of our self-esteem,

547
00:38:35,103 --> 00:38:37,103
of our dignity.

548
00:38:37,603 --> 00:38:41,477
So it gives us dignity, Mahalakshmi gives us dignity.

549
00:38:42,496 --> 00:38:46,083
And that’s how we start understanding the value of human dignity.

550
00:38:46,987 --> 00:38:50,730
We should have also the idea of human dignity

551
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,992
that we cannot insult human dignity,

552
00:38:58,356 --> 00:39:01,814
like people who are nagging others all the time. It’s against

553
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:05,392
or all the time asserting themselves about

554
00:39:05,373 --> 00:39:08,020
something making everybody’s life miserable.

555
00:39:08,232 --> 00:39:12,228
It’s against human dignity. You have to decorate another's life,

556
00:39:12,382 --> 00:39:17,489
you have to make it beautiful, you have to make it enjoyable

557
00:39:17,701 --> 00:39:21,546
and happy, make everyone happy, not to nag all the time.

558
00:39:22,046 --> 00:39:24,221
And if you nag that’s not a Gruhalakshmi;

559
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:27,236
that is not a Gruhalakshmi. You should not nag, “Do this, do that,

560
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:30,341
stand up, what are you doing, stand this side, do, go that side.”

561
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:33,004
It’s all a nonsense. You /?/ the person to do it;

562
00:39:33,389 --> 00:39:35,227
the human dignity is the most important thing.

563
00:39:35,727 --> 00:39:37,727
Must respect the human dignity.

564
00:39:38,227 --> 00:39:41,125
And that’s possible because now you have got the Mahalakshmi power.

565
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:44,748
Those who do not have the dignity also will get it from you

566
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,544
because you are dignified now.

567
00:39:47,678 --> 00:39:50,268
If you have sense of dignity, you will never insult other’s dignity.

568
00:39:50,768 --> 00:39:52,768
For small, small things we insult others

569
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:56,222
“Why did you put the soap here, why did you do this, why did you do that?”

570
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,392
And the another side coud be that others

571
00:39:59,546 --> 00:40:02,907
have no dignity so they go on doing things just like animals.

572
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:05,407
The both things are wrong.

573
00:40:06,253 --> 00:40:11,494
But one must respect and respect brings the best results I have seen.

574
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:15,442
That’s the best result, once you respect and love

575
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,730
and then the trust is grown

576
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:21,411
and one should keep the trust.

577
00:40:21,565 --> 00:40:24,553
And that’s how the human dignity /?/

578
00:40:25,053 --> 00:40:27,053
We must respect every Sahaja yogi

579
00:40:27,899 --> 00:40:31,614
because we are all saints, to respect each other,

580
00:40:32,114 --> 00:40:34,114
absolutely respect because you are all saints.

581
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:36,268
I don’t know you realize what I am saying.

582
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:41,955
Each one of you is capable of giving realization to the whole world,

583
00:40:42,455 --> 00:40:43,541
each one of you

584
00:40:46,521 --> 00:40:50,617
and if we realize then we must respect ourselves and respect others.

585
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:53,829
You should do not talk frivolously about others, make fun.

586
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:57,309
And specially your Mother,

587
00:40:57,636 --> 00:40:59,636
you can’t take liberties with Her.

588
00:41:00,886 --> 00:41:02,886
That is something one has to know

589
00:41:03,386 --> 00:41:07,544
in the west is important. This is very important

590
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:10,217
that one has to know about it.

591
00:41:11,467 --> 00:41:13,467
The other day I was correcting somebody.

592
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:15,967
So Hugh said that “You are a very lucky person

593
00:41:16,063 --> 00:41:17,926
that Mother is correcting you; you are very lucky

594
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,080
that She is correcting you, telling you something,

595
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:24,807
because you are naive you see, that is why you start taking liberties.”

596
00:41:25,538 --> 00:41:29,158
First of all you must respect the divinity of your Mother.

597
00:41:29,427 --> 00:41:33,839
That’s very important. And that gives you the greatest dignity.

598
00:41:35,031 --> 00:41:40,189
I am telling you this because unless and until you do that, your growth

599
00:41:40,689 --> 00:41:42,689
cannot come up well.

600
00:41:42,728 --> 00:41:44,728
So that is a very important point

601
00:41:45,228 --> 00:41:49,556
and like in India supposing somebody is going to a temple

602
00:41:49,652 --> 00:41:52,423
or they come to - for example, today

603
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,235
She has come or somebody has come they will better,

604
00:41:55,331 --> 00:41:56,689
they will wear a nice dress.

605
00:41:57,477 --> 00:42:00,324
You see, you are going to a temple and all the ornaments they will wear,

606
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:01,895
everything they will wear.

607
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:04,402
That is the day they have to present all their dignity.

608
00:42:04,902 --> 00:42:07,076
So one should not come with

609
00:42:07,288 --> 00:42:10,312
dishevel hair or things like that.

610
00:42:12,254 --> 00:42:15,968
That is not a good thing because all these things are important,

611
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,180
how you respect.

612
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:23,165
How you have to be dressed

613
00:42:23,434 --> 00:42:25,662
how you have to presentable, because these things

614
00:42:25,758 --> 00:42:28,001
Some people say that oh /?/

615
00:42:28,501 --> 00:42:30,501
we don’t need to be tidy because we are the spirit

616
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:33,001
Spirit is the most tidy thing.

617
00:42:33,213 --> 00:42:35,574
It tidies everything you see.

618
00:42:35,671 --> 00:42:38,729
It tidies everything. It goes into proper synthesis, proper

619
00:42:38,998 --> 00:42:40,644
concord, a complete,

620
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,558
beautiful music is created out of that.

621
00:42:44,058 --> 00:42:47,558
How can a chaotic person be called spiritual man? Cannot,

622
00:42:47,597 --> 00:42:50,492
anybody who is chaotic, their house is chaotic, their things are chaotic,

623
00:42:50,588 --> 00:42:52,891
you must know there is something bhootish in them,

624
00:42:52,915 --> 00:42:54,915
absolutely.

625
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,280
But you should not be other way round, that

626
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:01,019
so meticulous that you eat others’ heads.

627
00:43:01,532 --> 00:43:04,700
That’s another side. So both things should not be done.

628
00:43:05,025 --> 00:43:08,205
And I go on insisting on this point because it is very important

629
00:43:08,705 --> 00:43:10,222
for ego-oriented people

630
00:43:10,722 --> 00:43:12,722
because they can become anything.

631
00:43:13,395 --> 00:43:16,446
The other day I was going on King’s Road and I was surprised

632
00:43:17,004 --> 00:43:19,004
what sort of dresses people are wearing

633
00:43:19,043 --> 00:43:21,163
and they think that “whatever we wear, we are.”

634
00:43:21,259 --> 00:43:22,955
That means you must be monkeys,

635
00:43:23,455 --> 00:43:25,455
you wear such dresses and go about it.

636
00:43:25,955 --> 00:43:28,423
If you believe in that then you should be decent people,

637
00:43:28,635 --> 00:43:29,985
there should be decorum about it.

638
00:43:35,617 --> 00:43:42,297
So today we have learnt about Lakshmi's growth into Mahalakshmi

639
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:46,393
but it is not that when you grow into something the rest of it is finished,

640
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:50,279
is not so, that some people think that they become

641
00:43:50,316 --> 00:43:54,023
spiritual personality now Lakshmi Tattwa is not there, is not true.

642
00:43:54,869 --> 00:43:56,869
You have to be decent person,

643
00:43:57,369 --> 00:44:02,026
properly dressed according to your status in life, the way you live.

644
00:44:02,526 --> 00:44:06,877
And there should be no, what you call, hypocrisy about it,

645
00:44:07,377 --> 00:44:10,526
no hypocrisy. By doing any

646
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,680
nonsensical thing,

647
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:15,547
like some people think becoming a primitive or anything,

648
00:44:15,759 --> 00:44:17,935
you will impress others. You will never impress,

649
00:44:18,147 --> 00:44:20,147
you see. It’s beggar’s thing,

650
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:24,176
see, doing beggary you will get some beggars bhoot into you.

651
00:44:25,253 --> 00:44:28,071
So we are not to be beggars, neither we have to be

652
00:44:28,571 --> 00:44:32,115
a sort of dandies, but we are Sahaja yogis, dignified people.

653
00:44:32,615 --> 00:44:36,353
We have our own self-esteem and we live with our own dignity,

654
00:44:36,622 --> 00:44:40,865
and that’s how we should be pure

655
00:44:41,884 --> 00:44:43,884
transparent, honest,

656
00:44:44,961 --> 00:44:46,576
within ourselves we should be honest,

657
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:49,769
absolutely honest. Water is so honest with itself.

658
00:44:50,557 --> 00:44:52,557
We put anything to the water it will show.

659
00:44:53,807 --> 00:44:55,807
Put any color into it, it will show.

660
00:44:56,307 --> 00:44:58,307
Put any mud it will show.

661
00:44:58,403 --> 00:45:01,113
You have to be so honest, honest to yourself.

662
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:05,213
And the whole thing should work out to be a personality

663
00:45:05,713 --> 00:45:10,467
and be congenial, beautiful, permeating, no doubt

664
00:45:10,794 --> 00:45:12,674
but very beautifully enlightened

665
00:45:13,174 --> 00:45:15,174
because Mahalakshmi Tattwa itself

666
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,213
is enlightenment in our awareness.

667
00:45:17,713 --> 00:45:20,178
Such a person cannot be an idiot. If there is an idiot

668
00:45:20,274 --> 00:45:22,274
he is not a Sahaja yogi, definitely he is not.

669
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:26,217
Idiotic person cannot be a Sahaja yogi - nitwits,

670
00:45:28,389 --> 00:45:31,860
absent-minded, all that has to go away.

671
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,360
If you all have to be sahaja yogis, you cannot be,

672
00:45:34,687 --> 00:45:37,800
“Oh, I know, I know, I know.” All that nonsense is not be there,

673
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,183
should not be there.

674
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:48,306
The lakshanas or what do you call, the seed tops, or you can say,

675
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,140
what do you call lakshanas,

676
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,271
is the way you can make out a Sahaja yogi, should be

677
00:45:57,771 --> 00:46:02,483
a Lakshmi putra is the sign of Lakshmi like a king /?/

678
00:46:03,502 --> 00:46:06,302
That doesn’t mean that he has everything to him self, no.

679
00:46:07,033 --> 00:46:09,033
That doesn’t mean that, king gives.

680
00:46:09,245 --> 00:46:11,439
He gives with generosity, known by his generosity.

681
00:46:11,708 --> 00:46:14,551
He is not known by how much he grabs, does he?

682
00:46:15,051 --> 00:46:18,285
He is a king, as it is, is giving.

683
00:46:21,209 --> 00:46:23,439
Then he should be cool personality.

684
00:46:25,323 --> 00:46:28,211
He should not be frozen. He should be cool personality,

685
00:46:29,345 --> 00:46:32,197
not hot- tempered. Those who are hot-tempered,

686
00:46:32,697 --> 00:46:35,430
I have seen people, you see, here

687
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:38,276
they first take to violence. I mean violence is

688
00:46:38,315 --> 00:46:40,491
something out of question for Sahaja yogis,

689
00:46:41,737 --> 00:46:45,706
no question. If somebody beat you also you are not to beat him back.

690
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:48,437
We have ways to beat them

691
00:46:49,802 --> 00:46:51,802
but you are not to beat them back.

692
00:46:52,821 --> 00:46:54,821
You are not to resist them,

693
00:46:55,033 --> 00:46:58,985
but if you are a sahaja yogi you have no business to be violent to anyone,

694
00:46:59,485 --> 00:47:01,968
even with your tongue. Some people are

695
00:47:02,064 --> 00:47:04,064
more with the tongue provocating type.

696
00:47:04,564 --> 00:47:07,476
You must know that you must correct all these points.

697
00:47:07,976 --> 00:47:11,958
It is important because tomorrow if you are going to show to the world

698
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:14,458
what Sahaja Yoga is not /?/

699
00:47:19,745 --> 00:47:21,745
So we have to dedicate ourselves

700
00:47:21,957 --> 00:47:23,490
to our purification,

701
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:26,522
to our glorification because water glorifies,

702
00:47:27,022 --> 00:47:29,022
gives you glory.

703
00:47:29,118 --> 00:47:32,441
You are all looking so nice and glistening on the face and I can see

704
00:47:32,479 --> 00:47:34,361
the Ganti Rupena Samasthita.

705
00:47:34,515 --> 00:47:38,856
He said that “Ya Devi Sarva Butheshu Ganti Rupena,” the glistening,

706
00:47:38,895 --> 00:47:43,609
the light and that’s there I can see you in you all.

707
00:47:43,821 --> 00:47:49,188
It has already come but it should be inside also.

708
00:47:50,553 --> 00:47:53,596
And that person who is a realized soul

709
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,151
one doesn’t have to vow for it.

710
00:47:56,939 --> 00:47:58,939
people just know that he is realized soul.

711
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:03,940
You don’t have to tell anyone people just know the way he is.

712
00:48:06,574 --> 00:48:08,574
So many points we have covered today.

713
00:48:08,901 --> 00:48:10,901
I hope you will

714
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:12,414
again listen to them because,

715
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,904
see, Mataji’s lecture goes from one ear and comes out from the other.

716
00:48:16,807 --> 00:48:20,657
Thank God we have a way of localizing it.

717
00:48:20,926 --> 00:48:22,926
I hope you people will take these tapes

718
00:48:23,022 --> 00:48:26,288
and listen to them everyday one by one

719
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,576
and also act, not planning

720
00:48:29,788 --> 00:48:33,782
in the paper or in the ear. But it should go in the heart.

721
00:48:36,185 --> 00:48:38,185
That’s how we are all going to mature

722
00:48:38,397 --> 00:48:41,713
beautiful children. I’m just counting

723
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:48,066
now again C.P. will be elected for four years and then I have to

724
00:48:48,566 --> 00:48:53,911
there is hardly three years it will pass away and

725
00:48:54,988 --> 00:48:57,289
I won’t be able to go so much in U.K.

726
00:48:57,789 --> 00:49:00,426
The responsibility, such a lot on you people.

727
00:49:02,887 --> 00:49:05,554
I hope we celebrate some more Diwalis together.

728
00:49:06,382 --> 00:49:08,382
May God bless you!
