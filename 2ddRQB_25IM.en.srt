1
00:00:00,632 --> 00:00:06,828
On seeing the depth of your love, My heart feels overwhelmed.

2
00:00:06,853 --> 00:00:17,561
In this Kaliyuga, it is very difficult to recognize Mother

3
00:00:17,586 --> 00:00:20,430
because we don't recognize our Mother

4
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:25,193
so, it becomes all the more difficult to recognize Me.

5
00:00:25,218 --> 00:00:34,806
But the depth of this land of BENGAL is working in you.

6
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,190
So, I observe that

7
00:00:38,214 --> 00:00:43,837
any Sahajyogi, who comes from this place, goes deep, gets deeper.

8
00:00:43,862 --> 00:00:45,758
He goes very deep.

9
00:00:45,782 --> 00:00:53,341
And it is so surprising, that the places where I did a lot of work

10
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:58,429
there the people are many, but they are not so deep.

11
00:00:58,453 --> 00:01:03,742
And the collectivity among them is not as beautiful as it is here.

12
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:09,882
The speciality, of Bang bhumi [Bengal], I say, is

13
00:01:09,907 --> 00:01:13,760
that the collectivity and love for each other

14
00:01:13,785 --> 00:01:19,171
if we look at it, is absolutely selfless and unselfish.

15
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:24,596
On seeing all this, you dont know how happy I am!

16
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:31,171
And I wish that your work may progress much more

17
00:01:31,196 --> 00:01:34,160
 and spread among the masses.

18
00:01:34,184 --> 00:01:40,536
Because you know that, this land is very much dear to Mother.

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,975
You had told that today, Saraswati Puja will be performed.

20
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:46,325
It is absolutely necessary

21
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:51,124
that in Bang Desh [Bengal], Saraswati should be worshiped.

22
00:01:51,148 --> 00:01:53,719
Because of Devi’s blessings only

23
00:01:53,744 --> 00:02:00,269
and because of Her sacrifice, this land is SASHYA - SHYAMALAM

24
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:02,540
such fertile and green.

25
00:02:02,565 --> 00:02:12,705
But the reason why poverty and the suffering is here

26
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:15,660
that whatever the worship of Saraswati has been done

27
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:21,878
was very limited (NOT CLEAR).

28
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:26,567
People did not pray Mahasarawati, only Saraswati has been worshipped

29
00:02:26,592 --> 00:02:30,231
in which we can encourage artistic talents

30
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:34,982
or, we can become scholars.

31
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:37,327
From this place the scholars are one better than the other

32
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:38,666
Many scientists have evolved  from here.

33
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:49,611
People have progressed a lot in the field of education

34
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:51,403
compared to people from other places.

35
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:55,785
People from here are very intelligent and are very matured.

36
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,101
Inspite of all this, why there is still poverty here?

37
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:05,031
We should come up with a formula

38
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:07,828
as to why there is so much of poverty is here?

39
00:03:07,852 --> 00:03:14,393
Why do we have in a way, jealosy within us?

40
00:03:14,418 --> 00:03:18,442
That if someone gets some money, we are are jealous of him.

41
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:23,020
By being jealous of him or hatred, poverty will not go away.

42
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:25,746
For that we need to understand

43
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:32,144
what is it we are lacking, that we need to overcome.

44
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:33,311
Saraswati you know that

45
00:03:33,335 --> 00:03:39,273
as per Sahaja Yoga, the work of Maha Saraswati is on the right side.

46
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:44,094
When She works on the Swadishthan chakra

47
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:49,043
 and when the Swadishthan chakra moves towards the left,

48
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:53,064
then all the artistic talents are developed.

49
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:55,981
The music here is fantastic.

50
00:03:56,005 --> 00:04:03,535
And there is no field of art that is not there in Bengal.

51
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,586
In everything, even in movies, in dramas

52
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:14,820
every art field like, dance, music, sculpture

53
00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:18,193
in everything, Bang Desh [Bengal] is very famous.

54
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:20,765
Nowhere else, you will find artists better than them.

55
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,169
You tell them any small thing, they will immediately do it.

56
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:29,560
The gold jewelly designers here, are also very famous.

57
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:34,893
It is because they have reached that state of art, of fine art.

58
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:41,017
The fne form of art, which is famous and accepted all over the world.

59
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:46,632
 It is in a way created such

60
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:52,999
 that you can see lot of like Divine Light in it.

61
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:58,153
 You cannot see the Divine Light in it, but it is full of vibrations.

62
00:04:58,178 --> 00:05:01,284
Anything that is created very beautifully

63
00:05:01,309 --> 00:05:10,111
and recognised all over the world, is aesthetically rich.

64
00:05:10,136 --> 00:05:13,729
If you put your hands towards it

65
00:05:13,753 --> 00:05:17,346
you will feel vibrations flowing from it.

66
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,748
There will be vibrations flowing from it.

67
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:27,432
If a Realized person makes a sculpture or any art form

68
00:05:27,456 --> 00:05:32,202
 from that you can  feel the vibrations flowing.

69
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:38,786
The reason is that people who live here are very devotional.

70
00:05:38,811 --> 00:05:44,540
The people are deep from within and take any art form of this place.

71
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:49,354
There is nowhere in the world that it is not liked

72
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,222
 or liked by people, appreaciated .

73
00:05:53,247 --> 00:05:55,410
There is no such art form, from Bengal

74
00:05:55,434 --> 00:06:02,205
whether it is, painting, even cinema, dance, that is not appreaciated.

75
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,415
They say that people of Bengal are perfectionist

76
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,581
who have achieved totality.

77
00:06:06,605 --> 00:06:10,422
When we have progressed on one side (of Swadishthan)

78
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:15,387
 we have not used the other side of Swadishthan.

79
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:19,672
Even when we use the other side of Swadishtan

80
00:06:19,697 --> 00:06:29,546
that too we think, we use it only for reading, writing and such things.

81
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,333
We have not paid attention to a state higher than this.

82
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:38,485
 That is why now a days, there is imbalance.

83
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,693
If you look at it, it is a very accomplished place.

84
00:06:40,717 --> 00:06:42,900
So much of art, literature, everything is there

85
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:46,180
and whatever the problems here are

86
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:50,689
and people say that the union of Saraswati and Lakshmi takes place.

87
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:55,840
It is right that there may be no union between Saraswati and Lakshmi

88
00:06:55,865 --> 00:06:59,335
 but the union can be achieved in Mahasaraswati.

89
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,667
Being in unision with Mahasaraswati means that

90
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:08,124
 whatever you are doing there

91
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:11,052
you go to the deeper aspect and start thinking.

92
00:07:11,076 --> 00:07:17,197
 After all, what is the reason that there is no union with Lakshmi?

93
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,901
Why there is no union with Mahalaxmi?

94
00:07:20,926 --> 00:07:28,193
In Sahaja Yoga, both meet at the Agnya chakra and is (NOT CLEAR)

95
00:07:28,218 --> 00:07:36,925
Because, if you look at the action part, it is tremendous

96
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:43,275
 but you do not get the result that you desire.

97
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:49,523
If you come into Agyna chakra, you start thinking.

98
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:54,902
"Why, till now, we have not got that state?

99
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:58,135
which so many artists have got

100
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,432
 that totality which other enlightened people have been granted?

101
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:07,047
and why are we living in poverty?”

102
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:09,503
What we need to understand is that

103
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:17,179
till we do not reach that state where we see both aspects

104
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:20,378
till then, we cannot progress.

105
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:26,742
To unite art with Lakshmi we need balanced vision.

106
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:31,701
So,One of our greatest weaknesses within us is

107
00:08:31,726 --> 00:08:37,239
 it is said about Bengalis, is stubbornness. They are very stubborn.

108
00:08:37,264 --> 00:08:40,012
 Suppose they take to some art form

109
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:44,179
like if they have made an elephant, they will go on making elephants.

110
00:08:44,203 --> 00:08:47,121
If they make a horse, they go on making horses.

111
00:08:47,146 --> 00:08:49,004
If they like a particular type of music

112
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,312
they will go on singing in the same way.

113
00:08:51,337 --> 00:08:55,195
If you tell them to change it

114
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:57,428
they will immediately get angry.

115
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,341
They feel that their art is not respected at all.

116
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:06,544
 At Agnya Chakra, if you contemplate, the stubbornness catches Agnya.

117
00:09:06,568 --> 00:09:15,864
“We are Bengalis. We have the greatest artists, intellectuals”.

118
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,195
By taking the names of great artists

119
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,109
they think that they are also great.

120
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:23,387
 It is not true, you need to understand.

121
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:27,805
If you look at them, you will know that they are not stubborn at all

122
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:32,051
But you are stubborn when you say that,'We are great people

123
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:34,665
because we have such great people from Bang Desh [Bengal]’.

124
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,188
Thinking like that you cannot reach that level

125
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:44,501
but yes, you can live in the shadow of their glory.

126
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:48,726
But if you want to rise above that, we should give up stubbornnes.

127
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:51,297
'we are like this only’, 'we will continue to be like this’

128
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:53,490
'we will not do anything more than this’

129
00:09:53,514 --> 00:09:57,189
'and we will not compromise with our style’.

130
00:09:57,213 --> 00:09:59,196
That is not possible.

131
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,467
By compromising, I am not telling that you destroy the art.

132
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:05,673
Don’t have to destroy the art in any manner.

133
00:10:05,697 --> 00:10:11,255
But you must think of art, in a balanced manner.

134
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,600
 I am telling you something practical.

135
00:10:14,624 --> 00:10:18,354
One is the laziness within us

136
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:20,862
that laziness too leads to stubbornness.

137
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:25,443
When a person starts becoming lazy, he also becomes very stubborn.

138
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:30,407
He does not think that I am stubborn because of laziness.

139
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:34,205
Because, for learning something new, I have to make an effort.

140
00:10:34,229 --> 00:10:38,980
But something that I already know, I can do effortlessly.

141
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:43,622
 "But Mataji was saying, "Just make some changes, it will be alright."

142
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:45,606
 "That I cannot do”.

143
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:50,165
In this, one thing is stubborness and behind that is laziness.

144
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:55,874
We are slow at learning anything new, because of  being slow learners.

145
00:10:55,898 --> 00:10:58,331
And because of this slow speed

146
00:10:58,355 --> 00:11:01,027
we cannot learn new things

147
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:05,717
which can definitely give us the blessings of Lakshmi.

148
00:11:05,742 --> 00:11:09,680
For example, I went to an organization, where I said

149
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:13,275
"Tell the Bengalis that the purses you make

150
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,390
 don’t make it so elaborate.

151
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:19,439
Make it in a single line, then people will like it very much”.

152
00:11:19,463 --> 00:11:23,335
"This is not possible”, "we cannot do this”.

153
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:25,123
'we will continue to make the same way’

154
00:11:25,147 --> 00:11:27,230
'we cannot make it the way you are saying’.

155
00:11:27,255 --> 00:11:29,776
'we cannot make it the way you are saying’.

156
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:32,435
You cannot give any suggestion.

157
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,833
They will continue to make in the same elaborate manner.

158
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:37,522
You may keep in stock twenty five articles ready

159
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:38,822
and it will not be sold.

160
00:11:38,846 --> 00:11:41,006
They will say, "We have the stock".

161
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:43,000
It is alright if it is not sold, we have the stock”.

162
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:45,867
They continue to be proud of it.

163
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:49,456
There must be an understanding.

164
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:56,109
 Now in Sahaja Yoga, your brains open up, it opens up completely.

165
00:11:56,134 --> 00:11:59,831
His Agnya opens out. First of all the stubborness reduces.

166
00:11:59,856 --> 00:12:02,222
I will insist that this is the only way to do it

167
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:04,181
and there is no other right way.

168
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:06,574
Whatever i do is only right.

169
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:09,164
You can benefit, once you give up the stubborness.

170
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:15,246
Like I have seen in many people, they have different type of qualities.

171
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,201
But in that stubbornness, it is all lost in stubborness.

172
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:23,157
It can have a very great effect on a person's entire life.

173
00:12:23,181 --> 00:12:26,825
We are like this only and will remain so.

174
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:36,272
No, we should change, and this change can be achieved very easily in Sahaja.

175
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:40,917
When you get it in Sahaj way then you will be surprised that

176
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:44,161
 it is in Sahaj way only, that the union with Laxmi can be achieved.

177
00:12:44,185 --> 00:12:47,217
I have seen this expecially in the artists that

178
00:12:47,242 --> 00:12:51,621
they are so stubborn that if you tell them

179
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,466
"Please make this small change”.

180
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,002
They’ll say, "No, we will not change it."

181
00:12:55,026 --> 00:12:57,802
Only this suits us and we will stick to it”.

182
00:12:57,827 --> 00:13:00,374
Even if the people who are listening get up and go away

183
00:13:00,398 --> 00:13:01,334
it doesn't matter.

184
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:02,998
'we will still continue to sing in the same way'.

185
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:05,994
'we will say the same way' or 'continue to make the same way’.

186
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:09,815
To put the Agnya chakra right

187
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,142
we must first put right, this strange ego which says that

188
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,147
whatever we have been doing

189
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:16,476
and whatever we have done, is the only right way

190
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,803
and whatever we do is right.

191
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:25,891
This methodology we have made, we have to change this method.

192
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:27,971
Now there are so many things in this.

193
00:13:27,995 --> 00:13:32,164
For example, we belong to some dharma.

194
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:40,191
For example, we are Brahmo Samaji, or Hindus, or Muslims, Christians etc.

195
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:42,213
You are nothing but a human being.

196
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:43,947
You were born as a human being.

197
00:13:43,972 --> 00:13:49,021
You have branded yourself that i am this, i am that.

198
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:52,157
You are neither Bengali nor Marathi.

199
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:55,839
You are just human beings.

200
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:59,379
By branding yourself you create more problems.

201
00:13:59,404 --> 00:14:04,397
like, i am Bengali, i am Marathi, i am this, i am that

202
00:14:04,422 --> 00:14:06,681
 I am Christian, i am Muslim, i am Jain.

203
00:14:06,705 --> 00:14:08,281
All these are brands

204
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,875
and these brands become so important

205
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,634
that you cannot see anything beyond that.

206
00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:18,555
That became the most important thing and nothing beyond that.

207
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:20,765
 This is another reason of the catch of Agnya.

208
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,388
It is very difficult to get rid of this catch.

209
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:27,876
Till you get rid of this catch, your blindness will not go.

210
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,456
 Because you will look at everything in a very narrow manner.

211
00:14:33,544 --> 00:14:37,907
It is not only here.  In the West also it is so.

212
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:39,445
In the West it is even more

213
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,931
because, once something goes into their brains

214
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:46,275
that 'it is good’, then they will follow it blindly.

215
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,761
There are such people that they are just critics.

216
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:53,558
They will say, 'This art form is good’, then it gets sold.

217
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,891
Another critic says, 'This is not good’, it won’t get sold.

218
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:59,485
One critic is accepted.

219
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:00,996
Then the other critics will come and say

220
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,513
"This is useless, the other one is good. Accept that one."

221
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:09,231
Nothing comes to them from their own brains, from within.

222
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:11,263
Nothing is fixed.

223
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:14,668
Whatever others have filled in your head is correct.

224
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:17,557
This is the reason that they have filled our minds

225
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:21,099
 that we belong to this brand, that brand.

226
00:15:21,124 --> 00:15:21,730
Right from our childhood

227
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,057
we are put into a certain brand, one after the other.

228
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:25,809
In the end you belong to the same street.

229
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:30,584
Don’t even belong to the same parents, same family.

230
00:15:30,608 --> 00:15:33,656
Like this the humans go on branding themselves.

231
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,176
The fault in branding is that

232
00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:43,579
they think that I am a great personality and very unique individual.

233
00:15:43,604 --> 00:15:44,947
He wants to become an Individual.

234
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:49,292
Even though, i have been branded but i have to become an individual.

235
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:55,684
And this itself, which is the essence of truth

236
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,686
that we are all one.

237
00:15:58,711 --> 00:16:03,685
we are whole, (NOT CLEAR), totality

238
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:07,233
Everything is one, it goes in the opposition of this truth.

239
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:12,372
When you go in opposition – ‚'I am this type of person or that type of person’ .

240
00:16:12,396 --> 00:16:15,293
From this you are getting separated from each other.

241
00:16:15,317 --> 00:16:18,761
For example, you say, 'I am Hindu, you are a Muslim', you separate into two.

242
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:20,809
 Then again in Muslims, you are bifurcated in four categories.

243
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:23,194
Those four categories of Muslims will have another ten divisions.

244
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:25,959
Like this you go on separating yourself.

245
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:30,007
You start losing the connection with the whole

246
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:34,733
 which is the goal of your life to achieve.

247
00:16:34,757 --> 00:16:42,245
So the first thing is that, all the variety has been made by God.

248
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,844
But one leaf doesn’t resemble the other, but if they are all on one tree

249
00:16:46,868 --> 00:16:54,863
they are all part and parcel of the Virata.

250
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:59,414
And if we are all parts of one person

251
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:05,251
in that wholeness, the individuality is adjoined.

252
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:08,669
So, by separating ourselves, we destroy ourselves.

253
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:12,014
And in this way, the saraswati tatwa

254
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,873
which should manifest into Maha Saraswati is not there.

255
00:17:14,897 --> 00:17:26,388
At the Maha Saraswati level, man's ideas, his vision changes.

256
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:30,161
 It changes even in his daily life.

257
00:17:30,185 --> 00:17:37,328
The person starts to see that they all have become whole.

258
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:40,090
Now, we are all one.

259
00:17:40,114 --> 00:17:44,269
So then, whatever he creates, or does

260
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:47,499
he creates some such beautiful thing

261
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:50,478
or, he does such a beautiful work

262
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:54,023
that man recognizes by heart only.

263
00:17:54,047 --> 00:17:58,539
By heart only he says that it is beautiful.

264
00:17:58,563 --> 00:18:01,633
But even then, it should be understood

265
00:18:01,658 --> 00:18:08,190
that whatever are our jobs of Saraswati

266
00:18:08,215 --> 00:18:12,114
 that we think that we are worshipping Saraswati.

267
00:18:12,138 --> 00:18:14,684
Why don't they understand?

268
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:19,655
If they do Saraswati's work, if they are surrendered to God

269
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,271
 they become immortal.

270
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:26,843
Now you see, the peotry that has become immortal in the world

271
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:29,917
 it is God's work.

272
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:32,348
The poems and songs

273
00:18:32,373 --> 00:18:34,668
Now, you see new songs have come

274
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:38,009
new songs come and die down soon.

275
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:42,533
We listen to only those songs, repeat only those things

276
00:18:42,557 --> 00:18:45,995
which were written by Kabir, written by Gyaneshwar.

277
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,359
Even in foreign countries, I see that

278
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:52,166
what was written by William Blake is recognized.

279
00:18:52,191 --> 00:18:55,052
what was written by Shakesphere is recognized.

280
00:18:55,077 --> 00:18:59,403
They were all self realized people.

281
00:18:59,427 --> 00:19:01,661
Mozart was self realized.

282
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:
 Maha Saraswati Shakti they had because of self realization.

283
00:19:07,876 --> 00:19:13,054
whatever they wrote because of that power, was of a unique kind.

284
00:19:13,078 --> 00:19:19,027
There was nothing in them that you could say

285
00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:22,569
that they looked uncultured.

286
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:28,992
They were so cultured that they could unite the world.

287
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:30,802
So, Once you become a Sahaja yogi

288
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:34,059
then you should move on to the Maha Saraswati tattwa.

289
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:36,446
You should not follow Saraswati Tattwa

290
00:19:36,471 --> 00:19:41,384
because it limits you, your imagination is like that.

291
00:19:41,408 --> 00:19:43,966
If Saraswati Tattwa is the seed

292
00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:46,781
then its tree is Maha Saraswati.

293
00:19:46,805 --> 00:19:50,615
Till you do not make this seed into Maha Saraswati

294
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:55,325
till then you cannot get connected to Maha Laxmi.

295
00:19:55,349 --> 00:20:06,748
The blessing of Mahalaxmi is that you get your self realization.

296
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:12,550
The third thing that you have achieved is

297
00:20:12,574 --> 00:20:15,224
which we can say is MahaKali Tattwa.

298
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:16,838
All the three Powers (Mahalakshmi, Maha Saraswati and Maha Kali)

299
00:20:16,863 --> 00:20:18,828
meet at your Agnya.

300
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:23,201
And you should cross over this Agnya.

301
00:20:23,225 --> 00:20:28,066
In every subtle way there is an ego.

302
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,970
Introspect yourself . After all why do i believe in this?

303
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:33,994
My father, grand father followed it

304
00:20:34,018 --> 00:20:35,516
their father and grand father followed it

305
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,377
and I am limitting myself to such small beliefs

306
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:43,800
and how can I enlighten the whole world?"

307
00:20:43,824 --> 00:20:49,559
I would tell everyone, "You see, pay attention to yourself, on yourself".

308
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:54,790
Many people recognize Me, worship Me as Goddess, from their heart.

309
00:20:54,814 --> 00:20:56,869
But how it has benifitted Me?

310
00:20:56,893 --> 00:21:00,512
I am what I am. What is there anything special about it?

311
00:21:00,536 --> 00:21:02,508
I am what I am. I have not done anything.

312
00:21:02,532 --> 00:21:06,884
It is your greatness that you, I am so surprised that

313
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:10,273
from Saraswati Tattwa you have risen to Maha Saraswati Tattwa.

314
00:21:10,298 --> 00:21:14,695
So it is your quality and you have got it.

315
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:17,416
I neither got it nor did anything.

316
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,710
I am telling you a very simple thing

317
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:23,297
that when I see that you are surrendered to Me only

318
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:27,556
I feel that you may compromise with this only

319
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,016
that we recognize Mother.

320
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,569
You have to recognize yourself.

321
00:21:32,593 --> 00:21:36,577
You have to recognize yourself and you have to raise yourself.

322
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:38,746
This new era has come.

323
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:43,521
the same type which I say, recently I said in Mumbai, that is also of Bodhi Sarpa.

00:21:43,545 --> 00:21:50,264
In this, you have become Budh, you have got Bodha.

325
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:53,578
you have come to know what all this is.

326
00:21:53,602 --> 00:22:00,704
Now for this truth, light has been enlightened within you.

327
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:05,839
Now this light has to ignite thousands of lights, this Bodhi Satya.

328
00:22:05,863 --> 00:22:08,393
If you cannot do this work

329
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:12,480
then for you, for us, it is all useless effort.

330
00:22:12,504 --> 00:22:18,521
Because, what I am, to love Me what is the special you get?

331
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:21,038
You must be feeling good to love your Mother.

332
00:22:21,063 --> 00:22:22,936
I also like. It is o.k.

333
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,870
But I cannot change your direction.

334
00:22:25,895 --> 00:22:30,062
Love to Mother so much, I became instantaneously emmotional.

335
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:34,209
I wanted to speak something, but could not.

336
00:22:34,234 --> 00:22:41,059
But the state beyond this is that there is joy.

337
00:22:41,146 --> 00:22:46,300
There is a state beyond this, which we call absolute NIRANAND.

338
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:49,650
And your Mother will have Niranand only when She will see

339
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:51,847
that Her children have done more work than Her.

340
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:54,230
Let them get more powers than Me

341
00:22:54,254 --> 00:22:57,597
Mother wants that Her chidren should be more powerful than Her.

342
00:22:57,621 --> 00:23:01,935
But they have got stuck up in small small issues.

343
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,271
That they should give up.

344
00:23:03,296 --> 00:23:07,814
And this is not here only, it is even more so among Maharashtrians.

345
00:23:07,838 --> 00:23:14,105
 I have seen in other people also that we are stuck in small pettinesses.

346
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:16,334
I call them 'Kusanskari'.

347
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:20,438
A saint having good Sanskaras would immediately open his heart

348
00:23:20,463 --> 00:23:24,288
and like flowers start to emit fragrance.

349
00:23:24,312 --> 00:23:29,002
Another thing of Maha Saraswati is that it can be executed into action.

350
00:23:29,026 --> 00:23:35,677
In Maha Saraswati Karya you start working it out.

351
00:23:35,701 --> 00:23:45,185
In the Mahakali Tatwa, you absorb, you take in and imbibe.

352
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:51,613
But in Maha Saraswati you start working it out.

353
00:23:51,637 --> 00:23:57,741
In Mahakali, you can desire, you can even create.

354
00:23:57,765 --> 00:24:02,711
We desire that it should be this, i want this, i want that.

355
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:05,295
i like this, i like that.

356
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:10,810
But to implement it, is the work of Maha Saraswati.

357
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:15,026
You will say, Mother i want that Sahajyoja should spread all around.

358
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:21,611
Very good! Your desire is very good! But what have you done for that?

359
00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:24,780
But what have you done for the sake of that?

360
00:24:24,804 --> 00:24:27,147
You are thinking about yourself only

361
00:24:27,172 --> 00:24:29,359
that it should be like this, it should be like that.

362
00:24:29,383 --> 00:24:31,120
And the same questions about yourself.

363
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:32,734
My father is like this,my father is like that

364
00:24:32,758 --> 00:24:34,908
my brother is like that, his ailment is not over.

365
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:39,051
His this thing is not cured, his that thing is not cured.

366
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:44,433
What such work you have done

367
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:50,646
on account of which Maha Saraswati Tatwa will fully evolve within you.

368
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,119
This you should think.

369
00:24:52,144 --> 00:24:54,242
To how many people we have given realization?

370
00:24:54,267 --> 00:24:56,941
To how many people we have told about Sahajyoga?

371
00:24:56,965 --> 00:24:59,713
I was very happy when they told Me

372
00:24:59,738 --> 00:25:03,039
that here many people of Yuva Shakti.

373
00:25:03,063 --> 00:25:06,188
They fixed many posters, they worked for nights together.

374
00:25:06,236 --> 00:25:07,617
I was very happy to listen to it.

375
00:25:07,642 --> 00:25:10,613
And just now a senior Jounalist came to Me and said

376
00:25:10,638 --> 00:25:14,089
"It laid a great impression on Me

377
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:20,517
I saw many young boys travelling with me in the train at 1.30 a.m

378
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:24,256
Some would get down and then some would get down, at the next station".

379
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:25,365
They were very cool.

380
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:27,344
I asked them, "What are you doing?"

381
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:28,991
They said ,"We are fixing Mother's posters."

382
00:25:29,016 --> 00:25:31,889
He said," I have not seen such young boys till date.''

383
00:25:31,913 --> 00:25:36,182
Such nice boys, young, educated, working so coolly.

384
00:25:36,206 --> 00:25:37,829
And there were some girls also with them.

385
00:25:37,854 --> 00:25:40,624
In a great friendly manner, all of them were sitting.

386
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:45,462
Then I asked them about Sahajyoga and I was very much impressed.

387
00:25:45,486 --> 00:25:46,782
So it should be implemented.

388
00:25:46,806 --> 00:25:52,936
It means that whatever are our desires, we should work for that.

389
00:25:52,960 --> 00:26:01,000
Whatever we think, we should add it to our agenda.

390
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:02,889
 We have to show it by doing.

391
00:26:02,913 --> 00:26:06,661
Otherwise, it will be just talk in the air.

392
00:26:06,685 --> 00:26:07,317
It will be just in the air," I wanted to do this

393
00:26:07,341 --> 00:26:12,669
i wanted to do that, wanted to do something, i wanted to do this".

394
00:26:12,693 --> 00:26:17,514
Your desires will be over, when you will work.

395
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:18,704
Then you will come to know that

396
00:26:18,729 --> 00:26:21,767
you should want only that which is possible.

397
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:25,712
And that which is not possible to desire, that is destruction.

398
00:26:25,736 --> 00:26:26,636
And the same thing is

399
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,348
that there is as you see now a days, the problem of joblessness.

400
00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:35,155
Now, here are many rich as well as poor people.

401
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:37,933
When I listen to the problems of rich people

402
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:41,644
I feel that they have got the same problems as that of the poor.

403
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:48,989
That they say, see Mother, here we have labour problem

404
00:26:49,013 --> 00:26:51,757
and that is why our factories are shut down.

405
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:55,069
Now, rich must think

406
00:26:55,093 --> 00:26:58,683
that labour is your part and parcel.

407
00:26:58,707 --> 00:27:01,418
You cannot do without labour.

408
00:27:01,442 --> 00:27:04,525
You don't want to use your hands, you are sitting on the chair only.

409
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,889
That is called motor scanning.

410
00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:11,719
You did it for labour. It is not with money only.

411
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:14,707
They also raised the flag and then gave the money.

412
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:17,185
Then they will raise flag again and ask for money.

413
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,773
There is no sense behind it.

414
00:27:18,797 --> 00:27:22,885
You worked to solve their problem.

415
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,412
First find out

416
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:27,998
For example, in Bombay it was, one gentleman came and said.

417
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:30,051
I told him that if you have to get work from Marathis

418
00:27:30,076 --> 00:27:32,445
first make Ganpatti Temple.

419
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:36,828
On this Diwali, you go to their residences and give them something.

420
00:27:36,852 --> 00:27:38,753
We had given (some gift) on Diwali.

421
00:27:38,778 --> 00:27:41,231
First understand their culture.

422
00:27:41,255 --> 00:27:44,371
And now here, may be great industrialists

423
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:48,258
they don't know what is their culture?

424
00:27:48,282 --> 00:27:51,105
In their culture, what do the people believe in

425
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,048
and what we have to understand in their culture.

426
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:58,325
If they are rich people or running great industries

427
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:00,919
if they understand Bengalis' state of mind.

428
00:28:00,944 --> 00:28:03,524
I will recognize them in a minute.

429
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:08,685
They are very good at heart.

430
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,949
That you just have a cup of tea with them

431
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:13,500
and they will be your life long friends.

432
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:17,595
If you show adamancy, you are great enemies.

433
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:19,651
This is the speciality of Bengalis.

434
00:28:19,675 --> 00:28:21,706
Why do you exhibit your adamantness?

435
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:26,566
Be with them, talk to them, ask them questions and know them.

436
00:28:26,591 --> 00:28:28,987
I call this 'enlightened entrepreneurs'.

437
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:32,723
Now you are enlightened, you have come to Sahajyoga.

438
00:28:32,748 --> 00:28:35,263
Now you should go to their houses

439
00:28:35,287 --> 00:28:37,801
and see what are their problems, what do they need?

440
00:28:37,826 --> 00:28:43,195
You help them a little bit, they will be at your service life long.

441
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,923
Because I have personally experienced

442
00:28:46,947 --> 00:28:49,772
the organization My husband was running

443
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:51,911
they had lot of questions.

444
00:28:51,935 --> 00:28:54,344
I told them to make a family of everyone.

445
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:57,272
And first of all study them, whosoever comes.

446
00:28:57,297 --> 00:28:59,409
Even from Calcuuta the people of Union come

447
00:28:59,434 --> 00:29:01,052
we serve them break fast.

448
00:29:01,077 --> 00:29:05,204
Talk to them, ask them, " what are your questions?"

449
00:29:05,228 --> 00:29:06,451
Then there are questions about their houses.

450
00:29:06,476 --> 00:29:09,249
I said, that these can be solved from your office.

451
00:29:09,273 --> 00:29:11,506
Make such an arrangement that they get houses.

452
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,789
 When this is done

453
00:29:12,814 --> 00:29:15,923
you make an arrangement for their children's education.

454
00:29:15,947 --> 00:29:18,165
It is not necessary that you give them raise and give them money.

455
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:22,695
Because if they get money, they will straightaway go to have drinks.

456
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,345
Or they may have two to four women.

457
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:25,995
That is not going to help in any way.

458
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:29,361
But if you help them really, deeply by heart

459
00:29:29,385 --> 00:29:34,723
and understand them by heart and think that they are your part and parcel.

460
00:29:34,747 --> 00:29:37,064
NOT CLEAR

461
00:29:37,088 --> 00:29:38,556
there should not be any falsehood in that.

462
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:43,104
But by heart, you only do everything and win their heart.

463
00:29:43,128 --> 00:29:45,870
All your questions will be over.

464
00:29:45,894 --> 00:29:51,826
This country is so blessed, that there should be abundance of Lakshmi.

465
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,987
But this is a very great question

466
00:29:54,012 --> 00:29:56,782
that here people do not take to Maha Saraswati Principle.

467
00:29:56,806 --> 00:30:00,025
Their access is only upto Saraswati Principle.

468
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:03,818
When you adopt Maha Saraswati Tatwa

469
00:30:03,842 --> 00:30:06,448
you in this matter will get busy into it.

470
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:07,786
For that it is not necessary that

471
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:10,207
you do 420 activity, some hypocracy, nothing.

472
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:12,907
Everything will be alright on its own

473
00:30:12,932 --> 00:30:14,913
Because otherwise also, you are a sahajyogi.

474
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:18,588
All the work of Sahaja Yogis gets done very easily.

475
00:30:18,612 --> 00:30:23,033
But following Sahaj yoga rules is compulsory.

476
00:30:23,057 --> 00:30:32,381
NOT CLEAR

477
00:30:32,406 --> 00:30:37,212
and everybody should spread it.

478
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:39,914
unless you ascent from inside

479
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,565
you cannot spread it outside, however you may want.

480
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:46,830
That is why in Sahajyoga, it is very important to meditate.

481
00:30:46,855 --> 00:30:51,802
You should meditate. I don't say , you get up at 5 a.m in the morning

482
00:30:51,826 --> 00:30:55,235
But you meditate for 5 minutes in the morning

483
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,342
 and for 10 minutes in the evening.

484
00:30:57,366 --> 00:31:00,929
And it is not that if you missed it one day, it is a great mistake

485
00:31:00,953 --> 00:31:05,913
but it will clense you and you will be blessed.

486
00:31:05,937 --> 00:31:10,352
Out of that I say , it is full time your protection.

487
00:31:10,376 --> 00:31:12,787
All the time you are protected.

488
00:31:12,811 --> 00:31:16,348
You get a full time guidance

489
00:31:16,372 --> 00:31:19,723
and entertainment all the time.

490
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:22,058
There is nothing that will not entertain you.

491
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,676
Yesterday I went there, all the Sahajyogis were sitting there.

492
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:28,781
Amongst themselves, they were raising their kundalinis.

493
00:31:28,806 --> 00:31:34,294
They were leg pulling each other, talking, laughing and enjoying themselves.

494
00:31:34,318 --> 00:31:36,525
Again I was happy to see this.

495
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:39,515
There was nothing to give any pain to anybody.

496
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:41,247
and in a lot of enjoyment and happiness

497
00:31:41,271 --> 00:31:44,500
 all of them were entertained and enjoying.

498
00:31:44,524 --> 00:31:51,751
In which there is enjoyment, there is uplitfment, spiritual upliftment.

499
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:56,733
and which will be for the welfare of society, of country and of the universe.

500
00:31:56,758 --> 00:31:59,538
Such is the great work of Sahajyoga.

501
00:31:59,562 --> 00:32:01,844
You should workout this.

502
00:32:01,868 --> 00:32:07,023
As such Sahajyoga has spread in 55 countries.

503
00:32:07,047 --> 00:32:09,786
Even now the tatwas that are there

504
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:12,737
 are not even that of Mahasaraswati.

505
00:32:12,761 --> 00:32:18,054
All the people, all think 'Love Mother'

506
00:32:18,078 --> 00:32:22,039
SEVA KARO, of Mother, be busy with worshipping Mother.

507
00:32:22,063 --> 00:32:26,928
That is o.k, that helps you a little to have faith.

508
00:32:26,953 --> 00:32:31,342
That is not going to benefit you.

509
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:37,164
NOT CLEAR

510
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,701
Now depth has been attained.

511
00:32:38,725 --> 00:32:45,003
let us suppose that you have achieved your depth.

512
00:32:45,027 --> 00:32:47,327
But what is the use of that depth?

513
00:32:47,351 --> 00:32:54,376
What is the use of such a deep pot in which we have not to fill water?

514
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,229
That is useless.

515
00:32:56,254 --> 00:32:58,741
Whether that is deep or shallow, what is the use of that?

516
00:32:58,766 --> 00:32:59,709
It has no utility.

517
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:03,247
For whatever you have created that depth

518
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:07,430
if you have to make use of it, get busy into that.

519
00:33:07,454 --> 00:33:13,253
what is the use of you certificates of that depth?

520
00:33:13,294 --> 00:33:18,147
It is possible, it is o.k, that in spiritualism

521
00:33:18,172 --> 00:33:20,669
people will take you as a saintly person.

522
00:33:20,693 --> 00:33:25,205
 You are very great, cool breeze flows out of you.

523
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,468
As I am sitting here

524
00:33:26,492 --> 00:33:28,775
but I don't do anything, I am inactive.

525
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,894
It is useless, you should do something if you are inactive>

526
00:33:32,918 --> 00:33:36,717
What is the use of such a life which makes us inactive?

527
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:39,288
So, we should get busy in some or the other work.

528
00:33:39,312 --> 00:33:43,496
Now you must think on Agnya chakra that Mother had said

529
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,214
So what should we do?

530
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:49,400
If you go to NIRVICHAR state, you will get an inspiration from inside only

531
00:33:49,425 --> 00:33:53,425
that you can do this, do this, this can be done, do this.

532
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,070
In this way only Sahajyoga is going to spread.

533
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:59,006
So, the people here who are very deep.

534
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:02,127
Also I felt very happy to see that they are very deep.

535
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:05,721
Now we have to distribute this depth.

536
00:34:05,745 --> 00:34:09,960
It is of no use that few people will be deep, say like Ravinder Babu.

537
00:34:09,985 --> 00:34:12,223
But others will lag behind.

538
00:34:12,248 --> 00:34:19,106
For example, in a pond some lotuses will come out

539
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:20,663
and there are some insects also.

540
00:34:20,688 --> 00:34:26,495
They say, see in our pond there are so many lotuses, but you are still an insect.

541
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:30,373
So, even if you are so, are so many flowers, have become lotuses too

542
00:34:30,397 --> 00:34:32,939
what is its use to others?

543
00:34:32,963 --> 00:34:35,144
So, this Maha Saraswati Tatwa

544
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:39,056
to which we had not paid so much attention till now.

545
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:46,420
That is why I have started (to emphasize) that Maha Saraswati should be worshipped.

546
00:34:46,444 --> 00:34:52,218
Mahasaraswati Tatwa in our country is the creation of the Vedas.

547
00:34:52,242 --> 00:34:53,809
In that also, it is said that

548
00:34:53,834 --> 00:34:56,818
if you have not experienced 'Vidha', there is no 'Veda' also.

549
00:34:56,867 --> 00:34:59,584
About the creation of 'Vedas' they said that

550
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:03,270
 These are' Panch Mahabhoots', its work must be done beforehand.

551
00:35:03,294 --> 00:35:05,833
We must see them, give them realization.

552
00:35:05,858 --> 00:35:10,058
After giving them realization, we must utilize them.

553
00:35:10,082 --> 00:35:11,090
It is because of that only

554
00:35:11,115 --> 00:35:13,635
the science etc., came to our country.

555
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,225
In our country, long back scientific research had taken place.

556
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,773
In comparison to modern science

557
00:35:19,798 --> 00:35:21,379
in our country, science was much before

558
00:35:21,403 --> 00:35:22,860
because of 'Vedas'.

559
00:35:22,885 --> 00:35:27,176
 Through vedas they attained dominion over the five elements.

560
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,626
And you can also get it.

561
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:31,129
With the help of Sahajyoga also, you can control five elements.

562
00:35:31,153 --> 00:35:33,085
But you move your hands.

563
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:34,938
You pay your attention there.

564
00:35:34,962 --> 00:35:39,077
One thing is that, "Mother, see my mother is sick."

565
00:35:39,101 --> 00:35:43,402
Oh! you are a Sahajyogi, you can cure her. use your hands."

566
00:35:43,426 --> 00:35:46,061
First check, if you can cure her or not?

567
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:48,977
If you cannot cure her, get her to Me.

568
00:35:49,002 --> 00:35:50,106
What do you talk?

569
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,338
Every thing Mother will do.

570
00:35:51,362 --> 00:35:53,317
If somebody is sick, Mother will cure.

571
00:35:53,342 --> 00:35:56,044
If there is some trouble, telephone Mother.

572
00:35:56,069 --> 00:35:59,417
You see, that you yourself can cure her.

573
00:35:59,441 --> 00:36:03,716
You put your hand on her, learn, you can do.

574
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,620
You yourself are powerful, you have got unlimited powers.

575
00:36:06,645 --> 00:36:10,107
You use the powers that have been given to you.

576
00:36:10,132 --> 00:36:13,710
You distribute with the help of your hands.

577
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:22,058
You will be surprised that your so many powers, your own powers will emit.

578
00:36:22,082 --> 00:36:25,666
This I repeatedly say that you yourself do something.

579
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:29,616
Whosoever is there, want to put the burden on Me, is of no use.

580
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,175
O.k I will cure , but you can do better than Me.

581
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,775
So, why don't you do?

582
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:38,908
Do it quickly. You should help each other also.

583
00:36:38,932 --> 00:36:40,689
Among Sahajyogis, if one is sick

584
00:36:40,713 --> 00:36:44,074
the other who is alright should go and help that (sick) person.

585
00:36:44,098 --> 00:36:47,286
Rush quickly. See that your plan works.

586
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,643
If it doesn't work, then tell Me.

587
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:55,822
And I am telling you absolutely, that you have this power all the time.

588
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:59,574
And the more you use it, the more it will grow and the more it will work.

589
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,968
and the more it will work and you will be successful.

590
00:37:02,992 --> 00:37:05,217
But have faith on yourself.

591
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:06,860
Mother has told us so

592
00:37:06,885 --> 00:37:09,782
Surely it is within us, and we should take it forward.

593
00:37:09,806 --> 00:37:13,247
I have to tell for all of you that depth has been achieved in Sahajyoga

594
00:37:13,271 --> 00:37:16,880
but so far as, 'giving it (to others)' is concerned, it is a little less.

595
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:19,495
Because you are very deep, I agree

596
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,109
the Sahajyogis of our country are very deep.

597
00:37:22,133 --> 00:37:26,912
Now you have to start giving it to people, distribute it among people.

598
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:31,481
And start making them understand and bring other people into Sahajyoga.

599
00:37:31,505 --> 00:37:35,701
You can cure them, you can bring them into balance.

600
00:37:35,725 --> 00:37:40,414
When you will get busy into it, when Maha Saraswari Tatwa will be awakened

601
00:37:40,438 --> 00:37:43,420
you will be amazed

602
00:37:43,444 --> 00:37:47,047
that how much this country has progressed.

603
00:37:47,071 --> 00:37:54,730
But this disease of laziness is there throughout India, not only here.

604
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,462
Everybody is lazy.

605
00:37:56,486 --> 00:38:01,795
And there are so many excuses, why don't we do?

606
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:05,662
We don't do because of this, because of that.

607
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:07,896
Even in Sahajyoga, people make lot of excuses.

608
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,795
Now if you start working without telling excuses

609
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:13,169
For example, somebody will say

610
00:38:13,194 --> 00:38:17,596
We had gone there but there the sheet was not clean.

611
00:38:17,621 --> 00:38:19,696
So you clean it.

612
00:38:19,721 --> 00:38:24,532
To make some excuses, it was so , that is why it could not be done.

613
00:38:24,556 --> 00:38:30,038
or that we are afraid of our society, or that we are afraid of our brother.

614
00:38:30,062 --> 00:38:31,402
Because of such scared people

615
00:38:31,427 --> 00:38:34,060
neither there can be betterment of them nor of Sahajyoga.

616
00:38:34,084 --> 00:38:37,536
Sahajyoga is not for cowards, it is for brave people.

617
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,057
And you should volunteer yourself.

618
00:38:40,081 --> 00:38:42,020
You should come forward.

619
00:38:42,044 --> 00:38:46,464
You should invite everyone, you should give challenge, 'come and see.'

620
00:38:46,488 --> 00:38:48,026
Then it will work out.

621
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:53,252
Because you are noticing how much bkack magic has spread in Bengal.

622
00:38:53,276 --> 00:38:57,205
Since I came, I see how much black magic is here.

623
00:38:57,229 --> 00:38:59,657
Since yesterday, I am just clearing it, clearing it out.

624
00:38:59,681 --> 00:39:04,186
Whosoever I see, says, I am sad, he is sad, they are sad.

625
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:08,344
If everybody is sad, what is sadness?

626
00:39:08,368 --> 00:39:10,685
Whosoever I see says, my foot broke, i am sad

627
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,876
my head is paining, i am sad.

628
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,012
So this poverty is also because of this black magic.

629
00:39:17,036 --> 00:39:20,004
You should get rid of this black magic.

630
00:39:20,028 --> 00:39:24,381
And for this you should have some special thing.

631
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:27,830
If you also say, i belong to this religion, i belong to that religion

632
00:39:27,854 --> 00:39:31,660
I am disciple of this guru, I am diciple of that guru, this is my guru.

633
00:39:31,684 --> 00:39:34,951
You have photographs of these gurus and all this

634
00:39:34,976 --> 00:39:38,308
of which you do not have any good experience till now

635
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:41,609
whom you have not seen, not heard of, don't know him

636
00:39:41,634 --> 00:39:44,624
what is the use of running after such people?

637
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:48,590
The person who is in front of you, accept him and get busy in that.

638
00:39:48,614 --> 00:39:55,622
So today's puja according to Me should be for the whole of India.

639
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:58,926
This disease is in whole of India.

640
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,536
We are active. You are not avtive at all.

641
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:09,391
What we are, we have lot of desires, lot of desires.

642
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:13,005
For example there are politicians, 'i will do this , i will do that'.

643
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:16,235
But as soon as they occupy their seats, they forget

644
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,855
and have no desire except earning money.

645
00:40:19,893 --> 00:40:22,207
It should not be so in Sahajyoga.

646
00:40:22,231 --> 00:40:24,303
In Sahajyoga we have to work.

647
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:27,931
And for working it out, what we have to do? We have to discuss.

648
00:40:27,955 --> 00:40:32,214
For this, you meet, discuss among yourselves what we have to do?

649
00:40:32,238 --> 00:40:34,010
What can we do?

650
00:40:34,034 --> 00:40:36,621
How can we take it forward?

651
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:41,025
There is nothing in Sahajyoga which that picks up speed.

652
00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:43,276
We purchased this land for the sake of experiments.

653
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,319
purchased the other, is rotting

654
00:40:45,344 --> 00:40:47,734
bought another land but is just lying there rotting.

655
00:40:47,758 --> 00:40:52,332
Till I don't come to India, not even a small path can be made.

656
00:40:52,356 --> 00:40:55,110
Not even a small hut can be constructed.

657
00:40:55,134 --> 00:41:00,727
I can't understand, even when there are so many people, no work is done.

658
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:05,497
When I go, you disburse and get separated.

659
00:41:05,521 --> 00:41:08,571
And only two to four people work.

660
00:41:08,595 --> 00:41:12,400
Sahajyoga is a collective work.

661
00:41:12,424 --> 00:41:14,839
It is not the job of only two to four people only

662
00:41:14,863 --> 00:41:20,325
that just one or two people can do it.

663
00:41:20,428 --> 00:41:22,078
This also is important to understand.

664
00:41:22,102 --> 00:41:24,229
Only one person is doing everything.

665
00:41:24,254 --> 00:41:26,711
only one person is running, it can't be like this.

666
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:30,663
Everybody has to get organized like the parts of a body.

667
00:41:30,687 --> 00:41:35,530
Not Clear

668
00:41:35,554 --> 00:41:39,113
A Sahajyogi is the part of one Sahajyoga.

669
00:41:39,137 --> 00:41:46,752
Imagine, there is something wrong with the finger itself.

670
00:41:46,777 --> 00:41:49,156
All over the body there will be pain definitely.

671
00:41:49,181 --> 00:41:55,862
But if this finger is finished, then from where can we get another one?

672
00:41:55,887 --> 00:41:57,897
Once you have come to Sahaja Yoga

673
00:41:57,922 --> 00:42:00,892
everything is Sahaja [spontaneous] no doubt about that.

674
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:04,203
But one thing that is Sahaj of all, does not go away

675
00:42:04,228 --> 00:42:07,266
and that is the small mindedness

676
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:12,910
and this ignorance about being special people.

677
00:42:12,934 --> 00:42:18,611
I have only one great thing to tell all of you, out of love

678
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:24,824
that all of you have  gained and achieved so much of depth, in Sahaja Yoga

679
00:42:24,849 --> 00:42:27,138
and now you should start spreading it.

680
00:42:27,163 --> 00:42:30,311
Till the time, the lamp is not lit

681
00:42:30,336 --> 00:42:35,593
we give it light and say that it is now enlightenend.

682
00:42:35,618 --> 00:42:39,818
But even after that if it asks for the light, what can one say?

683
00:42:39,843 --> 00:42:42,282
Now the enlightenend lamp should give light to others.

684
00:42:42,307 --> 00:42:44,124
Today you are listening to Me.

685
00:42:44,149 --> 00:42:47,436
Tomorrow you can sit in My place and do My work.

686
00:42:47,461 --> 00:42:50,233
When this happens only then Sahaja Yoga wil grow.

687
00:42:50,258 --> 00:42:54,099
Wherever this has happened, Sahaja Yoga has spread in those countries.

688
00:42:54,124 --> 00:43:00,133
I bless you that now many people may emerge after this puja and do this work.

689
00:43:00,158 --> 00:43:03,384
This is My eternal blessings.
