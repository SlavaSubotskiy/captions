1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,207
With love all kinds of creative action takes place.

2
00:00:08,503 --> 00:00:12,270
You see how Raulbai has love for Me

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:21,367
and in this place you all also got new
ideas of creating a beautiful thing.

4
00:00:21,544 --> 00:00:28,350
And as love will increase, your creativity
will develop.

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,731
So the basis of all creativity, of Saraswati, is love.

6
00:00:35,176 --> 00:00:39,472
If there is no love there’s no creativity.

7
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:42,878
It’s even in the deeper sense, if you see.

8
00:00:42,903 --> 00:00:47,768
People who have created all the scientific things

9
00:00:47,793 --> 00:00:51,893
are also out of love for the masses, 
not for themselves.

10
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,820
Nobody has produced anything for themselves.

11
00:00:54,974 --> 00:00:57,239
If they make something for themselves

12
00:00:57,264 --> 00:01:01,515
it has to become for universal use,
otherwise it has no meaning.

13
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,812
Even if you say atom bomb
and all these things that are created from science,

14
00:01:05,837 --> 00:01:08,572
 they are also very protective.

15
00:01:08,622 --> 00:01:13,968
If they had not created those, people would
not have taken out their minds from war.

16
00:01:13,993 --> 00:01:17,085
Now, nobody can think of having a big war.

17
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,228
Of course, they are having cold wars,

18
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:22,921
but that also will gradually stop, when
they will be fed up of it.

19
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:26,960
So, all the activity on the right hand
side, of Saraswati,

20
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:32,453
basically has to end up in love; starts
with love and ends up in love.

21
00:01:32,661 --> 00:01:37,368
Whichever does not end up in love coils
up and finishes off.

22
00:01:37,615 --> 00:01:39,067
It just disappears.

23
00:01:39,363 --> 00:01:44,249
So you can see that even matter, which is
not used for love,

24
00:01:44,298 --> 00:01:48,570
just finishes off. The basis has to be love.

25
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:53,733
Otherwise all such matter that we create
which has angularity,

26
00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:00,784
which is not fitting into the mass media,
which is not appealing to the masses.

27
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:04,706
Of course, it takes time, you have seen
that it takes time -

28
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:11,053
but it does have that tendency always
to disappear in the thin air

29
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:14,951
as soon as you find it does not appeal
to the masses.

30
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:20,905
Now this love of, that we talk of, this
great love of God we talk of,

31
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,569
we know it for definite through vibrations.

32
00:02:24,594 --> 00:02:26,696
People do not have vibrations,

33
00:02:26,721 --> 00:02:32,315
but still they can feel the vibrations
in a very unconscious way.

34
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,795
All the great paintings of the world have vibrations.

35
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,313
All the great creative works of the world have vibrations.

36
00:02:39,338 --> 00:02:43,705
Only those who have vibrations have been
sustained by time,

37
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,178
otherwise all other things are destroyed.

38
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:50,360
There must have been monuments
and horrible statues and horrible things

39
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:52,654
that have been created long time back.

40
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:57,580
But [they] were all destroyed by nature,
and they could not stand

41
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:04,765
the impact of the Kala - that is
the destructive power of time.

42
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:12,072
So, all that is sustaining, all that
is nurturing, all that is en-nobling,

43
00:03:12,265 --> 00:03:18,862
comes from this sense of love, which is
within us very much developed,

44
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:22,881
but within others also, who are not yet realized.

45
00:03:22,906 --> 00:03:25,576
Ultimately the whole world has to realize

46
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:31,936
that one has to go to that ultimate love
of God, otherwise it has no meaning.

47
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:36,031
Now you have seen in art people have taken
to other methods

48
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:40,474
of appealing to people by using cheap
things and very vulgar things,

49
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:44,797
just to make people think that this is art.
But this will all disappear.

50
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:50,143
It cannot sustain the impact of the time
as I told you, it cannot.

51
00:03:50,185 --> 00:03:53,241
Because the time will kill it. All these
things have to disappear

52
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,243
and already you can see the result,

53
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:58,661
how things are changing everywhere,
even in the West.

54
00:03:58,686 --> 00:04:02,435
So there is no need to be so much
disappointed with the West

55
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,797
and to say that the Western world is a wasteland.

56
00:04:05,822 --> 00:04:09,816
It is going to be alright and it has to be done.

57
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:14,490
Especially it has done lot of Puja
of Saraswati, I should say, in the West.

58
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:18,570
Much more than they have done in India
because they have gone to learning

59
00:04:18,595 --> 00:04:21,449
and they have tried to find out so many things.

60
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:25,738
But only thing they forgot that it is
a Goddess, Goddess of Learning.

61
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,963
Everything comes from the Goddess.
That’s what they’ve forgotten.

62
00:04:28,988 --> 00:04:31,529
And that’'s why all the problems have been created.

63
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:35,326
If there is no Spirit in your learning,
if there is no source

64
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:38,749
of the Goddess in your learning, then it is
absolutely useless.

65
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:44,344
If they had realized that there is
the Spirit that is working it out,

66
00:04:44,488 --> 00:04:47,886
they would not have gone that far.

67
00:04:48,694 --> 00:04:52,075
And that’s what I was warning the Indians, all through,

68
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,623
that you are now taking to industrial
revolution in a way

69
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:59,260
and to avoid all the complications
of industrial revolution,

70
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:03,100
you must try to know the Spirit.

71
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:07,487
If you do not know the Spirit you will have
the same problems as these people have.

72
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:10,434
Because they are also human beings, you are
also human beings.

73
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:13,548
You will also go the same way. At random
you will run

74
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:18,123
and there will be problems, the same
problems as the Western people have.

75
00:05:18,322 --> 00:05:24,890
Now Saraswati's blessings are so many that
one cannot describe in such a short time.

76
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:30,124
And the Surya has given us so many powers
that it is impossible

77
00:05:30,175 --> 00:05:34,479
to tell them even in one lecture, even
in ten lectures.

78
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:40,338
But how we go against Surya and how we go
against Saraswati,

79
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:44,943
while doing the worship of Saraswati, is
to be seen very clearly within ourselves.

80
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:48,371
For example the Western people are very
fond of Surya

81
00:05:48,396 --> 00:05:53,051
because they have no Surya within. But
they go too far with it, as you know,

82
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:56,721
and create complications within themselves of Surya.

83
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:03,623
But the main thing that one has to achieve
through Surya is the light within,

84
00:06:03,903 --> 00:06:11,586
is the light within. And if Surya chakra
at the Agnya level

85
00:06:11,611 --> 00:06:17,251
is occupied by Lord Jesus Christ then it is
even more essential

86
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:27,417
that the purity of life, what we call
‘Niti’, is the morality of life.

87
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:34,000
Now morality itself has become very much
sort of an argument in the West.

88
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:38,281
People don't have any sense of absolute morality.

89
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:43,435
On vibrations of course you know. But
they have gone all against it.

90
00:06:43,524 --> 00:06:48,931
Those who are the worshippers of Jesus,
those who are the worshippers of the Surya,

91
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:53,473
of the Saraswati have all gone against it.

92
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:58,681
Against the powers of Surya, just disobeying it.

93
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:02,928
Because you cannot be a Surya if you do not have

94
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:07,164
a proper sense of morality and holiness.

95
00:07:07,404 --> 00:07:12,987
The Surya itself brings light, to see
everything clearly.

96
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:15,646
So many qualities Surya has got.

97
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:22,202
It dries up everything that is wet, dirty, filthy.

98
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,612
It dries up all these places, which create parasites.

99
00:07:26,734 --> 00:07:29,489
But so many parasites are created in the West.

100
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:33,706
Not only parasites, but there are horrible
cults and horrible things

101
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:41,191
which have come into those countries
which is supposed to be full of light.

102
00:07:41,352 --> 00:07:48,809
And in that darkness they exist: darkness
about their Spirit,

103
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:54,261
darkness about their own knowledge
and darkness about love.

104
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,836
These three things have taken over in the places

105
00:07:57,861 --> 00:08:01,506
where you are supposed to love light.
Light doesn’t mean,

106
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:05,516
light doesn’t mean what you see with your gross eyes.

107
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:09,625
Light means from within - the Light of Love.

108
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:13,265
That one should understand - Light of Love.

109
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:18,358
And it's so soothing, it’s so sweet, it’s
so beautiful, it’s so enamouring,

110
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:24,621
it’s so abounding that unless and until
you can feel that light within you -

111
00:08:24,885 --> 00:08:29,443
that light which is of pure love, of purity,

112
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,579
pure relationships, pure understanding.

113
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:38,238
If you can develop that kind of a light within yourself,

114
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:43,116
then the whole thing will be cleansed.

115
00:08:43,141 --> 00:08:48,681
'Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.'

116
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:53,154
This is what happens to you when you are
completely cleansed.

117
00:08:53,269 --> 00:09:01,815
The purest form of nature is within us.
The purest form of nature is within us.

118
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:06,598
Our chakras are made out of that purest
form of nature.

119
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:10,944
We are the only people who are spoiling it
by our mental thinking.

120
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:15,284
Again the same Saraswati’s work. You are
going against Saraswati itself.

121
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:20,087
Saraswati cleanses all that is impure in nature,

122
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:24,649
while, with our brain activity, we are
spoiling all that.

123
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:31,481
All our brain activity goes against pure intelligence.

124
00:09:31,935 --> 00:09:36,781
And that’s what one has to understand -
that this pure intelligence,

125
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:43,181
is not to be soiled by our thinking. Our
thinking can make us so bumptious,

126
00:09:43,405 --> 00:09:54,036
so ego-oriented, so impure, that we can
really eat the poison

127
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:58,819
and say 'what is wrong with it'?
Just the opposite of Saraswati.

128
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:03,722
If Saraswati is within us, She gives us
Subuddhi, wisdom.

129
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:07,435
And that is why to worship Saraswati,
to worship Surya

130
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,128
we must have that clear vision as to
what we have to be,

131
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:16,758
what we are doing, what filth we are
living in, what our mind is getting into.

132
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:21,406
After all, we are here for emancipation
and not for just for pampering our ego

133
00:10:21,431 --> 00:10:24,592
and living with our filth that is with us.

134
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:29,441
So this light has come within us and we
should try to rise above

135
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:36,580
our own mental filth, which is being
created around us.

136
00:10:36,893 --> 00:10:43,656
Apart from that, you have to go higher
and understand

137
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:50,100
that there is, within us, a thing called ego.

138
00:10:50,372 --> 00:10:53,880
And this ego is false, absolutely false.
You do not do anything.

139
00:10:53,905 --> 00:10:56,866
Actually when you turn your eyes here and there,

140
00:10:56,891 --> 00:11:02,587
when your attention is here and there
it is nothing but your ego is trying to overpower everyone.

141
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:07,368
 But actually, ego is an absolute falsehood

142
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:13,747
because there is only one ego and that is
of God Almighty, Mahat-Ahamkara.

143
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:19,748
There is no really any ego that exists. It's myth.

144
00:11:19,797 --> 00:11:24,195
It's a very big myth, because if you start
thinking you are doing everything -

145
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,952
you are doing this, you are doing that -
which you are not doing;

146
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:32,530
then this nonsensical ego comes in an
 you start working it out,

147
00:11:32,555 --> 00:11:34,643
it can project in every direction.

148
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:38,975
When it projects forward, it overpowers others,

149
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:44,883
it tries to dominate others, tries to kill
others, becomes cruel.

150
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:49,191
When it moves [to the] right side,
it becomes supraconscious.

151
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,165
It starts seeing things, which are absurd,
which are foolish, which are stupid.

152
00:11:54,269 --> 00:12:01,657
When it moves left side then it starts
talking - I mean, seeing things -

153
00:12:01,682 --> 00:12:08,520
yourself as a big man, as a big Christ
or as a big Devi

154
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:13,082
or something like Adi Gurus and 'I am a very
great personality' - that is left sided.

155
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:16,153
When it moves backwards, that is
the dangerous one.

156
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:21,112
When people become gurus, which are ruining
other people.

157
00:12:21,345 --> 00:12:24,749
When their ego moves backwards then they
become gurus,

158
00:12:24,774 --> 00:12:27,291
they themselves have lots of defects in themselves

159
00:12:27,316 --> 00:12:30,705
and they try to pull people into those horrible stuff,

160
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,546
which is described as absolute Naraka.

161
00:12:34,724 --> 00:12:38,465
That’s how, is the movement of ego
on all the sides.

162
00:12:38,572 --> 00:12:43,738
Now when people try to use their right Vishuddhi

163
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:47,443
that is to talk about themselves,
is the worst of all.

164
00:12:47,597 --> 00:12:50,447
Whatever type of ego you may have,

165
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:55,362
if you start boasting about it and talking
about it, then it encircles,

166
00:12:55,418 --> 00:13:01,486
thickens the walls of ego so much, that
it is impossible to penetrate into that.

167
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:05,108
Because such a person is completely
satisfied with himself

168
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:10,364
and he believes that he is so. And once he
starts believing into a nonsense like that,

169
00:13:10,402 --> 00:13:14,765
it's an impossibility, is an impossibility
to penetrate.

170
00:13:14,846 --> 00:13:21,446
So, when you boast about these things
or you talk big, be careful.

171
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,245
You see, you know what I am, but how many
times do I say 'I am that'?

172
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:30,399
Even if I say once, it makes tremendous
vibrations for you.

173
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:35,469
But how many times do I say so?
At the most if you say something, I say 'yes'.

174
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,169
 But I don't say that.

175
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:40,318
If I say it loudly, I don't know what may happen.

176
00:13:40,343 --> 00:13:43,064
The whole thing might be blasted with truth.

177
00:13:43,227 --> 00:13:47,118
So, one has to understand that
Mahat-Ahamkara is the one

178
00:13:47,143 --> 00:13:51,367
that acts, that works, that creates???.
Sometimes I shout at you.

179
00:13:51,392 --> 00:13:54,313
Immediately all the bhoots run away.
Just once I shout.

180
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:57,866
Yesterday, you saw all the bhoots that were
coughing, they all ran away.

181
00:13:57,891 --> 00:14:01,702
Yesterday just I started. So you should understand

182
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,771
that now you are a realized souls, you can
also do the same.

183
00:14:04,796 --> 00:14:07,293
Use your right Vishuddhi to shout at yourself,

184
00:14:07,318 --> 00:14:10,570
‘‘Now will you please stop boasting,
will you stop talking all this nonsense,

185
00:14:10,595 --> 00:14:15,423
will you stop showing off!'' Then it will stop.

186
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:23,782
Now this thickening takes place by people
who really are active,

187
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:27,327
who want to do something about it. Not that
they are not active, they want to do it.

188
00:14:27,352 --> 00:14:30,909
But they know only one way, is to act
through talking.

189
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:34,277
They don't understand that there are inner ways

190
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:38,583
by which you control it much more.

191
00:14:38,704 --> 00:14:43,247
Because they don't want to take to that,
they take to this talking.

192
00:14:43,504 --> 00:14:49,085
And once they take to talking and they talk
about it, the whole power flows away.

193
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:53,439
But if they do not talk about it and keep
it within themselves.

194
00:14:53,782 --> 00:14:57,010
It’s alright, you can tell Me about your
experiences or anything,

195
00:14:57,035 --> 00:15:00,377
but if you start telling others, and
talking about it too much,

196
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:05,063
then the powers that you have got will be
all disappearing gradually from you.

197
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,442
And you will just come down to absolutely lowest level.

198
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,853
So one should not too much talk that,
“I have this power,

199
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:16,386
I have this power” or “I see this” or
“I do this,”

200
00:15:16,424 --> 00:15:20,891
which is a very wrong thing. I warn you,
don’t try to show off.

201
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,552
Yes, you can talk about My powers.
It's all right.

202
00:15:23,737 --> 00:15:26,666
But don't try to talk about your powers.

203
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:31,708
When it comes, of course, to talk
to somebody who is a negative person

204
00:15:31,827 --> 00:15:35,278
or to tell somebody, then you should say
that “we”, not “I”.

205
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:41,532
“We” have, some of us have felt this power
within ourselves. We have seen people”.

206
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:46,359
It may be you only, but you need not say,
'I' have. What you have to say is 'We'.

207
00:15:46,703 --> 00:15:52,756
Then you become the Mahat-Ahamkara. When
you say 'We', Yes, some of us', 'we do'.

208
00:15:52,997 --> 00:15:57,110
Like in Gregoire's book also I made it,
I saw to it,

209
00:15:57,135 --> 00:16:00,619
that he should not have many 'I's',
but he should have 'We'.

210
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:04,674
'We think', 'we do', 'we'. Means, the whole
collective being,

211
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:09,541
the whole collective organism, living
organism of Sahaja Yogis.

212
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:12,221
So if you say, 'yes, some of us have got it',

213
00:16:12,246 --> 00:16:15,449
that means, you put yourself down,
but put all others above you.

214
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:18,332
Say: 'Yes, some of us have. I know some
people have this.'

215
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:23,115
That’'s the way one should do it. Because
if you have to overpower your ego,

216
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,740
you must allow it to spread into everybody else.

217
00:16:27,824 --> 00:16:31,353
That’s how you will make it perfectly
all right, to make it spread.

218
00:16:31,378 --> 00:16:35,144
“We, all Sahaja Yogis, we all”.
But that pride is not there.

219
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,710
I've seen that pride is not there.
Still it is very individualistic.

220
00:16:38,735 --> 00:16:43,017
If you start thinking, ''we Sahaja Yogis",
then what happens,

221
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,317
that you become one personality,
one organization.

222
00:16:46,342 --> 00:16:49,729
But the person will look down upon
other people.

223
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:55,203
He will see that this person is low, that
person is higher, that person is there.

224
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:59,256
But he will not think, "'We' the Sahaja
Yogis, how beautiful we are.

225
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:02,665
'We' the body of Sahaja Yoga, how beautiful we are."

226
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:09,851
So always think in the words of 'we',

227
00:17:10,084 --> 00:17:14,917
so your ego will become much less,
much less, much less.

228
00:17:14,942 --> 00:17:18,692
And the same ego, which looked so funny
and absurd,

229
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:23,727
will form tomorrow the Ekadesha.

230
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:30,368
Today’s individual ego will merge into Ekadesha.

231
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:35,797
But we all must remember to say 'we' all time.

232
00:17:35,892 --> 00:17:40,714
This is what is today's day, is a great day
for us to change,

233
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:44,695
because the Sun has changed its mood, now.
Sun is coming this side.

234
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,652
So let us welcome the Sun, coming
to the North now, this way.

235
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:55,008
And for Australians to say that though
the Sun has gone,

236
00:17:55,033 --> 00:18:00,072
let us establish the Sun, the domain
of Sun, within ourselves.

237
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:03,000
Because Sun never disappears
from our inside.

238
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:08,020
So that is how we have to take a mood
by which we should think

239
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:12,007
of one personality, all of us together,
all of us together.

240
00:18:12,032 --> 00:18:17,901
And anybody who tries to be something
separate or different, he will drop out.

241
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:21,028
I will drop him out. Whatever it may be,
it will drop out.

242
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:25,292
So you just don’t worry: anybody who tries
to be singled out or anything.

243
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:29,128
Everybody must do whatever they like,
to nurture the whole,

244
00:18:29,153 --> 00:18:32,435
to help the whole, to emancipate the whole.

245
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,482
But not to, in anyway, put anyone down. Always.

246
00:18:37,693 --> 00:18:41,493
Because this is not the way the Sahaja Yoga is.

247
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:44,059
Sahaja Yoga only works in collectivity.

248
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:48,803
And the one who has developed
this permeating spirit,

249
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:52,178
is a real Sahaja Yogi. Who has not, is not!

250
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:55,610
Whatever you may think of yourself, I have
nothing to say.

251
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:59,255
But this permeating personality, which
moves from places to places,

252
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,100
whether you talk or not. Like your Mother is.

253
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,207
Whether I meet you or not, makes
no difference, but I am permeating

254
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:09,718
through all of you, by little, little
things, also, I am there with you.

255
00:19:09,891 --> 00:19:13,973
So like that, try to permeate into each
other and see the beauty.

256
00:19:13,998 --> 00:19:18,418
And you’ll enjoy yourself the best because
that is the biggest thing.

257
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:21,559
That's the biggest thing that is
to be achieved.

258
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:27,501
Because this ego you know makes you like a
nutshell and you just cannot have a rapport

259
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:33,463
with that beauty of permeation and just see
how the notes move into each other.

260
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:38,771
It will be a great idea today, it’s great
thing today we are having Puja in Dhulia.

261
00:19:39,484 --> 00:19:43,452
Like the Dhulia means the dust, dust.

262
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:48,541
And one day I had written in childhood,
a poem, I remember.

263
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:51,710
Very interesting poem it was - I don't know
whether it is lost -

264
00:19:51,735 --> 00:19:56,276
but which said that, "I want to be like
a dust particle

265
00:19:56,392 --> 00:20:00,212
which moves with the wind. It goes everywhere.

266
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:06,136
Can go, sit on the head of a king, or can
go and fall at the feet of someone.

267
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:12,499
And it can go and sit on a little flower,
and it can go and sit everywhere.

268
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:17,321
But I want to be a particle of dust
that is fragrant,

269
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:21,959
that is nourishing, that is enlightening."

270
00:20:22,232 --> 00:20:24,628
Like that, I had written a very beautiful poem,

271
00:20:24,653 --> 00:20:28,922
I must have been about seven years of age,
I remember - 'To be a dust particle',

272
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:33,038
I remember that very clearly, long time back,

273
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:39,399
that "I should be a dust particle so that
I’ll permeate into people."

274
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:43,383
Which is a very big thing - to become
a dust particle of that kind.

275
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:48,006
Whatever you touch, you see, that becomes enlivened,

276
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:55,982
whatever you just feel, that has fragrance.
It’s such a great thing to be like that.

277
00:20:56,167 --> 00:21:00,411
And that was My desire, and it has been achieved.

278
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:05,160
At that young age, I had this idea
of becoming a dust particle

279
00:21:05,227 --> 00:21:10,213
and today just while talking to you,
I remembered that I wanted to be that,

280
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:14,058
and that is what this place is.
And Raulbai is like that.

281
00:21:14,257 --> 00:21:17,311
She’s a very simple woman, very simple woman,

282
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:23,233
and she lives like a very simple person but
she has a sense of permeation.

283
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:26,923
And now there are so many Sahaja Yogis,
yesterday who came.

284
00:21:26,948 --> 00:21:29,540
I am sure that they will take up Sahaja
Yoga very well.

285
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:34,797
And there are lots of Sahaja Yogis from
Dhulia now,

286
00:21:34,822 --> 00:21:37,224
and I am sure there are going to be more people.

287
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:40,532
I hope you have met all of them. Make
friends with all of them.

288
00:21:40,557 --> 00:21:43,630
Try to know them who they are. They may
not know English -

289
00:21:43,655 --> 00:21:47,656
so get somebody to translate. Talk to them
and be nice to them,

290
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:51,360
be friendly with them. I wanted you to meet
them for permeation.

291
00:21:51,385 --> 00:21:54,474
You should know who are the people here,
who are in Nasik.

292
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:57,652
Because somehow we never meet the Sahaja
Yogis, you see,

293
00:21:57,677 --> 00:22:00,480
who are in that particular place, and
when we go back

294
00:22:00,505 --> 00:22:03,094
we have only one or two addresses.
It is not a good idea.

295
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:08,569
Try to see how many people there are.
Ask questions about them, and all that.

296
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:13,900
This permeation is only possible when your
ego starts permeating all around,

297
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:18,524
and this is the way to overcome
the problems of the right side

298
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:20,935
and that is how to worship Saraswati.

299
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:23,530
Because Saraswati has a veena in Her hand

300
00:22:23,555 --> 00:22:27,672
and that veena is the primordial
instrument, which She plays

301
00:22:27,697 --> 00:22:30,618
like music, and the music penetrates
into the heart.

302
00:22:30,643 --> 00:22:33,269
You don't know how it goes into you and how
it works out.

303
00:22:33,294 --> 00:22:38,410
And that’'s how a person who is a Sahaja Yogi

304
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:41,244
should permeate like music into other people.

305
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:46,225
She has so many qualities, as I told you,
which cannot be described in one lecture.

306
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:54,322
But one of the greatest qualities of Hers
is that She ends up into subtler things.

307
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:59,813
Like the Mother Earth will end up into fragrance.

308
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,929
Music will end up into melodies,

309
00:23:03,954 --> 00:23:07,662
like that whatever She creates ends up
into something greater.

310
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:11,715
Matter, whatever She produces, ends up
into aesthetics.

311
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,153
If matter does not have aesthetics then it is gross.

312
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,913
Like that everything. Now you will say,
"What is water?"

313
00:23:18,938 --> 00:23:24,545
Water becomes the river Ganges.
These are the subtler [things].

314
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,804
So the matter gets into subtler thing
because it has to permeate,

315
00:23:28,829 --> 00:23:33,271
it has to permeate. So everything
whatever it is.

316
00:23:33,388 --> 00:23:40,096
And the best of all is the air -that air
becomes the vibrations.

317
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:47,310
So you can see how, whatever has come out
from this matter,

318
00:23:47,335 --> 00:23:52,676
from these five elements, becomes that subtle thing.

319
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:57,953
Of course, the left and right side both
work it out because the love

320
00:23:58,185 --> 00:24:04,744
has to work on this and when love acts
on matter it becomes that,

321
00:24:04,922 --> 00:24:08,320
and that is how one has to look at your own lives,

322
00:24:08,345 --> 00:24:15,140
to make it a beautiful combination of love and matter.

323
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:18,213
May God bless you!

324
00:24:19,096 --> 00:24:21,924
