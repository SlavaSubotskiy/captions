00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,259
Shivaratri Puja, Pune,
17 March 2002.

2
00:02:07,092 --> 00:02:16,259
Tonight we have gathered here to do Shri Shiva Puja.

3
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:35,341
Those people who have a clean heart can only do Shiva Puja.

4
00:02:36,842 --> 00:02:44,508
Those whose heart is not clean cannot do Shiva Puja.

5
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,466
It's a simple principle of Shri Shivaratri.

6
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:08,466
As you have seen yesterday, we have snakes,

7
00:03:09,508 --> 00:03:14,092
or, these are horrible snakes

8
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,591
guiding behind the Shiva Linga.

9
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:32,925
The significance is this - those who are clean in heart,

10
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:40,591
who are full of love for others,

11
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:53,425
are always guarded by the power of Shiva,

12
00:03:53,675 --> 00:03:56,341
which are the snakes.

13
00:03:57,591 --> 00:04:04,341
It's a symbolic thing, to say, very symbolic.

14
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:09,675
But I must say that animals understand

15
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:16,508
Divine force much better than human beings, much better.

16
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,925
Because they have a clean heart.

17
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:31,175
Whatever is their lifestyle built by nature,

18
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:33,175
they carry on with it.

19
00:04:33,591 --> 00:04:39,466
But there's no malice, there's no jealousy,

20
00:04:39,508 --> 00:04:44,508
there's not all these mean things in their heart.

21
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:47,967
They do it because it is supposed to be.

22
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:55,591
But the quality of human beings is only one

23
00:04:56,675 --> 00:05:01,967
- and that is how much they love and forgive.

24
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:09,800
Loving capacity of human beings are such by

25
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:14,341
which they conquer all their negative forces -

26
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:18,800
they can, easily, see that it's not good

27
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:21,967
to have all these qualities,

28
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:26,591
or maybe that they understand it's not noble

29
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:32,341
to indulge into all these inhuman behaviour.

30
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:41,967
They are not bound to indulge into all these things.

31
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:51,341
Neither they are asked to be,

32
00:05:53,425 --> 00:06:02,259
but suddenly they get lured by such things which has got hatred,

33
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:10,591
jealously and greed.

34
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:16,425
You see how Shiva lives.

35
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:19,675
He lives in the Himalayas.

36
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:26,092
See what clothes He wears, what He eats.

37
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:32,675
He has no demand for anything because He's complete, He's perfect.

38
00:06:36,092 --> 00:06:40,300
Such a personality is Shiva's.

39
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:44,508
And if you are worshipping Him,

40
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:48,300
you should find out within your heart

41
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:58,341
what sort of feelings you have, what sort of malice you nurture.

42
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:04,842
These days in India, greed has become the main point.

43
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,134
They are so mean and so low.

44
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:20,466
It's impossible to understand that they think money is everything,

45
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,341
which is not in the culture of Indians, no, no.

46
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:28,341
In no way.

47
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:32,259
But somehow they have picked it up,

48
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,842
in the foreign countries perhaps,

49
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:37,675
and it is spreading very much now,

50
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:40,842
that money is the most important thing.

51
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:44,259
Think of Shiva.

52
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,508
He never thought of money.

53
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:53,508
He never wanted any money.

54
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,591
He never wanted to show off himself.

55
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:06,134
There is such a difference between Shiva and Shakti.

56
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:09,508
In their whole attitude.

57
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:14,925
Because Shiva is absolutely a liberated personality,

58
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:16,925
he's not bothered.

59
00:08:18,508 --> 00:08:19,967
If the people

60
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:23,466
are indulging into wrong things, he'll destroy - finished!

61
00:08:25,842 --> 00:08:27,259
He doesn't want to cure,

62
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,842
He doesn't want to improve, nothing of the kind.

63
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,259
But for the Shakti it is important,

64
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:38,259
because this is Her child, this universe is Her child.

65
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:41,425
All this is created by Her,

66
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:44,092
so naturally She is worried

67
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:46,633
and She doesn't like people

68
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:51,134
who try to take to mean things and nonsense.

69
00:08:54,508 --> 00:09:01,259
First of all it was human beings started indulging in power.

70
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:07,425
They moved from countries to country to empower themselves.

71
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:09,591
Where is that power gone? Finished.

72
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:16,717
Then, after that, what happened with them

73
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:22,009
is that they left their style with others.

74
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:26,425
And now it seems

75
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:31,134
it is very common to see people shamelessly being greedy.

76
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,842
For them, is the solution, is Shiva.

77
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,633
All such people will be destroyed. First of all

78
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:50,009
they will be exposed and then they will be destroyed,

79
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:52,842
to the last bit of it.

80
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,633
Another thing is that

81
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:04,758
Shiva respects a person who has a good character;

82
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:08,134
a person with a good character.

83
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:13,633
And if anyone is a bad character

84
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:22,758
or indulges into bad things, Shiva won't spare them.

85
00:10:24,134 --> 00:10:31,341
So the Shakti creates, protects, looks after them, brings them up.

86
00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:36,009
But Shiva is sitting there, just to destroy!

87
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:43,009
Very important, this destruction is very important.

88
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:46,425
The Shakti doesn't show those qualities.

89
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:48,633
She may destroy some rakshasas,

90
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:52,466
but He can destroy nations after nations.

91
00:10:53,925 --> 00:11:01,425
First of all the ego you have - who will destroy that?

92
00:11:01,508 --> 00:11:07,758
That too Shiva. Shiva is in your Sahasrara.

93
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:10,425
He is sitting in the Sahasrara;

94
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:14,009
now remember, on top of everything.

95
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:27,591
The other day I saw one gentleman from the Broadcasting, a newsman,

96
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:34,591
who was very, very stupid and was talking, very harshly.

97
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:41,925
And I saw his Ekadesha Rudra "My God" I said,

98
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:46,758
"This one is now going to be in trouble. "

99
00:11:47,175 --> 00:11:52,425
What is Ekadesha is nothing but the eleven powers of Shiva.

100
00:11:52,508 --> 00:11:55,800
They build up here

101
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,967
and give you all kinds of diseases;

102
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:02,300
the worst of all is cancer.

103
00:12:02,341 --> 00:12:07,175
And I knew that this fellow is going to have a very bad time.

104
00:12:07,591 --> 00:12:11,466
He is not a Sahaja Yogi, how am I to tell him?

105
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:13,508
How anybody has to tell him?

106
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:18,341
But it comes from this Ekadesha Rudra.

107
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,925
Now these are eleven powers of Shiva, very well described.

108
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,466
Now these powers start working on people,

109
00:12:28,508 --> 00:12:30,508
even on Sahaja Yogis,

110
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,175
if they do not follow the principle of Sahaja Yoga.

111
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:41,466
He is, I should say, watching everything.

112
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:45,591
Every part of your life He watches.

113
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:52,633
How you behave, what you do, what is your dharma

114
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:54,925
- He watches all that.

115
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,300
And so many saints have warned you,

116
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:02,633
so many incarnations have warned you;

117
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:06,758
but I tell you if don't listen to them,

118
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:10,508
then Shiva is not going to listen.

119
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:13,175
He doesn't listen to anyone.

120
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:17,175
If he's angry, he's angry.

121
00:13:17,591 --> 00:13:21,675
Whatever it is, very difficult to convince Him

122
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:27,217
that 'Please spare this person, it's alright. Forgive.

123
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,425
' But his basic quality is forgiveness,

124
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,800
can you imagine. His basic quality is forgiveness.

125
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:41,175
But if He doesn't forgive, then you are finished.

126
00:13:43,175 --> 00:13:47,675
Up to a point maybe He might forgive, but after that..

127
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:52,466
It's a very, very difficult situation.

128
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:57,466
And I find that people don't realise

129
00:13:57,508 --> 00:14:00,092
what Shiva is.

130
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:05,009
In the south we have two types of people worshipers.

131
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:07,800
One are shaivaites, another vaishnavaites.

132
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:11,508
They are having a big fight between them.

133
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,675
Now it is less, much less.

134
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:19,967
What is the work of Vishnu is to give you realisation,

135
00:14:20,341 --> 00:14:24,092
emancipation of human beings, evolution of human beings.

136
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:33,591
But if you fail in your goodness, in your dharma,

137
00:14:33,675 --> 00:14:39,259
then Shiva comes in your life.

138
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:42,967
We have to understand

139
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:46,967
that we are all surrounded by their powers,

140
00:14:47,341 --> 00:14:50,092
we are all made by their powers,

141
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:55,466
is the Shakti who is protecting you.

142
00:14:55,591 --> 00:15:02,092
But to an extent. She cannot go above Shiva,

143
00:15:04,508 --> 00:15:06,675
She cannot cross Him.

144
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:15,092
These days you find so many people indulging into politics

145
00:15:15,508 --> 00:15:17,675
- it's all money-making propositions.

146
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:23,591
They all try to make money, it's not politics!

147
00:15:23,675 --> 00:15:28,675
They don't do any good to the whole communities, nowhere

148
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:33,341
- either under fear or under abandonment.

149
00:15:33,425 --> 00:15:40,675
They behave in such a manner that they are not afraid of God,

150
00:15:41,092 --> 00:15:47,675
they are not afraid of His own attention on them.

151
00:15:49,092 --> 00:15:53,591
Perhaps they don't know that they are under the attention of Shiva.

152
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:57,466
He's watching each and every person,

153
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:04,134
whether you are Australian, English or Indian.

154
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:11,591
Whatever religion you may follow, He's watching them.

155
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:15,466
This is a thing one has to understand.

156
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,842
And once you understand this,

157
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:25,508
you will accept that you have to be good and dharmic people.

158
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:28,466
You have to be good character people.

159
00:16:29,842 --> 00:16:33,134
Why people talk of good character?

160
00:16:33,508 --> 00:16:35,466
Try to understand!

161
00:16:35,842 --> 00:16:39,842
It's stupidity these days when people don't believe in it.

162
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:44,259
People are doing all kinds of things,

163
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:54,425
they are drinking, they are playing the money business.

164
00:16:54,842 --> 00:16:56,967
All kinds of things they are doing

165
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:06,259
without having any fear of the wrath of God.

166
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:09,466
And that wrath comes from Shiva.

167
00:17:10,842 --> 00:17:12,466
I would like to warn you all,

168
00:17:12,842 --> 00:17:15,758
though you are all my children - be careful!

169
00:17:17,134 --> 00:17:19,591
Try to weigh every step that you take.

170
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:24,341
Of course I am there to support you, to help you,

171
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,466
to protect you.

172
00:17:25,842 --> 00:17:29,009
But, not beyond Shiva,

173
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,009
I can't go beyond Him.

174
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:42,259
It's such a power of Shiva, it's such an authority of Shiva.

175
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:47,758
And to worship Him means to worship goodness.

176
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:55,425
The goodness could be compassion, could be love,

177
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:58,259
could be forgiveness, anything.

178
00:17:58,341 --> 00:18:00,466
He likes only good people,

179
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:03,466
and He will protect only good people.

180
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:08,633
For example, some people are very power oriented,

181
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:13,508
some are money oriented and some are power oriented.

182
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:17,842
And the power oriented also do it for money sometimes,

183
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,842
that's the aim.

184
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,134
They'll not stay in Sahaj.

185
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:26,134
They will be displaced.

186
00:18:26,508 --> 00:18:28,341
They do it, and then come and ask for forgiveness,

187
00:18:28,758 --> 00:18:31,633
"Oh Mother forgive us, we have done it".

188
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:35,466
But try not to do anything of that kind.

189
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:41,466
I, of course, forgive you, but Shiva, He won't, He won't.

190
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:45,425
He will take you to task

191
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:46,675
and then you will come to Me "Mother,

192
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:49,341
You must save us!" It's very difficult.

193
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:53,425
From His clutches it is very difficult.

194
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,758
Also He's a very forgiving person.

195
00:18:57,134 --> 00:19:00,425
He forgives you, many things.

196
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:03,633
Because of Me also He forgives.

197
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:07,134
But, after some time when He takes over,

198
00:19:08,425 --> 00:19:11,758
there's no appeal, there's no safety.

199
00:19:12,175 --> 00:19:14,758
I do not want to frighten you,

200
00:19:15,175 --> 00:19:18,508
but I want to tell you the truth, it is the truth.

201
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:22,175
You have to try to be good people.

202
00:19:23,591 --> 00:19:29,341
You have to try to be really good character people.

203
00:19:29,758 --> 00:19:33,633
I am told some people who are in Sahaja Yoga

204
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:39,633
indulge in money laundering and all that.

205
00:19:40,425 --> 00:19:43,341
Also some of them have very bad characters,

206
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,758
they run after girls

207
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:50,591
and they try to look at the girls and all sorts of things.

208
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:55,508
Now this has ruined the west especially.

209
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:59,300
Also our Indians are learning from it.

210
00:20:01,341 --> 00:20:05,300
As it is, we have to respect ourselves.

211
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:11,633
If we don't respect ourselves, and we try to misbehave,

212
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:20,009
I can only help you with your Kundalini.

213
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,300
But if you go too much beyond it,

214
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,800
Ekadesha Rudra will catch, no doubt.

215
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:37,466
It's a very big barrier on your forehead.

216
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:47,425
Eka-desha Rudra, and it is so effective nowadays, so much active.

217
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,217
All kinds of diseases which are coming out, is all incurable,

218
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,633
are because of Ekadesha.

219
00:20:57,092 --> 00:21:04,300
And also those who are suffering from possessions.

220
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,925
The other day I met somebody who was very much caught-up.

221
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,508
And the Ekadesha was working.

222
00:21:15,925 --> 00:21:21,383
I found out that he is very fanatically

223
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:26,300
influenced by something.

224
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,591
I don't want to name it,

225
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:36,925
but these, we have found out, are not correct things.

226
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:40,383
In every religion we have

227
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:44,675
people who are spreading nonsensical ideas.

228
00:21:45,092 --> 00:21:48,591
Now if you don't have discretion about it,

229
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:50,508
nobody can help you.

230
00:21:50,925 --> 00:21:53,508
You should have a full discretion

231
00:21:53,925 --> 00:21:59,591
as to what is right and what is wrong.

232
00:22:02,675 --> 00:22:06,092
Then Shiva is with you.

233
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:08,883
But if you indulge

234
00:22:09,175 --> 00:22:16,466
into all such nonsensical things, it is self-destructive, I must say

235
00:22:16,508 --> 00:22:21,800
But to the Self which is destructive is the power of Shiva.

236
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:27,800
What we call the Self here, is the power of Shiva.

237
00:22:30,175 --> 00:22:33,800
He destroys by many ways, by many ways.

238
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:38,675
You can lose your reputation,

239
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:41,675
you can lose your health,

240
00:22:43,092 --> 00:22:46,092
you can lose your wealth,

241
00:22:47,508 --> 00:22:49,466
everything can happen to you

242
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:53,591
till you are completely finished and..?..

243
00:22:58,466 --> 00:23:01,175
I have known people on the death-bed also,

244
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:04,466
start talking about money,

245
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,550
'What should she get, money, how will he get money,

246
00:23:07,883 --> 00:23:08,967
and this and that'.

247
00:23:10,341 --> 00:23:12,383
Instead of talking about God

248
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:16,175
or Self Realisation, they are talking like this.

249
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:20,425
It's such a noble thing.

250
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:26,800
But if you see Shiva, He doesn't possess anything,

251
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:29,092
He doesn't want anything.

252
00:23:31,466 --> 00:23:33,341
Whatever you give to him,

253
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:36,092
as a samarpana or anything,

254
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:43,967
that He doesn't accept, and He passes on to the Shakti,

255
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:46,341
"You do whatever you want to do. "

256
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:51,259
She's the one who is working out everything

257
00:23:51,591 --> 00:23:57,675
to benefit you to make you happy. He's not bothered.

258
00:23:58,092 --> 00:24:02,092
In this case, you have to please Shiva!

259
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:04,967
He will not try to please you,

260
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:08,341
you have to go all the way to please Him.

261
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:13,092
It is a very difficult personality of Shiva.

262
00:24:15,508 --> 00:24:20,675
In the Koran, it is not written separately

263
00:24:20,883 --> 00:24:27,591
for Allah or for Shiva, it is not differentiated.

264
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,508
Because the people with whom He had to deal

265
00:24:31,842 --> 00:24:34,508
were all uneducated, stupid people.

266
00:24:34,591 --> 00:24:37,259
So He didn't give all the details that

267
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,466
God is in different forms.

268
00:24:40,842 --> 00:24:43,466
So there is only one Allah they know.

269
00:24:43,842 --> 00:24:47,508
But they don't do anything that

270
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:52,259
shows the differentiations of their jobs and work.

271
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,259
It is the Shakti who loves, I agree.

272
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:03,134
But She too, can get angry very much.

273
00:25:05,508 --> 00:25:08,466
And once She gets angry, there is no end to it!

274
00:25:11,842 --> 00:25:14,675
Now I have to tell you, as Sahaja Yogis,

275
00:25:15,134 --> 00:25:19,591
that you develop you qualities to please the Shiva.

276
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:30,259
It's too much of hankering, too much of 'wants'.

277
00:25:32,591 --> 00:25:36,466
All this is not necessary.

278
00:25:36,842 --> 00:25:41,134
Of course I want you to live well, and beautifully,

279
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,758
not stupidly - to go into jungles

280
00:25:45,134 --> 00:25:48,259
or to behave like hippies - that's not the point.

281
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,134
The point is,

282
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:59,134
from your heart, the attachment to things must go away.

283
00:25:59,508 --> 00:26:03,967
A person who is a Shiva Bhakti

284
00:26:07,425 --> 00:26:10,134
- he doesn't care for money, he doesn't know about money.

285
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:16,425
He is a very generous person, extremely. He's just generous.

286
00:26:16,466 --> 00:26:21,508
People say he is stupid the way he goes on, the way he goes on.

287
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:24,758
But I don't think so.

288
00:26:25,134 --> 00:26:33,466
That's not at all the description.

289
00:26:37,591 --> 00:26:40,259
The description of a man

290
00:26:40,591 --> 00:26:47,591
who is a bhakta of Shiva has no interest in money,

291
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:50,009
is very generous.

292
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:54,466
Anything you ask from that, he'll give.

293
00:26:54,842 --> 00:26:57,300
Mahavira's was like that.

294
00:26:57,341 --> 00:27:03,508
Mahavira had gone for his meditation in his own garden

295
00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:12,009
and Vishnu as Shri Krishna

296
00:27:12,425 --> 00:27:13,842
came and told him that,

297
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,134
"See, I have no clothes.

298
00:27:16,508 --> 00:27:21,134
You have got this cloth, why don't you give me half of it?"

299
00:27:21,508 --> 00:27:28,425
He said, "All right, you can have it. You can have the whole. "

300
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:35,633
Because he said this, "My house is here, I'll just wear my clothes"

301
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:38,134
What he did was not

302
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:43,425
to show that nudity is a very great thing.

303
00:27:43,466 --> 00:27:45,925
But if you see the Jains, what to do,

304
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:54,425
they make big, big statues of Mahavira

305
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:57,425
showing Him completely nude.

306
00:27:57,466 --> 00:28:00,591
I mean, this is the perversion of human mind.

307
00:28:01,633 --> 00:28:03,591
Why He did it, we should know.

308
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:06,758
He was so detached, so detached, to

309
00:28:07,134 --> 00:28:10,508
give away the clothes, what is the harm?

310
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:13,425
It was not to show-off or anything.

311
00:28:13,508 --> 00:28:19,175
But the generosity, people don't understand.

312
00:28:19,591 --> 00:28:22,925
And the Jainies are the least generous!

313
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:32,341
So the quality of all these great incarnations is also not understood.

314
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:40,925
Because a kind of an illusion is there.

315
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:48,341
For example, Shiva is always with very few clothes, very few.

316
00:28:50,758 --> 00:28:54,925
And what does he eat? No-one knows.

317
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:01,175
What is his desires and what does he want? No-one knows.

318
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:07,425
A person with a great knowledge of music will sing before him,

319
00:29:07,508 --> 00:29:08,591
He's alright.

320
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:12,341
Or even any madcap comes and sings, He's alright.

321
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,341
For Him it doesn't matter,

322
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:23,341
He's not meticulous about how the music is and what the notes are,

323
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,925
whether it is alright or not, no.

324
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,591
He is beyond all these things.

325
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:34,175
He is beyond all these formalities that we have about everything,

326
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:37,425
he is beyond.

327
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:43,092
He is spirituality itself, he is beyond all these things.

328
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:48,758
Whether you are a musician or you are an artist,

329
00:29:49,092 --> 00:29:54,092
whatever it is you are, He'll enjoy.

330
00:29:54,466 --> 00:29:58,508
He's the enjoyer, and He'll enjoy -

331
00:29:58,925 --> 00:30:04,925
whatever is simple, whatever is given with the heart, He'll enjoy.

332
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,300
Whatever is expressed with the heart, He'll enjoy.

333
00:30:08,425 --> 00:30:12,633
He is not a conditioned person,

334
00:30:13,092 --> 00:30:17,508
that it should be modern, it should be such and such.

335
00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:19,466
He is not conditioned.

336
00:30:19,508 --> 00:30:24,466
He doesn't think that way like human beings who will sit down

337
00:30:24,508 --> 00:30:29,675
and make a meticulous everything, does it fit into it or not.

338
00:30:30,092 --> 00:30:33,591
Even, even for art,

339
00:30:33,675 --> 00:30:39,466
even for anything that is created out of somebody's heart,

340
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:42,925
they will try to discourage that person.

341
00:30:44,341 --> 00:30:48,675
I have seen people, they have such conditioning.

342
00:30:49,092 --> 00:30:52,466
And one thing about Shiva, he has no

343
00:30:52,508 --> 00:30:56,092
conditioning of anything, nothing.

344
00:30:56,675 --> 00:30:59,591
That's why they call him a mast-maulaa

345
00:30:59,675 --> 00:31:02,508
- He is not at all conditioned.

346
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:05,508
If you have any conditioning in your mind,

347
00:31:05,717 --> 00:31:07,508
then you are not a Shivabhakta.

348
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:11,092
It's all right, you should dress up well, you should do this ...

349
00:31:11,466 --> 00:31:15,092
but you should not have conditioning that 'If you don't do that

350
00:31:15,466 --> 00:31:23,508
you are being out of cast, out of fashion, out of this ...'.

351
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:29,967
It is very difficult for people not to accept.

352
00:31:31,341 --> 00:31:34,675
All kinds of fashions are coming nowadays, all kinds.

353
00:31:35,092 --> 00:31:38,591
I tell them, "What is this?" "Oh this is the fashion. "

354
00:31:38,675 --> 00:31:41,800
Is it some God behind this fashion,

355
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:45,425
or is there some deity who is telling you these fashions?

356
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,259
Today it comes, tomorrow it will disappear.

357
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:51,341
So, what I am saying,

358
00:31:51,425 --> 00:31:55,591
that if you have to worship Shiva,

359
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:58,591
you should de-condition yourself.

360
00:31:59,341 --> 00:32:02,425
You are living in the world of Sahasrara.

361
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:07,591
Now, somebody is not properly dressed - finished!

362
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:11,259
Somebody is over-popularly dressed - finished!

363
00:32:11,425 --> 00:32:16,259
Human beings have a capacity to criticise everyone.

364
00:32:17,591 --> 00:32:21,842
And to criticise everyone, this is nothing fundamental

365
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:25,675
because if you do it on vibrations, one can understand.

366
00:32:26,092 --> 00:32:28,259
But not on vibrations, just

367
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,675
because 'this is not the fashion, that is not the fashion'.

368
00:32:35,092 --> 00:32:38,591
What is the fashion of Shiva, tell me.

369
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:41,092
Has He any fashions?

370
00:32:42,508 --> 00:32:44,842
Anything you give Him, He's happy.

371
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:47,842
Whatever you give Him, He eats that.

372
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:56,842
He is full of such appreciation because He is personified as Joy.

373
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:00,300
He is peace and He is joy.

374
00:33:00,675 --> 00:33:04,341
If you are worshippers of Shiva,

375
00:33:04,466 --> 00:33:10,842
then you should not have any conditioning of any kind.

376
00:33:13,675 --> 00:33:17,842
I mean, normally I also wear simple saris, very simple.

377
00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:22,967
And it happens that people think I am a very poor woman.

378
00:33:23,341 --> 00:33:24,967
I am poor

379
00:33:26,425 --> 00:33:31,466
because I don't care for money, I don't bother.

380
00:33:31,842 --> 00:33:41,466
So, we should know that Shiva is the poorest man, purest God.

381
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:47,425
He doesn't wear any alankaras, he doesn't wear anything, just

382
00:33:48,466 --> 00:33:51,466
he lives with his own body.

383
00:33:51,842 --> 00:33:58,300
Because he is nothing but embodiment of enjoyment,

384
00:33:58,758 --> 00:34:07,134
nothing but complete form of enjoyment and joy.

385
00:34:08,508 --> 00:34:13,134
So another quality of Shivabhakta* should be joy.

386
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:18,134
You should be joyous about everything

387
00:34:18,508 --> 00:34:23,259
- whatever you see, whatever type of person you see.

388
00:34:23,466 --> 00:34:25,591
So the only way you can do, is

389
00:34:26,009 --> 00:34:29,842
give up human quality of criticism

390
00:34:32,758 --> 00:34:35,009
- to criticise others.

391
00:34:35,425 --> 00:34:38,591
Like if the English go into the Indian house,

392
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:40,259
they say "We don't like it. "

393
00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:41,591
"Yes, what, what you don't like?"

394
00:34:42,009 --> 00:34:44,591
"We didn't like the carpet. "

395
00:34:45,009 --> 00:34:50,842
'I don't like it' itself is against your Shakti.

396
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,300
Then, if supposing an American goes to an English home,

397
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:58,425
he'll say, "I don't like it. " It's very common.

398
00:34:58,466 --> 00:35:02,009
All the people say "I don't like it", "I didn't like that".

399
00:35:02,425 --> 00:35:04,134
Who are you

400
00:35:04,508 --> 00:35:07,758
to say 'I don't like it' or 'I like it'.

401
00:35:08,134 --> 00:35:12,508
People don't realise that by saying all these things,

402
00:35:12,633 --> 00:35:17,134
you are showing that you have no Shiva principle in you.

403
00:35:20,508 --> 00:35:24,341
I can understand somebody who cannot walk, alright,

404
00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:30,425
for such a person is allowed to use some sticks or something,

405
00:35:30,466 --> 00:35:32,466
allowed.

406
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:34,425
But if he says "I don't like that person

407
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,009
because he doesn't use the stick. "

408
00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:41,300
Shows that he is such an egoistical fellow.

409
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:45,341
Himself is using the stick and

410
00:35:45,675 --> 00:35:48,842
he wants to create what, warts or what,

411
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,758
in a democratic country, that people should

412
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:56,758
walk with the sticks in their hands. It is very difficult.

413
00:35:57,134 --> 00:36:00,009
In the west it is very common, you see,

414
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,341
to have this kind of a hat,

415
00:36:02,758 --> 00:36:05,591
to have this kind of a dress,

416
00:36:05,633 --> 00:36:07,508
to wear this kind of a chiroot.

417
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,425
All kinds of things have a conditioning.

418
00:36:12,508 --> 00:36:17,925
Nowadays the hairstyle has become very funny with women.

419
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,591
Because they don't put oil in their hair.

420
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:28,508
They will not have any grease in their hair.

421
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:32,300
If somebody's going to meet them they will wash their hair.

422
00:36:33,341 --> 00:36:35,591
I don't think it looks very nice.

423
00:36:35,633 --> 00:36:36,925
Of course I don't say that

424
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:42,175
you need not have so much of oil on your face and ears.

425
00:36:42,591 --> 00:36:45,633
But, what is so important?

426
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:57,508
In life, also there is another thing that we are very self-centred.

427
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:01,300
We want to impress people.

428
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:09,591
If I wear a dress or anything, it should impress.

429
00:37:10,633 --> 00:37:14,300
I mean, even it impresses - so what?

430
00:37:15,341 --> 00:37:19,341
If a snake comes along, he will bit you, whatever dress

431
00:37:20,175 --> 00:37:23,800
you might be wearing, whatever country you might be from.

432
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:31,925
All this kind of identification, it doesn't behove a Shivabhakta.

433
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,925
A Shivabhakta has to be just

434
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,925
absolutely lost in the raptures of joy.

435
00:37:44,092 --> 00:37:49,508
Very particular about hairdress, very particular about dresses

436
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:52,466
- I don't know what they are particular about.

437
00:37:52,508 --> 00:37:56,508
With all that, what do they gain? Nothing.

438
00:37:57,925 --> 00:37:59,967
Do they become popular?

439
00:38:00,758 --> 00:38:03,259
And this kind of popularity,

440
00:38:03,591 --> 00:38:07,092
which is so skin-deep, what's the use?

441
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:13,092
You must have respect, respect of your being.

442
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:19,341
As not only human beings, but as Sahaja Yogis.

443
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:22,466
You are Sahaja Yogis.

444
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:28,175
We are Shiva's bhaktas, we don't care.

445
00:38:29,591 --> 00:38:31,175
We are not bothered.

446
00:38:32,508 --> 00:38:37,425
Whatever it is, Shiva is there within us

447
00:38:37,675 --> 00:38:47,508
and we shine with that power within us that is of Kundalini.

448
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:52,425
You may be very well dressed, you may be anything.

449
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,092
If your vibrations are bad, what's the use?

450
00:38:56,466 --> 00:38:58,259
If you cannot judge people

451
00:38:58,591 --> 00:39:01,259
by their vibrations,by nonsensical things

452
00:39:01,591 --> 00:39:06,883
like dress and moustaches, is it of any value?

453
00:39:07,175 --> 00:39:12,508
In Sahaja Yoga your value system has to be Sahaj.

454
00:39:14,967 --> 00:39:17,175
I have seen many people,

455
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:20,466
"I don't like their house, I didn't like this ..."

456
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:26,175
'I don't like' is the sentence, is nishidda,

457
00:39:26,591 --> 00:39:29,967
is to be given up by Sahaja Yogis.

458
00:39:33,341 --> 00:39:35,675
If you don't like anything, you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

459
00:39:39,591 --> 00:39:45,800
Now, of course if there is somebody who is anti-Sahaj and all that,

460
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:50,675
but still by saying 'I don't like', what are you going to gain?

461
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:54,466
It's a waste of energy.

462
00:39:58,591 --> 00:40:03,591
Because of this, in Sahaja Yoga I have seen,

463
00:40:03,675 --> 00:40:07,800
people have created problems for Me, so many problems.

464
00:40:08,259 --> 00:40:12,675
Only because they are such much 'self' oriented.

465
00:40:15,092 --> 00:40:19,092
"This man is bad, that woman is bad, he is this, that ..."

466
00:40:19,466 --> 00:40:20,800
Sometimes I am surprised.

467
00:40:21,092 --> 00:40:24,092
Because when those people come to me,

468
00:40:24,425 --> 00:40:27,675
I am amazed that they are very nice people.

469
00:40:29,092 --> 00:40:32,591
But people are very self-centred, also.

470
00:40:32,883 --> 00:40:37,675
Like I have seen people who are not bothered

471
00:40:38,092 --> 00:40:44,967
to come to meetings, to pujas.

472
00:40:46,341 --> 00:40:48,508
Because they have got work.

473
00:40:50,591 --> 00:40:56,591
Altogether there are eleven pujas, but they don't come.

474
00:40:58,967 --> 00:41:01,591
Because they are very busy.

475
00:41:02,967 --> 00:41:05,259
At least to one puja you should come.

476
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:14,967
But those who are Shivabhaktas only enjoy nothing but pujas.

477
00:41:15,508 --> 00:41:17,508
Nothing else

478
00:41:18,591 --> 00:41:24,842
Their whole being is absolutely vibrated by Shiva bhakti.

479
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:27,967
To them, that's the most important thing to do.

480
00:41:29,341 --> 00:41:32,259
Also there are people in Sahaja Yoga

481
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,591
who are trying to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

482
00:41:35,967 --> 00:41:39,466
Very wrong, very wrong, very wrong.

483
00:41:40,842 --> 00:41:45,259
Sahaja Yoga is to give you punyas,

484
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,675
to give you blessings,

485
00:41:48,134 --> 00:41:51,300
and if that is not in your mind,

486
00:41:51,758 --> 00:41:52,675
better give up Sahaja Yoga.

487
00:41:52,925 --> 00:41:56,259
You can join some business or something

488
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,134
of malpractices very easily, very easily.

489
00:41:59,508 --> 00:42:01,758
Till you end up in the jail you are there.

490
00:42:05,134 --> 00:42:10,591
But to enjoy your spiritual powers

491
00:42:10,967 --> 00:42:13,591
you must learn certain things.

492
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:17,466
And one of them is de-condition yourself

493
00:42:17,842 --> 00:42:21,466
- 'I don't like it' or 'I like it' -

494
00:42:21,758 --> 00:42:26,009
this sentence must go away from your tongue!

495
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,425
Likes and dislikes

496
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:35,425
are only for people who have limited vision.

497
00:42:38,466 --> 00:42:41,758
You should learn to appreciate.

498
00:42:42,134 --> 00:42:44,466
Your power of appreciation will show

499
00:42:44,842 --> 00:42:47,883
how spiritually you are endowed.

500
00:42:51,259 --> 00:42:56,758
And your power of observation

501
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,259
will show what do you observe.

502
00:43:00,341 --> 00:43:03,134
For example, some people will come and tell me,

503
00:43:03,341 --> 00:43:07,758
"I didn't like that lady, she was wearing a funny sari. "

504
00:43:09,134 --> 00:43:10,758
I mean, what is this?

505
00:43:13,134 --> 00:43:18,341
"I didn't like her, because she was putting her hand on her head".

506
00:43:18,758 --> 00:43:20,633
So what?

507
00:43:22,009 --> 00:43:24,842
Because you make your own images of people, and you want

508
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,300
everybody to be like that, otherwise you don't like it.

509
00:43:29,758 --> 00:43:33,425
Whether you like it or don't like it, nobody's going to change.

510
00:43:34,466 --> 00:43:36,758
Why waste your energy?

511
00:43:38,508 --> 00:43:41,842
Sometimes there are musicians who are not so good.

512
00:43:48,758 --> 00:43:56,925
I remember, once I went home and I asked my father,

513
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,341
"How does this musician sing?"

514
00:43:59,758 --> 00:44:03,591
He says, "He's very courageous, very courageous. "

515
00:44:03,633 --> 00:44:05,591
I said, "Why, what happened?"

516
00:44:05,842 --> 00:44:10,425
He said, "He sings without bothering about it

517
00:44:10,466 --> 00:44:12,883
and he goes out of tune sometimes,

518
00:44:13,092 --> 00:44:15,300
he goes out of taala, doesn't matter,

519
00:44:15,341 --> 00:44:16,633
but he sings.

520
00:44:17,009 --> 00:44:18,758
He's very courageous, himmatwala"

521
00:44:19,134 --> 00:44:23,300
So, that's how he used to appreciate, I have seen.

522
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:28,633
When this fellow started singing, I saw he was like that,

523
00:44:29,009 --> 00:44:34,009
but my father was saying "Wa-wa, wa-wa" and encouraging him.

524
00:44:34,425 --> 00:44:38,341
You see, I have seen in my father these divine qualities,

525
00:44:38,758 --> 00:44:41,633
how he used to tolerate,

526
00:44:42,009 --> 00:44:46,175
how he used to - I mean not tolerance also, just appreciation.

527
00:44:46,591 --> 00:44:50,009
Of any kind of thing he used to appreciate.

528
00:44:50,175 --> 00:44:53,217
That's what, if the Sahaja Yogis have that

529
00:44:53,508 --> 00:44:58,508
condition of appreciation they will enjoy everything.

530
00:44:58,717 --> 00:45:01,925
Because you kill your enjoyment, do you know that?

531
00:45:04,341 --> 00:45:07,925
You are all variety of people here, all variety of dresses,

532
00:45:08,092 --> 00:45:12,800
all variety of families and so many countries you are here.

533
00:45:13,175 --> 00:45:16,591
To Me you are nothing but Sahaja Yogis, my children, that's all.

534
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:22,092
Now I don't go on judging you on your dress, or

535
00:45:22,259 --> 00:45:25,175
on what your hairstyle is, no.

536
00:45:26,633 --> 00:45:29,800
All modern things are extremely conditioning.

537
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:37,800
And they condition you so much that you get irresponsible.

538
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,341
As Sahaja Yogis you get irresponsible.

539
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:46,591
Your first and foremost responsibility is Sahaja Yoga.

540
00:45:46,633 --> 00:45:49,508
Because you should know what a work it is.

541
00:45:50,925 --> 00:45:57,425
It is such a great work, to transform the whole world - that is My vision.

542
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,092
And this old age I think the same.

543
00:46:01,466 --> 00:46:05,800
Now, if that is My vision, what should be your attitude?

544
00:46:06,175 --> 00:46:10,425
That we should go all out to spread Sahaja Yoga.

545
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,508
That's the main thing.

546
00:46:12,925 --> 00:46:20,092
I call you for these pujas just to renovate, I should say,

547
00:46:20,466 --> 00:46:23,800
to give you more of energy and all that.

548
00:46:24,175 --> 00:46:27,009
But if you are just taking it as a great

549
00:46:27,259 --> 00:46:30,259
blessings and sitting at home it's of no use.

550
00:46:31,425 --> 00:46:33,341
You must spread Sahaja Yoga!

551
00:46:33,425 --> 00:46:36,591
I was surprised that they said

552
00:46:36,883 --> 00:46:43,092
in Lucknow there are only 200 Sahaja Yogis. How can that be?

553
00:46:43,591 --> 00:46:45,591
First time I went to Lucknow,

554
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,175
there were at least three thousand Sahaja Yogis

555
00:46:48,591 --> 00:46:51,675
and we had not fixed any hall or anything.

556
00:46:52,092 --> 00:46:56,175
And can you imagine, suddenly I find so many people.

557
00:46:57,591 --> 00:47:00,466
How is it there can be two hundred Sahaja Yogis?

558
00:47:00,508 --> 00:47:05,675
Either you are telling lies, or you are good for nothing.

559
00:47:07,092 --> 00:47:10,092
So the responsibility of all the Sahaja Yogis,

560
00:47:10,341 --> 00:47:15,425
of all the Sahaja Yogis, first and foremost,

561
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,591
is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

562
00:47:18,675 --> 00:47:20,800
How many people have you given realisation?

563
00:47:22,175 --> 00:47:24,425
Where have you talked about Sahaja Yoga?

564
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,175
I have seen even in the plane, if you are travelling,

565
00:47:28,466 --> 00:47:33,217
anyone who is there will tell Me "My guru is this,

566
00:47:33,508 --> 00:47:36,175
you know, such a great guru, this that. "

567
00:47:36,591 --> 00:47:39,967
Openly, shamelessly, about horrible gurus!

568
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:47,466
While you people are very shy to talk about Sahaja Yoga.

569
00:47:48,591 --> 00:47:51,675
Never publicly unless and until

570
00:47:52,092 --> 00:47:56,466
you have a programme, and public programme and all that.

571
00:47:58,591 --> 00:48:03,466
You have no time, also, for Sahaja Yoga, very busy people.

572
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:15,217
So, if you have to follow Shiva and His blessings all the time,

573
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:16,967
His protection to you...

574
00:48:17,259 --> 00:48:24,675
then you have to be Sahaja Yogis of very high quality.

575
00:48:27,092 --> 00:48:30,092
It shows when you go all out

576
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:32,425
to spread Sahaja Yoga.

577
00:48:35,341 --> 00:48:37,675
That is the thing missing.

578
00:48:38,092 --> 00:48:40,967
I am very happy that in Australia

579
00:48:41,341 --> 00:48:43,675
Sahaja Yoga has spread so much.

580
00:48:44,092 --> 00:48:47,425
I don't know what has happened.

581
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:51,341
In a far fetched place like Australia.

582
00:48:52,259 --> 00:48:55,508
In the beginning I had some set-backs

583
00:48:55,591 --> 00:49:00,383
but now it has spread. Also in Austria it has spread.

584
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:03,259
And also in Italy.

585
00:49:05,341 --> 00:49:10,341
But otherwise, just doesn't spread. What's the matter?

586
00:49:10,466 --> 00:49:14,300
The matter is the leaders are not going all-out.

587
00:49:14,675 --> 00:49:18,591
Say, for in England I travelled from north to south,

588
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:21,508
east to west in all the directions.

589
00:49:24,259 --> 00:49:29,675
We have very poor, very poor Sahaja Yogis there.

590
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:35,259
You have to go to universities, to younger people.

591
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:42,300
If hippy-ism can spread, why not Sahaja Yoga?

592
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:49,842
It spread like wild-fire, why not Sahaja Yoga?

593
00:49:50,259 --> 00:49:56,842
All these things are there, which I have to warn you - be careful!

594
00:49:58,259 --> 00:50:01,967
If you have got Realisation, you have a responsibility

595
00:50:02,425 --> 00:50:07,508
- to give realisation to others, and to spread Sahaja Yoga.

596
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:14,466
If you can't do it, then God save you.

597
00:50:14,842 --> 00:50:16,259
I have nothing to say.

598
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,300
You have to introspect,

599
00:50:20,758 --> 00:50:22,758
'What have I done for Sahaja Yoga.

600
00:50:24,134 --> 00:50:25,758
What have I got from Sahaja Yoga?'

601
00:50:28,134 --> 00:50:31,967
And I am sure after this Shiva puja,

602
00:50:32,217 --> 00:50:36,842
you will dedicate yourself to Shiva principle within you.

603
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:41,134
Shiva principle doesn't 'stir out',

604
00:50:41,508 --> 00:50:50,259
it's very, very stern, it's very powerful.

605
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:58,758
You have to dedicate, and you have to surrender.

606
00:50:59,134 --> 00:51:05,466
Above every other job, above every other performance,

607
00:51:05,842 --> 00:51:07,758
the highest is this.

608
00:51:08,134 --> 00:51:16,009
So, with this, I ask Shiva to give you blessings,

609
00:51:16,425 --> 00:51:18,341
complete blessings,

610
00:51:18,758 --> 00:51:24,633
so that you get transformed into the personality of Shiva.

611
00:51:25,009 --> 00:51:25,633
May God bless you all
