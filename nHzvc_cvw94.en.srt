1
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:20,175
Interviewer: Is this your first visit here?

2
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:21,525
Shri Mataji: Oh no.

3
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:22,525
Interviewer: No?

4
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:24,114
How many times have you been here before?

5
00:02:24,114 --> 00:02:25,114
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

6
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:26,945
Interviewer: How many times have you been
here?

7
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:30,415
Shri Mataji: I haven’t counted.

8
00:02:30,415 --> 00:02:33,515
Must be how many times?

9
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:35,495
From 1974.

10
00:02:35,495 --> 00:02:37,485
Interviewer: Right.

11
00:02:37,485 --> 00:02:42,454
Shri Mataji: Practically every year.

12
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:46,675
Sometimes I missed one or twice.

13
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:57,155
Interviewer: And what is the main emphasis
in your teaching?

14
00:02:57,155 --> 00:03:17,445
Shri Mataji: To convey that within us lies
a power which we call as Kundalini in the

15
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:29,844
triangular bone and when awakened, it passes
through six subtle centres through our spinal

16
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:40,325
chord, our brain, ultimately into limbic area
and pierces through the fontanel bone area

17
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:43,575
which was the soft bone in our childhood.

18
00:03:43,575 --> 00:03:52,204
This is the actualization of baptism, actualization.

19
00:03:52,204 --> 00:04:01,674
And this power within us is the reflection
of the Holy Ghost.

20
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:06,395
Thus you get your second birth, that’s how
you are twice born.

21
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:08,204
Interviewer: Oh I see.

22
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:10,465
Shri Mataji: Yes, born again.

23
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:11,914
Interviewer: And everyone has this?

24
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:12,914
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

25
00:04:12,914 --> 00:04:13,914
Interviewer: Everyone has this?

26
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:14,914
Shri Mataji: Everyone everyone has.

27
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:16,555
Interviewer: And how do people find it?

28
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:19,825
Shri Mataji: I knew about it since my birth
I think.

29
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:22,084
Interviewer: And what about the people you
teach?

30
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:23,084
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

31
00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:26,545
Interviewer: The people you teach, how can
they find this power?

32
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:36,575
Shri Mataji: (Unclear) They feel themselves,
the cool breeze on top of their heads.

33
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:42,145
And they feel they are connected with this
power because they can feel it on their fingertips,

34
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:48,685
also this power.

35
00:04:48,685 --> 00:04:59,985
Interviewer: And the groups you speak to,
what sort of people are they?

36
00:04:59,985 --> 00:05:04,865
Shri Mataji: (Unclear) Are conditioned people.

37
00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:12,065
Or sometimes ego is there also, lot of ego.

38
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:23,945
They are not open-minded like scientists are.

39
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:34,745
And they are conditioned by different faiths
and blind faiths.

40
00:05:34,745 --> 00:05:45,405
Interviewer: I have some information here
which says you have an emphasis on the spiritual

41
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:49,025
importance of women and their role.

42
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:53,265
In what way, you know how are women important
in this way?

43
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:55,975
In establishing the balance of society.

44
00:05:55,975 --> 00:05:59,355
Shri Mataji: Because women are the potential.

45
00:05:59,355 --> 00:06:12,925
Men are the kinetic energy and women don’t
know how powerful they are within themselves

46
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:17,085
and they try to compete with men and get frustrated.

47
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:22,475
Interviewer: And how are they powerful in
this way, different from men?

48
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:29,955
Shri Mataji: Because they have forbearance,
they have lot of forbearance, they are the

49
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:40,585
preservers of society, they are the preservers
of family life and they create beautiful children.

50
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:52,735
Motherhood is a sure thing, fatherhood is
uncertain isn’t it?

51
00:06:52,735 --> 00:07:06,345
Interviewer: And so you’ve travelled the
world have you, speaking to people?

52
00:07:06,345 --> 00:07:11,135
Shri Mataji: Yes, I don’t know how many
countries, I travel.

53
00:07:11,135 --> 00:07:18,635
I’ve been to Russia, to all the Eastern
block people.

54
00:07:18,635 --> 00:07:29,795
They seem to be very much clean about it because
they are not so conditioned and in our freedom

55
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:34,075
we have lost many things which were important
to us.

56
00:07:34,075 --> 00:07:36,615
Interviewer: Such as?

57
00:07:36,615 --> 00:07:48,775
Shri Mataji: Such as chastity, innocence,
simplicity, respect.

58
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:52,845
Interviewer: And how can people get these
virtues back then?

59
00:07:52,845 --> 00:08:02,655
Shri Mataji: Once these centres are awakened
and nourished you feel physically all right,

60
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:16,595
mentally all right and your attention is filled
with the light of the Spirit and thus you’ll

61
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:30,905
see what is spirituality is within yourself
and you understand your beauty.

62
00:08:30,905 --> 00:08:35,635
And then you enjoy your virtues, you become
religious, it’s not a question of saying

63
00:08:35,635 --> 00:08:40,725
I’m this religion, that religion, you just
become religious, you become.

64
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:47,865
Like one may follow any religion but can do
any sins, they are equally the same, there’s

65
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:52,665
no difference, it’s just a brand.

66
00:08:52,665 --> 00:09:03,555
Interviewer: The recent Gulf War what sort
of effect has that had on people as a whole?

67
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:17,975
Shri Mataji: At least one thing is that fundamentalism
is a very dangerous thing.

68
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:21,865
Any religion that gets exclusive can be very
dangerous.

69
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:37,275
In Sahaja Yoga you realise that all these
prophets, incarnations, saints were born on

70
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:48,815
the same tree of life or of spirituality and
we have plucked them, saying this is mine,

71
00:09:48,815 --> 00:09:58,085
this is mine and we are fighting with those
dead flowers.

72
00:09:58,085 --> 00:10:05,425
Interviewer: So how can people be helped through
your type of teaching?

73
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:24,964
Shri Mataji: Because of this happening you
get completely integrated within yourself.

74
00:10:24,964 --> 00:10:38,404
Also all these centres which are within us
were created by these great incarnations in

75
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:51,285
the evolutionary process and they are all
lined up together.

76
00:10:51,285 --> 00:11:03,935
Thus we realise that if this Kundalini has
to pass through we have to put them into the

77
00:11:03,935 --> 00:11:07,044
same garland.

78
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:15,245
It’s a happening.

79
00:11:15,245 --> 00:11:21,055
Interviewer: And how long have you been teaching
this?

80
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,146
Shri Mataji: I started in 1970.

81
00:11:23,146 --> 00:11:30,625
Interviewer: And how long did it take you
to come to this.

82
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:39,435
Shri Mataji: No I started working out with
one lady to begin with in India.

83
00:11:39,435 --> 00:11:49,185
Then as my husband got elected to a post,
as you must have heard about, he was the Secretary

84
00:11:49,185 --> 00:11:54,075
General of the International Maritime Organisation
U.N..

85
00:11:54,075 --> 00:12:00,865
I went to London and I started with seven
hippies.

86
00:12:00,865 --> 00:12:08,825
They were hippies but very well educated professors
and lawyers and things like that but had become

87
00:12:08,825 --> 00:12:15,595
hippies just for seeking the truth.

88
00:12:15,595 --> 00:12:31,935
I had to work very hard on them but they are
the foundation of Sahaja Yoga.

89
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:42,965
And that’s how then one of them went abroad
to some other place, it started spreading.

90
00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:50,405
England is a, like a heart of the universe
because everyone comes there and they carry

91
00:12:50,405 --> 00:12:56,095
to their own country.

92
00:12:56,095 --> 00:13:03,315
Interviewer: And which countries have you
been to ..

93
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:08,735
would there be so many that you ..

94
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,495
Shri Mataji: Yes, I have been at least to
forty five countries.

95
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:16,415
Interviewer: Really?

96
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,295
Shri Mataji: Yes.

97
00:13:19,295 --> 00:13:25,595
Interviewer: When you were working with these
people how long did it take you to come to

98
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:27,035
now, to what you understand?

99
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:29,335
Shri Mataji: About what?

100
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:30,815
Interviewer: Your teachings.

101
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:32,675
How did it come together?

102
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:43,005
Shri Mataji: I see a great future, a new race
is coming up.

103
00:13:43,005 --> 00:14:01,735
They are devoid of all addictions, devoid
of all diseases, devoid of unchaste things,

104
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:09,495
devoid of things which are wrong like they
lead a very nice married life, have nice children,

105
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:12,805
absolutely angelic I would say.

106
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:27,414
I don’t have to tell them anything, they
are on their own because they have evolved.

107
00:14:27,414 --> 00:14:32,445
This is the last breakthrough of our evolution.

108
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:40,985
They are beautiful people.

109
00:14:40,985 --> 00:14:54,905
We have seventy five to eighty marriages every
year, all international, and except for one

110
00:14:54,905 --> 00:15:05,925
percent, they are all very very successful.

111
00:15:05,925 --> 00:15:12,235
Interviewer: And do you intend on continuing
to travel, how long do you think you will

112
00:15:12,235 --> 00:15:13,235
be travelling for?

113
00:15:13,235 --> 00:15:15,935
Shri Mataji: I can’t say, already I am sixty
eight years of age.

114
00:15:15,935 --> 00:15:24,555
Can’t say, as long as possible I would like
to travel because somehow they like me very

115
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:28,164
much everywhere I think.

116
00:15:28,164 --> 00:15:34,794
Interviewer: And you obviously enjoy travelling
and speaking to people about it.

117
00:15:34,794 --> 00:15:36,104
Shri Mataji: Yes.

118
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:37,905
Interviewer: Why do you enjoy doing it?

119
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:38,905
Shri Mataji: What?

120
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:41,794
Interviewer: Why do you enjoy travelling and
telling people about this?

121
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:56,775
Shri Mataji: It’s so nice to see so many
getting the meaning of their life, so many

122
00:15:56,775 --> 00:16:07,135
getting rid of their problems and man-made
nonsense that they have on their heads.

123
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:13,305
Also they are capable of giving Realizations
to others.

124
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:21,525
And also if you give vibrations to your agriculture
it improves, to animals if you give it improves.

125
00:16:21,525 --> 00:16:30,475
Also it solves ecological problems because
they become so wise.

126
00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:39,974
We have to worry about the emancipation of
human beings as a whole, as a whole because

127
00:16:39,974 --> 00:16:56,354
we are one world and they all feel they are
citizens of the universe.

128
00:16:56,354 --> 00:17:04,544
And the love they have, respect they have
for each other and the silence they enjoy

129
00:17:04,544 --> 00:17:12,284
shows that we’ll have no more wars, no more
problems and we’ll always abide in the beautiful

130
00:17:12,284 --> 00:17:17,405
realm of kingdom of God.

131
00:17:17,405 --> 00:17:22,724
It’s the greatest satisfaction anybody can.

132
00:17:22,724 --> 00:17:29,645
This cannot be given by money, power, anything.

133
00:17:29,645 --> 00:17:42,075
When I leave one country I feel very much
wrenched, as if my heart is being wrenched

134
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:47,284
because I feel that I am leaving all of them
there, but when I reach another country I

135
00:17:47,284 --> 00:17:55,595
see again beautiful flower-like faces.

136
00:17:55,595 --> 00:17:58,745
This is what all the incarnations wanted.

137
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:08,844
We have no organisation as such, I have no
secretary, nothing.

138
00:18:08,844 --> 00:18:13,325
It’s like a stateless state you can call
it.

139
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:26,375
And we have no problems, we just enjoy that’s
all.

140
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:30,475
Pure enjoyment.

141
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:37,425
Interviewer: Thank you very much for your
time, it’s been very interesting, thank

142
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:38,425
you.

143
00:18:38,425 --> 00:18:47,345
Shri Mataji: You are so intelligent I must
say, I thought you are a little girl, she’s

144
00:18:47,345 --> 00:18:48,755
very intelligent.

145
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:53,755
Yesterday I was in New Zealand talking to
the interviewer, with the gentleman interviewing,

146
00:18:53,755 --> 00:19:00,034
he felt the cool breeze in his hands immediately
and he came to my program also.

147
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:04,335
Interviewer: Thank you.

148
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:14,375
Shri Mataji: Want to take a photograph?

149
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,805
(Unclear).

150
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:30,145
Sahaja Yogi: She’s got it Shri Mataji, she’s
got it.

151
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:36,935
Shri Mataji: She’s got it.

152
00:19:36,935 --> 00:19:55,324
First time
I met (unclear) in Australia.

153
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:59,465
They cannot see subtler things, that’s the
trouble is.

154
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:03,615
And they also find it’s not so sensational.

155
00:20:03,615 --> 00:20:15,295
It’s the most sensational thing don’t
you think so?

156
00:20:15,295 --> 00:20:32,025
It’s for the betterment of the whole world,
the most sensational thing.

157
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:40,735
It’s a silent revolution, peaceful revolution
that’s coming.

158
00:20:40,735 --> 00:20:46,175
Has to come after all.

159
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:51,915
We are waiting for a shock all over.

160
00:20:51,915 --> 00:20:55,434
One thing you must see that for all such things
you cannot pay any money because you always

161
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:56,434
have these from my country or from other countries.

162
00:20:56,434 --> 00:20:57,434
…..

163
00:20:57,434 --> 00:20:58,434
(unclear).

164
00:20:58,434 --> 00:20:59,434
Don’t go near people who ask for money,
that’s the point.

165
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:01,565
You cannot pay for all these things.

166
00:21:01,565 --> 00:21:05,635
Formerly I used to pay for my travel everything,
… (unclear) I used to pay.

167
00:21:05,635 --> 00:21:08,415
But now they have said Mother we’ll look
after that, aeroplanes.

168
00:21:08,415 --> 00:21:09,855
All right (unclear) I can’t take money for
that.

169
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:10,855
It’s invaluable.

170
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:15,775
And you know Christ never took any money,
nobody took any money, now this new type of

171
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,755
people who have come are already described
in the Bible.

172
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:22,814
One should run away from that, one after another
they are coming to Australia.

173
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:29,165
Whenever I came there was this Rajneesh was
there, (unclear) was there, (unclear) was

174
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:33,705
there and people are so much attracted to
them because they think they are paying.

175
00:21:33,705 --> 00:21:35,245
Wrong idea.

176
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:36,855
And then they disappear.

177
00:21:36,855 --> 00:21:44,565
Any person who has interest in Rolls Royce
and this kind of thing, how can people (unclear).

178
00:21:44,565 --> 00:21:48,675
They don’t think about it, they don’t
think.

179
00:21:48,675 --> 00:22:03,875
It must be told very very clearly to people,
don’t pay a single pai.

180
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,805
And you must know the accounts, that’s the
point.

181
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:11,935
Now if I am here, acually I don’t know how
these people organize, it’s among themselves.

182
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:17,985
They know (unclear), they pay, they do what
they…, I mean say for example they have

183
00:22:17,985 --> 00:22:19,825
a program here they pay for the hall and they
know all that.

184
00:22:19,825 --> 00:22:23,185
I am not interested in that.

185
00:22:23,185 --> 00:22:32,915
Interviewer: Yes well thank you very much,
very interesting, thank you for your time.

186
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:33,745
Thank you.
