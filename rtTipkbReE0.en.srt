1
00:00:08,543 --> 00:00:16,637
Today is a special day, as you know;
we are worshipping the Goddess

2
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:23,619
who came on this earth
nine times before,

3
00:00:24,102 --> 00:00:27,882
to kill all the demons
and all the negativity,

4
00:00:28,087 --> 00:00:36,247
and relieve all the
bhaktas to worship.

5
00:00:37,324 --> 00:00:43,264
All Her work has already
been described.

6
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:52,699
Despite that they find
new type of devils,

7
00:00:54,252 --> 00:01:00,572
new type of negative people
have come back.

8
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:08,039
Perhaps it had to be.

9
00:01:19,964 --> 00:01:25,254
This had to be, maybe,
after all it’s Kali Yuga.

10
00:01:25,914 --> 00:01:34,309
And the drama of Kali Yuga would not be
 performed unless and until they are there.

11
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:41,357
So to complete
this drama they came.

12
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:55,336
But this time, it’s going to be
a very different type of war.

13
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,649
It’s going to be the war
of the peaceful people.

14
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:13,314
And the peaceful people are the most successful people

15
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:20,000
in every walk of life, even in the war.

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,550
It did not work out before.

17
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:28,732
They say that when
Genghis Khan came,

18
00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:37,116
he went to a very big monastery
of Buddhists near Gaya

19
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:40,331
and killed all of them.

20
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:44,061
There were about thirty
thousand of Buddhists there

21
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:49,859
and they didn’t say a word,
and they were all killed.

22
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:55,111
So people started
disbelieving in Buddhism.

23
00:02:55,674 --> 00:03:01,114
They said, “What kind of a Buddhism
is here? Why didn’t Buddha save them?”

24
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,159
That’s human style of thinking.

25
00:03:06,857 --> 00:03:12,401
"Buddha should have saved these thirty 
thousand people who were peaceful,

26
00:03:13,114 --> 00:03:21,024
who were resisting in a manner
that was no resistance,

27
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,960
and so they were all killed by this
horrible fellow called Genghis Khan."

28
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:35,178
But you’ll be surprised, in this Kali Yuga,
 this Genghis Khan has been praised by many authors.

29
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:38,387
And there are books written about him.

30
00:03:38,804 --> 00:03:43,534
He was not a Muslim but 
some sort of a crackpot.

31
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:49,554
He finished off many mosques,

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,080
he destroyed many
beautiful buildings

33
00:03:57,507 --> 00:04:03,017
and also, he came to India
and ruled there for a short time.

34
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:06,519
All that’s a history.

35
00:04:07,356 --> 00:04:26,707
In the same way, there have been wars
between Christians and non-Christians,

36
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:32,192
between Muslims
and non-Muslims.

37
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:43,451
All kinds of wars we have heard of 
where only the faithful got lost,

38
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,350
the real people got lost.

39
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:55,325
The one who worshipped
God with full faith got lost.

40
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,839
So, many people become atheist

41
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:06,766
and they said, “There is nothing like God, 
nothing like his divine Power.

42
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:13,423
It never existed. We were stupid, 
we were foolish to follow all this".

43
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:19,751
And those who were in charge of religion 
took full advantage of that

44
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:25,390
and said that, "These people
were sinful people,

45
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,870
these people were not godly people,

46
00:05:30,609 --> 00:05:36,069
and that’s how they were killed by
us and we were victorious".

47
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:43,999
The idea of victory they had
that they have been successful

48
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:48,823
"and so many people have
been butchered by us".

49
00:05:53,034 --> 00:05:56,634
So we come to Kali Yuga,

50
00:05:57,684 --> 00:06:04,924
and in Kali Yuga, same thing
has started in a subtler way;

51
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:08,874
in a different way
it has started that

52
00:06:08,874 --> 00:06:18,984
there’s a big war going on
between the people who are anti-God,

53
00:06:19,757 --> 00:06:25,227
and who are using God
for their own purpose.

54
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:30,717
Very dishonest, very corrupt,
very cruel people.

55
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:36,652
And they are using
the flag of God,

56
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:43,594
that banner which they
have no right to use.

57
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:51,133
Then there are Sahaja Yogis 
who have got their Realization,

58
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:55,822
 
and they have to fight them.

59
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:04,939
Now the difference in the previous
wars and this war is very different.

60
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:15,970
In those wars, you see, all those
who were supposed to be victorious

61
00:07:16,496 --> 00:07:26,766
 - this was, after all, the nine battles of the Divine Mother -

62
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:33,375
– the negativity that came up
and which became successful

63
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:41,022
started feeling very confident that,
"We have achieved what we wanted".

64
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:51,990
But in Kali Yuga,
in the light of Kali Yuga,

65
00:07:51,990 --> 00:08:01,487
all those historical victories
are regarded as shameful things,

66
00:08:02,374 --> 00:08:08,504
as something very
aggressive and nonsensical.

67
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:14,174
This is now being described everywhere.

68
00:08:14,922 --> 00:08:25,260
Like, the white-skinned people went to America
and killed all the rest of them there.

69
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:31,749
– now that is coming into light.

70
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:40,544
All these people who thought
themselves to be victorious:

71
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:44,997
their children, their grandchildren,
their progeny are ashamed of them!

72
00:08:44,997 --> 00:08:50,627
Ashamed to call that
they were their forefathers

73
00:08:50,934 --> 00:08:54,184
– up till the last war.

74
00:08:55,981 --> 00:09:06,592
This awareness which has come is the real victory of modern times,

75
00:09:06,592 --> 00:09:09,740
of this Kali Yuga:

76
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,070
that everything that was
accepted as a part of the game,

77
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:22,420
as the lifestyle, you can call it,

78
00:09:22,844 --> 00:09:28,254
is now being challenged in
modern times, everywhere.

79
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:36,160
Whatever is aggression,
whatever is oppression,

80
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:44,499
whatever is cruel is
now punished also.

81
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:52,556
You see, so many war
criminals must have escaped,

82
00:09:52,556 --> 00:09:56,346
but so many went into trials

83
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,196
– never happened before.

84
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,842
Nobody took Genghis Khan to a trial.

85
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,969
Now in a very subtle way

86
00:10:05,477 --> 00:10:09,887
all these aggressive people
are getting now afraid

87
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:20,090
that they will be questioned,
and they may be tortured.

88
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:23,520
It started I don’t know where,

89
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,140
but definitely at the beginning
of the Kali Yuga.

90
00:10:27,374 --> 00:10:33,891
If you remember in this country was
 a great aggressive man called Mussolini,

91
00:10:34,187 --> 00:10:37,337
and ultimately he was hanged.

92
00:10:38,194 --> 00:10:40,894
In Germany there was
a very powerful man

93
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,242
called Hitler, and Himmler
and all this.

94
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:47,072
God knows what
happened to them

95
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:50,597
– even the Germans don’t
want to take his name,

96
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:53,627
they’re all ashamed of him.

97
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:57,759
Then we had somebody
say in England,

98
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:00,919
Warren Hastings who
came to India

99
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:03,012
– he was put to jail.

100
00:11:03,332 --> 00:11:07,002
This was never done before.

101
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:13,859
If Napoleon aggressed people, he
thought he was very victorious;

102
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:20,402
but he could not continue
with it, he had to face it.

103
00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:28,314
You see, anybody who has been aggressive,

104
00:11:28,732 --> 00:11:38,122
who has been dominating,
who has been very cruel, demonic,

105
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:43,697
has been taken to task
mostly in his lifetime.

106
00:11:44,696 --> 00:11:51,646
Now, if not in his lifetime,

107
00:11:51,934 --> 00:11:56,074
afterwards he was maligned

108
00:11:56,074 --> 00:12:00,332
and he doesn’t have a name
like a hero or anything.

109
00:12:00,332 --> 00:12:04,637
People don’t want
to erect their statues.

110
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:09,021
So the awareness has come
in the mind of the people.

111
00:12:09,454 --> 00:12:14,694
Like a person like Stalin who
ruled Russia once upon a time,

112
00:12:15,052 --> 00:12:19,242
today you can’t see even
one statue of Stalin.

113
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:22,672
These are modern times.

114
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:27,299
See the power
of modern times!

115
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:30,109
And that is frightening
to those people

116
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:34,809
who think they can get along
with whatever they are doing.

117
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:41,504
It is going to be very
soon understood by them

118
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:49,452
that they have to stop all this
nonsense, otherwise they will suffer.

119
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:53,447
It’s not those whom
they are dominating

120
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:57,142
but those who are
dominating will suffer.

121
00:12:57,427 --> 00:13:01,180
They will suffer physically,
they will suffer mentally,

122
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,080
they will suffer emotionally,

123
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:09,420
and also their fame
will be in the mud.

124
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:18,669
So today’s victory of the
power of the Divine Mother

125
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:25,400
is doing one very great
work, is to expose;

126
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:33,095
and this exposure will be condemning publicly

127
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:36,760
 those people who are doing wrong.

128
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,899
If you see from that point of view,

129
00:13:41,312 --> 00:13:47,302
you will understand how
we are victorious now.

130
00:13:48,197 --> 00:13:52,728
Many of you felt very sad
that I didn’t get the award [Peace Nobel Price].

131
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:55,408
This award makes no
difference to Me,

132
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:58,247
and to you also, I must tell you;

133
00:13:58,247 --> 00:14:02,517
because you have come without
I having any award,

134
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:06,552
and many will come without
having any award as such.

135
00:14:07,257 --> 00:14:12,557
But this time, for the
first time, if you notice

136
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:16,742
the people who got award
are condemned.

137
00:14:17,214 --> 00:14:23,114
Even now they are writing against it,
even now they are criticizing.

138
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:28,681
So those who have been, they
thought they were very smart,

139
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:31,660
but the smartness is out now

140
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,804
and I don’t know
how long will it go on;

141
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:38,980
because even today if you use, open a newspaper 
you find something about it,

142
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,340
that how stupidly
they have done it

143
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,690
– they can’t understand what was
the reason they have done it.

144
00:14:46,192 --> 00:14:49,332
Not only the people who
selected are criticized,

145
00:14:49,332 --> 00:14:53,902
but very much more
the people who are selected.

146
00:14:55,649 --> 00:15:02,250
Now, as being Sahaja Yogis,
we have to know what is the difference

147
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:10,940
between the consciousness at that
time and awareness at this time.

148
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:16,256
That time it was necessary
to kill those demons, finish them,

149
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,420
but they are back
again on the stage.

150
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,930
Now at this time when
it is Kali Yuga

151
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,730
they are exposed,

152
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,270
they are condemned,

153
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:44,690
they are put in the jail, they
are now punished publicly.

154
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,360
So the collective awareness

155
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,310
has got such a great victory
I think, over these people

156
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,230
whom so many came,
killed and died

157
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,790
without getting any
punishment out of it,

158
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,750
without getting any
defamation out of it.

159
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,510
Now let us see what
is consciousness

160
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,860
and what is awareness.

161
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:31,290
It is a subtle subject which
I think you all can understand.

162
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,310
Consciousness is that

163
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,460
when you are made conscious,
you become conscious about it.

164
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,330
Like I have My
hand here all right,

165
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:49,920
but normally I am not conscious
of it that I have a hand.

166
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:57,259
If a man is sleeping, he is
not conscious that he’s sleeping.

167
00:16:57,927 --> 00:17:02,447
When you tell Me “You have
a hand” I become conscious;

168
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:07,907
or something pricks Me,
then I become conscious

169
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,520
– otherwise I am
unconscious about it.

170
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:21,640
I am absolutely unconscious about
My eyes, I am seeing everything;

171
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:28,730
but supposing I become
blind, I can’t see:

172
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,490
then I become conscious
of My eyes,

173
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,580
that I have got My eyes through
which now I cannot see.

174
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:46,334
So once you say there is this
hand, the consciousness is there.

175
00:17:46,842 --> 00:17:50,512
This we can say is the
knowledge about the hand,

176
00:17:50,512 --> 00:17:53,672
that you get knowledge
about that.

177
00:17:55,347 --> 00:17:57,147
But once

178
00:17:58,697 --> 00:18:03,557
you are not conscious of the hand,
that knowledge is disappeared.

179
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,559
So to say there is ignorance
or there is knowledge,

180
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,529
both things are just the same.

181
00:18:15,482 --> 00:18:23,412
You are not conscious of your hand
so you are quite ignorant about it.

182
00:18:23,997 --> 00:18:26,667
Now supposing somebody says,

183
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,810
“Your hands are very beautiful”.

184
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,200
Somebody remarks like that then
I become conscious of my hand

185
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,220
which is beautiful; otherwise
I never knew they were beautiful.

186
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:49,780
So normally all human beings
live at that level,

187
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,890
that somebody has to tell you.

188
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,160
Now somebody said, "You
are wearing a very nice sari".

189
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:02,750
All right. Then I look at it, "Yes,
it’s very nice, I never knew".

190
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:09,509
So somebody has to tell you,
then you become conscious;

191
00:19:10,902 --> 00:19:14,202
otherwise you are not.

192
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:21,347
So we all human beings
at that level are like that.

193
00:19:22,482 --> 00:19:26,102
Now, what is awareness?

194
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,142
– that’s a different thing.

195
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:34,744
That means if I see

196
00:19:35,447 --> 00:19:40,057
somebody is attacking Me
I put My hand like this.

197
00:19:40,457 --> 00:19:43,807
That means I’m
aware I have a hand.

198
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:48,990
I’m not conscious but I’m aware that I have
a hand, I have to use it.

199
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,664
Like here, in Italy, you
go on using your hands

200
00:19:51,664 --> 00:19:54,654
bringing them up all
the time like this.

201
00:19:56,042 --> 00:20:00,332
That means you know you
are aware that you have got hands,

202
00:20:00,737 --> 00:20:03,487
that you have to use
them for expressing

203
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:07,317
something more sort
of emphatically.

204
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:17,070
So we are sort of also
aware of our body,

205
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,200
we are aware of others,

206
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,430
we know about others,

207
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,210
we know what sort of
a person another one is

208
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:33,840
– up till you are Self-realized.

209
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,230
After Self-realization what happens?

210
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,910
It’s very interesting.

211
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:49,950
After Self-realization you go
beyond both these things,

212
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,090
consciousness and awareness,

213
00:20:55,147 --> 00:21:00,557
because you go beyond thought.

214
00:21:02,452 --> 00:21:05,782
“You have gone beyond
thought” means what?

215
00:21:06,252 --> 00:21:14,474
Anger, all kinds of ideas, all kinds of aggression,

216
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:19,214
everything is maneuvered

217
00:21:19,214 --> 00:21:23,930
or worked through your mind.

218
00:21:24,474 --> 00:21:30,074
So if your mind is lost,
what will you do?

219
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:35,149
There’s no mind anymore.

220
00:21:36,134 --> 00:21:39,954
You exist with reality,

221
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:45,560
so there is no mind to communicate.

222
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,090
We call it 'thoughtlessly aware'.

223
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,150
Means what?

224
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,880
We have conquered
all our enemies by

225
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,160
giving up one enemy
that was our mind.

226
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,250
There’s no mind to suggest,

227
00:22:01,602 --> 00:22:04,652
there’s no mind to tell you,

228
00:22:05,302 --> 00:22:09,882
so once there is no
mind you are lost.

229
00:22:11,184 --> 00:22:13,344
Now it is being said that you ask

230
00:22:13,344 --> 00:22:16,554
a question to yourself,
“Who am I?”

231
00:22:18,634 --> 00:22:21,764
As soon as you ask this question
you become thoughtless,

232
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,780
so you get lost.

233
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,030
You cannot answer this question.

234
00:22:29,754 --> 00:22:34,184
Otherwise you might say, “I am
a woman, I am this, I am that”;

235
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:41,764
“I am a bishop or I am a pope,
I am this, I am that.”

236
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:48,400
But once you are a Realized soul,
who will tell  you who you are?

237
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,470
Because the one which tells
you is the mind which doesn’t exist

238
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,290
- no thought

239
00:22:56,162 --> 00:23:01,662
– means you get dissolved
into your Self.

240
00:23:03,981 --> 00:23:06,541
This is what is reality.

241
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:15,222
But you are aware also;
now that’s another point.

242
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,440
If you ask yourself a question
you are not there,

243
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,890
but you are aware.

244
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,970
If your Nabhi is catching
you immediately you know

245
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,370
“My Nabhi is catching,
I have got liver.”

246
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,150
Don’t have to ask questions.

247
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,140
Or somebody is standing near you,

248
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:43,650
his left Swadisthana
– “Oh my God, it is this one!”

249
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,790
If somebody is very angry
and hot tempered,

250
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,400
immediately you’ll feel such
heat from that person,

251
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,190
you’ll say, “Oh baba,
I’ll run away from this man.”

252
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,530
So this is a new

253
00:24:03,197 --> 00:24:06,527
realm you have entered into reality,

254
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,320
which you are never aware of before.

255
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:17,969
Now supposing there’s a very
bad man standing near you.

256
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:23,650
He might be a thief, he might
be a murderer, anything

257
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,010
– you will not be even
conscious of it

258
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,640
leave alone aware, normally.

259
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,080
But once you are a realized soul,

260
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:42,610
you become aware of the whole.

261
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,130
That is reality.

262
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:50,860
What are the problems,
in the collective?

263
00:24:51,812 --> 00:24:55,262
You become aware of the collective.

264
00:24:55,832 --> 00:24:58,762
You become aware of the
problems of the whole world.

265
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,447
Now, this awareness is
very different.

266
00:25:03,446 --> 00:25:07,706
The first awareness as
I told you is like this,

267
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:13,059
that if somebody tells you
you are this and this,

268
00:25:13,447 --> 00:25:16,707
you become aware of it.

269
00:25:18,737 --> 00:25:22,447
In this, nobody has to tell you;

270
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,160
it’s just there.

271
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,560
You are there, you know what it is.

272
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:45,440
And this is what you have
achieved in these modern times,

273
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,710
which is the blessing
of the modern times also,

274
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:55,090
that we know now who we are.

275
00:25:55,729 --> 00:26:00,959
You always say, “We are the pure
Spirit,” yesterday also I heard it.

276
00:26:01,244 --> 00:26:03,194
Are you sure?

277
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,730
What makes you believe that,

278
00:26:08,497 --> 00:26:12,327
that you are the pure Spirit?

279
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:16,884
I mean, you haven’t seen
your Spirit, have you?

280
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:20,594
You haven’t seen yourself
what you are.

281
00:26:21,427 --> 00:26:24,367
Then how do you say you
are the pure Spirit?

282
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:31,277
It’s just you are saying
something because I say so.

283
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:39,516
But you are the pure Spirit,
because whatever the description

284
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:41,986
of the pure Spirit is given

285
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:46,959
that it is aware

286
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:54,050
of the divine Power.

287
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,970
It is aware of the Divine Power,

288
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:03,970
and that is how you
are the pure Spirit;

289
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,800
because only
through pure Spirit

290
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,780
as your personality

291
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:18,780
you can be aware of this
All-pervading Power.

292
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:27,100
This is written in all the 'shastras',
in all the scriptures, everywhere.

293
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,950
And what do you know
about yourself?

294
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:39,780
– that you are the Spirit, because
you know about your own chakras,

295
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,110
you know about your own nadis.

296
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:49,334
Now, what has happened is that
you are separated from your self

297
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:53,444
and you can see your self.

298
00:27:54,754 --> 00:27:58,934
You see yourself very clearly,

299
00:28:01,209 --> 00:28:10,439
and you start seeing yourself as the
present and the past and the future.

300
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,690
“In the past what I was”
– you see, you’re shocked now

301
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,490
“my goodness, I was like this.”

302
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,920
You see it through this
present state,

303
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,330
in the present state you see.

304
00:28:26,912 --> 00:28:33,412
Then you start forgetting it,
“Forget the past, forget the past.”

305
00:28:36,692 --> 00:28:39,952
Then still you have the future;

306
00:28:40,449 --> 00:28:46,229
then you start thinking
about the future.

307
00:28:47,207 --> 00:28:53,362
First future they think about their
 own children, their wives - Sahaja Yogis also.

308
00:28:53,887 --> 00:29:00,607
“What will happen to my children?
What will happen to my wife?”

309
00:29:01,862 --> 00:29:06,692
Then they think, “What will
happen to Sahaja Yoga?”

310
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:11,414
Then they think, “What
will happen to Mataji?”

311
00:29:12,844 --> 00:29:17,144
Also they think, “What will
happen to this world?”

312
00:29:18,358 --> 00:29:26,566
Because your awareness
has expanded,

313
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:32,699
you are not in the limited
sphere now anymore.

314
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:37,327
You can think of your children,
you can think of your wife,

315
00:29:37,327 --> 00:29:40,807
also you can think
of the whole world

316
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:46,824
and all the problems of
the world you think about.

317
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:52,419
So you have reached
that state, all right;

318
00:29:52,902 --> 00:29:56,052
up to that state we are.

319
00:29:56,994 --> 00:29:59,884
Now what is the thing

320
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:08,220
that covers up all this
or gives you solutions,

321
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:12,870
say, for your children, for your
family, your wife, everyone

322
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,560
– what is the solution?

323
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:22,450
Your Mother believes in giving
solutions, not only the problems

324
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,130
Because these days
there are not problems

325
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,200
that existed in the Navaratri.

326
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,200
They no more exist,

327
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:42,080
that you can take a sword
in your hand and go and

328
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,900
kill someone; no, it doesn’t,

329
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,480
it’s not possible – cut what?

330
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:55,760
So the today’s problem
as they are, as we see

331
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,430
– within us we see the problems,

332
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,450
we are aware of it and we
want to do something about it.

333
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:10,740
Whether we are in the past,
present or future,

334
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,770
we see the problem.

335
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,030
So now what is the solution?

336
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:30,510
We have no weapons,
nothing to fight.

337
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,420
We don’t know also,
so many do not

338
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,340
know even how to hold
a sword in the hand,

339
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,100
and so many don’t
even want to hold it;

340
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,220
because they are so
much in compassion,

341
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,990
in the ocean of compassion
enjoying themselves nicely.

342
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:54,780
They are enjoying their own
compassion and compassion of others,

343
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,660
compassion of their Mother.

344
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:01,790
But then how to solve the problem?

345
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,590
The problem can be solved

346
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:15,200
if you become very
powerful yourself within.

347
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,380
Where is your attention?

348
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,900
You have to move inward.

349
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,730
Where is your attention?

350
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:36,180
You have to become very powerful.

351
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:41,980
I have done My job, I have
given you realization.

352
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,720
You have grown so much,
I have explained to you,

353
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,770
I’ve told you everything
– it’s done.

354
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,030
I have given you lots of love,

355
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:58,870
ocean of love, I should say,
as you call it, whatever it is.

356
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:04,429
But now you have to
nourish yourself.

357
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:10,080
You have to become
powerful within yourself.

358
00:33:12,332 --> 00:33:16,412
So what is the way you
can become powerful?

359
00:33:21,344 --> 00:33:23,844
First, you must believe

360
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:29,500
that you have transcended
your human personality

361
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:35,310
and you have now become
a super-human being.

362
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:44,289
First of all, this must come in you.

363
00:33:45,098 --> 00:33:48,214
This is what we call as faith.

364
00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:53,950
This faith is not false
faith, is not blind faith

365
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,110
that you believe into
something, but it’s a fact.

366
00:34:01,766 --> 00:34:05,020
I have a hundred times,
I have told you

367
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:10,420
that you have first of all
faith in your ascent

368
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:14,680
in your position as Sahaja Yogis.

369
00:34:17,158 --> 00:34:23,692
For this meditation is
very important, very important.

370
00:34:23,954 --> 00:34:29,594
Without meditation you cannot
have full faith in yourself,

371
00:34:30,831 --> 00:34:38,038
because you can’t know yourself
by saying, “Who am I?” You cannot.

372
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:45,809
You try now. Ask a question within,
“Who am I?” You’ll be lost.

373
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,460
So what should be the faith then?

374
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:00,280
Because when you ask the question
“Who am I?” you are lost.

375
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,010
So we reach a stage
where I have to tell you

376
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:18,630
that faith is not mental, it is
not emotional, it is not physical,

377
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:25,380
but it is a state of your own being

378
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:30,860
which we can call as
a spiritual state.

379
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,980
In the spiritual state

380
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:47,230
nothing can disturb you,

381
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,680
nothing can overpower you,

382
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,810
nothing can dominate you;

383
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,400
because that state if you have,

384
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:09,240
that means you are part
and parcel of reality.

385
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:18,380
Then you are a honored member
of the God’s kingdom.

386
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:29,270
Then you are the most
revered personality.

387
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,070
Then you are like a deity.

388
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:38,630
Then you are like a Gana.

389
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:44,990
In that state when you are
– it’s a state, again I say,

390
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,350
beyond the human state

391
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:56,040
– you are extremely powerful.

392
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:06,240
There’s a story about
Nizamuddin – the great Auliya,

393
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:09,440
great Sufi in India.

394
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,630
There was a horrible king

395
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:16,240
I think what Shah he called himself;

396
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:22,100
and he would not go and bow
to him. So he was very angry.

397
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,020
He said, “I can only bow
to God and to nobody else.”

398
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,610
This Shah said, “If you don’t come
and bow to me tomorrow,

399
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,110
I will cut your throat.”

400
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,410
And that night, the throat
of this king was cut.

401
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:45,820
It’s a story, but it’s a real story.

402
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:53,160
Somebody came and cut his throat
– it was not Nizamuddin Sahib.

403
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,570
He would not do that.

404
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:03,070
So that state if you reach,

405
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:10,290
what we call is
the state of shraddha,

406
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:17,900
state of shraddha

407
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:24,650
which is enlightened,
enlightened faith.

408
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:34,120
It’s a new type of mechanism;

409
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:44,190
that is, you become part
and parcel of the whole.

410
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,930
That means the moon, the star- see

411
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,530
I tell you, I never told the sun that
it should be there for the pujas -

412
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,450
last time, this time - I never tell him.

413
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,100
There’s no need to tell,
it’s all done.

414
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,150
I don’t tell all these vibrations

415
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:14,430
to make a cross or to show these,
all these miraculous photographs.

416
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:18,230
I don´t tell them, there´s no need to tell. 

417
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:25,260
They just do it by themselves.
I am sometimes surprised

418
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:28,380
how ingenious methods
they have of their own,

419
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,040
how they manage things
– I am myself surprised.

420
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,980
I didn’t tell them that
these two persons

421
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,280
who were selected by this award

422
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:42,440
should be so condemned
by every newspaper.

423
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:46,140
It all works automatically,

424
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,370
it just works.

425
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:58,610
Only thing if I have anything is
just complete, complete faith

426
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,730
that I am at that state,

427
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,020
and that’s why there is
complete patience, 'saburi',

428
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:10,070
complete patience.

429
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:19,120
And that is what we have to learn.

430
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:26,330
It will all happen in any case
because you are all at that state.

431
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,470
Only meditation is important,
very important;

432
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:33,840
for Me not, but for you all.

433
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,680
If you all can meditate now,

434
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:45,480
just for ten minutes also every day,

435
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,860
it will help you a lot.

436
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:56,540
Now, why do we have all these
statues and, I mean the Mother

437
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:01,990
and the Hanumana
and Ganesha, Christ?

438
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:05,830
Because to begin with,
human beings cannot

439
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:10,710
understand anything which
does not have a form.

440
00:41:12,305 --> 00:41:17,615
They cannot go deeper unless
and until there’s a form.

441
00:41:18,252 --> 00:41:21,240
But they went to another
limit of using any stone,

442
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,570
anything, as God and all that.

443
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,480
But now you have discretion:

444
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,340
you know what is to be worshipped,

445
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:41,410
what is to be treated as a higher
personality – that you know.

446
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:46,570
But before that they would
worship all kinds of people,

447
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:51,040
like now people worship pope,
you know that very well.

448
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,910
But now what to do?

449
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,460
They are not only blind,

450
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,220
they are not only unaware, but
they are also not conscious of it.

451
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:08,890
They are all at such a level
that you cannot tell them.

452
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,920
So you are a new type
of people I should say,

453
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:17,940
who have tried to fight
it out, to struggle out,

454
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,830
to know about the absolute truth.

455
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:29,300
Unless and until you know
the absolute truth,

456
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,260
you are nowhere;

457
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:38,640
you have no discretion, you have no
understanding, you have no wisdom.

458
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,600
But once you know the absolute truth,

459
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:48,290
then you should not by any chance

460
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,150
be halfway this and halfway that.

461
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:59,780
That’s a very dangerous
state of affairs.

462
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:07,530
Say a seed is sprouted, it is
neither a seed nor a tree.

463
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,110
If it doesn’t grow it is useless.

464
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,810
That’s happens to your
awareness – I am again talking

465
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:21,410
of your consciousness, awareness

466
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,750
– and then you are neither
here nor there.

467
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:38,100
There are many people who come
to Sahaja Yoga perhaps, maybe

468
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:42,000
to find some peace.

469
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,870
But I get letters:

470
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,540
“My father is sick, my mother is
sick, my sister is sick.”

471
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:54,650
Then otherwise, “My husband is fighting
with me, I am seeking a divorce.”

472
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,140
Or thirdly, “I’ve lost all my money,

473
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,020
I must have some money.”

474
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:02,920
Fourthly, “I am a great artist but I,

475
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,910
my art is not selling.”

476
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:11,240
All these stupid problems
they bring for Me.

477
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:16,730
Hah – “My children are no good,
they are troublesome.”

478
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,950
Then, “My wife is fighting with me,

479
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:21,890
my mother is fighting with
me, brother is fighting.”

480
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:26,710
But I said, “What sort
of Sahaja yogis these are?”

481
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:36,300
The state of being one
with the reality

482
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:45,060
means that the whole
of reality is at your feet,

483
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:49,260
whole of it works for you;

484
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:55,220
and once you even
get a glimpse of that state

485
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:02,720
I tell you, you become so much
peaceful within yourself.

486
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:11,890
If you say, “I am the king,
I am the king,”

487
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,430
if you say, “I am the beggar,
I am the beggar,”

488
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,890
what difference does it
make to that state

489
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:24,370
which is like a purest of pure gold,

490
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:28,480
which cannot be tarnished?

491
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,590
Such a state of mind
we have to develop.

492
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,840
It’s a more a challenge to us.

493
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,460
We are Sahaja yogis, all right.

494
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,050
We have got realization, all right.

495
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,800
We can sing very well, all right.

496
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,590
We have achieved good
positions, all right.

497
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,490
We are nicely married, all right.

498
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,960
We’ve got nice children,
we have got everything,

499
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:05,450
we have got jobs, this that.

500
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:12,650
Now, suddenly one negative force
comes in to trouble you – so what?

501
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,380
So what?

502
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,120
Otherwise how will you
know what you are?

503
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:31,980
If there is no darkness, how will
you know you are the light?

504
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:44,160
It’s a challenge to your own
state, at what state you are.

505
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:50,580
The word “state” is not so
explanatory. In Sanskrit is swarupa,

506
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,200
swarupa

507
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:03,040
– “swa” is yourself
and “rupa” is form or state.

508
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:10,800
That state is possible
for all of you

509
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:17,780
by saying “Not this, not this,
not this, not this.”

510
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:27,950
As it is, your mind has reached
that state that there is no mind

511
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,620
– you can do that.

512
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:37,550
But you have to develop
a kind of a personality

513
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,780
that realizes what you are.

514
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:48,730
But in that realization

515
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,830
you are just aware of it,

516
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,100
not conscious of it.

517
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,100
I´ll, for example, I'll tell you. 

518
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:04,180
I am aware that I am Adi Shakti
– I am aware, I know.

519
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:09,910
But when you say “Jai Shri Mataji”
I also say “Jai Shri Mataji,”

520
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,710
forgetting that I am the
one you are talking about.

521
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:22,980
This is actually,
should be the state:

522
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:27,820
that you are aware, yes, you
are aware in the sense, in the

523
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:31,590
- I don’t know how to say
- but I am aware I am that.

524
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,250
If you ask Me, “Mother,
are You Adi Shakti?”

525
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:41,170
I said, “Yes, I am” - because
I know that, that I am.

526
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,890
But when you say
“Jai Shri Mataji” I forget that

527
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:50,180
I am Adi Shakti and I also say
“Jai Shri Mataji” with you.

528
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:59,020
I forget, I have to tell you, 
“No, no, you can't say it”. 

529
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:02,160
It’s very interesting.

530
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:06,210
Now, you make Me sit
here like a queen

531
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:09,310
and give Me a presents,
this thing, that thing;

532
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:14,423
I mean, all right, that’s your idea.

533
00:49:16,937 --> 00:49:25,397
But to Me, you see, I am
complete in Myself, I think so.

534
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:33,000
This in Hindi: “Me kahenge ki
hum apne hi andar samma gaye”

535
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:39,520
"I am - got lost into Myself".

536
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:43,170
All right, you do this, all right;
you should do that, all right.

537
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:47,218
If you don’t do it, it’s all right.

538
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,510
To Me it makes no difference;
it may make difference to you,

539
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:54,440
but to Me it does not.

540
00:49:54,730 --> 00:50:00,000
Like, I´ve been saying, "Now don´t give me any presents, 
don´t give me any presents", all these days. 

541
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,330
So the only argument is that,

542
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:06,130
“The whole year, we give You once,
so why should You, Mother, object?

543
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:07,940
because that gives us joy.”

544
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:10,970
All right, if you think
it gives you joy, do it,

545
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,650
but to Me, it doesn’t matter.

546
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:22,480
Because I don’t think I am there.

547
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,980
I am just seeing you
sitting here, all right.

548
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:34,559
They are all Realized souls, all right.

549
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,624
But I am one of you.

550
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,160
I don’t think I am very special.

551
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:48,470
But if you ask Me then I will say,
"All right, I am Adi Shakti".

552
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:53,301
But I don’t think Adi Shakti
is very special also,

553
00:50:55,269 --> 00:50:57,569
because I’ve no mind.

554
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,550
But otherwise, I don’t think
it’s something special.

555
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:04,210
Because somebody is
something, so what?

556
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,810
Now supposing sun is
sun, so what? He is a sun.

557
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:16,263
If somebody is Adi Shakti
– so Adi Shakti, so what?

558
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:23,947
But for you it is creditable 
because you were not born Realized.

559
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:27,573
You got your Realization.

560
00:51:27,765 --> 00:51:32,900
So you are special, you are great,

561
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,350
you have achieved something.
I’ve achieved nothing;

562
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:40,000
I have been like this and
I will be like this.

563
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:45,640
Whether I fight the devils
or I sit before you

564
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,710
makes no difference,
I will be like this.

565
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:54,670
But for Me you are great,
because you have achieved this.

566
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:58,460
Today to see you
on this Navaratri day,

567
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:03,889
so many people sitting
to worship Me!

568
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,260
So many people are here,

569
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:13,370
so many Sahaja Yogis
- it’s so remarkable!

570
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,370
It’s not My achievement, I tell you,

571
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:18,420
it’s your seeking.

572
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,556
Because I have been on this
earth many a times before

573
00:52:23,759 --> 00:52:25,840
that you know.

574
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,820
But we never had like this.

575
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,800
So many came, got crucified,
died, this, that,

576
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,000
but I never had people of this kind.

577
00:52:38,137 --> 00:52:41,657
So again we come
to the same point,

578
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:50,000
that we should be aware
of ourselves

579
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:54,530
– complete shraddha
in yourself.

580
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:58,680
If you have some shraddha
in yourself,

581
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:02,238
you’ll have shraddha about Me also,

582
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:06,430
because we are not different.

583
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:11,390
If you believe this is water,

584
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:16,129
then everywhere there is water 
I believe that that is water, isn’t it?

585
00:53:16,392 --> 00:53:19,400
Because I know this is water,

586
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:24,810
so wherever in the world there
is water, I know it is water.

587
00:53:25,707 --> 00:53:29,050
So if you know you are
a Sahaja Yogi,

588
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:36,092
anywhere there is a Sahaja Yogi, you know there is
a Sahaja Yogi, this is a Sahaja Yogi. 

589
00:53:36,092 --> 00:53:44,170
But as far as you are concerned 
you forget how great you are,

590
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:47,100
and how far you can go.

591
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,570
I am very proud of you,
you don’t know.

592
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:56,380
But because I am a humble person,

593
00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:00,000
I don’t know how to show off.

594
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:08,607
So, I have such nice children,
so many of them, so lovable.

595
00:54:09,642 --> 00:54:16,351
Those bhaktas for whom She killed
so many demons and all that

596
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:19,690
were not like you.

597
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,064
You are much better, much higher,
 of a much greater quality.

598
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:30,700
But you must know that you are.

599
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:36,480
And don’t behave like
those people who

600
00:54:36,882 --> 00:54:41,810
were of a very rudimentary nature.

601
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:46,360
You are grown up,
you have prospered,

602
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:51,086
and now the fruits we can see.

603
00:54:52,462 --> 00:54:56,120
I don’t know what to
do for you, really.

604
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:01,422
But have faith in yourself.

605
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:06,500
Then you will see how much
faith you will have in reality,

606
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:10,280
that there is reality with
you at every step,

607
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,200
every moment.

608
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,840
No fear,

609
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,664
no sense of achievement - nothing!

610
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:29,489
Done now, finished!

611
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,270
When there were 5 Sahaja Yogis,
 I was happy,

612
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:34,360
when there are so many, I am happy.

613
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:40,000
But I, when I see so many, I think

614
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:49,684
there are so many powerful
personalities who are one with reality.

615
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:57,934
This collective oneness
was never so.

616
00:55:58,465 --> 00:56:05,190
And so I would say that, on this day,

617
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:11,280
what we have to do is to
kill the devils within ourselves;

618
00:56:11,487 --> 00:56:14,354
that’s all.

619
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,940
If you want to really worship Me,

620
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:22,757
that’s what you have to think,
what are the devils within you

621
00:56:22,757 --> 00:56:24,267
That’s all.

622
00:56:24,587 --> 00:56:27,818
So you don’t have to worry
otherwise for outside devils,

623
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:31,109
they cannot do anything to you.

624
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:36,371
May God bless you.
