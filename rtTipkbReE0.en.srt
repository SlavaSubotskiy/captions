1
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:17,210
Today is a special day, as you know; 
we are worshipping the Goddess

2
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:24,240
who came on this earth 
nine times before,

3
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,550
to kill all the demons 
and all the negativity,

4
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:37,010
and relieve all the 
bhaktas to worship.

5
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:44,170
All Her work is already 
been described.

6
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:53,700
Despite that they find 
new type of devils,

7
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:01,430
new type of negative people 
have come back.

8
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,230
Perhaps it had to be.

9
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:26,160
This had to be, maybe, 
after all it’s Kali Yuga;

10
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,220
and the drama of Kali Yuga 
would not be performed

11
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,370
unless and until 
they are there.

12
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,120
So to complete 
this drama they came.

13
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:56,290
But this time it’s going to be 
a very different type of war

14
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,840
- it’s going to be the war 
of the peaceful people.

15
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,750
And the peaceful people

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,840
are the most successful people in 
every walk of life, even in the war.

17
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,190
It did not work out before.

18
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,210
They say that when 
Genghis Khan came,

19
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:38,070
he went to a very big monastery 
of Buddhists near Gaya

20
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,380
and killed all of them.

21
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,110
There were about thirty 
thousand of Buddhists there

22
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,670
and they didn’t say a word, 
and they were all killed.

23
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,160
So people started 
disbelieving in Buddhism.

24
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:02,210
They said, “What kind of a Buddhism 
is here; why didn’t Buddha save them?”

25
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,350
That’s human style 
of thinking.

26
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,500
Buddha should have saved 
these thirty thousand people

27
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,300
these who were peaceful,

28
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:21,930
who were resisting in a manner 
that was no resistance,

29
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,200
and so they were all killed by this 
horrible fellow called Genghis Khan.

30
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,230
But you’ll be surprised, in 
this Kali Yuga this Genghis Khan

31
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,920
has been praised 
by many authors,

32
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,150
and there are books 
written about him.

33
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,250
He was not a Muslim – was 
some sort of a crackpot.

34
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:50,270
He finished off many mosques,

35
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:57,680
he destroyed many 
beautiful buildings

36
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:03,780
and also he came to India 
and ruled there for a short time.

37
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,520
All that’s a history.

38
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:16,720
In the same way there 
have been wars

39
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,910
between Christians 
and non-Christians,

40
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,050
between Muslims 
and non-Muslims.

41
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:39,600
All kinds of wars we 
have heard of where

42
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,830
only the faithful got lost,

43
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,470
the real people got lost.

44
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:55,470
The one who worshipped 
God with full faith got lost.

45
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,840
So, many people 
become atheist

46
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,580
and they said, “There is 
nothing like God,

47
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,720
nothing like His 
divine Power.

48
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,760
It never existed. We were 
stupid, we were foolish

49
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,390
to follow all this.”

50
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,840
And those who were 
in charge of religion

51
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,690
took full advantage 
of that and said

52
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,630
that these people 
were sinful people,

53
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,870
these people were 
not godly people,

54
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:37,070
and that’s how they were killed by 
us and we were victorious.”

55
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:45,190
The idea of victory they had 
that they have been successful

56
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,920
“and so many people have 
been butchered by us.”

57
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,540
So we come to Kali Yuga,

58
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:06,020
and in Kali Yuga same thing 
has started in a subtler way;

59
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,590
in a different way 
it has started that

60
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,470
there’s a big war going 
on between the people

61
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,850
who are anti-God,

62
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,800
and who are using God 
for their own purpose.

63
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,480
Very dishonest, very corrupt, 
very cruel people,

64
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,510
and they are using 
the flag of God,

65
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:44,500
that banner which they 
have no right to use.

66
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,070
Then there are Sahaja yogis

67
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:56,490
who have got their realization, 
and they have to fight them.

68
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:05,750
Now the difference in the previous 
wars and this war is very different.

69
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:14,450
In those wars, you see, all those 
who were supposed to be victorious

70
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:27,720
– this was after all the nine 
battles of the Divine Mother

71
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,710
– the negativity that came up 
and which became successful

72
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:40,480
started feeling very confident that 
“we have achieved what we wanted.”

73
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,510
But in Kali Yuga now,

74
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,230
in the light of Kali Yuga

75
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,770
all those historical victories

76
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,920
are regarded 
as shameful things,

77
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,410
as something very 
aggressive and nonsensical.

78
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:15,080
This is now being 
described everywhere.

79
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,600
Like the white-skinned 
people went to

80
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,600
America and killed 
all the rest of them there

81
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,750
– now that is coming 
into light.

82
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:41,450
All these people who thought 
themselves to be victorious:

83
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,380
children, their grandchildren, 
their progeny’s ashamed of them,

84
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:51,320
ashamed to call that 
they were their forefathers

85
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,900
– up till the last war.

86
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,110
This awareness which has come

87
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:09,980
is the real victory of modern 
times, of this Kali Yuga:

88
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:16,770
that everything that was 
accepted as a part of the game,

89
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:23,400
as the lifestyle 
you can call it,

90
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:29,160
is now being challenged in 
modern times everywhere.

91
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:36,940
Whatever is aggression, 
whatever is oppression,

92
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:45,630
whatever is cruel is 
now punished also.

93
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,680
You see so many war 
criminals must have escaped,

94
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,730
but so many went into trials

95
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,890
– never happened before.

96
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,510
Nobody took Genghis Khan to a trial.

97
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,780
Now in a very subtle way

98
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,460
all these aggressive people 
are getting now afraid

99
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:21,090
that they will be questioned, 
and they may be tortured.

100
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,760
It started I don’t know where,

101
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,840
but definitely at the beginning 
of the Kali Yuga.

102
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,850
If you remember in this 
country was

103
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,430
a great aggressive man 
called Mussolini,

104
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,100
and ultimately he was hanged.

105
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,990
In Germany there was 
a very powerful man

106
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,100
called Hitler, and Himmler 
and all this.

107
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,930
God knows what 
happened to them

108
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,360
– even the Germans don’t 
want to take his name,

109
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,390
they’re all ashamed of him.

110
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,380
Then we had somebody 
say in England,

111
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,800
Warren Hastings who 
came to India

112
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,870
– he was put to jail.

113
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,860
This was never done before.

114
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:14,860
If Napoleon aggressed people, he 
thought he was very victorious;

115
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:21,260
but he could not continue 
with it, he had to face it.

116
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:29,220
You see anybody who 
has been aggressive,

117
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:38,980
who has been dominating, 
who has been very cruel, demonic,

118
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:44,460
has been taken to task 
mostly in his lifetime.

119
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:52,720
Now, if not in his lifetime,

120
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:57,170
afterwards he was maligned

121
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,000
and he doesn’t have a name 
like a hero or anything.

122
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,770
People don’t want 
to erect their statues.

123
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,070
So the awareness has come 
in the mind of the people.

124
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,600
Like a person like Stalin who 
ruled Russia once upon a time,

125
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:20,100
today you can’t see even 
one statue of Stalin.

126
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,530
These are modern times,

127
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,110
see the power 
of modern times;

128
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,920
and that is frightening 
to those people

129
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:35,870
who think they can get along 
with whatever they are doing.

130
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:42,600
It is going to be very 
soon understood by them

131
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:50,120
that they have to stop all this 
nonsense, otherwise they will suffer.

132
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,210
It’s not those whom 
they are dominating

133
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,890
but those who are 
dominating will suffer.

134
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,420
They will suffer physically, 
they will suffer mentally,

135
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,320
hey will suffer emotionally,

136
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:09,660
and also their fame 
will be in the mud.

137
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:19,940
So today’s victory of the 
power of the Divine Mother

138
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:25,640
is doing one very great 
work, is to expose;

139
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,560
and this exposure will be

140
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:37,000
condemning publicly those 
people who are doing wrong.

141
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,900
If you see from that point of view,

142
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:48,160
you will understand how 
we are victorious now.

143
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,110
Many of you felt very sad 
that I didn’t get the award.

144
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,070
This award makes no 
difference to Me,

145
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,820
and to you also I must tell you;

146
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,360
because you have come without 
I having any award,

147
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,410
and many will come without 
having any award as such.

148
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:13,320
But this time, for the 
first time if you notice

149
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,600
the people who got award 
are condemned.

150
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,020
Even now they are writing against 
it, even now they are criticizing.

151
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:29,730
So those who have been, they 
thought they were very smart,

152
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,900
the smartness is out now

153
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,250
and I don’t know 
how long will it go on;

154
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,580
because even today if you use,

155
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,220
open a newspaper you 
find something about it,

156
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,870
that how stupidly 
they have done it

157
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:46,560
– they can’t understand what was 
the reason they have done it.

158
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,000
Not only the people who 
selected are criticized,

159
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,850
but very much more 
the people who are selected.

160
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,540
Now, as being Sahaja yogis, 
we have to know

161
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,720
what is the difference between

162
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:11,180
the consciousness at that 
time and awareness at this time.

163
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,400
That time it was necessary 
to kill those demons, finish them,

164
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,660
but they are back 
again on the stage.

165
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:30,170
Now at this time when 
it is Kali Yuga

166
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,970
they are exposed,

167
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,510
they are condemned,

168
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:44,930
they are put in the jail, they 
are now punished publicly.

169
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,600
So the collective awareness

170
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,550
has got such a great victory 
I think, over these people

171
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,470
whom so many came, 
killed and died

172
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,030
without getting any 
punishment out of it,

173
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:06,990
without getting any 
defamation out of it.

174
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,750
Now let us see what 
is consciousness

175
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,100
and what is awareness.

176
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:31,530
It is a subtle subject which 
I think you all can understand.

177
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,550
Consciousness is that

178
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,700
when you are made conscious, 
you become conscious about it.

179
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,570
Like I have My 
hand here all right,

180
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,690
but normally I am not conscious 
of it that I have a hand.

181
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,070
If a man is sleeping, he is 
not conscious that he’s sleeping.

182
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:03,210
When you tell Me “You have 
a hand” I become conscious;

183
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:08,670
or something pricks Me, 
then I become conscious

184
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:12,760
– otherwise I am 
unconscious about it.

185
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:21,880
I am absolutely unconscious about 
My eyes, I am seeing everything;

186
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:28,970
but supposing I become 
blind, I can’t see:

187
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,730
then I become conscious 
of My eyes,

188
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,820
that I have got My eyes through 
which now I cannot see.

189
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:47,050
So once you say there is this 
hand, the consciousness is there.

190
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,370
This we can say is the 
knowledge about the hand,

191
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,780
that you get knowledge 
about that.

192
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,910
But once

193
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,320
you are not conscious of the hand, 
that knowledge is disappeared.

194
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,370
So to say there is ignorance 
or there is knowledge,

195
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,620
both things are just the same.

196
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:24,270
You are not conscious of your hand 
so you are quite ignorant about it.

197
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,430
Now supposing somebody says,

198
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,050
“Your hands are very beautiful,”

199
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,440
somebody remarks likes that then 
I become conscious of My hand

200
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:42,460
which is beautiful; otherwise 
I never knew they were beautiful.

201
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:50,020
So normally all human beings 
live at that level,

202
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,130
that somebody has to tell you.

203
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,400
Now somebody said, “You 
are wearing a very nice sari.”

204
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:02,990
All right. Then I look at it – yes, 
it’s very nice, I never knew.

205
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,320
So somebody has to tell you, 
then you become conscious;

206
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,060
otherwise you are not.

207
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:22,110
So we all human beings 
at that level are like that.

208
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,770
Now, what is awareness?

209
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,000
– that’s a different thing.

210
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,460
That means if I see

211
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,820
somebody is attacking Me 
I put My hand like this.

212
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,570
That means I’m 
aware I have a hand.

213
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,280
I’m not conscious but I’m aware

214
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,630
aware that I have 
a hand, I have to use it.

215
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,380
Like here in Italy you 
go on using your hands

216
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,660
bringing them up all 
the time like this.

217
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,190
That means you know you 
are aware that you have got hands,

218
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,250
that you have to use 
them for expressing

219
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:08,380
something more sort 
of emphatically.

220
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:17,310
So we are sort of also 
aware of our body,

221
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,440
we are aware of others,

222
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,670
we know about others,

223
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,450
we know what sort of 
a person another one is

224
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:34,080
– up till you are self-realized.

225
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,470
After Self-realization what happens?

226
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,150
It’s 
very interesting.

227
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:50,190
After Self-realization you go 
beyond both these things,

228
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,770
consciousness and awareness,

229
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:01,320
because you go beyond thought.

230
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,640
“You have gone beyond 
thought” means what?

231
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:12,090
Anger, all kinds of ideas,

232
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,930
all kinds of aggression,

233
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,930
everything is maneuvered

234
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,170
or worked through your mind.

235
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,980
So if your mind is lost, 
what will you do?

236
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:36,150
There’s no mind anymore.

237
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,670
You exist with reality,

238
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:45,800
so there is no mind 
to communicate.

239
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,330
We call it “thoughtlessly aware.”

240
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,390
Means what?

241
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,120
We have conquered 
all our enemies by

242
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,400
giving up one enemy 
that was our mind.

243
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,160
There’s no mind to suggest,

244
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,510
there’s no mind to tell you,

245
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,740
so once there is no 
mind you are lost.

246
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,250
Now it is being said that you ask

247
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,740
a question to yourself, 
“Who am I?”

248
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,480
As soon as you ask this question 
you become thoughtless,

249
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,020
so you get lost.

250
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,270
You cannot answer this question.

251
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:34,900
Otherwise you might say, “I am 
a woman, I am this, I am that”;

252
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:42,730
“I am a bishop or I am a pope, 
I am this, I am that.”

253
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,640
But once you are a realized soul, 
who will tell  you who arey ou?

254
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,970
Because the one which tells 
you is the mind which doesn’t exist

255
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,100
- no thought

256
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,520
– means you get dissolved 
into yourself.

257
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,590
This is what is reality.

258
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:15,890
But you are aware also; 
now that’s another point.

259
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,680
If you ask yourself a question 
you are not there,

260
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,130
but you are aware.

261
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,210
If your Nabhi is catching 
you immediately you know

262
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,610
“My Nabhi is catching, 
I have got liver.”

263
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,390
Don’t have to ask questions.

264
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,380
Or somebody is standing near you,

265
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:43,890
his left Swadisthana 
– “Oh my God, it is this one!”

266
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:50,030
If somebody is very angry 
and hot tempered,

267
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,640
immediately you’ll feel such 
heat from that person,

268
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,430
you’ll say, “Oh baba, 
I’ll run away from this man.”

269
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,690
So this is a new

270
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,290
realm you have entered into reality,

271
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,560
which you are never aware of before.

272
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:18,590
Now supposing there’s a very 
bad man standing near you.

273
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,890
He might be a thief, he might 
be a murderer, anything

274
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,250
– you will not be even 
conscious of it

275
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,880
leave alone aware, normally.

276
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,320
But once you are a realized soul,

277
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:42,850
you become aware of the whole.

278
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,370
That is reality.

279
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:51,100
What are the problems, 
in the collective

280
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,930
you become aware of the collective.

281
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,430
You become aware of the 
problems of the whole world.

282
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,210
Now, this awareness is 
very different.

283
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,660
The first awareness as 
I told you is like this,

284
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,870
that if somebody tells you 
you are this and this,

285
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,470
you become aware of it.

286
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,210
In this nobody has to tell you;

287
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,400
it’s just there.

288
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,800
You are there, you know what it is.

289
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:45,680
And this is what you have 
achieved in these modern times,

290
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,950
which is the blessing 
of the modern times also,

291
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:55,330
that we know now who we are.

292
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:01,580
You always say, “We are the pure 
spirit,” yesterday also I heard it.

293
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,910
Are you sure?

294
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,970
What makes you believe that,

295
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,090
that you are the pure spirit?

296
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,600
I mean, you haven’t seen 
your spirit, have you?

297
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,500
You haven’t seen yourself 
what you are.

298
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:25,130
Then how do you say you 
are the pure spirit?

299
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:31,850
It’s just you are saying 
something because I say so.

300
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:40,470
But you are the pure spirit, 
because whatever the description

301
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,220
of the pure spirit is given

302
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,770
that it is aware

303
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:54,290
of the divine Power.

304
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,210
It is aware of the divine Power,

305
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:04,210
and that is how you 
are the pure spirit;

306
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,040
because only 
through pure spirit

307
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,020
as your personality

308
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:19,020
you can be aware of this 
all-pervading Power.

309
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:27,340
This is written in all the shastras, 
in all the scriptures everywhere.

310
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:31,190
And what do you know 
about yourself?

311
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:40,020
– that you are the spirit, because 
you know about your own chakras,

312
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,860
you know about your own nadis.

313
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:50,050
Now, what has happened is that 
you are separated from your self

314
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,450
and you can see your self.

315
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:59,650
You see yourself very clearly,

316
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:11,250
and you start seeing yourself as the 
present and the past and the future.

317
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,930
“In the past what I was” 
– you see, you’re shocked now

318
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,730
“my goodness, I was like this.”

319
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,160
You see it through this 
present state,

320
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,570
in the present state you see.

321
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:33,890
Then you start forgetting it, 
“Forget the past, forget the past.”

322
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,810
Then still you have the future;

323
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:47,040
then you start thinking 
about the future.

324
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,890
First, future they think 
about their own

325
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,290
children, their wives 
- Sahaja yogis also

326
00:28:54,650 --> 00:29:01,370
– “What will happen to my children, 
what will happen to my wife?”

327
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:07,360
Then they think, “What will 
happen to Sahaja Yoga?”

328
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,320
Then they think, “What 
will happen to Mataji?”

329
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,860
Also they think, “What will 
happen to this world?”

330
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:27,330
Because your awareness 
has expanded,

331
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,320
you are not in the limited 
sphere now anymore.

332
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,090
You can think of your children, 
you can think of your wife,

333
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,870
also you can think 
of the whole world

334
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:47,540
and all the problems of 
the world you think about.

335
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,420
So you have reached 
that state, all right;

336
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,910
up to that state we are.

337
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,870
Now what is the thing

338
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,730
that covers up all this 
or gives you solutions,

339
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,380
say, for your children, for your 
family, your wife, everyone

340
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,070
– what is the solution?

341
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,960
Your Mother believes in giving 
solutions, not only the problems

342
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:27,640
Because these days 
there are not problems

343
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,710
that existed in the Navaratri.

344
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,710
They no more exist,

345
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:42,590
that you can take a sword 
in your hand and go and

346
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,410
kill someone; no, it doesn’t,

347
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:49,990
it’s not possible – cut what?

348
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:56,270
So the today’s problem 
as they are, as we see

349
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:01,940
– within us we see the problems,

350
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:06,960
we are aware of it and we 
want to do something about it.

351
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,250
Whether we are in the past, 
present or future,

352
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,280
we see the problem.

353
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,540
So now what is the solution?

354
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:31,020
We have no weapons, 
nothing to fight.

355
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,930
We don’t know also, 
so many do not

356
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,850
know even how to hold 
a sword in the hand,

357
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,610
nd so many don’t 
even want to hold it;

358
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:46,730
because they are so 
much in compassion,

359
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,500
in the ocean of compassion 
enjoying themselves nicely.

360
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,290
They are enjoying their own 
compassion and compassion of others,

361
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,170
compassion of their Mother.

362
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,300
But then how to solve the problem?

363
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,100
The problem can be solved

364
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:15,710
if you become very 
powerful yourself within.

365
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:21,890
Where is your attention?

366
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,410
You have to move inward.

367
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,240
Where is your attention?

368
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:36,690
You have to become very powerful.

369
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,490
I have done My job, I have 
given you realization.

370
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,230
You have grown so much, 
I have explained to you,

371
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,280
I’ve told you everything 
– it’s done.

372
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:54,540
I have given you lots of love,

373
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,380
ocean of love I should say 
as you call it, whatever it is.

374
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:05,510
But now you have to 
nourish yourself.

375
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:10,590
You have to become 
powerful within yourself.

376
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:17,540
So what is the way you 
can become powerful?

377
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,020
First you must believe

378
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:30,010
that you have transcended 
your human personality

379
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:35,820
and you have now become 
a super-human being.

380
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:45,790
First of all this must come in.

381
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,390
This is what we call as faith.

382
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:54,460
This faith is not false 
faith, is not blind faith

383
00:33:54,750 --> 00:34:00,620
that you believe into 
something, but it’s a fact.

384
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,530
I have a hundred times, 
I have told you

385
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,930
that you have first of all 
faith in your ascent

386
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,190
in your position as Sahaja yogis.

387
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,680
For this meditation is 
very important,

388
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,940
very important.

389
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:31,140
Without meditation you cannot 
have full faith in yourself,

390
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,980
because you can’t know yourself

391
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,040
by saying, “Who am I?” You cannot.

392
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:47,080
You try now, ask a question within, 
“Who am I?” – you’ll be lost.

393
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,970
So what 
should be the faith then?

394
00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:00,790
because when you ask the question 
“Who am I?” you are lost.

395
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:11,520
So we reach a stage 
where I have to tell you

396
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:19,140
that faith is not mental, it is 
not emotional, it is not physical,

397
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:25,890
but it is a state of your own being

398
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:31,370
which we can call as 
a spiritual state.

399
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,490
In the spiritual state

400
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:47,740
nothing can disturb you,

401
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,190
nothing can overpower you,

402
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:57,320
nothing can dominate you;

403
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:02,910
because that state if you have,

404
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:09,750
that means you are part 
and parcel of reality.

405
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:18,890
Then you are a honored member 
of the God’s kingdom.

406
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:29,780
Then you are the most 
revered personality.

407
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,580
Then you are like a deity.

408
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,140
Then you are like a gana.

409
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:45,500
In that state when you are 
– it’s a state, again I say,

410
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:49,860
beyond the human state

411
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,550
– you are extremely powerful.

412
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,750
There’s a story about 
Nizamuddin – great Auliya,

413
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,950
great Sufi in India.

414
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:13,140
There was a horrible king

415
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,750
I think what Shah he called himself;

416
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:22,610
and he would not go and bow 
to him. So he was very angry.

417
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,530
He said, “I can only bow 
to God and to nobody else.”

418
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:32,120
This Shah said, “If you don’t come 
and bow to me tomorrow,

419
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:35,620
I will cut your throat.”

420
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:40,920
And that night, the throat 
of this king was cut.

421
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:46,330
It’s a story, but it’s a real story.

422
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,670
Somebody came and cut his throat 
– it was not Nizamuddhin Sahib;

423
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:57,080
he would not do that.

424
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,580
So that state if you reach,

425
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:10,800
what we call is 
the state of shraddha,

426
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:18,410
state of shraddha

427
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:25,160
which is enlightened, 
enlightened faith.

428
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:34,630
It’s a new type of mechanism;

429
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:44,700
that is, you become part 
and parcel of the whole.

430
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:49,440
That means the moon, the star…see

431
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:55,040
I tell you, I never told the sun that 
it should be there for the pujas,

432
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,960
I never told, last time, 
I never tell him.

433
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:02,610
There’s no need to tell, 
it’s all done.

434
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:08,660
I don’t tell all these vibrations

435
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,940
to make a cross or to show these, 
all these miraculous photographs.

436
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,740
I don’t there’s no need to tell;

437
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:25,770
they just do it by themselves 
I am sometimes surprised

438
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,890
how ingenious methods 
they have of their own,

439
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:32,550
how they manage things 
– I am myself surprised.

440
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:36,490
I didn’t tell them that 
these two persons

441
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,790
who were selected by this award

442
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,950
should be so condemned 
by every newspaper.

443
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,650
It all works automatically,

444
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,880
it just works.

445
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:59,120
Only thing if I have anything is 
just complete, complete faith

446
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,240
that I am at that state,

447
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:07,530
and that’s why there is 
complete patience, saburi,

448
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,580
complete patience.

449
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,630
And that is what we have to learn.

450
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:26,840
It will all happen in any case 
because you are all at that state.

451
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,980
Only meditation is important, 
very important;

452
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,350
for Me not, but for you all.

453
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:38,190
If you all can meditate now,

454
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:45,990
just for ten minutes also every day,

455
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,370
it will help you a lot.

456
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:57,050
Now, why do we have all these 
statues and, I mean the Mother

457
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:02,500
and the Hanumana 
and Ganesha, Christ?

458
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,340
Because to begin with, 
human beings cannot

459
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:11,220
understand anything which 
does not have a form.

460
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:18,410
They cannot go deeper unless 
and until there’s a form.

461
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,480
But they went to another 
limit of using any stone,

462
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:26,080
anything, as God and all that.

463
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,990
But now you have discretion:

464
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,850
you know what is to be worshipped,

465
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:41,920
what is to be treated as a higher 
personality – that you know.

466
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:47,080
But before that they would 
worship all kinds of people,

467
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:51,550
like now people worship pope, 
you know that very well.

468
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,420
But now what to do?

469
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,970
They are not only blind,

470
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:03,730
they are not only unaware, but 
they are also not conscious of it.

471
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,400
They are all at such a level 
that you cannot tell them.

472
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:13,430
So you are a new type 
of people I should say,

473
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:18,450
who have tried to fight 
it out, to struggle out,

474
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:23,340
to know about the absolute truth.

475
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,810
Unless and until you know 
the absolute truth,

476
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,770
you are nowhere;

477
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:39,150
you have no discretion, you have no 
understanding, you have no wisdom.

478
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:43,110
But once you know the absolute truth,

479
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:48,800
then you should not by any chance

480
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:52,660
be halfway this and halfway that.

481
00:42:53,360 --> 00:43:00,290
That’s a very dangerous 
state of affairs.

482
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:08,040
Say a seed is sprouted, it is 
neither a seed nor a tree.

483
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:14,620
If it doesn’t grow it is useless.

484
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,320
That’s happens to your 
awareness – I am again talking

485
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,920
of your consciousness, awareness

486
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:31,260
– and then you are neither 
here nor there.

487
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:38,610
There are many people who come 
to Sahaja Yoga perhaps, maybe

488
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,510
to find some peace.

489
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,380
But I get letters:

490
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:50,050
“My father is sick, my mother is 
sick, my sister is sick.”

491
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:55,160
Then otherwise, “My husband is fighting 
with me, I am seeking a divorce.”

492
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,650
Or thirdly, “I’ve lost all my money,

493
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:00,530
I must have some money.”

494
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,430
Fourthly, “I am a great artist but I,

495
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:06,420
my art is not selling.”

496
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:11,750
All these stupid problems 
they bring for Me.

497
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:17,240
Hah – “My children are no good, 
they are troublesome.”

498
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,460
Then, “My wife is fighting with me,

499
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,400
my mother is fighting with 
me, brother is fighting.”

500
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,220
But I said, “What sort 
of Sahaja yogis these are?”

501
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:36,810
The state of being one 
with the reality

502
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:45,570
means that the whole 
of reality is at your feet,

503
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,770
whole of it works for you;

504
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:55,730
and once you even 
get a glimpse of that state

505
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:03,230
I tell you, you become so much 
peaceful within yourself.

506
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,400
If you say, “I am the king, 
I am the king,”

507
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:15,940
if you say, “I am the beggar, 
I am the beggar,”

508
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,400
what difference does it 
make to that state

509
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:24,880
which is like a purest of pure gold,

510
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,990
which cannot be tarnished?

511
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,100
Such a state of mind 
we have to develop.

512
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:41,350
It’s a more a challenge to us.

513
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:44,970
We are Sahaja yogis, all right.

514
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:48,560
We have got realization, all right.

515
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:52,310
We can sing very well, all right.

516
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:56,100
We have achieved good 
positions, all right.

517
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:00,000
We are nicely married, all right.

518
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:03,470
We’ve got nice children, 
we have got everything,

519
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,960
we have got jobs, this that.

520
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:13,160
Now, suddenly one negative force 
comes in to trouble you – so what?

521
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:18,890
So what?

522
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:26,630
Otherwise how will you 
know what you are?

523
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:32,490
If there is no darkness, how will 
you know you are the light?

524
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:44,670
It’s a challenge to your own 
state, at what state you are.

525
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:51,090
The word “state” is not so 
explanatory. In Sanskrit is swarupa,

526
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,710
swarupa

527
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:03,550
– “swa” is yourself 
and “rupa” is form or state.

528
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:11,310
That state is possible 
for all of you

529
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:18,290
by saying “Not this, not this, 
not this, not this.”

530
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:28,460
As it is, your mind has reached 
that state that there is no mind

531
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:31,130
– you can do that.

532
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:38,060
But you have to develop 
a kind of a personality

533
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:42,290
that realizes what you are.

534
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:49,240
But in that realization

535
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:54,340
you are just aware of it,

536
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,610
not conscious of it.

537
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:59,610
Ah, for example I’ll tell you,

538
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,690
I am aware that I am Adi Shakti 
– I am aware, I know.

539
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:10,420
But when you say “Jai Shri Mataji” 
I also say “Jai Shri Mataji,”

540
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:15,220
forgetting that I am the 
one you are talking about.

541
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:23,490
This is actually, 
should be the state:

542
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,330
that you are aware, yes, you 
are aware in the sense, in the

543
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,100
- I don’t know how to say 
- but I am aware I am that.

544
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,760
If you ask Me, “Mother, 
are You Adi Shakti?”

545
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:41,680
I said, “Yes, I am” - because 
I know that, that I am.

546
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:45,400
But when you say 
“Jai Shri Mataji” I forget that

547
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:50,690
I am Adi Shakti and I also say 
“Jai Shri Mataji” with you.

548
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:57,770
I forget; I have to tell, 
“No, no, You can’t say

549
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,670
It’s very interesting.

550
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,720
Now, you make Me sit 
here like a queen

551
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,820
and give Me a presents, 
this thing, that thing;

552
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:14,410
I mean, all right, that’s your idea.

553
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:26,240
But to Me, you see, I am 
complete in Myself, I think so.

554
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:33,510
This in Hindi: “Me kahenge ki 
hum apne hi andar samma gaye”

555
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:40,030
- “ I am got lost into Myself.”

556
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,680
All right, you do this, all right; 
you should do that, all right.

557
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,300
If you don’t do it, it’s all right.

558
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:52,660
To Me it makes no difference; 
it may make difference to you,

559
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,950
but to Me it does not.

560
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,770
I have been saying that don’t 
give Me any presents,

561
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,320
don’t give Me any 
presents, all these days.

562
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:02,580
So the only argument is that

563
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:06,380
“In whole year we give You once, 
so why should You, Mother, object?

564
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,450
because that gives us joy.”

565
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,480
All right, if you think 
it gives you joy, do it,

566
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:15,160
but to Me it doesn’t matter.

567
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:22,990
Because I don’t think I am there.

568
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:30,490
I am just seeing you 
sitting here, all right

569
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,260
– they are all realized souls, all right

570
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:39,420
– but I am one of you.

571
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:43,670
I don’t think I am very special.

572
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:48,980
But if you ask Me then I will say, 
“All right, I am Adi Shakti.”

573
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:52,860
But I don’t think Adi Shakti 
is very special also,

574
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,460
because I’ve no mind.

575
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:01,060
But otherwise I don’t think 
it’s something special;

576
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,720
because somebody is 
something, so what?

577
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:11,320
Now supposing sun is 
sun, so what? – He’s a sun.

578
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:16,250
If somebody is Adi Shakti 
– so Adi Shakti, so what?

579
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:20,700
But for you it is creditable

580
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:27,560
because you were not born 
realized, you got your realization.

581
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:33,150
So you are special, you are great,

582
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:35,610
you have achieved something. 
I’ve achieved nothing;

583
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:39,530
I have been like this and 
I will be like this.

584
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:45,920
Whether I fight the devils 
or I sit before

585
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:48,970
you makes no difference, 
I will be like this.

586
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:54,840
But for Me you are great, 
because you have achieved this.

587
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:58,970
Today to see you 
on this Navaratri day,

588
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,400
so many people sitting 
to worship Me;

589
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,770
so many people are here,

590
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:13,880
so many Sahaja yogis 
- it’s so remarkable.

591
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:16,880
It’s not My achievement I tell you,

592
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,930
it’s your seeking.

593
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:22,590
Because I have been on this 
earth many a times before

594
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:26,350
that you know.

595
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,330
But we never had like this.

596
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:33,310
So many came, got crucified, 
died, this, that,

597
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,510
but I never had people of this kind.

598
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:42,500
So again we come 
to the same point,

599
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:50,510
that we should be aware 
of ourselves

600
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:55,040
– complete shraddha 
in yourself.

601
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,190
If you have some shraddha 
in yourself,

602
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,320
you’ll have shraddha about Me also,

603
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:06,940
because we are not different.

604
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:11,900
If you believe this is water,

605
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:13,500
then everywhere there is water

606
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,820
I believe that that is 
water, isn’t it?

607
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:19,910
Because I know this is water,

608
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:25,320
so wherever in the world there 
is water, I know it is water.

609
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:29,560
So if you know you are 
a Sahaja yogi,

610
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:35,270
anywhere there is a Sahaja yogi 
you know there is a Sahaja yogi,

611
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:41,100
But as far as you are 
concerned you forget

612
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,290
how great you are, 
and how far you can go.

613
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,810
I am very proud of you, 
you don’t know.

614
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:55,940
But because I am a humble person,

615
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,910
I don’t know how to show off

616
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:07,880
– so I have such nice children, 
so many of them, so lovable.

617
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:16,100
Those bhaktas for whom She killed 
so many demons and all that

618
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,200
were not like you.

619
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:24,100
You are much better, 
much higher,

620
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:26,730
of a much greater quality.

621
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:31,210
But you must know that you are,

622
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:37,310
and don’t behave like 
those people who

623
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:42,320
were of a very rudimentary nature.

624
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:46,870
You are grown up, 
you have prospered,

625
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:51,120
and now the fruits we can see.

626
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,630
I don’t know what to 
do for you, really.

627
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:00,790
But have faith in yourself.

628
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:07,010
Then you will see how much 
faith you will have in reality,

629
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:10,790
that there is reality with 
you at every step,

630
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:13,710
every moment.

631
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,350
No fear,

632
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:25,460
no sense of achievement - nothing.

633
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,000
Done now, finished.

634
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:32,570
When there were five 
Sahaja yogis I was happy,

635
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:34,610
when there are so many, I am happy.

636
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:39,850
But I, when I see so many, I think

637
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:49,100
there are so many powerful 
personalities who are one with reality.

638
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:57,730
This collective oneness 
was never so.

639
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:05,140
And so I would say that on this day

640
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,840
what we have to do is to 
kill the devils within ourselves;

641
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:14,150
that’s all.

642
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:18,450
If you want to really worship Me,

643
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:23,040
that’s what you have to think, 
what are the devils within you

644
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,110
– that’s all.

645
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:28,090
So you don’t have to worry 
otherwise for outside devils,

646
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:30,810
they cannot do anything to you.

647
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:36,310
May God bless you.
