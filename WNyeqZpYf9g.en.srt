1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:15,209
I hope you are all very comfortable now and
that you are enjoying the food as well. [Applause]

2
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:25,910
Also we are approaching the fag end of our
tour. This tour was arranged, as you know,

3
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:35,649
like a journey through your Shushumna Nadi.
At different, different points different,

4
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:41,300
different Chakras in the same way we have
passed through various places and now we have

5
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:47,140
reached Ganapatipule where we have to get
our Sahasrara fully drenched with blessings

6
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:59,329
of Shri Ganesh. As you know Sahaja Yoga is
a very subtler happening within us. It's a

7
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:08,401
very subtler happening and this subtler happening
gives you sensitivity to Divine joy. When

8
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:13,500
you start getting the Divine joy you don't
care for any comforts, you don't care for

9
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,299
all worldly type of pleasure giving things.
To you, this becomes the most important thing

10
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:31,299
and the only thing. Apart from that you start
seeing the truth as it is. When I say you

11
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:40,750
start seeing the truth many people can misuse
this word. I've seen many people saying that

12
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:49,520
they can decide things on vibrations and they
have decided certain things on vibrations.

13
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,750
But they commit mistakes. That means they
have not yet grown up to that state where

14
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:02,729
they can decide on vibrations. So nobody should
arbitrarily decide but consult the collective,

15
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:10,230
especially your leaders to find out if whatever
decision you have taken, whatever you have

16
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:18,610
thought of, is it all right or not. And one
may commit lots of mistakes if you start behaving

17
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:27,160
arbitrarily. The greatest law of Sahaja Yoga
is that it is a collective happening.

18
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,500
Now as you have seen here people are from
abroad, people are from Delhi, people are

19
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,860
from Calcutta, people from Bombay, people
from villages, people from various places.

20
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:45,670
The idea of all of you coming here is to,
is to create the understanding of the collective.

21
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:50,940
As people start becoming collective and collective
they do not bother others, they do not trouble

22
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:57,620
others, but they give joy to others. They
are not bothered about their going and coming,

23
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:07,420
their eating and everything, they just don't
behave like mundane, usual type of people.

24
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:14,200
But they are very patient, Saburi as they
call it. They are in the patience. Now this

25
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:25,420
patience is most joy giving. Patience gives
you the greatest joy. When you are patient

26
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:32,550
you develop all your qualities. I think in
patience you blossom the best. But patience

27
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:40,870
is not be patient, be patient. Patience is
also a kind of a state within us with just

28
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:49,690
this patience, Saburi as they call it. You
just watch and see. Wherever you are you are.

29
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:56,400
Now some people are worried that they must
get into the bus. Some people are worried

30
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,530
they must reach back home. Some people are
worried they must get their food in time.

31
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:07,740
According to them this is discipline. This
is not. This is conditioning. But what is

32
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:15,370
the discipline is of patience in Sahaja Yoga.
Where you watch everything and you are patient.

33
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,560
If you are in the bus you are there. If you
are standing on the road you are there. If

34
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,550
you are walking on the road you are there.
On the contrary it is a good idea to walk.

35
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:30,730
I wish I could but I can't because once I
start walking everybody will fall at My feet.

36
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:40,700
Nobody will spare Me. So I am just imprisoned
inside the house, inside the room all day

37
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,090
long because I just can't come out as soon
as I come out I find there hosts of people

38
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:51,880
standing outside. But your case is not such.
You are free people. You are not bound like

39
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:59,681
Me. So it's nice to walk a little bit in the
evening time, it's a good idea. It’s a very

40
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:04,760
good idea, leisurely you can walk, that will
digest your food. The food is rather heavy

41
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:12,380
sometimes. It makes you feel better and just
know that you are walking that's all. To feel

42
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,350
that I have to walk, I have to go there, once
you start thinking you get exhausted sitting

43
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:24,040
here, even if you have not walked. So, it
is important that patience should be made

44
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,190
the discipline of life.

45
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:33,050
How much patient we are for anything, for
anything. Now as you can see, I have to sit

46
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:38,400
here before I don't come you can not start,
till I have to sit here till you finish. You

47
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,960
are all free you can get up, walk about, come
whenever you feel like I am not. And how do

48
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,270
I manage all this, is through My patience.
But patience is My quality. It's My nature

49
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:57,670
which I enjoy the most of all. Now I am sitting
here is nobody is there I am enjoying it.

50
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:08,930
If I am lost somewhere I enjoy it. If I lost
My way I enjoy it because I am there to enjoy

51
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:15,810
Myself. So I think we should make a practice
now the Moon is out, beautiful moonlit nights,

52
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,530
try to walk down, especially the Delhi people
must walk. They don't just walk. In Delhi

53
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:26,020
is all right because you can not walk about,
there is danger and all that but here is better.

54
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,280
You better walk your health will improve.
Sahaja Yoga will improve. Kundalini will improve.

55
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,340
You'll feel much better.

56
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:42,639
That's the good part of this remote place
that nobody sees you. Nobody is bothered about

57
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,120
you. You can live whatever way you like you
can walk the way you like. There is nobody

58
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,169
to bother. There is no need to have a competition
or run about but just leisurely if you walk

59
00:06:52,169 --> 00:07:00,430
it is a good idea. I am not saying just to
save some money out of the buses. But it is

60
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:06,590
just to make you feel more healthy, just sitting
all the time one feels very funny sit here,

61
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:12,060
sit there, sit there, going in a taxi, going
in a bus, going in a lift, you just don't

62
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,770
move your legs. There is no exercise also
in Sahaja Yoga. Walking is the best exercise

63
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:24,470
for all the Sahaja Yogis as I told you. And
that's why it is important that you all should

64
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:30,680
try to walk a little bit, if possible. For
there are ladies who have children, that is

65
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:38,850
all right, old ladies, old men but even them
it's a good idea to walk half a way and then

66
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:43,889
you can go by buses. Something like that try
to adjust yourself for these three, four days.

67
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:53,080
You'll feel much better. I promise you will
feel much better when you walk now.

68
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:04,620
And another thing, which one has to learn
apart from Saburi from the patience. One has

69
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:13,630
to imbibe within one self is the sweetness.
If you are sweet you are filled with humor,

70
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:23,389
you do not hurt others, you are not hurt either,
you see everything so beautiful and nice,

71
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:32,110
that's the quality of Shri Krishna, Madhurya.
Anything can be done with sweetness. That's

72
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:37,250
very important. Now some people might say,
“Mother, sometimes You have to get angry

73
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,589
and all that.” There, is no need for you
that I can do that dirty job. You don't have

74
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:49,450
to. You don't have to get angry with anyone.
You just show your patience, your love, your

75
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,620
kindness, your sweetness. That is how the
personality of Sahaja Yoga, which is a collective

76
00:08:53,620 --> 00:09:00,190
being, is to be built by people who have patience,
who are sweet outwardly, inwardly.

77
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:08,480
And the third one is the genuineness. Without
genuineness we can not enter into ourselves

78
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,270
because our inner being knows what we are.
If there is hypocrisy, if there is just showing

79
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:23,571
off or if there is a kind of a reservation
within us we can not enter inside us. Also

80
00:09:23,571 --> 00:09:30,040
the people who come in contact with such people
can not progress. So one has to be very genuine

81
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,090
about it and this is an individual quality,
is not a Samuhik [MEANS collective –SG]

82
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:40,210
quality. It is not a collective quality. All
of us have to be genuine within ourselves

83
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:46,540
because it is for our gain, for our Hitha.
So we have to be collective because it is

84
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:53,040
good for us. We have to be patient because
it is good for us and we have to be genuine

85
00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:00,320
because it is good for us. It’s all Swartha.
It is all the meaning of Swa, Swartha, Swa

86
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,790
means ourselves, and Artha means the meaning.
And Swartha also means selfishness but actually

87
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,440
it is self, and self and self.

88
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:18,400
Now you are changed people. Your personality
is different. It's shining through your Spirit.

89
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:24,200
In that Spirit you have to see everything.
All your conditionings will drop out as soon

90
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,400
as you start identifying your Self fully,
fully with the Spirit. Fully again I say because

91
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:37,399
we do not, we are still Christians, we are
still Hindus, we are still Muslims. We are

92
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:47,360
still Indians, English this that. We are still
narrow-minded small little puddles. We have

93
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:56,230
to be the ocean. Once you are identified with
the ocean we have to throw away everything

94
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:04,360
and become absolutely clean and detached,
Nisanga. So when we are singing all these

95
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,780
songs we are saying this. It should not be
a lip service. It should be flow in our heart.

96
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:15,600
We should feel it. But I am happy that your
Spirits are shining and the Spirit is enjoying

97
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,430
and that you are moving very smoothly upward.
Little push will help you more and understanding

98
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,240
about it.

99
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:29,910
This time it has been a much better seminar
as I have seen it. We must have a proper seminar,

100
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:35,560
may be tomorrow morning we might try to have
a proper seminar of this brain trust or something

101
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:41,130
but most of the people who are coming will
be really coming tomorrow. So I don't know

102
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,460
may be tomorrow evening you can have brain
trust. They’ll be coming tomorrow sometime,

103
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,899
there’s hardly any time for a seminar which
I would like you all to sit down and have

104
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:56,440
a proper brain trust or something or you can
have it tomorrow morning and also you can

105
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,171
have it day after tomorrow sometime. So something
can be arranged by the leaders and all the

106
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:06,530
leaders of the world should meet and should
do it.

107
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:16,360
As the program stands it is so. But in Sahaja
Yoga programs are never just the same. Changing

108
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:25,089
is the sign of life. As I told you a little
root has got a very little small tiny cell

109
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:30,839
at the end of it which is very discreet and
it changes its course according to the way

110
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,350
it can penetrate into the Mother Earth. If
there is a big boulder it goes round and round

111
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:43,060
and round to create a bondage for it later
on for the tree to stand on. Then it goes

112
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:49,790
into all various areas in a proper manner
whichever way the best and Sahaj. In the same

113
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:55,410
way it's a living process and whatever works
out has to be worked out in that manner. Sometimes

114
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,930
you might sleep at ten o'clock, sometimes
you may sleep at one o'clock. Sometimes you

115
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:06,320
may sleep at anytime. It depends on whatever
way the things are moving. We have to be prepared

116
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,430
for everything in a very sweet manner with
an enjoyable manner.

117
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:18,810
So once, we start deciding that we are going
to be great Sahaja Yogis, we are here to be

118
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:27,830
the Nirmalites, to fight all that is wrong,
to stand for right and to emancipate the whole

119
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:36,020
humanity. If you understand the tremendous
work we have to do, then you will create your

120
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:43,470
own personalities in such way that you will
be able to shoulder this great responsibility.

121
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:53,740
So let us see, today is the beginning of this
understanding between us that we are not going

122
00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:03,120
to grow by demanding, by asking, by getting
worried about ourselves. But just be enjoy,

123
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,930
just be enjoy and this is what is lacking
in some people and that's why they cannot

124
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,620
enjoy. They are all the time worried how will
they reach there, how will they come here,

125
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,500
what is the arrangement, what's this, what
is that. Just take it easy and things will

126
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,660
work out for you. That's how you are going
to enjoy life.

127
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,700
May God bless you all!
