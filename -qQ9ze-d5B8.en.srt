1
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,960
so

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,000
once you are left shruti is absolutely

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,439
jammed

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,800
you lose complete discretion

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,920
of the chakra here

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,519
which we call it hamsa

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,920
and then you do not know what is

8
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,680
distracted what is constructive

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,120
you start accepting mostly the

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,239
destructive thing

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,239
if you are left with this man escape

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,280
so what what wrong

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,280
that is how violence has come

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,520
that is how all kind of cheating

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,120
corruption

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,120
has come what's wrong because if you do

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,520
anything wrong we put it there finished

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,800
stored up again you do anything you put

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,920
it there and

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:12,320
till you become absolutely immune to all

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:15,759
destructive action you go on

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:19,280
so to get out of it what to do

23
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,240
to get out of this horrible state where

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,360
you do not feel

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,400
any uh

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,759
thing wrong

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,600
what is the thing is only is to take to

28
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,960
sahaja yoga

29
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:40,560
in a right fashion first of all

30
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,079
you must face yourself if you start

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,600
facing yourself

32
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,240
you will realize that you have committed

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,240
a mistake

34
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,159
so this is the mistake i have committed

35
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,240
doesn't matter

36
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,079
i am not going to feel guilty about it

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,799
if i ever have to do this

38
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,560
i will not do it and i am not guilty for

39
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,960
whatever has happened is the past

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,960
finished

41
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,200
with this faith in yourself

42
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,280
you can definitely get rid of your

43
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,959
leftish

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,720
the problem is even if i tell you

45
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,920
something i'm

46
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,440
worried that you start feeling guilty

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,360
about it also

48
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,480
i mean i'm telling you for something for

49
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,520
your correction

50
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,360
then you start to guilty ah mother is

51
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,040
saying so she i did this and

52
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,800
but that you did at this moment

53
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,120
what i'm telling you never to do it

54
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,560
again

55
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,920
and face it whatever he did is finished

56
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,760
and gone and is forgiven completely

57
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,760
otherwise vishnu maya will take over

58
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:53,440
this is very important because

59
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:57,120
one side is a leela

60
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,560
it's a play and it's

61
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,280
all the world is beautiful the another

62
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,720
side

63
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,519
is the guilt

64
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,840
so we think that by just feeling guilty

65
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,840
we are solving all our problems

66
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,080
and this side we are enjoying ourselves

67
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,280
and this the guilt part is just like a

68
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,879
storehouse of a garbage

69
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,120
big buddha but we never think this

70
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,640
garbage what it is wrong it is doing to

71
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,599
us

72
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,000
and this is what it is that vishnu maya

73
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,200
has to burn this garbage

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,519
then she works in her

75
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,200
own ways in her own maya ways and so

76
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,959
many things happen

77
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,560
like there was a lady and she was very

78
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,560
right-sided

79
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,000
she used to dominate everyone but nobody

80
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,280
dared tell her that because if

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,879
you tell her she would come back on you

82
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,799
so nobody wanted to tell her what's

83
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,400
wrong with her they said all right let

84
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,560
it be now

85
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
but i told her that see you are very

86
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,480
right sided you are dominating everyone

87
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,599
everybody is frightened of it

88
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,959
so she said no mother i am not

89
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,080
i am telling you you better believe me

90
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,760
or

91
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,920
you are in for trouble and that very day

92
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,840
she was getting down from the staircase

93
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,799
and she fell from top to bottom she came

94
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,199
down

95
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,239
and on her right side she came to

96
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,360
madarashi

97
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,560
my right hand is broken my right leg is

98
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,479
broken

99
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,600
this is broken that is broken

100
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,000
i said then you know what happened i now

101
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,040
know

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,040
why it has happened then i cured her

103
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,960
she was all right but what i am trying

104
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,720
to tell you that she wouldn't listen to

105
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,160
me

106
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,960
so the right sided people have a special

107
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,520
capacity to put everything here

108
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:56,240
so i always say that it is the

109
00:04:51,520 --> 00:05:00,560
byproduct of ego

110
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:05,199
those people who try to dominate who try

111
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:08,880
to be angry try to control everyone

112
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:13,039
they put it down there and

113
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,039
then the whole thing works against them

114
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,479
this is to be understood in a very

115
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,919
serious manner

116
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,919
that feeling guilty is not that you are

117
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,240
harming yourself but you are harming all

118
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,240
others

119
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,840
also this vishnu maya gets very upset

120
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:36,160
with two other things

121
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,800
one of the things is smoking

122
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,360
if you smoke too much then this vishnu

123
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,039
maya

124
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,479
gets very angry she

125
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:51,520
she is the one who then causes cancer

126
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,680
she can spoil your throat

127
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,240
all kinds of ear nose throat problems

128
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,919
can come in with the smoking

129
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:03,039
because she doesn't like that smoke

130
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:06,479
she once twice

131
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,280
tries but once you start smoking then

132
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,880
after some time

133
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,919
what's wrong they will quote such and

134
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,759
such man

135
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,680
who is 83 he still smokes

136
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,919
see coating like this they have ideas

137
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,240
like that then you have also some cinema

138
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,080
of

139
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,240
heroes such and such man see

140
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,759
he murdered his wife he's not you see

141
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,039
he's going along

142
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,919
so we should also murder we should also

143
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,319
smoke

144
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,880
so the all ideals which have destroyed

145
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,280
themselves become our ideas

146
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,400
and we start exactly doing what they are

147
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,880
doing

148
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,600
without knowing that how they are

149
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,280
destroyed

150
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:51,599
will be also destroyed so

151
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,880
this understanding

152
00:06:51,599 --> 00:07:00,160
about vishnu maya's powers

153
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:04,400
should be there with us that if we try

154
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:07,440
to continue with our mistakes

155
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,440
and putting them here

156
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:14,479
then first thing we become vulnerable

157
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,240
to all kinds of diseases with that if

158
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,639
you have smoke

159
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,599
smoking you can become also

160
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,919
very much vulnerable to cancer of the

161
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,919
throat

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,880
another thing which people do not know

163
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,160
is the mantras

164
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,919
if you go on saying any mantra

165
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,919
i mean in india there are people who

166
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,840
will every day morning get up and say

167
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:45,280
some mantra for about say

168
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,199
hundred times some say it at least 300

169
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,960
times 500 times

170
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,280
they go on measuring mantra mantra

171
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,720
mantra mantra like that

172
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,120
now she's the mantrika

173
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,479
she's the one who gives the power to the

174
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,840
mantra

175
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,720
now if you are not connected

176
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,000
to this divine power then there's a

177
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,440
short-circuiting

178
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,160
take place and if you go on saying this

179
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,919
mantra

180
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,000
you develop all the troubles of the

181
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,919
throat throat cancer

182
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,680
you can develop also stomach in the

183
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,319
stomach problems because

184
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,440
it is krishna and vishnu are the same

185
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,000
you might develop

186
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:29,039
also the problem of virata

187
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,560
because you are

188
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:36,240
reciting a mantra like this you see a

189
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,560
telephone if it is not connected

190
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,800
i go on using it the telephone will go

191
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,560
out of order

192
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,120
in the same way if you are doing wrong

193
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:49,040
mantras

194
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,959
in the sense that the mantras which are

195
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,240
said before your connection with the

196
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,959
divine

197
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,200
then they can spoil your leftish very

198
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,200
much

199
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,600
this is the style they use in india

200
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,200
supposing

201
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,959
you are a businessman in india

202
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,480
now you're a big businessman you have

203
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,000
made a lot of money now i feel guilty

204
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,399
about it

205
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,959
because you are made by bad means also

206
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,560
by all kinds of black market and all

207
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:23,600
sorts so they'll make a big temple

208
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:25,839
of vishnu

209
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,920
not vishuddhi but they'll make a very

210
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,279
big temple of sri vishnu

211
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,360
and and they they will create

212
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,560
a kind of image that we they are great

213
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,320
religious people

214
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,120
or they they'll have hierarchies they

215
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,120
will distribute food to people

216
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,360
or distribute some things to people and

217
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,560
feel satisfied

218
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,080
here you go on committing any amount of

219
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,440
sins any amount of nonsense

220
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,880
and then out of that money

221
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:00,399
you make a little contribution

222
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,640
to sri vishnu thinking that steve vishnu

223
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,880
will be very happy and will not punish

224
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,760
them but he is kubera what can you give

225
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,440
it to him he is the kubera

226
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,600
he gives you all the money he does

227
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,279
everything so how can you

228
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:20,240
give anything to kubera who is

229
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:23,279
himself the lord of wealth

230
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,640
it's a very common thing in india like

231
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,040
uh there was a buddha thing i knew of a

232
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,760
man who was very corrupt very bad person

233
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,200
i mean

234
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,040
reidy was really very very bad man

235
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,360
and he had taken away so much land from

236
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,760
the poor farmers and all that

237
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:46,000
so he gave one land mahatma gandhi

238
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:49,120
and this land this buddha man was known

239
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,640
it was i think nobody gave this land

240
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:56,160
was so bad that you could not put

241
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,160
even cactus there

242
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,240
and he was telling everybody i have

243
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,240
given so much land to buddha and i've

244
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,760
given so much land

245
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:09,040
so trying to sort of justify himself

246
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,160
for taking all the land from the poor

247
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,680
and lynching them and then to

248
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:18,079
do this kind of a generosity so this is

249
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,200
another escape people have

250
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:25,519
that do what you like and ultimately

251
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:29,120
be generous this kind

252
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:33,120
of gracious covering

253
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:36,480
of your mistakes can be very misleading

254
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,320
it doesn't work with vishnu she knows

255
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,040
you out and out

256
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,720
and if you try all these tricks with her

257
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,000
she will show her

258
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,720
own powers i would say all our

259
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,279
left side problems come because of

260
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,600
vishnu my power

261
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:59,360
she punishes you as well as she exposes

262
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:03,120
as well as she gives you light as well

263
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,120
as she corrects you

264
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,160
with all these powers of shravaya we

265
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,920
should be very thankful

266
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:15,680
that today we are celebrating

267
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,519
her special puja

268
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,440
because i think it is one of the curses

269
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,079
of the best especially of americans to

270
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,959
feel guilty

271
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,079
so today you all have to promise in your

272
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,079
heart and the mantra

273
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,600
is now they all she also understand

274
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,480
english perhaps

275
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,440
you can say that mother i am not guilty

276
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,639
at all

277
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,639
that's all if that is said she will be

278
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,920
very happy i'm not guilty at all i'm not

279
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,760
going to feel guilty

280
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,760
once you stop feeling guilty you will

281
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,399
not do wrong things

282
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,600
because how will you manage because you

283
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,079
are not doing

284
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,839
you cannot put it as guilt so it was

285
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,000
just doing anything wrong if you do

286
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,360
wrong it comes on your head

287
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,560
you cannot put it in your leftish so

288
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,560
you won't do anything wrong

289
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,600
you will immediately understand that if

290
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,000
i have to do wrong i have to face it

291
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,600
but if there's a space here kept where

292
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,880
you can put your guilt

293
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,680
for your wrongdoings available

294
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,600
then you don't mind so much supposing

295
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,399
somebody has a small house no place to

296
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,079
store

297
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,680
then somebody brings something says no

298
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:26,000
no space here

299
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,000
i am already very full it's like that

300
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:35,120
so the best thing is to have

301
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,560
no guilt at any cost i will have no

302
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,839
guilt if i have done mistake all right

303
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,240
i'll admit i've done the mistake

304
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,440
and i'll have no guilt at all about it

305
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,199
i'll face it

306
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,440
you'll be surprised you'll stop doing

307
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,120
wrong things

308
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,120
definitely you stop because there's no

309
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,120
space left

310
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,120
so this is very important today to do

311
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,760
vishnu maya's thing

312
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:02,000
and i'm sure now very happy

313
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,959
with the tour of america this time i'm

314
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,760
really happy

315
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,480
because i think it has worked in most of

316
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,800
the places

317
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,959
very well and if it has not worked

318
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,000
one should not feel guilty but face the

319
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:19,199
problem why it has not worked

320
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,040
and the problem lies with sahaja yogis

321
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:26,079
and nobody else shouldn't blame anybody

322
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,399
else for it just see

323
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,160
yourself what mistakes you must have

324
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,240
committed could be a small or a big

325
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,440
mistake whatever it is

326
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,519
face it that's no harm in saying i am

327
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,079
i've done mistake

328
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,160
but if you say sorry means it goes

329
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,680
that's straightforward

330
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:49,279
no i have committed a mistake

331
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:52,160
to admit that is very gracious

332
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,000
very beautiful and very kind to yourself

333
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,920
for your penalties

334
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,079
in sahaja yoga is one of the biggest

335
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,560
mantras for all the western people

336
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,519
they should all the time saying to all

337
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,959
the trees

338
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:10,839
all the nature around i am not

339
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:13,199
guilty your ecological problem will

340
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,279
improve

341
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,199
because then you won't do wrong things

342
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,519
to spoil your ecology

343
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,199
you'll be careful because you spoil it

344
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,199
and you feel guilty oh i should not have

345
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,199
done this oh i should not

346
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,320
but why did you do in the first place is

347
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,079
the point

348
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,759
so now next time you are not going to do

349
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,160
it

350
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,839
so many of our problems will be solved

351
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,880
if you face them

352
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,199
and correct them boldly

353
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,120
it's possible for sahaja yogis because

354
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,680
you are separated from your being

355
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,480
you are away from it you can see your

356
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,880
body

357
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,519
you can see your mind you can see your

358
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,160
ego

359
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,399
you can see all of those things and you

360
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,279
know how to put them right

361
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,560
you are not that you know so you are the

362
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,360
spirit

363
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,920
with the light of the spirit you can

364
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,800
correct

365
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,360
all these things but this guilt is

366
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,320
something where it stops you completely

367
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,279
from correcting or doing anything better

368
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,120
about it

369
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:15,920
or bringing any constructive thing to

370
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,920
your own mind

371
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,199
this will solve many problems for

372
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,360
america

373
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,040
as well as for all the western world

374
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,560
same with the indians that they should

375
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,360
not think that if they

376
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,120
are generous a little bit uh they can

377
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,880
get rid of their mistakes you see they

378
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,720
have to face it

379
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,880
it's a different style indians are very

380
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,000
clever you know they know how to find

381
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:43,759
excuses and escapes but

382
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,759
after all it is vishnu maya

383
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,560
she will show you that there is no

384
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,399
escape just face it

385
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,079
there is no need to condemn yourself

386
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,800
don't need to

387
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,120
uh in any way degrade yourself or to

388
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,000
feel

389
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,399
inferior but to be superior as the

390
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,399
spiritual i see oh

391
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,799
like i would say all right well i see

392
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,360
you very well you did this

393
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,199
separate yourself from yourself you can

394
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,000
talk on the mirror

395
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,039
you can go to the river and talk there

396
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,839
or you can

397
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,520
go to an ocean and tell them that see i

398
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,160
have done this mistake

399
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,400
and now i am not going to do it you can

400
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,600
make promises to all these elements

401
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,240
once you make these promises this vishnu

402
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,880
maya

403
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,360
will receive the message and she won't

404
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
enter

405
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,520
into any one of these elements to

406
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,400
destruction so you have to go and tell

407
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,240
the ocean

408
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,600
that all right america is not guilty for

409
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,880
whatever they have done

410
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,280
say it like that if you say it's all

411
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,760
right

412
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,360
not other people because i told you your

413
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,400
genetics are changed you are different

414
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,520
people

415
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,120
whatever you say vishnu maya will always

416
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,400
believe in

417
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,840
and everything will work out very well

418
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,960
but this is a special time as i told you

419
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,480
before where we call it

420
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,720
is the krita yuga where between the

421
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,760
kali yuga and satyuga this time is so

422
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,840
important

423
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,919
that whatever mistakes we have committed

424
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,559
we have to pay for it

425
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,280
it's a karma palazzo it won't work out

426
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,320
by just putting it here

427
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,440
so one has to get to realization

428
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:27,440
change the genetics completely and then

429
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,440
you can go and tell the nature that all

430
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,200
right we are not guilty now we've got

431
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,679
our realization

432
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,880
and it will work i'm sure so many of

433
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,880
catastrophes

434
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,160
of this country can be awarded by you

435
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,400
sahaja yogis

436
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,400
may god bless you
