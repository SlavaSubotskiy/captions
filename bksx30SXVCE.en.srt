1
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:20,378
Today we have decided to have Shri Krishna
Puja in the land of Shri Krishna.

2
00:00:28,754 --> 00:00:32,883
Though this is the land of Shri Krishna,

3
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:39,280
people ask Me why the people are not
spiritual.

4
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:47,922
How is it they get entangled into different
types of seekings

5
00:00:48,123 --> 00:00:52,157
which are not leading to truth?

6
00:00:52,358 --> 00:01:01,023
Why is it the people in America are not
so alert as to recognize

7
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:06,707
what is the truth and what they have
to find?

8
00:01:10,124 --> 00:01:14,809
Shri Krishna’s time was, as you know,

9
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:22,756
at least two thousand after Shri Rama.

10
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:28,877
And Shri Rama created lots of disciplines

11
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:38,715
for human beings to follow in the path
of their ascent.

12
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:43,068
According to the time everything works out.

13
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:52,029
So people were extremely rigid,
disciplined,

14
00:01:52,230 --> 00:02:06,421
and it so happened that people lost
the touch with the truth.

15
00:02:10,712 --> 00:02:16,174
They would leave their wives, ill-treat
their wives,

16
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:23,398
do all kinds of things in the name
of Shri Rama;

17
00:02:23,983 --> 00:02:30,647
because always human beings take
to something which is not right.

18
00:02:30,848 --> 00:02:37,462
The another side they never saw, how
Rama went after Sitaji to find Her,

19
00:02:37,663 --> 00:02:49,106
and He fought the horrible rakshasa Ravana
to get back His wife.

20
00:02:49,307 --> 00:02:53,605
So the other side people never see.

21
00:02:54,057 --> 00:02:57,652
Only this side they saw that He was very
strict with His wife,

22
00:02:57,861 --> 00:03:03,724
and if the wife stayed over in some
function, He got so angry,

23
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:09,946
and He shouted at Her and He threw Her out,
and all those things.

24
00:03:11,053 --> 00:03:20,562
That is how Shri Krishna came in.

25
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:28,140
Always incarnations come one after another
to correct themselves only.

26
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:34,654
When Shri Krishna found that it is
on the other side, of ego –

27
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:37,539
that men thought they were very powerful
people

28
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,922
and they could do whatever they liked,

29
00:03:40,123 --> 00:03:43,910
and they had all the power to judge their
wives –

30
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:50,785
so Shri Krishna came with a new diversion,

31
00:03:50,986 --> 00:03:57,490
or I should say, from a new idea about
life.

32
00:04:01,863 --> 00:04:10,369
He talked of freedom, He talked
of abandonment,

33
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,703
and He talked that life is for enjoyment.

34
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:22,890
Radha was the source of joy.

35
00:04:23,091 --> 00:04:27,808
“Ra” is energy, “dha” means the one who
sustains energy.

36
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:31,446
She was the source of joy,

37
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:41,202
and His idea was, to enjoy life is the best
way to live.

38
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:47,026
And that’s why He said that you should play
Holi,

39
00:04:47,227 --> 00:04:51,396
you should enjoy yourselves, you must have
Raas,

40
00:04:51,597 --> 00:04:59,429
by which you enjoy group dancing and
freedom.

41
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:05,331
So people thought that’s the way one has
to live -

42
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:14,708
is to be absolutely free, live as you like,
specially in America.

43
00:05:14,962 --> 00:05:20,355
They thought that to enjoy life is
complete abandonment:

44
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:25,338
no discipline, no bindings,

45
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:30,484
you can divorce your wife eight times and
husbands ten times.

46
00:05:30,685 --> 00:05:34,183
That sort of a life started long time back,

47
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:38,745
but it really prospered in America.

48
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:44,324
The prosperity of this kind of a culture
came to such a level

49
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:50,150
that now we don’t know what’s going
to happen to the family system,

50
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,512
to the joy part of it.

51
00:05:57,373 --> 00:06:02,043
Again here people forgot the other side
of it.

52
00:06:02,522 --> 00:06:09,790
Adi Shakti first created Shri Ganesh.

53
00:06:10,515 --> 00:06:15,313
Shri Ganesh is the source of wisdom,

54
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:20,301
He’s the source of auspiciousness.

55
00:06:27,693 --> 00:06:32,607
Through Him we understand auspiciousness.

56
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:39,060
And He is a child, He is an eternal child.

57
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:49,980
And this behavior of abandonment is
very destructive,

58
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:53,678
if there is no wisdom.

59
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:02,694
First thing was to establish wisdom within
ourselves.

60
00:07:02,895 --> 00:07:10,869
But we start a theory or a kind of
a pattern of life

61
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:16,646
without thinking have we got the wisdom
or not?

62
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,930
Are we capable of following that pattern
of life

63
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:31,136
without any development of our wisdom?

64
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:39,827
But the worst was when the freedom became
the criteria of life,

65
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:47,035
people became extremely dominating and
egoistical.

66
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,127
The first answer always you will get it,
“What’s wrong?”

67
00:07:55,328 --> 00:08:00,097
You ask them, “Why are you doing this?”
“What’s wrong?”

68
00:08:00,526 --> 00:08:04,212
“I mean, it’s wrong because it is not
auspicious.”

69
00:08:04,413 --> 00:08:13,855
“What’s auspiciousness is there?” –
absolutely like you can call them,

70
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:21,600
people without any brains, brainless
people.

71
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:25,477
“Brainless” means there is no wisdom.

72
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:31,748
What is the power of brain is wisdom.

73
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:52,593
So life started drifting into a destructive
pond, we should say, of no return.

74
00:08:52,865 --> 00:09:01,843
And every kind of filth was accepted
as a blessing,

75
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:09,253
and nobody would think that this is wrong,

76
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:13,804
this is not for human life.

77
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:18,099
Even the animals are all not like that.

78
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:30,643
Added to that came the stupidity
of drinking alcohol.

79
00:09:34,703 --> 00:09:40,612
I don’t know how they discovered alcohol
long time back, long, long time back,

80
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:45,554
but they say it came out of the manthana

81
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:49,908
and out of the churning of the ocean

82
00:09:50,109 --> 00:09:58,241
by the suras and asuras, by the rakshasas
and by the devas.

83
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:03,811
Must be some trick to get these rakshasas
drunk,

84
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:21,650
and to somehow or other manage to get the
kumbha of, the pitcher of amruta, ambrosia;

85
00:10:21,928 --> 00:10:26,065
so that these rakshasas will be lost
drinking

86
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:33,612
and then the devas will get their due,

87
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:38,869
which was amruta, which was ambrosia.

88
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:47,882
That might be one of the reasons that
it was created out of the ocean,

89
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:53,826
or among all the fourteen things that came
out of the ocean.

90
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:08,892
So kind of a oppositions, opposite quality
of things were created.

91
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:14,261
Another thing they created were
prostitutes.

92
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:21,348
One may ask why prostitutes came out
of that manthana –

93
00:11:22,095 --> 00:11:26,351
because now you have freedom.

94
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:31,309
You are given freedom to choose,

95
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:39,634
and so you must have full vision

96
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:49,570
whether to choose an auspicious life,
a holy life, a divine life,

97
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:54,291
or to choose destructive life.

98
00:11:54,544 --> 00:11:57,483
This opposition came forward

99
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:03,074
because your freedom had to be respected,

100
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:05,405
that was very important.

101
00:12:05,606 --> 00:12:10,557
In the growth of human awareness it was
very important

102
00:12:10,758 --> 00:12:14,501
to respect the freedom of human beings.

103
00:12:14,702 --> 00:12:20,723
Because animals, if you see, they have
no freedom:

104
00:12:20,924 --> 00:12:27,087
a snake will be a snake, scorpion will be
a scorpion,

105
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,099
lion will be a lion.

106
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:37,090
They live with their own qualities, gunas;

107
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:44,137
you cannot make them do something that
other animals are doing.

108
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,461
We have passed through all these different
animal yonis

109
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:56,166
and now we are human beings, and now we
have freedom.

110
00:12:56,367 --> 00:13:00,034
Now why freedom, one may ask – because
these days they ask

111
00:13:00,235 --> 00:13:05,818
such questions for everything you say –
why freedom needed?

112
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:11,523
Like I always told you before that
in the school they teach you

113
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:17,247
two plus two is four, and you have
to remember it.

114
00:13:19,503 --> 00:13:22,907
But when you grow and when you go
to college,

115
00:13:23,108 --> 00:13:29,187
you are supposed to have freedom
to understand everything yourself.

116
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:40,348
In the same manner, your awareness was
to be brought to that level

117
00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:47,095
that you could use your freedom wisely.

118
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,242
Now, you have to have temptations.

119
00:13:53,443 --> 00:14:00,439
How can you judge a person whether he is
blind or not blind?

120
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:08,100
Supposing you ask a blind person, “Is this
a flower?”

121
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:12,740
He might feel it, say, “No, no, it’s
a bee.”

122
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:18,014
So he has to have his eyes to see,

123
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:24,515
and once you give him the eyes he goes
amok.

124
00:14:24,754 --> 00:14:30,312
He doesn’t know what to do, what is good
for him.

125
00:14:30,513 --> 00:14:38,672
So he chose all that was not at all good
for him,

126
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:45,520
auspicious for him, and detrimental for his
growth.

127
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:50,597
So the drinking started, and with drinking

128
00:14:50,798 --> 00:14:56,379
you don’t know how we get abandoned.

129
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:03,974
I have heard people, that they lose their
sense of relationship with brothers,

130
00:15:04,175 --> 00:15:09,441
sisters, mothers, everything, if you get
drunk.

131
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,826
So many drunkards have told Me this.

132
00:15:13,027 --> 00:15:17,157
That is why in this country we have funny
type of relationships –

133
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:22,630
one can’t understand, how can it be?
But it is so.

134
00:15:22,831 --> 00:15:25,904
By drinking, all these things have happened

135
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:28,474
that they don’t know who is your sister,

136
00:15:28,675 --> 00:15:32,547
who is your wife, who is your mother.

137
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:40,251
In India also we have but different type
of thing,

138
00:15:40,452 --> 00:15:44,168
that they will ill-treat their mother,
they’ll ill-treat their sister,

139
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:48,537
ill-treat their wives; the other way round
also.

140
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:53,459
But here they do not ill-treat,

141
00:15:55,479 --> 00:16:00,355
they love, but in a very perverted manner.

142
00:16:01,381 --> 00:16:05,121
You see the reaction in two countries.

143
00:16:05,322 --> 00:16:09,107
So this grew up very much,

144
00:16:09,307 --> 00:16:18,787
and today we see a country that is America
in a complete chaos.

145
00:16:29,454 --> 00:16:35,861
So this freedom without any wisdom at all
growing,

146
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:44,362
starts creating a terrible ego.

147
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:53,686
When auspiciousness is given up then
Shri Ganesha sleeps

148
00:16:53,887 --> 00:17:03,381
and as Christ, who is the incarnation
of Shri Ganesha, also doesn’t bother.

149
00:17:04,145 --> 00:17:08,465
So the rule of Christ is finished.

150
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:17,418
So what rules is the ego, this ego which
thinks it is free.

151
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:27,693
It doesn’t know it is bound by all kinds
of enemies of very horrible types.

152
00:17:28,553 --> 00:17:31,050
At the time of Shri Krishna He said

153
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:36,535
that the worst enemy human beings have is
anger,

154
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:40,460
but I think in modern times the worst enemy

155
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:47,023
human beings have is greed and jealousy.

156
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:52,319
Greed has no meaning these days. I mean,
what do you say to a person

157
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:59,541
who has three thousand shoes – I mean,
pairs of shoes?

158
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:02,682
Must be mad!

159
00:18:03,462 --> 00:18:07,686
There are all sorts of things, you know,
in greed you see these days.

160
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:13,606
You don’t know how people are really
behaving.

161
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:15,989
No one can explain.

162
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:23,293
I know of someone who has five thousand
dogs.

163
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:30,099
What is she doing with those dogs I don’t
know, but she has.

164
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:43,138
Like all countries, even in America
I think it’s much worse, much worse.

165
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:48,278
Now you may call it anything, consumerism
or anything like that,

166
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:52,043
or your economics which is, I think, very
faulty,

167
00:18:52,244 --> 00:18:57,196
it doesn’t understand human beings –
whatever it may be,

168
00:18:57,397 --> 00:19:00,662
it can never bring benevolence,

169
00:19:00,863 --> 00:19:06,295
neither to the person who thinks he is
rich,

170
00:19:06,496 --> 00:19:14,013
or to the people whom he is exploiting.

171
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:19,642
As far as spirituality is concerned,

172
00:19:19,843 --> 00:19:26,563
they are all away from the realm
of divinity.

173
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:29,884
Now the mind starts working with ego.

174
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:33,832
Ego takes over like a computer,

175
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:36,970
and it starts suggesting ways and methods

176
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:42,468
by which how much money you can earn.

177
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:46,068
So when you start earning money,

178
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:51,120
then again the same Ego Mister tells you

179
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:55,920
how to destroy yourself with this money.

180
00:19:56,923 --> 00:20:00,408
They do all kinds of things when they have
money.

181
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:05,016
I mean, that money is not a Lakshmi prasad;

182
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:08,912
it is some sort of a money that becomes
like a rakshasa

183
00:20:09,113 --> 00:20:13,016
or a devil and which devours you.

184
00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:18,291
It takes you to all kinds of wrong places.

185
00:20:18,492 --> 00:20:24,650
It takes you to such horrible theories

186
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:29,963
that nobody would accept such theories.

187
00:20:30,164 --> 00:20:35,914
This ego makes you feel that – ah, yes,
you are perfect,

188
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:41,507
you know everything, whatever you are doing
is the best.

189
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:45,901
But with all that doing, what happens?

190
00:20:46,102 --> 00:20:51,090
You become restless, you cannot sleep.

191
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:59,353
Now with the problem here is that people
have this so-called tension, stress.

192
00:20:59,554 --> 00:21:03,551
In our young age we never heard of
this word, what is tension, stress is.

193
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:07,911
Even now in India very few people know
about it.

194
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,007
Because you yourself, you are destroying
yourself.

195
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:17,800
So with this money, say, you want to entice
some woman –

196
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:20,446
take a very low-level thing.

197
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:24,214
Then you’ll run after her, give her this,
give her that,

198
00:21:24,415 --> 00:21:29,210
and spend all your money till you become
bankrupt.

199
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:34,269
And then you’ll start sitting and crying.

200
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,313
And this is a common story.

201
00:21:37,514 --> 00:21:40,681
I don’t know why don’t they make films
like this,

202
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:45,671
to show actually what happens to a person
who runs after money,

203
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:48,101
and he goes on then spending that money.

204
00:21:48,302 --> 00:21:53,702
He doesn’t know what to do, you see; money
also eats him, I think.

205
00:21:53,903 --> 00:22:00,124
On the other side we have people who are
extremely miserly.

206
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:09,799
So all their – with the money only, they
become so much greedy

207
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,462
that they keep their money in seven locks
and keys.

208
00:22:14,663 --> 00:22:20,635
Now, they see in the world there are people
who are suffering so much,

209
00:22:20,836 --> 00:22:23,934
who have so much problem.

210
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:29,432
Why not spend some money on them?

211
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:37,315
So then there are agents come up, like
our Swiss bank.

212
00:22:37,918 --> 00:22:46,771
Swiss bank is the outcome of our greed,
completely our greed;

213
00:22:46,972 --> 00:22:49,721
because we have so much money we don’t
know what to do,

214
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:52,676
so we put it in the Swiss bank.

215
00:22:52,877 --> 00:22:56,483
Swiss bank says, “All right, we’ll look
after it.”

216
00:22:56,684 --> 00:23:01,234
Because we are greedy as well as we are
miserly.

217
00:23:01,435 --> 00:23:06,818
I mean, miserly people are another
crackpots, I should say, the way they live.

218
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:11,618
But also the people who have money are
really crackpots.

219
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:19,587
They have no sense of self-respect, neither
self-esteem.

220
00:23:19,788 --> 00:23:27,443
Now imagine eighty, ninety-year-old women
going for a shake dance, as I told you.

221
00:23:27,644 --> 00:23:31,313
Because they have money they think they
should do this,

222
00:23:31,514 --> 00:23:34,404
competing with the young people, because
they have money.

223
00:23:34,605 --> 00:23:42,015
If they have money, if they get it without
any, I should say,

224
00:23:42,216 --> 00:23:47,483
cheating or without deceiving someone,
if it’s a real good money

225
00:23:47,684 --> 00:23:55,975
they should give it to some good cause
and try to propagate goodness.

226
00:23:56,176 --> 00:24:01,401
But money itself seems to be something
very bad, like poison,

227
00:24:01,602 --> 00:24:10,164
because either this money makes you mad
how to spend it,

228
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:14,218
or mad how to save it.

229
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,278
As if you become a slave of this money
business,

230
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:25,636
and in that slavishness you go on drifting,
drifting, drifting.

231
00:24:26,635 --> 00:24:34,095
I’ve seen people when they talk,

232
00:24:34,296 --> 00:24:37,138
you don’t know why they talk like that,
you know.

233
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:39,908
Then you discover that they have a bank
account,

234
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:43,202
that’s why they are talking like that.

235
00:24:44,345 --> 00:24:49,319
If you don’t have bank account then you
won’t talk like that.

236
00:24:50,186 --> 00:24:52,495
I mean, more than that also.

237
00:24:52,696 --> 00:24:57,254
This country is overflowing with money,

238
00:24:57,455 --> 00:25:01,424
with all kinds of money transactions,

239
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,266
permutations and combinations and this
and that,

240
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:11,570
and what you can do with money – because
Shri Krishna is Kubera.

241
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:18,085
He is the Deity, or we can say He is
the God of wealth.

242
00:25:18,286 --> 00:25:25,659
But at the same time, He is a very
mischievous God.

243
00:25:26,095 --> 00:25:31,093
You can see clearly: this is supposed to be
Shri Krishna’s country

244
00:25:31,294 --> 00:25:34,913
which is overflowing with money.

245
00:25:35,114 --> 00:25:39,561
At the same time you find horrible things
happening,

246
00:25:39,762 --> 00:25:41,507
worst in the whole world.

247
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,724
I mean, no one can beat Americans, they
say,

248
00:25:44,925 --> 00:25:59,244
in stupidity, in vulgarity, indecency,
exploitation.

249
00:26:01,651 --> 00:26:08,804
So this is the curse of money on human
beings, which is to be understood,

250
00:26:09,005 --> 00:26:17,960
that freedom without wisdom is the most
dangerous thing to use.

251
00:26:18,603 --> 00:26:23,782
It is better not to be free if you have
no wisdom,

252
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:27,309
because God knows what you will do

253
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,932
if you have freedom and no wisdom.

254
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:38,599
I’ve seen here, heard about women who are
killing their children.

255
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:44,812
I mean, nowhere you will find such a thing
like that, killing small children.

256
00:26:45,013 --> 00:26:50,893
Now how this money makes you so dry

257
00:26:51,094 --> 00:27:03,651
that you have no, I would say, no love,
no feeling.

258
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:08,967
Just for killing’s sake also, people kill
here.

259
00:27:15,736 --> 00:27:20,444
Now there are – there’s another thing that
this money does:

260
00:27:20,645 --> 00:27:25,071
it creates a disparity.

261
00:27:25,507 --> 00:27:32,119
There are some who are very rich,
there are some who are very poor.

262
00:27:32,436 --> 00:27:40,228
So those who are very poor are against
those who are very rich.

263
00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:46,081
They can’t understand why should these
people have so much money,

264
00:27:46,282 --> 00:27:48,857
so they think it’s a matter of right

265
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:54,326
to snatch all that money from them and use
it for themselves.

266
00:27:54,527 --> 00:27:58,845
But the same money can destroy them also.

267
00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:06,176
So snatching that money with violence or
grabbing it

268
00:28:06,377 --> 00:28:10,889
is not going to give you any blessings.

269
00:28:14,298 --> 00:28:19,471
So what is the purpose of wealth?

270
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:26,760
That is very important for people who
worship Shri Krishna to know.

271
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:33,380
In Shri Krishna’s life, He saw that
the women

272
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:39,864
who were creating buttermilk and butter

273
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:45,719
were carrying all that all the way
to Mathura,

274
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,922
where in Mathura this horrible King Kamsa
was reigning.

275
00:28:51,123 --> 00:28:56,478
And they used to give to all the soldiers
there.

276
00:28:56,711 --> 00:28:59,852
He didn’t want them to do that.

277
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:02,372
Because they would fetch much more money,

278
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:10,102
they would be paid much more, so these
women were greedy about it.

279
00:29:10,303 --> 00:29:14,987
Instead of giving them to their own
children, to their own families,

280
00:29:15,188 --> 00:29:21,198
they used to collect all that and take
to Mathura.

281
00:29:21,543 --> 00:29:29,581
From very childhood Shri Krishna used
to throw stones at those pitchers

282
00:29:29,782 --> 00:29:35,096
and break their pitchers, because he didn’t
want

283
00:29:35,297 --> 00:29:45,125
that to go all the way to Mathura to feed
those horrible soldiers.

284
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:50,469
This is what it is we have to learn,

285
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:57,437
that if we have, say, surplus money or
something,

286
00:29:57,638 --> 00:30:00,497
you have to think what you can do with it

287
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:13,366
and what joy it can bring, by sharing with
right type of people.

288
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:17,851
Not in the pubs, no, no, I don’t mean that,

289
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:25,267
but sharing it for their needs and what
they want.

290
00:30:25,468 --> 00:30:33,112
Actually a disciple of Shri Krishna should
be a self-satisfied person.

291
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:40,254
Look at His life, how self-satisfied He
was.

292
00:30:40,516 --> 00:30:52,656
Every episode about Him talks of His
complete oneness with Himself.

293
00:30:54,595 --> 00:30:58,818
For example, when Arjuna asked Him that

294
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:03,649
“Why don’t You join us Pandavas to fight
with us?”

295
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:10,901
In modern times in the competitive life,
you see, if you see those races,

296
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:16,394
they’re so anxious to win, to have
the higher position.

297
00:31:16,595 --> 00:31:23,710
Then all the big, big politicians are
trying

298
00:31:23,911 --> 00:31:30,607
to bring down other politicians, to have
their own power.

299
00:31:30,808 --> 00:31:37,129
But what did Shri Krishna say, that “I will
be your charioteer.

300
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:46,069
I’ll drive your chariot, but I will not
lift My weapon against anyone.”

301
00:31:46,554 --> 00:31:50,908
We can’t think of anyone like that today.

302
00:31:51,352 --> 00:31:55,071
See, people will never say that,
“All right,

303
00:31:55,272 --> 00:32:01,266
I will stay down and you’ll be
on the throne.”

304
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:04,849
Very difficult even to see one person

305
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:08,336
who could behave like Shri Krishna.

306
00:32:08,537 --> 00:32:17,878
Because whether He is a charioteer or He
is the one who was Arjuna,

307
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:26,950
or He was the captain of the whole thing,
He knew what He was.

308
00:32:27,151 --> 00:32:32,648
What was the need for Him to become this
or that, and that?

309
00:32:32,849 --> 00:32:38,256
But these days, you see, to become
something is such a struggle going on.

310
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:42,572
Someone wants to be, say, the prime
minister –

311
00:32:42,773 --> 00:32:45,368
that’s the highest, I think, I don’t know.

312
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:50,898
But then some want to dislodge the prime
minister.

313
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:53,428
Then you start from the peon upward,

314
00:32:53,629 --> 00:32:58,096
everybody wants something higher, higher,
higher, higher.

315
00:32:58,297 --> 00:33:02,425
This is another very subtle type of greed

316
00:33:02,626 --> 00:33:09,124
which is working out in our minds.

317
00:33:09,325 --> 00:33:15,225
Even in Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen that
the leaders –

318
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:18,022
now are settled down of course, much
better –

319
00:33:18,223 --> 00:33:22,988
but used to be such a terrible fight
for leadership.

320
00:33:23,189 --> 00:33:27,866
It’s all a myth, actual myth, but they used
to fight.

321
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:32,211
And they would write letters after letters.
There were groups:

322
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:35,687
one group would write against another
group,

323
00:33:35,887 --> 00:33:38,039
another group would write against this
group,

324
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:47,267
and I used to just laugh, because there’s
no truth in it.

325
00:33:47,468 --> 00:33:50,897
Leadership is no truth, it’s just a joke.

326
00:33:51,098 --> 00:33:54,801
But even if I told them it’s a joke, they
would not understand

327
00:33:55,002 --> 00:34:00,697
it’s a joke and not to be that serious,
and to fight about it.

328
00:34:02,596 --> 00:34:07,428
Gradually it’s settled down normally –
better, much better, it’s not so much bad.

329
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:11,758
But that is what is there, this greed.

330
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:14,873
That was the mistake, I think, of Shri
Krishna,

331
00:34:15,074 --> 00:34:21,254
that instead of anger He should have put
greed as the worst thing.

332
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:27,092
Actually, you see, these incarnations don’t
know much about human beings,

333
00:34:27,293 --> 00:34:29,620
and they would not know how far they will
be going –

334
00:34:29,821 --> 00:34:31,691
same happens to Me.

335
00:34:31,892 --> 00:34:37,826
But they are absolutely unaware that
what these human beings are,

336
00:34:38,027 --> 00:34:45,011
what you tell them, what they will make
out of it.

337
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,408
Their brains are so sharp

338
00:34:49,608 --> 00:34:53,262
that they’ll pick up whatever is wrong
for them,

339
00:34:53,463 --> 00:34:58,421
and never see whatever is right for them.

340
00:34:59,311 --> 00:35:03,560
Shri Rama tried something – it was of no
use.

341
00:35:03,761 --> 00:35:07,595
Shri Krishna tried something – it was of no
use.

342
00:35:07,796 --> 00:35:12,546
So we come to Shri Jesus Christ.

343
00:35:12,747 --> 00:35:20,691
Nowadays the people who are something
else are ardent disciples of Christ.

344
00:35:26,978 --> 00:35:31,559
They have no wisdom of any kind.

345
00:35:33,873 --> 00:35:38,010
Like mad they are going about.

346
00:35:38,211 --> 00:35:40,317
You read there about their organizations,

347
00:35:40,518 --> 00:35:44,142
you read about things that they do,
you are amazed at it;

348
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:49,119
you see, how can they be disciples
of Christ?

349
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:56,520
In no way they have any right on Christ
to begin with,

350
00:35:56,721 --> 00:36:02,010
because they don’t know anything about
Christ.

351
00:36:02,211 --> 00:36:06,762
First to know and then to imbibe His
qualities

352
00:36:06,963 --> 00:36:16,289
are something very, very, I should say,
impossible thing it is these days.

353
00:36:16,765 --> 00:36:21,498
Some would say, “Why was He born in
a poor family?

354
00:36:21,699 --> 00:36:26,893
He was born in a poor family – He should
have been born to Mr. Ford.”

355
00:36:27,094 --> 00:36:31,851
Some say – I mean, you see, finding faults
and criticizing

356
00:36:32,052 --> 00:36:36,038
is the only thing left to us now

357
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:40,336
because you can’t do anything else, that’s
why.

358
00:36:40,537 --> 00:36:45,182
Then they would say, “Why did He get
himself crucified?”

359
00:36:45,383 --> 00:36:48,061
He didn’t crucify you. He should have
crucified you,

360
00:36:48,262 --> 00:36:53,446
but actually He crucified himself, that was
His mistake.

361
00:36:54,529 --> 00:37:02,207
It is also very difficult for human beings
to understand incarnations,

362
00:37:02,408 --> 00:37:05,870
because they are in juxtaposition.

363
00:37:06,071 --> 00:37:12,760
They are very different things, so human
beings can’t understand.

364
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,445
Now they are there to lead them,

365
00:37:16,646 --> 00:37:20,403
they are there to tell them what is to be
done;

366
00:37:20,604 --> 00:37:28,325
but the way they understand, you see, it’s
just absurd.

367
00:37:28,841 --> 00:37:36,849
For example, you know in Chicago I met
the head of the Hare Rama fellow.

368
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:41,257
Another puzzle he was to Me, really,

369
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:44,303
because he came in a very thin dhoti

370
00:37:44,504 --> 00:37:49,118
and it was so very cold, and he was
shivering before Me.

371
00:37:49,618 --> 00:37:53,461
So I said, “Sir, why are you wearing such
a thin dhoti?

372
00:37:53,662 --> 00:37:56,583
You are shivering, I am very sorry.”

373
00:37:56,784 --> 00:38:02,415
He said, “Why? My guru has told me
that I should have a thin dhoti.”

374
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:06,896
“Why?” “To go to heaven, to achieve my
ascent.”

375
00:38:07,097 --> 00:38:09,177
I said, “Really? He told you like that?

376
00:38:09,378 --> 00:38:12,998
But Shri Krishna never wore a thin dhoti.”

377
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,908
“But I am not Shri Krishna,” he said –

378
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:21,229
see how the human mind tries to avoid.

379
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:31,971
So now, then he had shaved his head and
had a big pony-tail behind.

380
00:38:32,172 --> 00:38:35,022
I asked him, “Why have you shaved your
head?”

381
00:38:35,223 --> 00:38:38,802
So he said, “Because my guru told me that
you have to shave your head

382
00:38:39,003 --> 00:38:41,964
if you have to go to heaven.”

383
00:38:42,165 --> 00:38:46,009
So I said, “But Shri Krishna did not shave
His head.”

384
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:50,170
“No, no, but He was incarnation. I have
to shave my head

385
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:53,714
so I have to go to heaven.”

386
00:38:53,915 --> 00:39:00,184
So I told him, “See, Kabira has said that,

387
00:39:00,636 --> 00:39:10,625
‘These sheep are shaven and shorn every
year twice.

388
00:39:12,043 --> 00:39:18,328
And if they all go to heaven where will be
a place left for you?’ ”

389
00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:21,149
So he never understood Me. He got very
angry with Me,

390
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:25,669
and he said to Me, “Mother, You are talking
ill about my guru.”

391
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:30,030
I said, “I am not talking ill. I am your
Mother, I am just asking Me

392
00:39:30,231 --> 00:39:33,948
that what’s the use of wearing this thin
dhoti, that’s all.

393
00:39:34,149 --> 00:39:39,240
A Mother has a right to ask.” He got very
angry, he went away.

394
00:39:39,441 --> 00:39:44,350
And he’s the head of these Hare Ramas!

395
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:55,882
So to understand the incarnation also
you have to be a realized soul,

396
00:39:56,083 --> 00:40:03,290
otherwise you cannot, because they look
very absurd.

397
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:11,187
Without asking any questions if you can
become a realized soul –

398
00:40:11,388 --> 00:40:15,874
if you ask questions it’s one degree less –

399
00:40:16,075 --> 00:40:23,540
without questioning if you get your
realization, without any questions,

400
00:40:23,741 --> 00:40:26,909
then you have the highest marks.

401
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:31,693
But if you, after questioning and this
thing and that thing,

402
00:40:31,894 --> 00:40:37,714
then you have less marks, because your
mind is very active,

403
00:40:37,915 --> 00:40:42,060
and the person whose mind is active

404
00:40:42,261 --> 00:40:47,502
cannot achieve something beyond the mind.

405
00:40:47,703 --> 00:40:50,791
You have to achieve it beyond the mind.

406
00:40:50,992 --> 00:40:55,871
This is one thing at least if you all
understand,

407
00:40:56,072 --> 00:41:00,184
I think My work is done.

408
00:41:00,938 --> 00:41:04,130
All tricks tried by Shri Krishna,

409
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:07,516
all disciplines put by Shri Rama,

410
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:12,299
all the gurus who tried their level best
to tell you what to do,

411
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:24,478
is only to make you a yogi by taking you
beyond the mind.

412
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,033
And then what happens?

413
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:35,584
Then you are in connection with this
all-pervading Power

414
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:39,327
which is looking after you, which protects
you, which helps you;

415
00:41:39,528 --> 00:41:51,184
in every way you are absolutely in charge
of this Paramachaitanya.

416
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:55,623
Now supposing I do not take the citizenship
of America –

417
00:41:55,824 --> 00:41:59,737
of course I may never take, but supposing.

418
00:41:59,938 --> 00:42:04,919
Then this government is not in charge
of Me.

419
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:12,752
But if I take, of course they’ll tax Me, do
all kinds of things, doesn’t matter,

420
00:42:12,953 --> 00:42:17,077
but at least they’ll be in charge.

421
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,780
But this Paramchaitanya when it takes
over,

422
00:42:20,981 --> 00:42:27,655
it is love, is absolute love:

423
00:42:27,856 --> 00:42:36,182
love which thinks, understands,
coordinates, cooperates, works,

424
00:42:36,383 --> 00:42:41,269
and extremely sensitive.

425
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:50,485
It works – I’m sometimes so surprised
the way it works,

426
00:42:51,844 --> 00:42:57,946
without fail, without making any mistakes.

427
00:42:59,851 --> 00:43:04,103
You don’t have to even tell, because you
are there.

428
00:43:05,378 --> 00:43:11,300
But to believe that we are there also
is a difficult task.

429
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:20,483
With all the experiences you should believe
that you are there,

430
00:43:20,684 --> 00:43:24,345
but that is also quite a difficult task.

431
00:43:24,546 --> 00:43:28,487
So when we say they’re established Sahaja
yogis

432
00:43:28,688 --> 00:43:35,986
then what we mean is this, that they are
completely one,

433
00:43:36,216 --> 00:43:44,098
under complete charge of Paramachaitanya.

434
00:43:44,713 --> 00:43:47,999
That’s what we have to be.

435
00:43:48,644 --> 00:43:53,812
If you want to save this country, you have
to be that.

436
00:43:54,013 --> 00:43:57,133
No argument, no explanation, nothing;

437
00:43:57,334 --> 00:44:02,098
no fighting, no strikes, nothing.

438
00:44:02,299 --> 00:44:05,944
No placards is needed.

439
00:44:06,145 --> 00:44:12,008
You are the ones who will advertise Sahaja
Yoga.

440
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:17,349
Every one of you should understand

441
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:23,741
that your life is very important at this
juncture.

442
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:30,851
And you have to become that special person

443
00:44:31,052 --> 00:44:38,270
who reflects reality through the divine
love.

444
00:44:38,471 --> 00:44:41,103
May God bless you.
