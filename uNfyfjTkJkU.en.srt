1
00:01:05,488 --> 00:01:11,518
Today we have gathered here to worship the Adi Kundalini

2
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:14,263
and your own Kundalini, both of them,

3
00:01:15,193 --> 00:01:18,193
because your Kundalini is the reflection

4
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:20,153
of the Adi Kundalini.

5
00:01:23,153 --> 00:01:25,093
We have understood a lot

6
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:28,253
about Kundalini

7
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:34,093
and also we know that

8
00:01:34,153 --> 00:01:36,283
through Her awakening only,

9
00:01:36,728 --> 00:01:38,263
through Her ascent only,

10
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:45,153
we have ascended into a very higher realm of consciousness.

11
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:51,253
It's not only that we have risen to a very higher realm

12
00:01:51,293 --> 00:01:54,313
of awareness

13
00:01:54,961 --> 00:02:01,113
but that it has granted us so many powers that,

14
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:07,263
never before in the history of spirituality

15
00:02:09,173 --> 00:02:11,123
people had

16
00:02:11,223 --> 00:02:15,313
this power of awakening of Kundalini.

17
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:21,038
As soon as they got their awakening perhaps,

18
00:02:21,063 --> 00:02:24,153
they went more on to the left or to the right,

19
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:28,293
and tried to achieve powers

20
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:36,183
which were not so much for the benevolence of others.

21
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:41,133
Buddha has written clearly

22
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:44,293
that, “When the incarnation of future Buddha,

23
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:49,133
that is Maitreya, three Mothers put together, comes in,

24
00:02:49,263 --> 00:02:56,123
that time it will be used for the benevolence of people.”

25
00:02:56,153 --> 00:02:58,183
This is one of the signs,

26
00:02:59,193 --> 00:03:01,183
"of the people",

27
00:03:01,243 --> 00:03:06,183
not only of Sahaja Yogis but of the people.

28
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:14,233
So how can it be unless and until those who are Buddhas,

29
00:03:14,273 --> 00:03:16,303
means those who are Realized souls

30
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:22,303
know the science of Kundalini?

31
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:29,163
Those people who had very little knowledge about Kundalini,

32
00:03:29,323 --> 00:03:32,213
who must have read in some scriptures

33
00:03:32,273 --> 00:03:36,103
or somewhere which is being described,

34
00:03:39,213 --> 00:03:42,083
started misusing it

35
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:44,273
and so they became tantrikas.

36
00:03:45,937 --> 00:03:49,123
But tantra, as you know very well,

37
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:55,193
is the mechanism of Kundalini,

38
00:03:55,918 --> 00:04:01,153
and the yantra is the Kundalini itself,

39
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:05,183
is the machine.

40
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:11,233
Today I think,

41
00:04:11,273 --> 00:04:14,123
as we know so much about Kundalini,

42
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:17,093
how it passes through different centers,

43
00:04:17,163 --> 00:04:21,213
how it rises, all those things as we know,

44
00:04:21,263 --> 00:04:27,103
we should find out how we can nourish our Kundalini.

45
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:29,273
That's very important to know.

46
00:04:34,183 --> 00:04:40,213
First of all there's a big difference between

47
00:04:40,243 --> 00:04:45,243
you people and other people who got their Realization.

48
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:50,323
First big difference is this,

49
00:04:51,163 --> 00:04:58,183
that this power you have achieved Sahaj, easily.

50
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:02,273
Others had to go to Himalayas,

51
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:07,293
stand in the cold air for days together, so many died,

52
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:10,133
live in the caves,

53
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:13,133
eating fruits,

54
00:05:13,243 --> 00:05:15,263
sometimes nothing.

55
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,143
Even Buddha's time they had to use only one piece of cloth

56
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:25,173
to cover their body

57
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:31,143
and they had to ask for alms

58
00:05:33,303 --> 00:05:41,113
in the villages and somehow cook some food and eat it

59
00:05:41,193 --> 00:05:45,303
- whether it was cold or hot, no comforts.

60
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:48,083
On the contrary,

61
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:54,283
He taught them that you should give up all our comforts

62
00:05:56,283 --> 00:05:59,253
because you can live without comforts.

63
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:05,283
But none of them got Realization

64
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:09,193
and none of them could do the work

65
00:06:09,223 --> 00:06:12,123
of awakening of Kundalini.

66
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:23,143
So the difference is too much,

67
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:26,153
the way you got your Realization,

68
00:06:26,223 --> 00:06:32,093
the way your Kundalini, in a very Sahaj manner, was awakened

69
00:06:32,313 --> 00:06:36,253
and the way you are manifesting those powers

70
00:06:36,283 --> 00:06:38,233
that you have got.

71
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:41,283
For example you can give Realization to others,

72
00:06:42,143 --> 00:06:44,113
you can cure others,

73
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:47,123
you can feel the vibrations of others,

74
00:06:47,223 --> 00:06:49,083
there are some Sahaja Yogis

75
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:53,163
who can control rain, sun, moon, everything.

76
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,203
Sahaja Yogis, some of them,

77
00:06:56,253 --> 00:06:59,083
have tremendous powers of prayers.

78
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:03,103
Just by praying they have saved the lives of many people.

79
00:07:06,203 --> 00:07:15,143
And these powers were available to some of them,

80
00:07:15,223 --> 00:07:22,313
even to the rishis and great munis on those days,

81
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:31,083
but their powers were not based on love and compassion.

82
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:33,213
This is your special field

83
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:41,113
because you have to work for the benevolence of the people.

84
00:07:42,143 --> 00:07:45,193
Their field was to protect themselves

85
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,143
or to destroy.

86
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:55,103
So they developed powers of curses,

87
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:57,223
like sharp,

88
00:07:57,313 --> 00:08:00,113
they could curse people.

89
00:08:00,223 --> 00:08:03,083
You haven't got that power;

90
00:08:03,193 --> 00:08:05,303
you cannot curse anyone.

91
00:08:06,313 --> 00:08:11,103
Very nicely that power I have cancelled.

92
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:20,133
Nor do I curse, I can, but I never curse anyone,

93
00:08:20,243 --> 00:08:29,313
because our basis is love and compassion and tenderliness.

94
00:08:31,223 --> 00:08:34,213
They were very hot-tempered people, most of them,

95
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:36,143
extremely hot temper,

96
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:42,083
and sometimes they used also terrible harsh languages

97
00:08:42,113 --> 00:08:45,313
whenever they spoke about the people

98
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,203
who were not realized or who were troubling them.

99
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:50,273
This was very funny

100
00:08:51,173 --> 00:08:54,203
the way they were angry with the society,

101
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,313
the way they described them.

102
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:06,163
Some of them did not look at the society,

103
00:09:06,193 --> 00:09:08,143
did not denounce the society,

104
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,193
did not say bad things about the society

105
00:09:12,123 --> 00:09:16,273
but they were only satisfied with themselves

106
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:22,193
or they wrote about the blessings that they are having.

107
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:25,303
But you have a new dimension;

108
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:30,283
you have to use your powers

109
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:35,263
for the benevolence of the people.

110
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:44,163
So also, your Kundalini was awakened so Sahaj;

111
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:51,303
it is because of the love and compassion of your Mother.

112
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,173
So this time, we should say,

113
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,203
your Kundalini can only be nourished

114
00:09:59,313 --> 00:10:04,143
if you develop within yourself

115
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:12,223
the sense of pure love and pure compassion.

116
00:10:14,203 --> 00:10:18,223
First I've used the word “pure”, that's My name also.

117
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:24,173
That means you have to be innocent to begin with.

118
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:32,173
If you are not innocent then you have certain problems,

119
00:10:32,203 --> 00:10:35,093
maybe with your lust.

120
00:10:36,323 --> 00:10:40,143
Maybe your love might be directed

121
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:44,173
towards some person, only.

122
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,233
Kundalini is not like that.

123
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:51,233
She rises, She goes to all the chakras,

124
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,203
She doesn't get involved into any,

125
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:56,283
She tries to cure every chakra, nourish that chakra,

126
00:10:57,093 --> 00:11:00,223
and She is only worried about Her ascent.

127
00:11:01,263 --> 00:11:05,093
In the same way a Sahaja Yogi

128
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:08,183
should not get involved

129
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:13,093
into any relationship as such.

130
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:16,143
Is possible.

131
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:20,143
You don't have to become like Buddha's disciples.

132
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,183
For example, as I have always told you,

133
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:24,293
the sap in the tree rises

134
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:27,293
and goes to various parts of the tree

135
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:31,113
and then evaporates or comes back.

136
00:11:32,253 --> 00:11:36,153
So this passage should be kept open,

137
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:41,233
and once this passage is kept open

138
00:11:42,123 --> 00:11:48,173
the Kundalini can rise very easily without any trouble.

139
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:52,313
But this passage can be closed,

140
00:11:53,153 --> 00:11:57,123
in case you get too much involved into one thing,

141
00:11:57,223 --> 00:12:02,183
because there are some people

142
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:10,083
who get involved, say in their parents to begin with.

143
00:12:10,113 --> 00:12:12,173
All right, in the beginning I know,

144
00:12:12,223 --> 00:12:14,203
those who come in the beginning to Sahaja Yoga,

145
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:18,183
will start saying, “Mother, my father's, sister's,

146
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:23,173
husband's, this things, that, is sick,

147
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:27,093
so will you please cure that person.” Very common.

148
00:12:27,223 --> 00:12:29,123
They'll write long, long letters

149
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:30,223
describing the relationship

150
00:12:30,253 --> 00:12:36,093
and I really lose the connection - who is this one?

151
00:12:36,143 --> 00:12:37,233
Without writing the names

152
00:12:37,263 --> 00:12:40,093
they will give all the connections that they have.

153
00:12:40,143 --> 00:12:42,283
These are all artificial connections.

154
00:12:44,153 --> 00:12:47,123
Tomorrow some calamity comes on you,

155
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:51,153
these relationships are of no use;

156
00:12:51,183 --> 00:12:54,223
on the contrary you'll find they'll take advantage of it.

157
00:12:55,283 --> 00:12:58,253
You cannot depend on these relations of yours,

158
00:12:58,323 --> 00:13:00,253
in what family you were born,

159
00:13:00,283 --> 00:13:02,153
in what religion you were born,

160
00:13:02,183 --> 00:13:04,253
in what country you are born,

161
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:08,253
because now you are a universal being.

162
00:13:09,253 --> 00:13:13,293
So you are no more related

163
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:17,153
through these artificial relationships

164
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:22,283
but you are related through your spiritual relationships.

165
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:29,083
Unless and until we establish that within ourselves

166
00:13:29,263 --> 00:13:31,263
- that doesn't mean you give up your husband,

167
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,283
give up your wife, give up your children,

168
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:35,313
nothing of the kind;

169
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:41,083
but that means that if we have to give up our conditionings

170
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:44,253
we have to give up all these things.

171
00:13:47,263 --> 00:13:50,153
There are all kinds of conditionings we have.

172
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:54,233
If there are some good conditionings,

173
00:13:56,143 --> 00:13:57,233
still we should give up

174
00:13:57,263 --> 00:14:00,233
in the sense they should not be conditionings

175
00:14:00,293 --> 00:14:02,313
but we should be master of them.

176
00:14:03,113 --> 00:14:06,143
For example Indians have one good conditioning, in a way,

177
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:07,233
in their own country,

178
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,203
that they must have their bath early in the morning.

179
00:14:11,223 --> 00:14:13,203
I used to do the same.

180
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:16,203
Then England is horrible for that.

181
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:20,203
It takes its respite, if you do that in England,

182
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:22,253
it's a cursed country,

183
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,283
you just can't do that.

184
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,223
You have to take your bath in the night

185
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:28,283
otherwise give up bathing;

186
00:14:30,113 --> 00:14:31,203
and one has to change.

187
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:33,133
But if you have that conditioning,

188
00:14:33,193 --> 00:14:35,193
then you will feel very sad,

189
00:14:35,223 --> 00:14:37,243
“Oh, oh, I've missed my bath, I'm feeling,

190
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:42,153
I can't sleep now, I can't feel all right, I am not normal.”

191
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:46,193
It’s a good conditioning but still it is enslaving you.

192
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:49,273
So whether it is good or bad,

193
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:51,273
if it is a conditioning

194
00:14:52,193 --> 00:14:56,213
you should try to see it clearly, it's a conditioning.

195
00:14:59,193 --> 00:15:01,083
That doesn't mean that you should go

196
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:02,153
in the opposite direction,

197
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,093
that, "All right I'll never have my bath",

198
00:15:04,123 --> 00:15:06,083
that's not the way.

199
00:15:09,203 --> 00:15:11,093
It is that,

200
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:14,093
"All right if it doesn't suit in the morning

201
00:15:14,143 --> 00:15:15,193
I'll have it in the evening,

202
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:17,253
also doesn't matter once in a while I'll miss it.

203
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:21,203
The bath cannot control me, I'll control the bath."

204
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:24,617
Nothing should control you,

205
00:15:24,642 --> 00:15:27,193
then the Kundalini moves for us,

206
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:30,203
because you must have complete liberty.

207
00:15:31,153 --> 00:15:33,233
If you do not have complete liberty

208
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:36,093
then the Kundalini won't move.

209
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:43,480
We have conditionings of our families,

210
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:47,093
of our religion,

211
00:15:47,786 --> 00:15:49,816
of our country.

212
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:54,936
These conditionings, as far as possible,

213
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:59,906
is to be seen clearly that we have got it through our

214
00:16:02,786 --> 00:16:03,856
family.

215
00:16:03,906 --> 00:16:05,956
If you are born a Christian

216
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:09,796
you'll always be more attached to Christ.

217
00:16:10,796 --> 00:16:11,906
Christ you have not seen,

218
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:13,936
you don't know whether He existed or not,

219
00:16:13,996 --> 00:16:15,926
whether this Bible is true or not

220
00:16:15,966 --> 00:16:17,966
but you'll be more attached to Bible.

221
00:16:18,826 --> 00:16:20,549
Now if you are a Hindu,

222
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:24,826
you'll be more attached to Gita or to Vedas or something.

223
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:28,796
This creates imbalance,

224
00:16:29,896 --> 00:16:33,786
because we must have the same attitude

225
00:16:33,846 --> 00:16:36,966
towards all the religions, towards all the scriptures;

226
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,926
that's the sign of a saint.

227
00:16:43,856 --> 00:16:46,856
So this conditioning has to go.

228
00:16:47,816 --> 00:16:51,926
In what country you are born is another conditioning

229
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:53,936
which has to be fought out;

230
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:56,816
very important it is.

231
00:16:57,986 --> 00:17:00,786
I don't want to discuss the conditionings

232
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:03,826
of different countries but you know very well.

233
00:17:03,876 --> 00:17:06,816
After Realization when you rise higher

234
00:17:06,856 --> 00:17:08,986
than your society which is surrounding you,

235
00:17:09,826 --> 00:17:13,856
you start understanding and you start describing.

236
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:16,700
I've come to know about the stupidity

237
00:17:16,906 --> 00:17:18,936
of all these countries through the people

238
00:17:18,966 --> 00:17:20,936
who belong to that country.

239
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:22,936
For example a Frenchman will say,

240
00:17:22,966 --> 00:17:26,926
“Mother, this is typical French mind,

241
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:29,826
he's a French otherwise born.”

242
00:17:29,936 --> 00:17:31,786
Or a Hindu will say,

243
00:17:31,846 --> 00:17:34,786
“Mother, this is typically a Hindu man,

244
00:17:34,816 --> 00:17:35,986
he will do like this.”

245
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:39,956
So then you understand that you are not typifying

246
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:41,856
that country,

247
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:43,816
you are a universal being

248
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:46,786
and you are living like a universal being.

249
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:51,996
Once you become the universal being

250
00:17:52,826 --> 00:17:56,986
then also you realize that this skin-deep complexion

251
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:59,786
makes no difference in the world.

252
00:18:00,986 --> 00:18:04,846
So then you don't start hating somebody

253
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:08,876
who is darker than you or who is fairer than you;

254
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:10,816
both ways it works.

255
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:16,678
It's not only the people who are fair hate the darker ones,

256
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,956
but “darkers” also hate equally.

257
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:23,556
And mutually they believe that they are all

258
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:25,896
absolutely wrong.

259
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:29,906
If you ask a fanatic

260
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:34,786
about another religion he'll say,

261
00:18:34,826 --> 00:18:36,966
that's the worst religion, his is the best.

262
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:40,816
And you ask the another fanatic,

263
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:45,846
he will say his is the best, the rest of it is the worst.

264
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,956
That means all of them are the worst,

265
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:49,896
in a general opinion.

266
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:51,796
Everybody seems to be the worst,

267
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:52,966
all the fanatics are the worst,

268
00:18:53,796 --> 00:18:55,986
if you take a general consensus, you see.

269
00:18:56,956 --> 00:18:58,791
Nobody will say that,

270
00:18:58,816 --> 00:18:59,936
"All right, my religion is all right

271
00:18:59,986 --> 00:19:03,006
and at least one another is all right", nobody.

272
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:07,826
If you ask an Englishman he'll say,

273
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:11,856
“Mother, this is typically English, you can't help it.”

274
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:15,906
They get so angry, I've seen the English getting angry

275
00:19:15,936 --> 00:19:17,856
with the other English for misbehaving

276
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:20,896
or doing something towards Me, but I don't,

277
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,966
because they are blind.

278
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:26,911
So here the compassion should come within you,

279
00:19:26,936 --> 00:19:28,590
as a universal being,

280
00:19:28,615 --> 00:19:31,966
that by God's grace you have risen higher

281
00:19:31,986 --> 00:19:33,896
in the real sense of the word.

282
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:35,856
It is not just you are certified,

283
00:19:35,906 --> 00:19:37,816
you are realized souls, no.

284
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:43,986
You are realized souls, no doubt, you are - sakshat.

285
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:48,961
So then, as it is now, you are absolutely certified by God

286
00:19:48,986 --> 00:19:51,016
that you are realized souls.

287
00:19:52,006 --> 00:19:54,956
Naturally you must change everything.

288
00:19:57,856 --> 00:20:01,856
No use typifying yourself, identifying yourself

289
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:09,956
with something that is now, you have given up.

290
00:20:10,006 --> 00:20:12,966
For example, from the egg now you have become the birds.

291
00:20:13,816 --> 00:20:17,876
Now birds don't identify themselves with the eggs

292
00:20:17,906 --> 00:20:20,896
and settle down in only one place, they fly.

293
00:20:20,956 --> 00:20:23,816
Now they have become birds, they are no more eggs.

294
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:27,786
In the same way we should accept our position.

295
00:20:27,956 --> 00:20:32,856
We should accept ourselves as realized souls

296
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:35,936
with self-esteem and understanding

297
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:38,876
as to what is our purpose of life now;

298
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,966
it is changed completely, entirely.

299
00:20:41,956 --> 00:20:44,856
Once you understand the purpose of your life,

300
00:20:44,906 --> 00:20:47,876
innately, not outside because I am saying,

301
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:49,786
or is a mental process,

302
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:52,816
but inside you feel responsible.

303
00:20:52,856 --> 00:20:56,926
You have got Realization to spread it all over the world

304
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:59,906
and to emancipate the whole world.

305
00:21:00,856 --> 00:21:02,986
Once you realize this point

306
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,846
then automatically you take up responsibilities

307
00:21:06,896 --> 00:21:08,906
and the Kundalini will rise.

308
00:21:10,786 --> 00:21:12,846
I know of many people who said,

309
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:15,796
“Mother, we cannot speak, You know we have a stage fright.”

310
00:21:15,846 --> 00:21:17,956
All right, you just stand up, that's all.

311
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:22,966
And they started giving lectures; I had to stop them.

312
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:27,906
There are many who said that,

313
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,846
“We cannot write any poems Mother, we are no good,

314
00:21:30,876 --> 00:21:32,016
we cannot sing.”

315
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:35,816
I know of a girl who used to sing so horribly bad

316
00:21:35,956 --> 00:21:37,876
that people had to tell her that you…

317
00:21:37,946 --> 00:21:39,876
because she would always go out of tune

318
00:21:39,906 --> 00:21:41,866
and very loudly she would sing;

319
00:21:42,006 --> 00:21:43,761
then they had to tell her,

320
00:21:43,786 --> 00:21:44,846
“Now you better keep at the back

321
00:21:44,896 --> 00:21:46,846
and don't sing now any more.”

322
00:21:46,956 --> 00:21:51,006
Now she is the one who is sort of leading the group.

323
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:55,816
So all these beautiful things start manifesting

324
00:21:55,866 --> 00:21:58,836
which you should accept that they have come to you,

325
00:21:59,866 --> 00:22:04,806
and give up all that you call as fear.

326
00:22:06,956 --> 00:22:09,876
All kinds of fear we have.

327
00:22:10,786 --> 00:22:14,816
These are all left-sided things as you have seen yesterday,

328
00:22:14,846 --> 00:22:16,836
left-sided man what he should do.

329
00:22:17,946 --> 00:22:22,786
But what a left-sided man has to know

330
00:22:22,846 --> 00:22:25,986
that he is now an enlightened soul

331
00:22:26,956 --> 00:22:31,926
and no one can touch him, leave alone destroy.

332
00:22:32,876 --> 00:22:35,926
No saint will be destroyed.

333
00:22:35,996 --> 00:22:39,026
Those who will try to destroy you

334
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:43,846
will, in a very interesting manner, will be finished.

335
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,026
Not destroyed but very interesting manner,

336
00:22:47,096 --> 00:22:50,846
very jocular manner.

337
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:52,876
You'll laugh at

338
00:22:52,966 --> 00:22:56,026
that and you will enjoy the way things are working out.

339
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,846
Like there's a saying in Sanskrit,

340
00:22:58,906 --> 00:23:00,906
“vinashkale viprit budhi,”

341
00:23:00,956 --> 00:23:03,886
means their destruction will start

342
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,956
by their own stupid methods.

343
00:23:07,816 --> 00:23:09,796
They'll become stupid.

344
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:12,956
And at every stage you'll see they are becoming stupid

345
00:23:13,906 --> 00:23:16,906
and by that stupidity they are destroying themselves.

346
00:23:16,936 --> 00:23:18,906
You don't have to worry about that part.

347
00:23:18,986 --> 00:23:21,806
So that's why you don't need any destructive powers.

348
00:23:21,956 --> 00:23:27,796
It will all be done by this all-pervading Divine Power.

349
00:23:28,016 --> 00:23:30,537
So that part you have to give up.

350
00:23:30,704 --> 00:23:33,846
You just forgive that person.

351
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,026
As soon as you forgive,

352
00:23:38,996 --> 00:23:41,916
the responsibility from you shifts

353
00:23:43,796 --> 00:23:45,906
and then Kundalini rises.

354
00:23:46,886 --> 00:23:50,886
You don't have to carry any malice, anything against him,

355
00:23:50,936 --> 00:23:54,826
but just laugh because they are blind,

356
00:23:54,996 --> 00:23:57,026
because they are stupid,

357
00:23:57,826 --> 00:23:58,966
they are foolish.

358
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:03,846
What do we do if you see an idiot?

359
00:24:04,796 --> 00:24:06,916
We may not laugh in his presence but we do,

360
00:24:06,956 --> 00:24:10,916
isn't it, at his back, because he's an idiot.

361
00:24:11,956 --> 00:24:14,956
So they become idiotic

362
00:24:15,886 --> 00:24:19,816
and you see them becoming idiotic and then you just start.

363
00:24:19,856 --> 00:24:21,617
You see that's the humor of Sahaja Yoga,

364
00:24:21,642 --> 00:24:23,906
you have to have some humor also, isn't it?

365
00:24:24,936 --> 00:24:27,846
And then you start seeing these jokers you see,

366
00:24:27,886 --> 00:24:29,806
behaving in that manner

367
00:24:29,906 --> 00:24:34,936
and the whole circus they do is nothing but jocular.

368
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:39,936
So there's nothing to have any fear from any human being;

369
00:24:40,966 --> 00:24:43,846
same about organizations or anything.

370
00:24:43,886 --> 00:24:45,986
Naturally you have to know one thing:

371
00:24:46,846 --> 00:24:48,846
that as you are Realized souls,

372
00:24:49,026 --> 00:24:50,886
you have seen the truth,

373
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:52,966
you are in the light so they are going to oppose you,

374
00:24:52,996 --> 00:24:54,936
they are going to oppose you.

375
00:24:56,946 --> 00:24:59,976
They did this, isn't it, to others;

376
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:03,936
everybody suffered so much.

377
00:25:05,966 --> 00:25:08,886
But now no more sufferings to you,

378
00:25:08,996 --> 00:25:12,946
only thing you can enjoy the humor.

379
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,936
Just understand this point,

380
00:25:17,006 --> 00:25:20,926
that nothing will destroy you, no one can touch you

381
00:25:21,006 --> 00:25:25,866
but they are there just to supply some humor for you.

382
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:29,415
If you take such a light attitude towards them,

383
00:25:29,816 --> 00:25:32,826
all this fear and left side will go away.

384
00:25:34,016 --> 00:25:37,956
What are these baddhas, and what are these bhoots,

385
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:40,906
and what are these tantrikas? Nothing.

386
00:25:40,966 --> 00:25:42,936
You are so powerful.

387
00:25:43,006 --> 00:25:44,926
Just with one glance

388
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,786
you can see them dancing on their heads,

389
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:49,866
the other way round.

390
00:25:51,006 --> 00:25:53,896
As long as you'll have fear

391
00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:58,816
Kundalini won't rise because She doesn't rise for people

392
00:25:58,876 --> 00:26:00,846
who are cowards.

393
00:26:01,796 --> 00:26:03,986
Cowardice She is not going to support.

394
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,956
If you are a coward She said, “All right”.

395
00:26:08,896 --> 00:26:10,926
You are walking on the street,

396
00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:14,906
normally people are afraid if there's darkness,

397
00:26:14,966 --> 00:26:18,816
afraid that somebody might attack,

398
00:26:18,926 --> 00:26:20,876
but a Sahaja Yogi does not,

399
00:26:20,926 --> 00:26:21,936
if he's a real Sahaja Yogi,

400
00:26:21,986 --> 00:26:24,846
because he knows there are ganas

401
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,816
and there are angels around him.

402
00:26:26,846 --> 00:26:28,796
No one can touch him,

403
00:26:28,936 --> 00:26:30,896
and the one who will try,

404
00:26:31,796 --> 00:26:34,791
these ganas will make such a fool out of that person

405
00:26:34,816 --> 00:26:36,906
that you'll have a nice chance to laugh at him.

406
00:26:38,896 --> 00:26:40,866
Now you watch and see.

407
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:46,986
So this left side or this fear should go.

408
00:26:47,016 --> 00:26:50,786
Once this fear will go all your slyness,

409
00:26:50,846 --> 00:26:56,986
all your intrigues, all your jealousies will just disappear.

410
00:26:59,006 --> 00:27:03,796
That's how the Kundalini will rise very well.

411
00:27:08,826 --> 00:27:15,906
Then another problem is for the awakening of the Kundalini,

412
00:27:15,956 --> 00:27:17,926
is your ego.

413
00:27:17,976 --> 00:27:20,826
That's tremendous, I must admit,

414
00:27:21,786 --> 00:27:24,826
rather too much for people who follow Christ,

415
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:28,786
is very surprising and those who follow Buddha,

416
00:27:29,956 --> 00:27:32,016
because they are anti-Christ,

417
00:27:32,846 --> 00:27:34,986
because they are anti-Buddha.

418
00:27:35,896 --> 00:27:38,906
The one who on the cross said that,

419
00:27:38,956 --> 00:27:39,906
“Oh Father,

420
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:43,786
forgive them for they do not know what they are doing”;

421
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:47,613
if you are following Him how can you have ego?

422
00:27:52,016 --> 00:28:00,826
Now the forgiveness should be absolutely spontaneous within.

423
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:10,976
There should be no ripple even of anger

424
00:28:11,786 --> 00:28:13,936
because you are so powerful.

425
00:28:16,976 --> 00:28:20,876
What can anybody harm you?

426
00:28:20,986 --> 00:28:22,956
But if you catch on your Agnya,

427
00:28:22,986 --> 00:28:24,846
only you are harming yourself.

428
00:28:24,876 --> 00:28:27,876
If you want to harm yourself nobody can help it.

429
00:28:30,826 --> 00:28:33,976
So this anger, which comes from liver

430
00:28:34,016 --> 00:28:40,866
and settles down in your Agnya, has to be looked into.

431
00:28:41,876 --> 00:28:44,976
That's a very important thing where Kundalini stops,

432
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:47,016
in the West specially.

433
00:28:50,026 --> 00:28:56,916
Because this whole culture here has created two problems.

434
00:28:58,006 --> 00:29:03,806
The first one is acquisition instinct,

435
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,916
what you call as greed.

436
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:13,916
The more greed you have the more these machines can run

437
00:29:13,956 --> 00:29:18,926
and you can have industrial development of plastics,

438
00:29:19,816 --> 00:29:23,846
and then have a conference against ecology.

439
00:29:26,886 --> 00:29:28,886
In Spain I saw,

440
00:29:29,806 --> 00:29:31,986
I don't know, there must be three, four car factories

441
00:29:32,026 --> 00:29:34,866
because every car had only one driver

442
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:36,956
because it had to be there.

443
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,896
And so many cars

444
00:29:41,866 --> 00:29:44,846
that you just don't know how to move.

445
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:47,916
For your program also is impossible,

446
00:29:47,956 --> 00:29:49,916
you must start two hours earlier

447
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:51,986
when you can just take fifteen minutes.

448
00:29:52,956 --> 00:29:56,806
In France is another thing, Paris.

449
00:29:57,006 --> 00:29:59,836
Paris, if you want to go somewhere

450
00:29:59,886 --> 00:30:02,916
you should start at four o'clock in the morning,

451
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:06,846
otherwise you cannot reach that place.

452
00:30:08,836 --> 00:30:12,976
Same about Milan and same about Rome.

453
00:30:13,886 --> 00:30:15,926
The worst is Switzerland,

454
00:30:16,806 --> 00:30:19,861
I don't know what to say about Switzerland,

455
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:23,826
the name itself is rather, very dangerous,

456
00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:32,976
because they are making all ugly money,

457
00:30:33,026 --> 00:30:34,856
they are doing all these things,

458
00:30:34,886 --> 00:30:36,946
I mean every kind of sin they have got

459
00:30:36,996 --> 00:30:39,936
in the name of acquisition.

460
00:30:40,016 --> 00:30:43,801
For them nothing like sin, taking somebody's money nicely,

461
00:30:43,826 --> 00:30:46,856
keeping that there, extracting money from poor countries,

462
00:30:46,916 --> 00:30:48,996
keeping, they don't feel there's anything wrong,

463
00:30:49,026 --> 00:30:51,796
I mean, they have become immune.

464
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:57,936
So this acquisition instinct that we have

465
00:30:58,016 --> 00:30:59,986
and which has been very much fanned

466
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:06,026
and has been made into a big sort of a quality in the West,

467
00:31:08,856 --> 00:31:12,936
we should try to see it clearly.

468
00:31:13,936 --> 00:31:17,876
In the olden days in the same European countries

469
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:21,906
this was used for creating art,

470
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:26,916
for producing artist, for supporting artist.

471
00:31:27,936 --> 00:31:29,826
Even in our country,

472
00:31:29,856 --> 00:31:31,986
artists were supported by the kings

473
00:31:32,026 --> 00:31:35,876
and all the big empires that we had.

474
00:31:37,966 --> 00:31:40,806
These days there's no question,

475
00:31:40,846 --> 00:31:43,856
no government is willing to support the artist.

476
00:31:44,876 --> 00:31:47,936
You know that Mozart was called by the queen herself

477
00:31:48,026 --> 00:31:50,026
to play before her.

478
00:31:51,886 --> 00:31:55,806
So the governments were not only looking after

479
00:31:55,836 --> 00:31:57,796
the collection of taxes

480
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,771
but they were looking after the artists,

481
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:06,916
musicians, painters and people who did creative art.

482
00:32:09,016 --> 00:32:11,026
Like in France you can see

483
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:15,906
how their queen collected beautiful artistic things

484
00:32:15,946 --> 00:32:18,026
and encouraged artists

485
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:22,876
to do artistic work,

486
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:24,966
spent her money in that,

487
00:32:25,936 --> 00:32:29,986
and now, you know that she was killed by people.

488
00:32:30,886 --> 00:32:34,886
By killing her they have killed the art of France.

489
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:43,876
And now the French themselves have become bourgeois,

490
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:46,916
those whom they condemned, they have become that.

491
00:32:48,796 --> 00:32:50,906
So acquisition instinct

492
00:32:50,966 --> 00:32:59,806
has to be taken to the acquisition of art.

493
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:07,796
That also should not be plastic

494
00:33:07,846 --> 00:33:10,946
otherwise tomorrow we might start buying plastic

495
00:33:10,986 --> 00:33:13,026
artistic things.

496
00:33:13,936 --> 00:33:17,966
Genuinely made, hand made things.

497
00:33:21,796 --> 00:33:25,766
Or the music also which is very deep,

498
00:33:25,826 --> 00:33:30,916
classical, singing the songs of the Divine;

499
00:33:30,966 --> 00:33:34,856
not the cheap type music which just makes you mad

500
00:33:34,886 --> 00:33:40,946
or makes you full of lust and greed.

501
00:33:42,796 --> 00:33:45,826
So this is one of the problems of your culture

502
00:33:45,886 --> 00:33:51,016
which gives you this kind of a ego.

503
00:33:53,846 --> 00:34:00,846
I mean, people if they have say, a Rolls Royce

504
00:34:01,846 --> 00:34:03,946
then of course nobody can talk to them,

505
00:34:03,986 --> 00:34:08,856
their brain has blown out of their hats, completely.

506
00:34:08,906 --> 00:34:11,996
But even the driver of the Rolls Royce

507
00:34:12,986 --> 00:34:15,846
who doesn't own the Rolls Royce, he drives it,

508
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:17,956
his head is off.

509
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:21,936
He has a different gait, he walks in a different way,

510
00:34:21,986 --> 00:34:24,826
he talks in a different way.

511
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:34,936
So this acquisition instinct gives you so much of ego.

512
00:34:35,886 --> 00:34:37,966
I mean, you go to somebody's house,

513
00:34:38,856 --> 00:34:41,966
like some stupid Indians who are now in England

514
00:34:43,796 --> 00:34:45,796
I went to their house;

515
00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:50,801
they're sadarjis - means following the path of Guru Nanaka

516
00:34:50,826 --> 00:34:52,986
where drinking is not allowed.

517
00:34:53,856 --> 00:34:58,016
So as soon as you rise he shows us a pub in his house.

518
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:04,512
“My God,” I said. I went back three, four steps, you see.

519
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:08,846
He says, “See my pubu,” as he says,

520
00:35:09,016 --> 00:35:13,876
and from the pub he takes out a soda thing and shows us how

521
00:35:13,936 --> 00:35:16,886
it pumps out the soda, just imagine

522
00:35:19,856 --> 00:35:21,966
and he wouldn't talk, you know.

523
00:35:22,806 --> 00:35:24,906
And when we said, "We don't drink,"

524
00:35:24,966 --> 00:35:28,026
he thought we were sinners of the worst type,

525
00:35:29,826 --> 00:35:31,856
that we don't drink.

526
00:35:32,906 --> 00:35:36,826
So this acquisition instinct is now ending up

527
00:35:36,986 --> 00:35:43,806
into something which is very cheap, vulgar and immoral.

528
00:35:48,956 --> 00:35:51,956
The fondness for showing off

529
00:35:52,816 --> 00:35:57,006
is so much that you are sometimes shocked,

530
00:35:57,926 --> 00:36:00,906
the way people try to show off.

531
00:36:01,836 --> 00:36:04,876
Like a American lady came from America

532
00:36:05,786 --> 00:36:07,846
and she asked Me, “Mrs. Srivastava,

533
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:10,816
how many pubs You have seen in London?”

534
00:36:11,806 --> 00:36:12,876
I said, “None.”

535
00:36:12,906 --> 00:36:19,976
“Oh, You are good for nothing, useless, absolutely.

536
00:36:20,816 --> 00:36:24,976
You haven't seen any pub. The best houses in any village,

537
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,926
any city in England is a pub.”

538
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,826
I said, “From outside I have seen.”

539
00:36:30,886 --> 00:36:32,806
All right, just to satisfy;

540
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:34,856
I thought she’s artistic.

541
00:36:35,906 --> 00:36:40,976
“No, no, no, no. Do You know the best pub in London?”

542
00:36:41,806 --> 00:36:43,946
She gave Me the list, you know.

543
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,986
I said, “Which one is the best?”

544
00:36:48,026 --> 00:36:50,906
“There was one called Hermit's Pub.”

545
00:36:51,886 --> 00:36:53,976
I said: "What is this supposed to be?"

546
00:36:54,856 --> 00:36:59,826
"You know, the man who was living in this house died

547
00:36:59,946 --> 00:37:02,856
and nobody knew that he's dead,

548
00:37:03,886 --> 00:37:08,856
so for months together nobody went in

549
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:11,886
and the whole place was filled with that stink,

550
00:37:12,836 --> 00:37:15,826
and lots of cobwebs were there.

551
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:18,986
Then they removed that

552
00:37:21,886 --> 00:37:23,916
dead body from there,

553
00:37:23,946 --> 00:37:27,798
and the stink is still there and the cobwebs,

554
00:37:27,826 --> 00:37:29,876
absolutely intact, you know.

555
00:37:30,856 --> 00:37:33,856
You have to be careful that you don't break them.

556
00:37:34,856 --> 00:37:39,826
And there, that is the best pub,

557
00:37:39,876 --> 00:37:42,876
for which you have to pay quite a lot.

558
00:37:43,026 --> 00:37:44,916
And I have seen that.”

559
00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:49,946
So proud. So where does it end then?

560
00:37:50,856 --> 00:37:54,986
This acquisition instinct ends in where?

561
00:37:56,796 --> 00:37:59,996
In rottening things, in putrefying,

562
00:38:01,826 --> 00:38:03,906
you may call it fermenting.

563
00:38:07,026 --> 00:38:09,836
It has to end up

564
00:38:09,906 --> 00:38:11,946
because the reaction of the ego comes

565
00:38:11,996 --> 00:38:16,916
and you start enjoying things which are rotten.

566
00:38:16,966 --> 00:38:19,026
Like cheese of France,

567
00:38:20,886 --> 00:38:25,876
never eat that, I tell you, you'll burn your finger,

568
00:38:25,966 --> 00:38:29,936
you will burn your throat and you'll burn your stomach.

569
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:33,806
It is very rotten,

570
00:38:33,966 --> 00:38:36,936
and the more rotten it is the better.

571
00:38:38,806 --> 00:38:42,886
The wine, the wine is the rotten grape juice,

572
00:38:42,936 --> 00:38:44,826
absolutely rotten,

573
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:45,966
you can't take it,

574
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:50,986
it smells, I've seen smells like a rotten cork.

575
00:38:53,796 --> 00:38:55,916
I asked somebody, “How does it smell?”

576
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:57,986
He said, “It's very fine.”

577
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:02,836
I said, “Does it smell like rotten cork?”

578
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:04,836
“I've never smelt a cork.”

579
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:07,996
That's why I said - if he had smelt a rotten cork

580
00:39:08,796 --> 00:39:10,966
he would never have taken to wine;

581
00:39:11,856 --> 00:39:15,016
so all things that are rotten.

582
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,986
You know the discovery of cheese, what had happened,

583
00:39:17,996 --> 00:39:19,976
how it started, do you know that?

584
00:39:20,936 --> 00:39:26,796
There was a big snowfall and milk was left in one cave.

585
00:39:26,946 --> 00:39:30,966
So because of the snowfall everybody forgot about the milk,

586
00:39:31,796 --> 00:39:36,996
it was left there, then summer time the milk became rotten,

587
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:39,936
then it became more rotten, more rotten.

588
00:39:40,026 --> 00:39:44,806
After twelve years or so, somebody went and saw this there.

589
00:39:53,876 --> 00:39:56,946
Thank God I have not taken My food today.

590
00:40:01,796 --> 00:40:05,906
And so they took that milk,

591
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:08,826
they called it cheese.

592
00:40:12,806 --> 00:40:16,906
In India cheez is used in Urdu language specially,

593
00:40:16,946 --> 00:40:18,986
for something which is,

594
00:40:19,826 --> 00:40:22,906
something special thing, something very special,

595
00:40:22,996 --> 00:40:25,906
and also as you know in music they use it

596
00:40:25,946 --> 00:40:31,026
for some special composition, cheez.

597
00:40:32,936 --> 00:40:39,856
But here the cheese is the most rotten milk

598
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:44,026
which no human beings or animals should eat.

599
00:40:44,886 --> 00:40:48,856
Worms may, so they gave it to worms,

600
00:40:48,936 --> 00:40:56,806
and I know in Holland and also in Sweden I think, yah,

601
00:40:59,016 --> 00:41:02,016
they had cheese with worms

602
00:41:02,826 --> 00:41:04,916
and they were eating the worms;

603
00:41:04,986 --> 00:41:08,826
can you beat it, it is true;

604
00:41:09,836 --> 00:41:12,026
not only the cheese but also the worms.

605
00:41:14,026 --> 00:41:16,806
I mean see where we have ended up

606
00:41:16,856 --> 00:41:19,026
into our acquisition instinct.

607
00:41:21,806 --> 00:41:25,781
The wine has to be hundred year old, certified,

608
00:41:25,806 --> 00:41:26,946
that's the best.

609
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:33,806
Such rotten things we are eating,

610
00:41:33,846 --> 00:41:36,806
they smell, I tell you, they smell of it.

611
00:41:36,876 --> 00:41:39,906
That's why, once I was surprised that,

612
00:41:40,026 --> 00:41:42,946
they go to the bathroom, don't even wash their hands.

613
00:41:43,026 --> 00:41:45,856
We get such horrible smells, they don't get

614
00:41:45,886 --> 00:41:47,836
because if you take that cheese

615
00:41:47,886 --> 00:41:49,996
you cannot smell anything rotten.

616
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:52,906
Even if you put them in the gutters

617
00:41:52,946 --> 00:41:54,771
they won't feel anything rotten

618
00:41:54,796 --> 00:41:58,806
because it's all that dirty smell, they are used to.

619
00:41:59,906 --> 00:42:01,906
Is the filth, I mean even if they go to hell

620
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,836
they won't feel bad because the smell will be the same.

621
00:42:10,856 --> 00:42:12,996
So where should we put them?

622
00:42:15,886 --> 00:42:18,826
They are so immune to that dirty smell

623
00:42:19,906 --> 00:42:23,016
which is absolutely sub-human.

624
00:42:24,856 --> 00:42:28,906
So this acquisition instinct in any elite society

625
00:42:28,986 --> 00:42:31,966
- once upon a time French society was regarded as elite

626
00:42:56,856 --> 00:43:00,651
- so the most elite society was the French society

627
00:43:00,676 --> 00:43:06,796
was most diplomatic in every way.

628
00:43:06,926 --> 00:43:10,986
Their food was made with wine, everything was wine,

629
00:43:12,016 --> 00:43:16,926
and this diplomatic society once upon… ruled the whole

630
00:43:16,966 --> 00:43:19,006
diplomatic areas.

631
00:43:21,786 --> 00:43:24,816
But they never realized

632
00:43:24,986 --> 00:43:31,786
that the whole culture was nothing but eating and drinking.

633
00:43:32,926 --> 00:43:36,866
Nothing else but eating and drinking.

634
00:43:39,006 --> 00:43:42,896
And later on maybe little politics started.

635
00:43:43,936 --> 00:43:47,006
But this eating and drinking

636
00:43:47,936 --> 00:43:50,796
went to such a limit

637
00:43:51,826 --> 00:43:55,487
that now they have gone out of diplomatic areas;

638
00:43:55,512 --> 00:43:59,956
no one wants them because they never think in the right way.

639
00:44:00,006 --> 00:44:02,876
Any diplomat, French diplomat is anywhere,

640
00:44:02,936 --> 00:44:05,816
people say, “Is he French?” “Yes.”

641
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:07,866
“Then better not call him for this meeting,

642
00:44:07,906 --> 00:44:12,926
you know, he'll put his own ideas.” They went out.

643
00:44:13,816 --> 00:44:18,006
So now that eliteness is shifted in America.

644
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,846
So the most elite are taking to drugs.

645
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:23,796
What is it after all?

646
00:44:23,826 --> 00:44:27,906
Drugs is creation of this acquisition instinct only.

647
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:33,966
Why should you blame Colombians or anybody else?

648
00:44:33,976 --> 00:44:35,786
They are making their money, all right

649
00:44:35,816 --> 00:44:36,986
as you are all making,

650
00:44:37,846 --> 00:44:39,956
but the one they are feeding is America,

651
00:44:40,006 --> 00:44:44,896
and America is the main thing now in acquisition instinct.

652
00:44:44,976 --> 00:44:46,986
And what are they acquiring?

653
00:44:47,846 --> 00:44:49,896
I have been in that society,

654
00:44:49,936 --> 00:44:52,786
they only talk of drugs.

655
00:44:52,796 --> 00:44:53,986
All right,

656
00:44:54,816 --> 00:44:56,906
drugs they talk not only that

657
00:44:56,926 --> 00:44:59,816
but it's like a shopping of drugs.

658
00:45:00,786 --> 00:45:02,846
They all know where you get drugs,

659
00:45:02,876 --> 00:45:05,866
all these so-called ambassadors and these people,

660
00:45:05,906 --> 00:45:07,866
and their wives.

661
00:45:07,936 --> 00:45:10,946
With all their dresses have become simpler now,

662
00:45:10,956 --> 00:45:13,906
they do not dress up the way formerly

663
00:45:13,936 --> 00:45:16,016
the ambassadors’ wives used to dress up.

664
00:45:16,836 --> 00:45:20,976
I will not be surprised if they come in holey pants.

665
00:45:24,786 --> 00:45:27,786
So this acquisition instinct you can see in the

666
00:45:27,836 --> 00:45:30,836
elite society has ended up into drugs,

667
00:45:30,986 --> 00:45:35,846
and if not, into gurus - false gurus.

668
00:45:35,906 --> 00:45:38,896
Those who got fed up with this went to false gurus

669
00:45:38,926 --> 00:45:40,896
because they have no discrimination

670
00:45:40,936 --> 00:45:43,876
to know what is right and what is wrong.

671
00:45:45,906 --> 00:45:50,866
See, step by step, how it has gone into the rotten state,

672
00:45:50,906 --> 00:45:53,926
this ego, in the West.

673
00:45:53,986 --> 00:45:56,796
So this is the first point,

674
00:45:56,976 --> 00:46:01,806
is the acquisition instinct you have.

675
00:46:01,896 --> 00:46:04,956
In that then somebody’s wife is good-looking,

676
00:46:05,006 --> 00:46:08,946
then every man has a right to look at her.

677
00:46:09,816 --> 00:46:12,946
Or some man is good-looking, maybe anybody’s husband

678
00:46:12,976 --> 00:46:15,344
– every woman has right to look at him.

679
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:17,866
Not look at her own husband but another man,

680
00:46:17,896 --> 00:46:19,786
what’s the use?

681
00:46:19,816 --> 00:46:20,946
I’ve never been able to understand,

682
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,946
“What’s the use of looking at another man

683
00:46:22,986 --> 00:46:25,796
who is not your husband?”

684
00:46:28,816 --> 00:46:32,417
This acquisition instinct has gone

685
00:46:32,796 --> 00:46:37,866
into complete immoral life, immoral society

686
00:46:37,946 --> 00:46:45,976
and they have lost sense of respect of their age.

687
00:46:47,816 --> 00:46:51,976
A ninety-year-old woman having a love affair

688
00:46:51,986 --> 00:46:54,946
with a grandson who is eighteen-year-old;

689
00:46:55,016 --> 00:47:00,786
just think of that, such stupidity, such nonsense.

690
00:47:00,956 --> 00:47:04,926
How is it possible unless and until

691
00:47:04,976 --> 00:47:10,836
we have some sort of a perverted acquisition instinct?

692
00:47:11,006 --> 00:47:13,926
Even art has gone into perversion,

693
00:47:14,016 --> 00:47:16,986
everything has gone into perversion

694
00:47:21,946 --> 00:47:25,956
- because the curse of the Western society is that

695
00:47:25,986 --> 00:47:28,956
there is no maryada.

696
00:47:29,976 --> 00:47:33,926
And Kundalini rises in its own maryada,

697
00:47:34,926 --> 00:47:37,866
it brings back your maryadas,

698
00:47:37,906 --> 00:47:39,976
it keeps you into your maryadas.

699
00:47:40,006 --> 00:47:41,926
You are a human being,

700
00:47:41,976 --> 00:47:44,926
don't live like animals, even worse than animals.

701
00:47:44,976 --> 00:47:49,786
You have no right to do that.

702
00:47:49,836 --> 00:47:53,480
God has not created you to be sub-human

703
00:47:53,528 --> 00:47:55,956
but to be super-human being.

704
00:47:56,016 --> 00:47:59,956
So, this is how it works out.

705
00:48:01,976 --> 00:48:04,876
You can now think about it, how far it goes

706
00:48:04,906 --> 00:48:06,956
this acquisition instinct,

707
00:48:08,866 --> 00:48:10,876
about things.

708
00:48:12,896 --> 00:48:15,976
But the second very bad curse

709
00:48:16,906 --> 00:48:21,786
of the Western acquisition instinct is

710
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:26,816
that they want to acquire, aggress, others.

711
00:48:30,786 --> 00:48:33,906
Aggression, the aggressiveness.

712
00:48:35,836 --> 00:48:38,946
They think they have a right to aggress other countries,

713
00:48:38,986 --> 00:48:42,836
I mean they aggressed our country for three hundred years.

714
00:48:42,866 --> 00:48:45,986
Why? Why did they aggress? We are not bad people.

715
00:48:46,796 --> 00:48:50,876
Because we had gold, we had diamonds,

716
00:48:51,866 --> 00:48:54,816
we had pearls,

717
00:48:54,956 --> 00:48:56,896
we had lots of things

718
00:48:56,926 --> 00:49:00,866
which were just material things for which they aggressed us,

719
00:49:00,906 --> 00:49:03,976
and they didn't take any spirituality from India.

720
00:49:04,866 --> 00:49:06,896
So the French aggressed, these aggressed,

721
00:49:06,926 --> 00:49:07,976
all the time aggressing.

722
00:49:08,016 --> 00:49:10,986
Japanese are also following you.

723
00:49:13,876 --> 00:49:16,896
This aggression then moves the whole society

724
00:49:16,946 --> 00:49:20,796
into a very destructive force.

725
00:49:20,946 --> 00:49:24,786
You can see every day the wars are going on,

726
00:49:24,816 --> 00:49:26,796
this is fighting that, that is fighting that,

727
00:49:26,846 --> 00:49:28,896
they want this, they want that.

728
00:49:28,956 --> 00:49:31,906
And this aggression has also penetrated

729
00:49:31,946 --> 00:49:34,846
the developing countries, the third world also.

730
00:49:34,876 --> 00:49:38,946
So, nicely the disease is on.

731
00:49:42,926 --> 00:49:48,836
But Kundalini kills that acquisition.

732
00:49:49,836 --> 00:49:52,846
How? By giving you joy.

733
00:49:54,836 --> 00:49:56,946
You enjoy everything.

734
00:49:57,876 --> 00:50:00,816
You are sitting in a jungle, you are enjoying,

735
00:50:00,926 --> 00:50:03,926
here in uncomfortable conditions, you enjoy

736
00:50:03,976 --> 00:50:07,906
because you seek the comfort of your spirit,

737
00:50:07,946 --> 00:50:09,781
because that gives you joy

738
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:12,896
- ultimately that's what you get out of everything.

739
00:50:13,006 --> 00:50:15,986
You think you get joy by acquisition; you do not.

740
00:50:18,786 --> 00:50:22,016
But through Kundalini awakening you get that joy,

741
00:50:22,836 --> 00:50:26,926
and in that joy you don't want anything,

742
00:50:28,836 --> 00:50:29,926
you don't ask for anything;

743
00:50:29,976 --> 00:50:31,876
you just enjoy yourself;

744
00:50:31,906 --> 00:50:34,896
you are the property of enjoyment.

745
00:50:35,976 --> 00:50:39,016
Sanskrit they say,  “Atmanyeva atmane ahrushta”

746
00:50:39,866 --> 00:50:43,926
- “The Spirit is satisfied by its own spirit.”

747
00:50:47,866 --> 00:50:51,896
So into small things you must see joy,

748
00:50:52,876 --> 00:50:57,876
and you must watch it, the whole universe, with that thing.

749
00:50:58,796 --> 00:51:00,806
I mean when I am traveling I'll ask,

750
00:51:00,836 --> 00:51:01,916
“What is this tree?”

751
00:51:01,946 --> 00:51:02,996
“Mother, we don't know.”

752
00:51:03,016 --> 00:51:04,976
“Well, you lived here for so many years, you don't know?”

753
00:51:04,996 --> 00:51:06,996
“No Mother, we don't know much about trees.”

754
00:51:07,026 --> 00:51:08,826
I say, “What are these flowers?”

755
00:51:08,856 --> 00:51:09,906
“We don't know.”

756
00:51:10,826 --> 00:51:12,856
I mean what are you doing, what have you been doing,

757
00:51:12,876 --> 00:51:13,856
you don't know what are the trees,

758
00:51:13,886 --> 00:51:14,996
every day you watch them;

759
00:51:15,026 --> 00:51:17,906
you don't know what is the tree is?

760
00:51:20,916 --> 00:51:23,846
But if you ask them, “Where do you get this wine?”

761
00:51:23,886 --> 00:51:24,996
they will know.

762
00:51:24,996 --> 00:51:26,816
“Mother, this is the place

763
00:51:26,856 --> 00:51:28,806
where they produced the best wines.”

764
00:51:28,816 --> 00:51:29,966
“All right, I'll see to it.”

765
00:51:30,006 --> 00:51:33,896
And next year they had no fermentation.

766
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:43,781
So, this is the acquisition instinct which is very,

767
00:51:43,806 --> 00:51:47,750
sort of a, which becomes a political asset

768
00:51:47,775 --> 00:51:48,996
that you go and aggress other countries,

769
00:51:49,026 --> 00:51:53,886
aggress other people and use all kinds of things;

770
00:51:56,866 --> 00:51:59,926
and that really is killing.

771
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:04,856
So the whole attitude of human beings changes,

772
00:52:04,896 --> 00:52:06,306
they think we are the Lord,

773
00:52:06,465 --> 00:52:07,896
we can hate anyone,

774
00:52:07,966 --> 00:52:09,806
we can aggress anyone,

775
00:52:09,836 --> 00:52:10,976
we could be arrogant with anyone,

776
00:52:11,026 --> 00:52:14,806
we can demand anything, we can take away anybody's wife,

777
00:52:14,856 --> 00:52:17,449
take away anybody's child, take away anything,

778
00:52:17,474 --> 00:52:19,786
we can kill our children.

779
00:52:20,936 --> 00:52:25,916
As a result the love is lost;

780
00:52:25,996 --> 00:52:28,996
no question of compassion.

781
00:52:29,836 --> 00:52:32,946
Love is lost, compassion is lost; no love.

782
00:52:35,996 --> 00:52:39,896
And with that you also developed “my” and “mine”,

783
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:41,916
sense of “my and mine”

784
00:52:42,946 --> 00:52:45,826
- is that this is my child,

785
00:52:46,806 --> 00:52:48,826
this is my country,

786
00:52:49,786 --> 00:52:53,936
this is... As you know in Yugoslavia what they are doing.

787
00:52:53,966 --> 00:52:58,026
I don't know who gave the name of Yugo, Yugo means Yoga.

788
00:52:58,836 --> 00:53:02,896
This is the Yoga people, fighting among themselves.

789
00:53:02,996 --> 00:53:07,946
This has come from the same root that,

790
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,936
“This is mine, this is my country”.

791
00:53:09,966 --> 00:53:12,806
Why? How is it your country?

792
00:53:12,866 --> 00:53:15,886
You can't create one leaf, so who are you?

793
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:20,026
You can't create little mud, can you?

794
00:53:22,026 --> 00:53:25,876
How do you say, “This is my country?” How dare?

795
00:53:25,886 --> 00:53:27,996
This all belongs to God.

796
00:53:28,816 --> 00:53:31,936
He has created, or you can say Adi Shakti has created.

797
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:34,986
You have not created even so much;

798
00:53:35,026 --> 00:53:38,856
how do you say, “This is mine and I should have it?”

799
00:53:38,926 --> 00:53:44,016
So the “my” and “mine” thing also develops, very strong.

800
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:47,816
And the same thing happens with, sometimes, Sahaja Yogis,

801
00:53:47,856 --> 00:53:52,856
very much. “My children”, this is the first curse.

802
00:53:54,856 --> 00:54:00,816
“These are my children, my wife, my family”,

803
00:54:01,926 --> 00:54:04,826
it starts growing like that.

804
00:54:06,846 --> 00:54:09,986
Then the heart shrinks.

805
00:54:10,966 --> 00:54:15,258
For a large-hearted man the whole world is the universe,

806
00:54:15,528 --> 00:54:18,936
the whole thing is within,

807
00:54:18,966 --> 00:54:21,786
the whole thing is yours.

808
00:54:23,976 --> 00:54:28,946
When such a heart you experience within yourself

809
00:54:28,996 --> 00:54:31,290
then Kundalini just shoots off because,

810
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:34,016
as you know, the Sahasrara is the Heart Chakra.

811
00:54:34,996 --> 00:54:37,976
No question of Sahasrara catching

812
00:54:38,856 --> 00:54:40,906
if you have a large heart.

813
00:54:41,836 --> 00:54:44,016
And to keep the Sahasrara open

814
00:54:44,826 --> 00:54:49,806
- is just develop that sense, that wisdom,

815
00:54:49,856 --> 00:54:52,886
that: "Nobody's mine, everybody belongs to God.

816
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:54,916
Who is mine?

817
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:58,946
Whatever God wants, let Him do."

818
00:54:59,016 --> 00:55:02,936
So get out of this small feeling.

819
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:06,806
Sahaja Yogis do, I must say, I have seen it.

820
00:55:06,866 --> 00:55:09,946
They get confined to their families.

821
00:55:11,856 --> 00:55:13,806
“My son hasn't got Realization,

822
00:55:13,856 --> 00:55:15,936
my brother hasn't got Realization, my this thing.”

823
00:55:16,966 --> 00:55:20,826
After that it moves, when they get Realization,

824
00:55:20,856 --> 00:55:23,826
“This is my son, my brother, my sister, this thing.”

825
00:55:23,866 --> 00:55:27,806
This “my” has to drop, which is very, very subtle thing,

826
00:55:27,836 --> 00:55:29,946
and that's why the Sahasrara catches.

827
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:33,826
Everyone is yours

828
00:55:35,956 --> 00:55:44,016
because the Kundalini of Sahaja Yogis is made of love,

829
00:55:45,876 --> 00:55:47,876
pure love.

830
00:55:48,016 --> 00:55:52,796
The pure love has only pure desire, is to love,

831
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:55,966
love everyone equally.

832
00:55:57,846 --> 00:55:58,966
When you say it is difficult

833
00:55:58,996 --> 00:56:01,796
that means you are not trying Sahaja Yoga.

834
00:56:01,996 --> 00:56:03,966
Enlarge your heart;

835
00:56:04,016 --> 00:56:05,996
you'll never feel lost.

836
00:56:06,816 --> 00:56:10,986
To Me, when I was leaving England I was really, little bit,

837
00:56:11,026 --> 00:56:15,826
I mean happens like that, like a moon sucks in the sea,

838
00:56:15,876 --> 00:56:19,856
you see, I felt My heart was just pulled out,

839
00:56:19,996 --> 00:56:25,826
but I reach here, again I see My children waiting for Me,

840
00:56:26,846 --> 00:56:28,966
so it's over, finished.

841
00:56:29,796 --> 00:56:32,966
It's there I felt, now here I feel

842
00:56:33,916 --> 00:56:39,846
that pull of My heart was released.

843
00:56:41,846 --> 00:56:45,826
You are also My children here and they are also My children.

844
00:56:45,876 --> 00:56:47,966
For a Mother like this, how can I say,

845
00:56:48,016 --> 00:56:50,936
“Oh, say this is Mine, this is Mine?”

846
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:57,966
So like this, try to break away from this conditioning.

847
00:56:57,996 --> 00:57:00,966
First, in the West people don't care for family;

848
00:57:00,996 --> 00:57:03,936
they'll divorce ten times and advertise it,

849
00:57:03,966 --> 00:57:06,856
“I am tenth time divorced lady."

850
00:57:07,796 --> 00:57:10,966
Now they don't divorce but so get attached

851
00:57:12,016 --> 00:57:14,956
with their family, with their husbands;

852
00:57:14,996 --> 00:57:17,876
like glue I tell you, like glue.

853
00:57:18,856 --> 00:57:19,966
Sometimes I start wondering,

854
00:57:20,016 --> 00:57:23,826
“What have I done to make them like this?”

855
00:57:24,996 --> 00:57:28,876
So now it is important to see these points,

856
00:57:28,926 --> 00:57:33,996
and ultimately the heart is the Sahasrara,

857
00:57:34,796 --> 00:57:36,016
or you can call the Brahmarandra,

858
00:57:36,816 --> 00:57:39,886
then we have to come to heart.

859
00:57:39,936 --> 00:57:43,886
Do not reason out, do not argue it out,

860
00:57:44,796 --> 00:57:48,846
don't work it out mentally from books or anywhere,

861
00:57:48,886 --> 00:57:50,796
but through your heart,

862
00:57:50,846 --> 00:57:51,886
if you work it out,

863
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:55,926
you'll understand that nothing is more important

864
00:57:56,876 --> 00:57:59,816
than to love someone.

865
00:58:00,796 --> 00:58:05,956
And the highest thing is to love everyone equally.

866
00:58:06,796 --> 00:58:09,876
Of course in love you might have to say something

867
00:58:09,926 --> 00:58:11,856
to a person.

868
00:58:12,796 --> 00:58:15,629
The other day I had to say something to some Sahaja Yogini,

869
00:58:15,856 --> 00:58:16,806
so My husband said,

870
00:58:16,856 --> 00:58:18,565
“Don't say, she'll become Your enemy.”

871
00:58:18,796 --> 00:58:20,771
I said, “Let her become My enemy, it doesn't matter.

872
00:58:20,796 --> 00:58:23,826
It's My duty to tell her that this is wrong,

873
00:58:23,976 --> 00:58:28,841
otherwise I become her enemy because I don't… told her

874
00:58:28,866 --> 00:58:30,916
the truth and she will suffer.”

875
00:58:33,896 --> 00:58:36,916
So this is what it gives you discretion;

876
00:58:37,006 --> 00:58:40,856
and love is truth.

877
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:44,806
So to this Kundalini,

878
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:50,866
which is nothing but, is the river,

879
00:58:50,946 --> 00:58:53,866
as yesterday they described nirvaj,

880
00:58:54,896 --> 00:58:58,976
which doesn't accept any compensation.

881
00:58:59,806 --> 00:59:02,996
The river of that pure love

882
00:59:03,826 --> 00:59:05,886
which has awakened us with such love,

883
00:59:05,936 --> 00:59:07,916
kindness and tenderness,

884
00:59:07,966 --> 00:59:13,836
we should try to use that power within ourselves

885
00:59:13,896 --> 00:59:16,946
to be like that because our job is,

886
00:59:17,006 --> 00:59:19,856
She has given us Realization

887
00:59:19,916 --> 00:59:22,996
for the emancipation of the whole world,

888
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:24,886
not only our own.

889
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:28,886
So everyone has to give Realization to others

890
00:59:28,936 --> 00:59:31,916
otherwise their Kundalini will settle back.

891
00:59:32,866 --> 00:59:36,926
Talk about Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga is not part time,

892
00:59:37,836 --> 00:59:40,916
it is not a side issue, it should be always with you.

893
00:59:40,906 --> 00:59:42,896
Wherever you get a chance you have to talk

894
00:59:42,926 --> 00:59:44,906
about Sahaja Yoga, you have to work it out,

895
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:48,956
you have to give Realization, otherwise no use.

896
00:59:50,016 --> 00:59:52,876
May God bless you all.
