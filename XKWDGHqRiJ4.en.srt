H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
Press-Conference

2
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:27,190
London, England, July 8, 1999

3
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,920
I bow to all the seekers of truth.
First of all, it’s important to know what

4
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:30,380
the truth is. You find so many people are
seeking the truth, but they don’t know what

5
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,640
to find and that’s how they are twisted
around, taken to some sort of a false rites.

6
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:47,360
It’s important first of all to know what
is the truth that we are seeking. The truth

7
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:54,400
is, if I tell you, it’s very simple: that
you are not this body, you are not this mind,

8
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:07,450
you are not this intellect, you are not these
emotions, but you are the pure Spirit. That’s

9
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,599
what you have to become – the pure Spirit.
And another truth is that the power that leads

10
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:30,359
you to the state were you know the truth about
yourself, about everything is within you,

11
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:39,120
this power is within you, is your own. Born
with you, with every human being. That’s

12
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:48,239
surprising: if all the human beings in the
whole world have this power within their triangular

13
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,319
bone - how can we differentiate them? They
are all just the same, everybody has a power

14
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:01,319
based in their triangular bone known as sacrum,
that means the Greeks knew it was a sacred

15
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:10,230
bone. This fact that there is a power in the
triangular bone was known thousands of years

16
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:18,290
back, I should say, in India and in various
countries. I was surprised – even in Sweden

17
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:25,680
I found, Norway I found, people were talking
about. I don’t know how they came to know

18
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,680
about. Specially Moscow I found people who
knew about it. “How do you know?” I asked

19
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:42,879
them. They said: “Our forefathers told us”,
like that. Specially with Indian Americans

20
00:03:44,249 --> 00:03:48,319
they are very, very down-to-earth people,
very natural people, I think – they also

21
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:55,319
knew about it. And Africans also knew about
it. But they didn’t know how to raise it.

22
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,819
That was the only problem they had.
And though they knew about the centres, about

23
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:09,819
which just now you have been told, they didn’t
know how to enlighten them through this power

24
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:18,349
– can you imagine? This knowledge became
– sort of - a knowledge which people would

25
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:25,919
not accept, because we live with science or
rationality. This is something beyond that,

26
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:32,919
but Einstein has said so, Einstein has said
very clearly - that there is a torsion area

27
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:40,759
beyond the mind. And you have to go to that
torsion area where you can get cognitive science

28
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:51,490
– called science, but I would say, cognitive
personality. So, how is it going to happen

29
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:57,669
to go beyond the mind? If you try anything
it is through your mind only. Whatever you

30
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:04,669
do is through your mind. So to go beyond your
mind is not possible. Now this power lies

31
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:12,819
in the triangular bone, which we can see also
clearly sometimes in some people who have

32
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,419
obstruction, where it cannot rise. You see
the pulsation in the triangular bone which

33
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:25,419
is just a bone.
But when it rises it is a so smooth movement

34
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,139
of this power.
Now there are some people who have written

35
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:36,610
that this is a very dangerous thing and this
happens and that happens, maybe because they

36
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:43,060
can’t explain, maybe because they don’t
know anything about it perhaps, maybe they

37
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:50,060
do not want to know human beings to have it.
Now, this power is kept within us because

38
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:57,099
now our last breakthrough of our evolution
has to take place. We have to rise to that

39
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:07,639
state which you can call self-realized or
there is 1001 names for it. So many people

40
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:14,639
had this power within them - they felt it
also but they were not so much capable I think,

41
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:22,349
of raising the Kundalini. Sufis, you have
heard about. Saints, many saints – William

42
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:29,349
Blake, I would say, from England, there were
so many people. Shakespeare is another one.

43
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,110
They all were realized souls. The way they
have expressed themselves shows very well

44
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:42,110
how detached they were and how beautifully
they understood the reality.

45
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:49,090
So when this Kundalini rises as they have
been told, She passes through these six centres.

46
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:56,090
And these six centres are responsible for
our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual

47
00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:03,979
being. So, when these centres go into jeopardy,
some because of exhaustion, maybe something,

48
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:14,409
then it is needed to be nourished and this
Kundalini nourishes them. Not only It nourishes

49
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:21,409
but It also integrates them. So you get your
personality in a state where you are completely

50
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:27,750
integrated. But then She pierces through your
fontanel bone area. This is the actualisation

51
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:33,080
of baptism, you can say.
Actually She pierces through and gets you

52
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:40,080
connected to the all pervading power of Divine
Love. It’s all love, nothing else but love.

53
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:47,210
Truth is love and love is truth. And when
She becomes one with that you are a transformed

54
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:56,580
personality. Firstly your centres are enlightened.
So your health improves, mentally you get

55
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:04,120
balanced and also emotionally you understand.
But the greatest thing that happens to you

56
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:11,889
is that you become a new personality with
collective consciousness. Jung has talked

57
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:18,129
about it – “collective consciousness”.
That you can feel another person. You can

58
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:25,129
feel your own centres on your fingertips.
First you feel the cool breeze in your hand.

59
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:34,060
That is the cool breeze described in the bible
as “the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost”.

60
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:39,240
And also in Sanskrit language they call it
“Saleelam, Saleelam”. In Koran it is described

61
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,250
as “Ruh”. Everywhere it is described with
different names, meaning the same. You start

62
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:49,250
feeling this cool breeze in your hands, specially
on your fingertips and these fingertips denote

63
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:56,420
your different chakras as shown there. So,
if there is something wrong with your centres,

64
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:04,110
then it is indicated on your fingertips; but
if it is something wrong with others also

65
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,579
it is indicated because you become, - again
I say, it’s a question of becoming - you

66
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:16,579
become collectively conscious. But with that
you are not disturbed, you are absolutely

67
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:24,790
at peace with yourself and absolutely satisfied.
How it happens that our mind is always thinking

68
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:31,790
about the future, about the past. And our
mind is dancing over the cusp of these thoughts,

69
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:42,220
which are like this. But when this Kundalini
rises She elongates them and there is a space

70
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,880
in between created and that space is, what
we can say, is the present. We can be in the

71
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:54,880
future, we can be in the past, but we cannot
be in the present, and when you are in the

72
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:02,750
present you are absolutely thoughtless. You
just become a witness. A witness state comes

73
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:09,750
into you and you start watching everything,
not reacting. And absorbing everything, very

74
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:19,180
easy. It’s a very wonderful thing that happens
to you. So this mechanism is placed within

75
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:26,250
you to give you that special personality,
to give you that new awareness of collective

76
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,920
consciousness, and the last breakthrough of
your evolution. Till human awareness you are

77
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:38,920
alright, till that I must say they still are
there somehow. But we are afraid of the future

78
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:49,720
of human beings, because such a turmoil, so
many problems, so many kinds of ideas people

79
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,720
have, which is surprising that in these modern
times what people are thinking: they are something

80
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:04,139
absolutely primitive, I should say, criminal.
Violence and things, all this has to disappear.

81
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:14,329
And I was happy to hear that you all want
transformation, the resurrection. You want

82
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:23,010
transformation, and transformation on a collective
scale. This is quite possible, absolutely

83
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,360
possible. Once you are transformed, you become
a person of tremendous love and patience.

84
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:39,529
You love everything. You understand everything
through love. It’s not love of – some

85
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:48,389
sort of a – expectations, it’s a love
of giving. You just enjoy giving, giving everything

86
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:57,519
is so enjoyable that time, that state and
you become so peaceful. Then, as you know,

87
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:04,519
the economics is like that, people will work
very hard to have, say, a carpet like this

88
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:11,389
and then this is all done, then they will
have some motorcar, then they want to have

89
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:18,389
a house, I mean, goes on from one to another,
they are never satisfied. The thing for which

90
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:25,610
you have worked so hard is finished. Then
again starts a new urge to have something

91
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,410
new. Goes on like that, the whole economics
work like that.

92
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:34,880
But here, once I see this carpet, for example
here, I just go into thoughtless awareness.

93
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:41,880
And what do I see? I see the joy, I feel the
joy of the person, of the artist, who makes

94
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:51,990
and enjoy this. Otherwise thinking, I would
think how much it must have cost, where can

95
00:12:53,240 --> 00:13:00,240
I buy this, or if it is mine I would be worried,
Oh God, how I’ve not insured this, which

96
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:07,649
has no meaning. But I cannot enjoy unless
and until I become thoughtlessly aware.

97
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:14,649
Also in our Patanjali Yoga it is written down
as Nirvichara Samadhi. But he has made four

98
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:22,420
stages of the whole thing is that first is
this “Sarvichar”. Sarvichar means “with

99
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:28,600
thoughts” and then without thoughts, but
in Sahaja Yoga it is not so. It is so quick

100
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:35,600
that you become thoughtlessly aware first,
and then you become doubtlessly aware.

101
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:43,180
That is there are no doubts about yourself.
You know there is a power flowing and you

102
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,680
know by experiment that this power, this power
can cure people, can help others. And the

103
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:54,680
attention, which is very high. Like I found
people say “I like this, I want this”

104
00:13:55,429 --> 00:14:00,290
- that disappears.
Attention goes to others. You want to see

105
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:07,290
what others would like, others would feel,
and the whole personality gets completely

106
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:16,139
enshrined with the feeling of oneness with
others. It’s something has to happen to

107
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:23,860
all of you. I’m happy I lived in England
at least for 20 or 22 years and couldn’t

108
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,670
meet you people. But now, thank God, you people
have thought of it.

109
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:35,009
Now we live with science and rationality.
This is something beyond that, as I told you.

110
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:41,230
It is beyond science and rationality which
is accepted as cognitive science, people say.

111
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:47,519
And also as I’ve told you Einstein has talked
about the torsion area. But how to achieve

112
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:54,490
it, I don’t think he has written anything
about it. So this is your own power within

113
00:14:54,490 --> 00:15:01,490
yourself for which I don’t have to do anything
– they might have said it, alright. I accept

114
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:05,550
it.
But once it rises in you, it’s like one

115
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:12,550
candle can enlighten many candles. And that’s
how you can spread Sahaja Yoga very far. We

116
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:19,630
have, say, they say so, we are now in 72 countries,
possibly. Because one person gets it, he goes

117
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,889
to his country, starts working. And India,
of course, Indians know this very well, they

118
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:32,889
know they have to achieve only this. Like
some people told me that we are like Indian

119
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:44,879
culture. So, we have taken to Indian style
of life and we are very satisfied. I said

120
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:53,819
“Is that the end?” We have so many Indians
who are following that culture. Are they satisfied

121
00:15:53,819 --> 00:16:00,750
people? Is that the end? What have you to
do according to Indian scriptures also - that

122
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,259
you have to know yourself. You don’t know
yourself. You don’t know what’s wrong

123
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:10,569
with you, unless and until you can feel your
centres on your fingertips. You will not know

124
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:17,540
what’s wrong with you – till you end up
with something horrible. But as soon as you

125
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,519
get your Realisation, immediately you can
feel it on your fingertips - your problems.

126
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:28,100
Now, supposing you know how to cure it, you
can cure anybody’s and you don’t have

127
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,779
to pay for it.
See, again and again I’ve said that “it

128
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:39,529
is your own, it’s your power. You can’t
pay for it.” I don’t know how people believe

129
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:46,529
that for spirituality you can pay, it cannot
be sold. In America it was very difficult.

130
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,199
They all came to me and told me: “You have
to sell it”. I said: “How?” They said:

131
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:58,079
“Do something, otherwise nobody will come
to you.” I said: “But I cannot do something

132
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,699
that is not done.” So they said: “Alright,
you do one thing: take money from them and

133
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:09,069
tell them that when you come for follow-up
you will get back your money.”

134
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:15,860
So much we are bound by money that if you
have paid the money you think you are bound.

135
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:20,130
You have to do it. And absurd things like
that human beings think.

136
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:27,130
But why don’t they think that we have to
change this world? They have to have emancipation

137
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:34,000
of human being. Why now? Instead of doing
all kinds of other things, the best thing

138
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
is to change yourself, transform yourself
and enjoy. And enjoyment is complete. Because

139
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:48,350
enjoyment is singular. It is not happiness,
unhappiness, it’s just enjoyment. You enjoy

140
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:56,929
everything. Even the smallest thing can give
you enjoyment. And then you don’t start

141
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,270
feeling depressed or doing that kind of a
tantrums that you do to trouble others, but

142
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:10,270
you are so much enjoying and everybody enjoys
you also, because you are so enjoyable. That’s

143
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,390
the thing that should happen to human beings
and when it happens it’s something really

144
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:21,679
very, very great and that should happen to
all of you.

145
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,490
And I’ll be very happy, I was told you are
all very great dignitaries here and you can

146
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:31,490
do a lot and this is how we have a chance
of first of all getting your Self Realisation.

147
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:44,760
Knowing your Self. And then helping people.
With a genuine love and affection.

148
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:53,039
I don’t know how much I should talk because
we’ve had so many lectures after lectures

149
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,280
and there’s no end to it. But lecturing
doesn’t help – it is something else to

150
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,780
work out within yourself. That is the most
important thing.

151
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,980
Now, I would like also to have some questions
from you.

152
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:12,860
If you have gone thoughtless I can’t help
it.

153
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:19,860
Question: Have you overcome all the fears
of life? You are not afraid of death also?

154
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:35,520
Shri Mataji: I don’t know that part, but
definitely I knew that I have to find out

155
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:44,780
a way and method by which I could give en-masse
realisation. Because people used to give realisation,

156
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:53,370
no doubt, but one person used to give to one
person. One of the reasons maybe because anybody

157
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:53,690
who was saintly, people used to torture them,
trouble them. They wouldn’t like a person

158
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,919
like that because that person was something
– out of the blue, you can call it. So that

159
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:02,980
was an attitude towards a person who was a
realised soul. Everybody suffered, whether

160
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:09,980
they were Sufis or they were – otherwise
even William Blake, I mean, everyone whosoever

161
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,470
said something different, people didn’t
like. So maybe that’s the reason they used

162
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:26,470
to give it to one person. That was the tradition.
Realisation was such that out of thousands

163
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:36,600
they used to select one person, work on him,
cleanse him, do this, do that and then give

164
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,940
realisation. One person.
But I felt that the time has come that you

165
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:48,880
must give en-masse realisation. Unless and
until people get en-masse realisation, we

166
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,909
cannot change this world. And I worked, I
should say, for days together.

167
00:20:54,909 --> 00:21:01,909
Luckily my father was a very social personality,
even my husband was. So I had a good chance

168
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:07,950
to meet people. In my own subtle ways I used
to find out what is the permutation and combination

169
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:14,950
of problems inside the human beings and then
how to work it out. That’s the only thing

170
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:21,539
I did more, I think, otherwise so many people
used to give Self Realisation at different

171
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:27,710
times. But what I found out a method by which
thousands of people can get realisation.

172
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:32,640
Question: How did you come upon this method?
Shri Mataji: Just, you see, I discovered it.

173
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,640
You see, it’s a thing I worked it out.

174
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:50,409
Have all gone thoughtless, or what?
Yes, madam?

175
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:05,559
Question: When you depart from this body,
as this lady was asking, where does the spirit,

176
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,570
where do the energy stay?

177
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:20,700
Shri Mataji: Spirit – it’s a very long
answer, but I would say, Spirit goes according

178
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:27,700
to its desire, alright. Now, supposing there
is a drunkard, who dies, now he wants to drink

179
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:37,100
still, even if he’s dead. He will hang in
somewhere in the limbo, I think, he will get

180
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:45,529
hold of somebody who drinks a lot. This side
of psychology, people don’t understand in

181
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:55,580
the west. Because it’s nothing in the medicine
about this. The other day I read a very nice

182
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:02,580
article about it, was published in America.
That Japanese believe that you get possessed

183
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:10,350
by a spirit. Even in the bible it is so that
you get possessed by the spirit. But they

184
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:17,440
have said that 50 to 60% people get possessed.
Schizophrenia, all kinds of psychological

185
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:25,539
problems come from that. Now, in India also
we believe in it. And if you can remove the

186
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:34,020
possession of a person the person completely
changes, no doubt. But this is still in the

187
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:40,340
realm of science, you cannot get it. I mean,
I would say that, psychology is still a childish

188
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:46,640
science and in that realm they don’t understand
what is this possession.

189
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:53,640
Is a fact that so far they have not gone into
it, but we know in Sahaja Yoga very clearly,

190
00:23:54,049 --> 00:24:01,049
because we get catches on the left hand side,
say here on this thumb, that means a person

191
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:09,950
is possessed. Yes, it’s like that, it’s
so simple. And then you can cure that person.

192
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:18,440
So many persons have been cured. So many.
Who have given up as lunatics, or schizophrenic

193
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:26,130
or all kinds have been cured, no doubt. But
it is to be seen and to be worked out, then

194
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:34,090
you can believe it. Because people don’t
believe that there is such a thing. But there

195
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:39,529
is. There is some sort of a negative force
which overpowers human beings, it is true.

196
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:46,529
I must tell you the truth.
We have had so many cases, even in England,

197
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:59,210
where people were possessed. So many cases.
On the contrary I would say that cancer and

198
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:08,200
all psychosomatic troubles come to people
when they shift to the left side. Means to

199
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:15,330
the past. Maybe some viruses which are dead
long time back are in our being – that everything

200
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:21,730
is past is in our being. So they can attack.
And I’ve told them long time back somehow

201
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:28,730
through this cognitive knowledge that they
will call by 53 proteins and 63 progenides

202
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:36,529
[ ? UNCLEAR] I told them. And now they know
it is so. So cancer is curable in Sahaja Yoga,

203
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:43,549
we have cured cancers, of many people. Absolutely
curable. We have an hospital in India, already

204
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:52,950
established near Bombay. There’s a nice
hospital where people are cured. And we don’t

205
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,289
charge them for any treatment, only for the
stay.

206
00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:03,289
It’s a fact, you see, because people never
talk about it, they never told you.

207
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:12,940
So you think it’s a, some sort of a mythological
thing, it’s not. It is there, it exists.

208
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:24,480
So many diseases are not cured because we
don’t know about them. You see, I was myself

209
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:31,480
in a medical school, so I know that they know
very limited things. Beyond that, they don’t

210
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,620
know. But in Japan, I was surprised that they
believe in it and they treat people. Even

211
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:40,330
in India, I mean, they know.

212
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:47,330
Question: What do you give, provide the definition
of enlightenment?

213
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:59,039
Shri Mataji: Enlightened means a personality,
enlightened personality, I can tell you, is

214
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:12,789
a person who is beyond his mind. And he is
in contact completely with this all-pervading

215
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:25,090
power of divine love. As a result everything
in that person is guided, helped by that divine

216
00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:33,409
love. That power is so great that it looks
after you, it organizes everything, it thinks,

217
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:45,200
it understands, it is wisdom of all the things.
You become a person who is so collectively

218
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,440
conscious.
Today we need people like that. Otherwise

219
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:01,440
you always think about yourself. About others
you can only think when you are collectively

220
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:09,120
conscious. But these days there are so many
people marketing their spirituality, you see.

221
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:15,600
That’s also there. And just people jump
to it, I don’t know why. Why don’t they

222
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:22,600
find out what is the gain, what did you gain
out of it? Nobody wants to know.

223
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:38,029
Question: How did you find America?

224
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:58,390
Shri Mataji: They are antipodes. I don’t
know what to say, they are very money-oriented,

225
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:05,269
extremely money-oriented. And they can’t
understand me because I’m not asking for

226
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:10,480
money, you see, they can’t understand. It’s
very difficult. And how to penetrate that

227
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:17,480
veil of theirs?
So, this time it has been much better, I should

228
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:26,700
say, I’ve been there. I went first, long
time back, 1973 I went there, and I saw the

229
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:33,700
people how mad they were. After one boy was
a 16 years old guru, you see. They just giving

230
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:40,059
money to him. So, I asked him “Why they
are giving money?” What is the need to give

231
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:44,440
money like this? To this guru? They said:
“Because he is giving us spirit.” Where

232
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:50,950
is he giving you spirit?
And then this fellow, he was wiser than others

233
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:57,130
I should say, because he settled down as a
young one, he married some American lady and

234
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:04,130
used his money, but all the rest of them,
so many of them, went there to befool them.

235
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:16,470
It’s endless. Still going on.
But unless and until you accept the truth,

236
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:29,500
you cannot change. Accept us in the sense
you have to ask for it. You should have pure

237
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:39,480
desire. This Kundalini is the power of pure
desire within you. When She rises She gives

238
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:48,360
you your pure desire. Not like this, changing
from one to another. And if you have pure

239
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:55,360
desire only then it works out. If you don’t
have, it won’t work out - no. I cannot force

240
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:13,590
it. Cannot be forced, you see.

241
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:23,360
Question: How are children, young children?

242
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,260
Shri Mataji: Oh, some of them are great. These
days so many realised souls have been born,

243
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:33,100
these state [or these days? UNCLEAR] . We
don’t understand them. But there are so

244
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:39,750
many, even in England there are born so many
of them. Born realized – they are special

245
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:46,750
ones.
I mean, this fact, it happens, so many good

246
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:55,320
things happen to the society, like drug addiction,
over night people in this England gave up

247
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:03,500
drugs, over night.
I’ve got one land far away from madding

248
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:10,590
crowd, I should say, in upstate New York,
and I wanted to start a curative centre for

249
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:18,820
drug addicts, because that is one of the big
problems here. But they said the public won’t

250
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:25,760
allow. I said: “Why?” They said: “They
go amok.” This place is so far fetched,

251
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:32,760
you cannot give a walk all the way – and
if, I mean, they allow me I could help a lot.

252
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:40,830
But somehow, even in Italy, is difficult.
And the biggest problem today, even in America,

253
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:49,460
is drug addiction. Another you can call AIDS.
We tried AIDS also, but AIDS-people are something

254
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:57,720
wrong with them, they are extremely arrogant.
Quarrelsome, arrogant, they think they are

255
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:04,269
martyrs - something like that. We’ve tried,
we’ve helped one or two – no doubt. But

256
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:08,059
it’s very difficult. But these drug addicts
can’t be helped very easily. But there is

257
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:13,510
no proper way, if you all can arrange something
- I would like to.

258
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:20,289
In your, this London city only, I should say,
at least 10 or 11 people like that. First

259
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:27,289
time I talked they’ve got cured. They were
all doing very well, were very well educated.

260
00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:36,889
All these problems can be solved. But the
government should help, in a way. Because

261
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:47,389
you know they, so much time even to take permission
for something. Sometimes like 10 years, 20

262
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:55,210
years, you go on applying. I am already very
old and I don’t know what will happen, if

263
00:33:55,210 --> 00:34:02,210
I go on like this. For 20 years for a permission.
Very difficult. But you people can organize

264
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:11,269
something like that. And I can work it out.
You can see the results. You can see the results,

265
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,430
you can save these children.
Alcoholism, alcoholism also can be corrected.

266
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:26,680
Yes, please?

267
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,370
Question: Shri Mataji, would you say a few
words about the golden age? The forthcoming

268
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,910
golden age?

269
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:38,910
Shri Mataji: You see, Aquarius, as they say,
Aquarius according to our astrology is the

270
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:52,570
Kundalini. The Kundalini is Aquarius according
to Indian, I should say, Indian science of

271
00:34:53,090 --> 00:35:00,090
(HINDI word – Sir C.P. explains:) Astrology.
And, you see, they, what they say that this

272
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:10,800
age of Aquarius is very important, because
this will change the lives of people. And

273
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:19,780
that is what they have already described about
this, that now there was Kali Yuga, means

274
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:26,890
the worst possible times. The whole Kali Yuga
means the absolutely the worst and worst possible

275
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:36,070
time for our destruction. That was over. Then
comes Kruta Yuga, I mean, overlapping. Now,

276
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:46,300
in Kruta Yuga, this all-pervading power, they
call it Paramchaitanya, becomes active. It

277
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:53,600
starts helping people to come along.
That also has been going on some days.

278
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:01,680
After this, is Satya Yuga. It’s the age
of truth. But it’s a last judgement. If

279
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,800
you take to truth, alright, well and good.
But if you don’t take to truth you are judged.

280
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,950
It’s like this.
Now how many people take to truth, very surprising.

281
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:17,950
Like a place like Russia, you’ll be amazed
- Russia. Country like Russia. I went there

282
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:26,170
and I first time went to Saint Petersburg,
that’s Leningrad that time. And when I went

283
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:35,290
to the hall I saw about 2000 people sitting
outside. Because there you have to pay for

284
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,450
a hall, I mean, the hall people. So, 2000
seats were all occupied inside. So these people

285
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:55,740
outside, people said: “Maa, are you not
going to give us realisation?” I said: “How

286
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:01,400
do they know all this?” Somebody must have
told them. When I went in I said: “Alright,

287
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:08,400
wait, I’ll come back then I’ll give you
Realisation.” So, I went inside. Inside

288
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:16,090
there were 2000 people nicely sitting down,
listening to me and then they got their realisation.

289
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:23,450
All of them. I was amazed. What’s the matter?
How is it they’re working so fast? And then

290
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:30,450
I came out and I saw there were again these
2000 still sitting there. 45 minutes they

291
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:36,890
were still. I said: “Alright, you all come
tomorrow morning, we’ll sit outside.”

292
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:42,640
Now, in Moscow they have huge big places,
huge big compounds and buildings. I said:

293
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,310
“I’ll sit on the steps and I’ll try
to give you realisation.”

294
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:53,900
You won’t believe – 2000 from inside,
2000 from outside and one thousand extra,

295
00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:00,900
I mean, 5000 people gathered there next morning
and they all got their realisation. In Moscow,

296
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:06,930
you won’t believe how many people, if somebody
asks me, I cannot say, have got realisation.

297
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:13,930
Now, the reason, I reasoned it out what must
be the reason. I asked them: “How is it?

298
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:22,030
Had you advertised that much?” “No”,
they said, “we saw your photograph. We knew.

299
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:30,400
We came.” So sensitive, I say. And thousands
and thousands have got realisation.

300
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:39,050
These people are so deep, so deep, so humble.
I couldn’t understand why, why are they

301
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:50,080
so much spiritually endowed, how did they
get all this. And what I found is that communism

302
00:38:54,190 --> 00:39:01,190
has given them no freedom of any kind. And
as a result, I think, they got completely

303
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:08,700
oppressed and the whole thing growth was inside.
And also if you have read those great novelist,

304
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:17,010
even Tolstoi, or anyone - they always show
introspection, even by the hero or by the

305
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:27,640
villain, anybody, they all introspect. And
this is the one, I thought, is the very deep

306
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:35,580
personalities they develop. And immediately
they got it.

307
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:40,350
A far fetched place called Togliatti where
they make motorcars, thousands and thousands

308
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:45,470
– we could not get to any hall, because
formerly, I mean, normally what was the thing

309
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:52,470
we were taken, we would have to take a stadium
– 18 to 20.000 in Moscow or Leningrad or

310
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:02,850
a big city. But in Togliatti we didn’t know
what to do. So we just had it in the open.

311
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:05,000
Thousands and thousands. But not in England
– no.

312
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,310
Much worse is America. I don’t know why.
Even Indians in England are no good. I just

313
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:18,310
don’t know what happens to them. They are
neither English nor Indian, I think, something

314
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:34,390
is, but we have very few Indians even, I must
tell you this, very frankly.

315
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:41,390
But in India we have so many, so thousands
and thousands who have got realisation. Though

316
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:49,940
Indians know they have to have self realisation,
even here. But somehow they are fed up, I

317
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:58,950
don’t know of what. Even if you read Shakespeare
you feel like understanding that he was a

318
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:05,880
great realised soul. What he showed was the
futility of human endeavour in every line,

319
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:12,880
it’s clearly shown. That’s what he was.
I can’t understand, see, because I’ve

320
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:23,620
read so much Indian novels and English novels
and English writers. I find all of them are

321
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:30,620
so enlightened. Can’t understand what’s
happening in England now. Why? Now, 20 years

322
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:38,260
I’ve been in England, first time I’m meeting
people like you. Why? I would ask you, people.

323
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:58,370
Really, I can’t understand.
Even Austria, you have thousands. Italy, where

324
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:09,030
Roman Catholics you know, are so many. Italians,
wonderful. Thousands. But I didn’t live

325
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:17,960
so long there as I‘ve lived in England.
Moreover, you see, language-wise, I know this

326
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:24,790
language, though I never studied English,
but I know English language, how to speak.

327
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:31,790
But there in their language, it’s Italian
or, I don’t know how.

328
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:42,410
I’m very happy today that you all have come
and I hope now from you it will start going

329
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:51,460
into other people. Because it’s very important:
we have to change this world.

330
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:58,270
And, I would say, they also said, some newspaper
people have come, but I said: “I’m sorry,

331
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:04,550
I don’t know what they will think of me.”
Because they have never been very supportive.

332
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:11,550
But I think they don’t realise their responsibility.
Really! Sometimes I see newspapers, I think

333
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:19,020
they don’t realise how much they are harming
people by wrong directions. By sensational

334
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:27,040
things. What they have to do is to see what
will be the effect of these things that we

335
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:34,040
are writing. Is it going to help them to rise
above all these things like jealousies and

336
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:42,100
violence and all these things that are really
completely corroding our humanity.

337
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:50,040
So, I think, all those lines, I don’t find
them and by head, I would say, I’ve met

338
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:57,030
some of them, they were just after me. “How
is it you are in England?” I said: “Because

339
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:02,250
my husband has a job here, that’s how I’ve
come.” Then all kinds of funny, funny questions

340
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:09,160
they were asking. You know, I was surprised,
they are not interested in spirituality at

341
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:16,160
all. So, then, whenever they said “Mother,
somebody is coming from there” I said: “Now

342
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:24,260
- please.”
All kinds of things they would say. “Your

343
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:31,260
country is so poor, what are you doing here?”
Then I had to tell them why we are poor. I

344
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:38,410
said: “300 years if you have a guest in
your house without a visa what will happen

345
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:47,130
to you?”
Then another question: “Why you have got

346
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:54,430
so many, such a big population, so many children
born?” I said: “In that also, I would

347
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:03,030
say, that what I have read about England is
this, that so many children are killed every

348
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:10,030
week, by the parents even.” I said: “So,
the children must be deciding to be born in

349
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:17,380
a poor country than in a country where they
can be killed.” I mean, simple thing like

350
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:24,500
that. Because children want love, they don’t
understand anything else.

351
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:29,980
So like that they asked me funny, funny questions.
I said: “I am here for spirituality, talking

352
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:36,980
to about spirituality, and why should I worry
about what I am, what is this and what is

353
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:45,620
that?”
Say, we have to change our attitude. Very

354
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:50,560
important. Of course I know some people who
are very broad, broad minded attitude towards

355
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:57,560
people, very much. I’ve known some in India
also, but there are so few. If this thing

356
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:06,120
has to be done it has to be mass-scale.
Now, we have Sahaja Yogis, many Sahaja Yogis,

357
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:14,590
I should say, but still I’m not satisfied.
I think we need many more.

358
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:23,860
Hindustani… HINDI…
I don’t know why.

359
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:39,860
Such a big tradition you have in our country.
Instead of bringing that here to this country,

360
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:55,270
I don’t know what’s happening. And they
are also very, very spiritual people. There

361
00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:02,780
too, you read their books you see, you’ll
be amazed. Very spiritual.

362
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:09,910
But suddenly the whole thing has turned round,
I think so that spirituality has lost its

363
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:16,910
power. And maybe some, you imported some of
the horrible gurus from there also might be.

364
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:24,100
That might be another reason, I think so.
But now, I think, they are very much reduced

365
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:32,060
in number, there are few still going round,
making money, doesn’t matter. But now you

366
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:39,060
people are very sensible, very highly placed,
you should do something about it, my request

367
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:47,310
is.
I’m available and never used to say, whatever

368
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:53,130
you say.
It’s a new mission where you have to do

369
00:47:53,130 --> 00:48:00,130
something. You are the ones who are going
to completely revolutionize the whole world.

370
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:30,200
You can do it. Absolutely everybody is capable
of doing that.

371
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,530
Question: Another question: What’s your
opinion of Avataras?

372
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:35,850
Shri Mataji: Alright, what’s the use of
my opinion about it? There are Avataras, no

373
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:39,300
doubt. Alright? But you don’t believe me
when I say that. Unless and until you experience

374
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,620
you shouldn’t believe even me. Alright,
this is something and because you asked me

375
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:47,280
I’m saying so. But I don’t say you believe
in some Avataras, first of all you experience

376
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:53,600
them. Everything that is now – you will
know gradually into different things and on

377
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,580
every centre there is somebody sitting there.
Who are they and what work they do? All this

378
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:03,580
is to be consumed and to be seen and to be
experimented. Now, I say, supposing this centre

379
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:15,240
is catching …. [UNCLEAR] it is the centre
very important because it is in the optic

380
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:22,240
chiasma like this, you see, it’s constricted.
Now, how to open this? Very difficult. Now,

381
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:31,620
I say, you forgive everybody. You forgive
everybody – it opens.

382
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:39,040
Why? Because Christ, Christ is on that centre.
And his message is to forgive.

383
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:47,030
Is, I mean, you should know who is on which
centre and what works out. That’s only to

384
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:57,320
be known. Once you get your Self Realisation,
only you have to know this much, who is the

385
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:04,320
one responsible for which chakras. That’s
all. And you, you have to do according to

386
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:10,920
– like it’s a mantra now, to say that
“I forgive everyone”. Now, some people

387
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:16,520
would say it’s very difficult to forgive.
But logically: if you forgive or don’t forgive

388
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:22,400
– what are you doing? You don’t do anything.
But if you don’t forgive then you torture

389
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:29,400
yourself. That’s why you forgive everyone.
And this opens. Most constricted – it opens

390
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:34,370
like this.

391
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:41,370
Question: So, which God is for the Kundalini?
Christ is over here. Which God is in the Kundalini?

392
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:46,910
In the triangle?
Sahaja Yogi: What is the God or the deity

393
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:50,150
in the triangular bone, the Kundalini?

394
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:57,150
Shri Mataji: Kundalini itself. The Kundalini
is your own mother. Your individual mother.

395
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:06,770
And She has tape-recorded all your past and
your aspirations, everything. And She rises

396
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:14,430
because She wants to give you your second
birth, but She is your individual mother.

397
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:22,720
You don’t share Her with anybody else. Yours
is a different, somebody else’s is different.

398
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:29,070
Because the tape-recording is different. And
She knows everything about you. So, when She

399
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:36,070
rises She does, goes very slowly, without
harming you, without troubling you and pierces

400
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:45,360
through.
We say She is the reflection of the Adi Shakti

401
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:54,830
who is called as Holy Ghost in the bible.
But She rises without any difficulty. Hardly

402
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:05,160
any time it takes.

403
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,530
Would they like to have their Self Realisation?

404
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:13,270
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji asks if you would
like to experience this and have your Self

405
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:16,290
Realisation? Very quick, very easy.

406
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:22,840
Shri Mataji: Hardly any time.
Now, you forget the past. Another thing you

407
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:27,720
have to do is to forgive yourself. And not
to feel guilty about anything. Very important,

408
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:34,720
because if you feel guilty then this centre
catches here on the left. When it catches

409
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:48,100
here on the left you can get spondylitis,
you can also get angina. So why, why to feel

410
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:55,050
guilty? Whatever has happened has happened,
forget everything. Not to feel guilty – very

411
00:52:55,050 --> 00:53:02,050
important. I know here people feel more guilty,
not in India. They never feel guilty. But

412
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:12,150
in the west they do. But there’s no need,
no need to condemn yourself, you have to have

413
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:19,150
great honour and love for yourself, because
you are special people and that you are going

414
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:28,300
to help the whole world. So respect yourself!
As I respect you and love you. You, please,

415
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:53,080
respect and love yourself.
Alright. Now, what you have to do is to put

416
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:03,280
both the hands towards me, like this, just
like this, because I told you these are the

417
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:11,360
endings of the sympathetic nervous system.
It’s like this – little open, like this.

418
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:22,330
You don’t have to doubt yourself, by any
chance. Please, don’t doubt.

419
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:33,420
Now, you put your left hand like this towards
me and right hand on top of your head here.

420
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:45,920
On top, means away, not touching the head.
You can bend your head and see for yourself.

421
00:54:53,020 --> 00:55:00,020
Now see, if there is a cool or a hot breeze
coming out of your fontanel bone area which

422
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:08,920
was a soft bone in your childhood. Just see
for yourself, if there’s a hot or a cool

423
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:19,190
breeze-like vibrations coming out of your
fontanel bone area which was the soft bone

424
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:26,190
in your childhood. Now, you can move your
hand and see for yourself. You can move it,

425
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:33,190
sometimes you can feel it higher, sometimes
lower or on the sides. See for yourself. If

426
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:37,050
it is hot that means, of course, you have
got your Realisation, but if it is hot that

427
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:44,050
means you have not forgiven yourself. Or you
have not forgiven others. So, please forgive

428
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:54,930
others, also forgive yourself fully. Please
forgive.

429
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:04,360
Now, please put your right hand towards me,
bend your head. And see for yourself if you

430
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:22,620
have cool or hot breeze-like vibrations coming
out of your fontanel bone area which was the

431
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:35,440
soft bone in your childhood. Please try. Please
bend your head and see for yourself.

432
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:07,610
Now, please take down your hands, both hands
and put them towards me, like this. And don’t

433
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:18,690
think. Just don’t think.
Because I already told you, you have a right,

434
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:34,210
it’s your birthright to have this Yoga,
union with the divine, it’s your birthright.

435
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:41,210
Now, you have to put both your hands towards
the sky like this and push back your head

436
00:57:54,320 --> 00:58:01,320
and ask me – I’ll tell you about three,
three things, three questions you can say.

437
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:12,260
You have to say one question three times,
only one of them. For example you can ask,

438
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:19,260
you can call me Mother, Mother – or Shri
Mataji, whatever you like. Mother is, is this

439
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:28,600
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Ask in
your heart this question “Mother is this

440
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:35,000
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?” Ask
three times. Or, you can ask “Mother, is

441
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:42,000
this the all-pervading power of divine love?”
Or you can ask third question “Mother, is

442
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:49,940
this the Paramachaitanya or Ruh?” Ask anyone
of these questions, anyone of them, three

443
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:56,850
times.
Now - let’s have it.

444
00:58:56,850 --> 00:59:03,850
Alright, please put down your hands again
and put them towards me.

445
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:13,040
Please, don’t doubt, please don’t doubt.
That’s something very important. If you

446
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:21,250
start feeling a cool or a hot breeze on your
fingertips or on your palm, same or out of

447
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:33,680
your fontanel bone area, out of your head,
anyone of them, then raise your both the hands,

448
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:42,020
raise your both the hands – those who have
felt it that way. Those who have felt the

449
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:49,020
cool breeze in their hands.
Thank you very much!

450
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:30,210
Most of you have got it. Unbelievable…
You got it? No – not yet? Alright.

451
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:54,850
Who didn’t get it now?
She also.

452
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:56,140
You didn’t get it, madam?
You got it?

453
01:00:56,140 --> 01:01:03,140
They can help you, let us see.
You got it? You felt the cool breeze? Now

454
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:13,540
– you felt it.
Keep it like that. Let it flow as much as

455
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:35,780
possible, is very good.

456
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:42,780
You all can do this, it’s very simple.
She has it now?

457
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:50,950
Sahaja Yogi: It’s warm, Mother, it’s warm.
Shri Mataji: It’s warm? Alright, put her

458
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:57,950
left to the right. Raise her left.
What’s she catching on?

459
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:29,740
Sahaja Yogi: It’s left Vishuddhi, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Left…. Are you Bengali?

460
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:14,750
Seeker: I am from the Caribbean.
Shri Mataji: Now you just don’t think. That’s

461
01:03:56,220 --> 01:04:03,220
what you should practice a little bit. Put
your hands towards me, all of you and don’t

462
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:09,110
think.
What is it?

463
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:15,870
Did you feel the Kundalini?
Are you feeling it on the head?

464
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:22,870
Warm, so that’s it – put her left to the
right. Raise her left and put down the right.

465
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:31,670
It has nothing to do with the air-condition.
You feel it on your fingers – alright?

466
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:34,730
Now better?
Now alright? May God bless you!

467
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:38,430
Just keep go on like that.
Alright? Are you feeling? Cool or hot? Cool

468
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:39,770
now?
Now she’s got it.

469
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:41,950
So, thank you very much! Thank you, all of
you!

470
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:45,000
May God bless you! (quietly)

471
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:52,000
You have to practice now.
Can you not tell them to come to some follow-up

472
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:42,980
or some program like that?
