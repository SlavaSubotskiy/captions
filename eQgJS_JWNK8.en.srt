00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:09,087
Being Bandhamukta,  A free personality and Evening Program

2
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:14,074
Ganapatipule (India), 5 January 1988.

3
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,426
From yesterday's program

4
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:32,101
and all these days we must have realized

5
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:42,424
that to get your Kundalini working out,

6
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:50,257
to get Her rush towards the Sahasrara

7
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:56,662
and to widen your Shushumna Nadi it

8
00:04:56,862 --> 00:05:04,878
is not necessary that you should sit for meditation for 3 to 5 hours.

9
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:08,756
Of course, you must meditate for a short time

10
00:05:08,957 --> 00:05:14,686
because that is at a point

11
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:20,735
where you are alone one with your God.

12
00:05:22,536 --> 00:05:31,580
But otherwise in the collective when you merge into it

13
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:35,483
then the Kundalini rises the same way.

14
00:05:35,683 --> 00:05:47,398
It's a very discrete way of understanding what happens.

15
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,870
In the collective when you are,

16
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,957
you compensate each other, compliment each other

17
00:05:57,157 --> 00:06:07,522
and the subtler side of the cosmos starts manifesting in you.

18
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,767
Then if you could really emerge

19
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:16,358
there is a word 'emerge' in Sanskrit language or in Marati language

20
00:06:16,558 --> 00:06:21,086
is very good is 'ramamaana'.

21
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,493
I don't think merging with joy

22
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:33,191
but there is no 'with' you see, merging into joy.

23
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:38,382
So if you can merge into the joy

24
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:42,150
of anything that is Sahaj

25
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:50,627
you can become

26
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:56,494
a meditative personality.

27
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:07,056
You can achieve that meditative mood within yourself.

28
00:07:07,256 --> 00:07:12,017
With that mood, with that force,

29
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:19,391
new subtler dimensions start breaking out within you.

30
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:24,185
Your different kind of conditionings,

31
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:30,987
which are like shackles binding you down,

32
00:07:31,187 --> 00:07:33,441
just open out

33
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:39,171
and you become a free person - 'Bandhamukta'.

34
00:07:40,651 --> 00:07:45,005
With that force everything breaks, your ego breaks,

35
00:07:45,205 --> 00:07:54,801
your conditioning breaks and you become one with the

36
00:07:55,001 --> 00:08:02,572
joy of life, divine life.

37
00:08:04,638 --> 00:08:11,298
This you can experience

38
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:20,084
but to retain it within yourself

39
00:08:20,284 --> 00:08:28,316
is only possible if you do your practices in Sahaja Yoga.

40
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:34,536
To control your attention,

41
00:08:34,736 --> 00:08:39,615
to keep your attention to higher values,

42
00:08:39,815 --> 00:08:43,878
to the higher things.

43
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,694
Let us see what are

44
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:59,024
the low value system that we get into

45
00:08:59,224 --> 00:09:04,367
which is regarded as something very important otherwise.

46
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:19,509
The first in the modern times is the consciousness of time.

47
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:24,277
What is the time now? What time we have to reach?

48
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:27,769
Oh God what is the time we are going to start it?

49
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:30,372
What time are we going to sleep?

50
00:09:30,572 --> 00:09:34,016
Now we have experienced that yesterday we went home about

51
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:37,016
6 o'clock and slept at 6 if we slept at all.

52
00:09:39,697 --> 00:09:42,807
You were quite tired till 2 o'clock I think

53
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:47,551
then that gondhal business started

54
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:53,261
and you again relived the whole sequence

55
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:57,199
with a greater gusto I must say.

56
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:02,239
So at that time those people who try to keep dignity

57
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:06,246
and try to keep out of it

58
00:10:06,446 --> 00:10:10,371
are still keeping down their conditionings.

59
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:14,745
Supposing there is a man who is a governor,

60
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:20,452
for example, quite healthy, young can dance.

61
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:23,571
I mean old people need not do all that but they can

62
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:30,087
at least break through very well into the barriers of conditionings.

63
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:33,727
but such a person starts thinking "what's this going on" and

64
00:10:33,927 --> 00:10:38,762
"oh, it is nonsense, how can I join this?"

65
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,159
It looks very rustic, sometimes looks something not very decent,

66
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:50,232
decorous, like a waltz, but

67
00:10:50,677 --> 00:10:57,732
It's extremely natural and child like, innocent.

68
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:05,556
You can make out the people who are still in the barrier.

69
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:10,403
They even find it difficult to say "Jai Mataji!".

70
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:17,116
Such people are still bound down by the shackles

71
00:11:17,316 --> 00:11:19,697
of the worldly life.

72
00:11:19,897 --> 00:11:22,097
Then they are all the time, seeing the time, "What is the time?"

73
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:24,869
And again getting a headache. At such times,

74
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:27,284
you should never see the time. Because you will get a headache

75
00:11:27,484 --> 00:11:30,474
if you see it.

76
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:33,506
Realizing it’s very late, you see,

77
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:38,444
and you say: "Oh God, it's 4 o'clock, we are still here."

78
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:46,332
So it is important for all of us not to have any watches

79
00:11:46,532 --> 00:11:48,658
and even if we have, not to see them.

80
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:53,937
Or even you see them, they should be stopped.

81
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:58,566
So you go beyond time.

82
00:11:58,766 --> 00:12:03,336
You go beyond time. You don't feel the time.

83
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:08,672
You don't feel the tiredness of time

84
00:12:08,872 --> 00:12:14,482
and you just forget yourself,

85
00:12:14,682 --> 00:12:19,396
which is tied down by time all the time.

86
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:29,857
Now then the second one is we talk so much.

87
00:12:30,057 --> 00:12:33,460
"Oh we should have no religions, no jati (caste), no pati,"

88
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,984
like that we say, all of us, "you should have no caste system",

89
00:12:37,184 --> 00:12:39,893
Indians especially: "Caste system is the curse."

90
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,154
People will talk like that and when it comes

91
00:12:43,154 --> 00:12:47,450
to their own daughters' wedding they will not go beyond their caste.

92
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:50,184
"Caste system is bad." "Your religion is bad,

93
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:52,601
this is bad, that bad",

94
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:57,014
but when it comes to actual understanding of religion,

95
00:12:57,214 --> 00:12:59,690
you can easily scratch them [beneath the surface] and find out

96
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:03,483
from where they come.

97
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:10,293
Worst of all the conditioning is, of so-called religions!

98
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,181
And this has to be broken completely

99
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:21,064
because they are all false.

100
00:13:21,738 --> 00:13:24,784
Based on something solid. Supposing you have

101
00:13:24,984 --> 00:13:30,055
a very solid foundation on that you put up a

102
00:13:30,255 --> 00:13:34,936
house of, say, a pack of cards, as they say.

103
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:38,166
How long it is going to last?

104
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:40,942
If you go to the foundations you find all the foundations

105
00:13:41,142 --> 00:13:45,785
are just the same but this pack of cards are different.

106
00:13:45,985 --> 00:13:50,595
And they are the greatest delusions for human beings

107
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:54,016
which we are seeing every day, in every religion,

108
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:57,627
in every country, in every caste.

109
00:13:57,827 --> 00:14:02,215
But still we are frightened of something nonsensical,

110
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:06,643
something historical or I don't know what.

111
00:14:06,843 --> 00:14:09,667
We don't want to give up that.

112
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:19,983
That’s another very big binding force

113
00:14:20,184 --> 00:14:24,511
to very low grade life.

114
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:29,302
I mean, say two caste people meet, same people,

115
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:33,706
how do they talk? “Oh so you are of the same caste?”

116
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,684
He says, “Yes I am.” “Then you must be knowing this man,”

117
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:40,696
“Yes, yes. He’s my father's brother's, this thing’s, this thing.”

118
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:45,400
In Marathi they will say “sakhaa”.

119
00:14:46,598 --> 00:14:52,042
“Satyakla sakhaa”. “Manje kai?” (Marathi: “Means what?”),

120
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:59,030
Like that: “Oh, so you are the cousin’s sister's,

121
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,751
this thing, that thing, real husband!”

122
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:12,130
And such terrible talks! I don't know, they go on for hours together.

123
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:16,091
And then I don't know what is the satisfaction out of it.

124
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:21,447
Then ultimately they did this, this - they,

125
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:25,296
they find out sometimes, or mostly,

126
00:15:25,496 --> 00:15:31,811
that both of them are related to a dacoit (armed thief)

127
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:36,365
or to a thug or some sort of a bankrupt

128
00:15:36,565 --> 00:15:42,018
or some sort of a horrible man and then they recede back.

129
00:15:42,218 --> 00:15:46,821
Then they don't want to show any relationship.

130
00:15:47,504 --> 00:15:50,756
So this kind of a nonsensical talks,

131
00:15:50,956 --> 00:15:55,345
for example, if the ladies meet “oh,” they will say,

132
00:15:55,545 --> 00:15:57,989
“where did you buy this Sari?” “I bought it there.”

133
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,908
“Oh, I went there. How much you paid?” She said, “This [much]”

134
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:05,256
Such waste of time goes on and on and on and on and on.

135
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:07,732
The whole life is wasted

136
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:13,316
in such a low-grade understanding of life's value.

137
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:16,042
Then they will also talk ill [of others], do this -

138
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:19,553
I mean you can build up on that all the filth.

139
00:16:19,753 --> 00:16:22,251
It's something like the fungus growing.

140
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:26,685
From the dead, with little heat the fungus starts growing,

141
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:30,796
mutation takes place, and the fungus becomes aggressive,

142
00:16:30,996 --> 00:16:33,308
can become cancerous, this, that.

143
00:16:33,508 --> 00:16:39,349
In the same way all this low grade life starts.

144
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:52,705
Then this low grade life can extend in every walk of life,

145
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:56,284
like politics, economics, everywhere,

146
00:16:56,484 --> 00:17:01,530
because it is like plastic.

147
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,447
Plastic can get into cloth, can get into trees,

148
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:08,807
can get into everything.

149
00:17:09,381 --> 00:17:14,193
In the same way this horrible low-grade business

150
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:19,273
goes into these various things

151
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:22,058
and a person cannot rise

152
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:29,790
above this built-in plastic bondages we have.

153
00:17:31,076 --> 00:17:36,911
At this time when we have such kind of programmes,

154
00:17:37,111 --> 00:17:39,561
everything breaks off

155
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:50,155
and you really dissolve into the love of God.

156
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,834
There are so many other mundane things if you see how people talk,

157
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,034
how they joke and all that.

158
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:02,420
You will think it’s all filth going round you.

159
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,143
Slowly you will gradually recede from it.

160
00:18:06,343 --> 00:18:09,357
That is how you prepare yourself

161
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:13,885
for retaining this joy within yourself.

162
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:20,240
Now we are coming to the fag-end of our tours

163
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,398
and when you will be going to your countries

164
00:18:23,598 --> 00:18:28,581
you should see for yourself what's happening around

165
00:18:28,781 --> 00:18:32,303
and just laugh and get out of it.

166
00:18:32,503 --> 00:18:37,064
You have to remember those beautiful days of Ganapatipule

167
00:18:37,264 --> 00:18:40,634
and you have to get into that mood

168
00:18:40,834 --> 00:18:45,525
and know that you belong to the Kingdom of God.

169
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:50,624
I know we had very little time to talk

170
00:18:50,824 --> 00:18:53,672
but music was even better. I could communicate better

171
00:18:53,872 --> 00:18:55,872
through music to you.

172
00:18:56,073 --> 00:18:59,061
 I’m working on you all the time

173
00:18:59,261 --> 00:19:02,611
but still there are some people who are caught up.

174
00:19:02,811 --> 00:19:05,309
I would request you, for all the leaders who find out

175
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:08,277
there are caught up people in their groups -

176
00:19:08,477 --> 00:19:11,482
please don't call them for the pujas.

177
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:14,713
They should be kept back if you think they are not alright.

178
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:16,960
And they should not also feel bad

179
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:21,701
because they will be helped much
more if they don't come to the puja.

180
00:19:21,902 --> 00:19:25,131
So tomorrow is going to be the great day for our puja.

181
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,671
I hope it will be convenient for all of you to come

182
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:31,436
and be seated here.

183
00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:34,651
I think tomorrow, before coming to the puja don't talk too much

184
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:37,111
and don't discuss too much.

185
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:41,608
I think you must have had enough discussions today

186
00:19:41,808 --> 00:19:45,965
and have reached some conclusions.

187
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:49,528
I would like to know if some questions were not answered.

188
00:19:49,728 --> 00:19:52,201
If there is any I would like to answer them now

189
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,979
and after that we’ll start our programme. For about five minutes,

190
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:58,925
are sufficient for answering.

191
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:13,402
All questions were answered?

192
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:18,933
Is there any questions that was not answered?

193
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:26,073
Please stand up, I can't see
if there is anybody

194
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,723
Oh, ho, that's Sahaj.

195
00:20:37,923 --> 00:20:43,113
Sahaj people have no questions. They have to only answer.
