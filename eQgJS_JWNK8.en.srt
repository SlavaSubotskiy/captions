1
00:00:27,062 --> 00:00:30,506
From yesterday's program

2
00:00:31,743 --> 00:00:34,249
and all these days, 

3
00:00:35,177 --> 00:00:37,321
you must have realized

4
00:00:38,707 --> 00:00:48,437
that to get your Kundalini working out,

5
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:56,657
to get Her rush towards the Sahasrara

6
00:00:56,857 --> 00:01:02,186
and to widen your Shushumna Nadi,

7
00:01:02,953 --> 00:01:10,969
it is not necessary that you should sit for meditation for 3 to 5 hours.

8
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:15,156
Of course, you must meditate for a short time

9
00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:21,086
because that is at a point

10
00:01:21,286 --> 00:01:27,135
where you are alone one with your God.

11
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:37,980
But otherwise in the collective when you merge into it

12
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,883
then the Kundalini rises the same way.

13
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:53,798
It's a very discrete way of understanding what happens.

14
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,270
In the collective when you are,

15
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,357
you compensate each other, complement each other

16
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:13,922
and the subtler side of the cosmos starts manifesting in you.

17
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:18,167
Then if you could really merge,

18
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:22,758
there is a word 'emerge' in Sanskrit language or in Marati language

19
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:27,486
is very good is 'ramamaana'.

20
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,893
I don't think merging with joy

21
00:02:35,093 --> 00:02:39,591
but there is no 'with' you see, merging into joy.

22
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,782
So if you can merge into the joy

23
00:02:44,983 --> 00:02:48,550
of anything that is Sahaj

24
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:57,027
you can become

25
00:02:57,227 --> 00:03:02,894
a meditative personality.

26
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:13,456
You can achieve that meditative mood within yourself.

27
00:03:13,656 --> 00:03:18,417
With that mood, with that force,

28
00:03:18,618 --> 00:03:25,791
new subtler dimensions start breaking out within you.

29
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:30,585
Your different kind of conditionings,

30
00:03:30,785 --> 00:03:37,387
which are like shackles binding you down,

31
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:39,841
just open out

32
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:45,571
and you become a free person - 'Bandhamukta'.

33
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:51,405
With that force everything breaks, your ego breaks,

34
00:03:51,605 --> 00:04:01,201
your conditioning breaks and you become one with the

35
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:08,972
joy of life, divine life.

36
00:04:11,038 --> 00:04:17,698
This you can experience

37
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:26,484
but to retain it within yourself

38
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:34,716
is only possible if you do your practices in Sahaja Yoga.

39
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:40,936
To control your attention,

40
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:46,015
to keep your attention to higher values,

41
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:50,278
to the higher things.

42
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:56,094
Let us see what are

43
00:04:56,294 --> 00:05:05,424
the low value system that we get into

44
00:05:05,624 --> 00:05:10,767
which is regarded as something very important otherwise.

45
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:25,909
The first in the modern times is the consciousness of time.

46
00:05:26,782 --> 00:05:30,677
What is the time now? What time we have to reach?

47
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:34,169
Oh God what is the time we are going to start it?

48
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:36,772
What time are we going to sleep?

49
00:05:36,972 --> 00:05:40,416
Now we have experienced that yesterday we went home about

50
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,416
6 o'clock and slept at 6 if we slept at all.

51
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:49,207
You were quite tired till 2 o'clock I think

52
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:54,466
then that 'Gondhari' business [Bhajan, "Mateche Gondhari"] started

53
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:59,661
and you again relived the whole sequence

54
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:03,599
with a greater gusto I must say.

55
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:08,639
So at that time those people who try to keep dignity

56
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:12,646
and try to keep out of it

57
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:16,771
are still keeping down their conditionings.

58
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:21,145
Supposing there is a man who is a governor,

59
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:26,852
for example, quite healthy, young can dance.

60
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:29,971
I mean old people need not do all that but they can

61
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:36,487
at least break through very well into the barriers of conditionings.

62
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:40,127
but such a person starts thinking "what's this going on" and

63
00:06:40,327 --> 00:06:45,162
"oh, it is nonsense, how can I join this?"

64
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,559
It looks very rustic, sometimes looks something not very decent,

65
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:56,632
decorous, like a waltz, but

66
00:06:57,077 --> 00:07:04,132
It's extremely natural and child like, innocent.

67
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:11,956
You can make out the people who are still in the barrier.

68
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:16,803
They even find it difficult to say "Jai Mataji!".

69
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:23,516
Such people are still bound down by the shackles

70
00:07:23,716 --> 00:07:26,097
of the worldly life.

71
00:07:26,297 --> 00:07:28,497
Then they are all the time, seeing the time, "What is the time?"

72
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:31,269
And again getting a headache. At such times,

73
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:33,684
you should never see the time. Because you will get a headache

74
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:36,874
if you see it.

75
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:39,906
Realizing it’s very late, you see,

76
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:44,844
and you say: "Oh God, it's 4 o'clock, we are still here."

77
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:52,732
So it is important for all of us not to have any watches

78
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:55,058
and even if we have, not to see them.

79
00:07:55,258 --> 00:08:00,337
Or even you see them, they should be stopped.

80
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:04,966
So you go beyond time.

81
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:09,736
You go beyond time. You don't feel the time.

82
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:15,072
You don't feel the tiredness of time

83
00:08:15,272 --> 00:08:20,882
and you just forget yourself,

84
00:08:21,082 --> 00:08:25,796
which is tied down by time all the time.

85
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:36,257
Now then the second one is we talk so much.

86
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:39,860
"Oh we should have no religions, no jati (caste), no pati,"

87
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,384
like that we say, all of us, "you should have no caste system",

88
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:46,293
Indians especially: "Caste system is the curse."

89
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:49,554
People will talk like that and when it comes

90
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:53,850
to their own daughters' wedding they will not go beyond their caste.

91
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:56,584
"Caste system is bad." "Your religion is bad,

92
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:59,001
this is bad, that bad",

93
00:08:59,202 --> 00:09:03,414
but when it comes to actual understanding of religion,

94
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:06,090
you can easily scratch them [beneath the surface] and find out

95
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,883
from where they come.

96
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:16,693
Worst of all the conditioning is, of so-called religions!

97
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,581
And this has to be broken completely

98
00:09:22,781 --> 00:09:27,464
because they are all false, 

99
00:09:28,138 --> 00:09:31,184
[but] based on something solid. Supposing you have

100
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:36,455
a very solid foundation on that you put up a

101
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:41,336
house of, say, a pack of cards, as they say.

102
00:09:41,536 --> 00:09:44,566
How long it is going to last?

103
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:47,342
If you go to the foundations you find all the foundations

104
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:52,185
are just the same but this pack of cards are different.

105
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:56,995
And they are the greatest delusions for human beings

106
00:09:57,195 --> 00:10:00,416
which we are seeing every day, in every religion,

107
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:04,027
in every country, in every caste.

108
00:10:04,227 --> 00:10:08,615
But still we are frightened of something nonsensical,

109
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:13,043
something historical or I don't know what.

110
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:16,067
We don't want to give up that.

111
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:26,383
That’s another very big binding force

112
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,911
to very low-grade life.

113
00:10:31,112 --> 00:10:35,702
I mean, say two caste people meet, same people,

114
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:40,106
how do they talk? “Oh so you are of the same caste?”

115
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,084
He says, "Yes I am." "Then you must be knowing this man."

116
00:10:43,284 --> 00:10:47,096
"Yes, yes. He’s my father's brother's, this thing’s, this thing".

117
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:51,800
In Marathi, they’d say “sakhaa”. 

118
00:10:52,998 --> 00:10:58,442
 “Sakyatla sakhaa”. [Means what?].

119
00:10:59,704 --> 00:11:05,430
Like that: “Oh, so you are the cousin’s sister's,

120
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:10,151
this thing, that thing, real husband!”

121
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:18,530
And such terrible talks! I don't know, they go on for hours together.

122
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,491
And then I don't know what is the satisfaction out of it.

123
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:27,847
Then ultimately they did this, this - they,

124
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:31,696
they find out sometimes, or mostly,

125
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:38,211
that both of them are related to a 'dacoit' [armed thief]

126
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:42,765
or to a thug or some sort of a bankrupt

127
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:48,418
or some sort of a horrible man and then they recede back.

128
00:11:48,618 --> 00:11:53,221
Then they don't want to show any relationship.

129
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:57,156
So, this kind of a nonsensical talks,

130
00:11:57,356 --> 00:12:01,745
for example, if the ladies meet, "Oh" they will say,

131
00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:04,389
"Where did you buy this sari?" "I bought it there".

132
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,308
"Oh, I went there. How much you paid?" She said, “This [much]”

133
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:11,656
Such waste of time goes on and on and on and on and on.

134
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,132
The whole life is wasted

135
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:19,716
in such a low-grade understanding of life's value.

136
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:22,442
Then they will also talk ill [of others], do this -

137
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:25,953
I mean you can build up on that all the filth.

138
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:28,651
It's something like the fungus growing.

139
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:33,085
From the dead, with little heat the fungus starts growing,

140
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:37,196
mutation takes place, and the fungus becomes aggressive,

141
00:12:37,396 --> 00:12:39,708
can become cancerous, this, that.

142
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:45,749
In the same way all this low grade life starts.

143
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:59,105
Then this low grade life can extend in every walk of life,

144
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:02,684
like politics, economics, everywhere,

145
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:07,930
because it is like plastic.

146
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,847
Plastic can get into cloth, can get into trees,

147
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:15,207
can get into everything.

148
00:13:15,781 --> 00:13:20,593
In the same way this horrible low-grade business

149
00:13:20,793 --> 00:13:25,673
goes into these various things

150
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:28,458
and a person cannot rise

151
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:36,190
above this built-in plastic bondages we have.

152
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:43,311
At this time when we have such kind of programmes,

153
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:45,961
everything breaks off

154
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:56,555
and you really dissolve into the love of God.

155
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,234
There are so many other mundane things if you see how people talk,

156
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:05,434
how they joke and all that.

157
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:08,820
You will think it’s all filth going round you.

158
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,543
Slowly you will gradually recede from it.

159
00:14:12,743 --> 00:14:15,757
That is how you prepare yourself

160
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:20,285
for retaining this joy within yourself.

161
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:26,640
Now we are coming to the fag-end of our tours

162
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,798
and when you will be going to your countries

163
00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:34,981
you should see for yourself what's happening around

164
00:14:35,181 --> 00:14:38,703
and just laugh and get out of it.

165
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:43,464
You have to remember those beautiful days of Ganapatipule

166
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:47,034
and you have to get into that mood

167
00:14:47,234 --> 00:14:51,925
and know that you belong to the Kingdom of God.

168
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:57,024
I know we had very little time to talk

169
00:14:57,224 --> 00:15:00,072
but music was even better. I could communicate better

170
00:15:00,272 --> 00:15:02,272
through music to you.

171
00:15:02,473 --> 00:15:05,461
 I’m working on you all the time

172
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:09,011
but still there are some people who are caught up.

173
00:15:09,211 --> 00:15:11,709
I would request you, for all the leaders who find out

174
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:14,677
there are caught up people in their groups -

175
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:17,882
please don't call them for the pujas.

176
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:21,113
They should be kept back if you think they are not alright.

177
00:15:21,314 --> 00:15:23,360
And they should not also feel bad

178
00:15:23,561 --> 00:15:28,101
because they will be helped much
more if they don't come to the puja.

179
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,531
So tomorrow is going to be the great day for our puja.

180
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:35,071
I hope it will be convenient for all of you to come

181
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:37,836
and be seated here.

182
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:41,051
I think tomorrow, before coming to the puja don't talk too much

183
00:15:41,251 --> 00:15:43,511
and don't discuss too much.

184
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:48,008
I think you must have had enough discussions today

185
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:52,365
and have reached some conclusions.

186
00:15:52,565 --> 00:15:55,928
I would like to know if some questions were not answered.

187
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:58,601
If there is any I would like to answer them now

188
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:01,379
and after that we’ll start our programme. For about five minutes,

189
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:05,325
are sufficient for answering.

190
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,802
All questions were answered?

191
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:25,333
Is there any question that was not answered?

192
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:32,473
Please stand up, I can't see if there is anybody.

193
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,123
Oh, ho, that's Sahaj!

194
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:49,513
Sahaj people have no questions. They have to only answer.
