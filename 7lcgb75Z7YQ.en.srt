1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:07,400
Actually Christians do not know anything about 
His becoming.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:14,850
How He became Christ or what was the need 
to have Christ or a son to come down.

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,300
Why not God Himself could do the job.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:24,840
And this is the reason why I would request 
you to read for yourself the incarnation of

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,630
Maha Vishnu by which you realize why Christ 
was born.

6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:40,870
And it is the most important incarnation because 
He is the principle.

7
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,910
He is the principle of creation.

8
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,489
The Tattwa as they call it in Sanskrit language.

9
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,010
He is the tattwa.

10
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:58,549
Ganesha, who resides in the Mooladhara gradually 
evolves to be Christ at this stage.

11
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:07,250
From that red Chakra up to this Chakra He 
became the Christ.

12
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,770
He is the principle.

13
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,170
Now what is the principle?

14
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,250
Within us what is our principle?

15
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,430
Is say the Kundalini you can say?

16
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,080
In this the electricity is the principle of 
this one is.

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:32,510
In the same way the creation, the whole creation 
if you take it as such, it is the principle

18
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,299
and the support of this creation.

19
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:45,329
He represents the essence, the essence of 
creation.

20
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:55,969
Like we can say we have a family, husband 
and wife and the child.

21
00:01:55,969 --> 00:02:01,969
Now the child is the essence of husband and 
wife.

22
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:08,039
He is the essence of the family, of the house.

23
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,230
The whole thing is sustained for him, is created 
for him.

24
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:19,510
Till they did not have the child there was 
no meaning to that house, no meaning to their

25
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,510
life.

26
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,210
But when they had a child then they had a 
meaning.

27
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,260
In the same way Christ is the essence, is 
the tattwa itself.

28
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,049
He’s the Omkara as they call it.

29
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:39,200
He is the first sound, first sound that was 
created AUM when the Primordial Father and

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,090
Primordial Mother separated, They created 
this sound.

31
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:53,410
And He is that sound which is filled into 
All-Pervading Power and looks after and support,

32
00:02:53,410 --> 00:03:05,280
actually it is more the support because looking 
after is done by the father you can say or

33
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,959
by the mother.

34
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,860
But is the support of all the universe.

35
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,800
And because He is just the essence, the essence 
never dies.

36
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,290
Say My essence is My Spirit, it will never 
die.

37
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,610
The body dies or the creation will die but 
the essence has to be there.

38
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,840
If the essence is lost then nothing could 
be there that’s why He is the most important

39
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,370
incarnation.

40
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,209
Because He is the support.

41
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:41,150
Now this incarnation is placed in this Agnya 
Chakra of ours.

42
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:46,530
Here in the center where the optic nerve or 
optic thalamus cross each other like this.

43
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:53,939
In the center is a very subtle point which 
moves both the sides like this and like that

44
00:03:53,939 --> 00:04:01,650
and it creates two sounds Ham Ksham, Ham Ksham, 
Ham Ksham.

45
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:10,140
Ham is on the right hand side where you have 
seen the superego is there and Ksham is on

46
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,069
the left hand side where the ego is.

47
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:19,730
Now these two sounds create two kinds of vibrations.

48
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:32,260
The Ham sound creates the vibrations, which 
make you think, “I am, I am.

49
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,960
Ham, I am.”

50
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,540
This comes from our existence power that we 
know we have to live in this world, we’re

51
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,630
not going to die.

52
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:47,240
Any human being who tries to kill himself 
is abnormal.

53
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:55,430
Normally every human being, why every animal 
or any living thing tries to retain its life.

54
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,750
That is through this power of Ham that I am.

55
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,090
Now the superego on the left hand side and 
ego on the right hand side is Ksham.

56
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,380
But now I’ll tell you about the right hand 
side superego.

57
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:21,040
In this superego when you are conditioned 
by so many things, then you are frightened

58
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:29,620
and you are worried because these experiences 
make you that type of a person which has fear

59
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,620
in the mind.

60
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,820
And this fear is all settled in your superego.

61
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:40,350
This starts from your amoeba stage you can 
say and is still today is being stored there.

62
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,030
You are afraid of police, you are afraid of 
that, you are afraid of this.

63
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,870
Some people are not afraid of these things 
but are afraid of something else.

64
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:54,880
Because whatever have been your conditions, 
whatever have been your experiences are all

65
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,210
put down here.

66
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,453
Moreover when somebody reads the book of “Dracula” 
now he’s afraid of the word Dracula but

67
00:06:00,453 --> 00:06:04,760
the children who do not read they do not know 
what is a Dracula is.

68
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:11,460
If you say Dracula has come they say all right 
lets have a look at him.

69
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,270
But those children have read about Dracula, 
they are literally frightened and they say,

70
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,460
“Oh God, Dracula is coming, something terrible 
is going to happen.”

71
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,400
So you see whatever you have read, whatever 
you have gone through whatever experiences

72
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,720
you have had all is in the superego.

73
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:36,680
So this superego in that this center sends 
message, I am, you are, you are Ham, Ham don’t

74
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,220
be afraid, don’t be afraid, you are.

75
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,630
So the people who come to Me, you have seen 
some people who come to Me are victims of

76
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:52,790
superego conditioning And these are the people, 
actually at this stage only you can really

77
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,970
discriminate between the two types.

78
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:04,010
One who are very aggressive, the other who 
are absolutely we should say subordinated,

79
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,250
frightened.

80
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:11,371
These people when they come to Me I have seen, 
they go on crying and weeping, “Mother you

81
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:16,630
know this has happened that has happened,” 
and I really get tired talking to them.

82
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:23,610
And there are so many of this kind that really 
you have to pay attention to them as Sahaja

83
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,690
Yogis because you’ll have to deal with them, 
how to manage them and how to work it out.

84
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:36,170
Now at that time if a Sahaja Yogi says, now 
you go on saying Ham, Ham, Ham, Ham, a Sahaja

85
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:41,350
Yogi if he says then the vibrations will drive 
out his fear.

86
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:46,430
Even if you are under any fear and you are 
walking around and you feel that there’s

87
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,380
frightened, you just say Ham, Ham, Ham.

88
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,980
Now with this saying the vibrations will clear 
out this side very nicely.

89
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:02,100
Apart from that, that is the way you can get 
help from the Divine by saying Ham.

90
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:07,590
Now there are many things about Ham and Ksham 
but as the time is you know, so I do not want

91
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,320
to go into great details about it.

92
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,560
But I would say the mantra for the right hand 
side is Ham and for the left hand side is

93
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
Ksham.

94
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:25,460
The right hand side is the ego, which is real 
problem, you understand that, is a real colossal

95
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,090
one you have to face them, I mean.

96
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,589
I say anything small here and there I find 
the whole thing coming up onto my head like

97
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:33,589
that.

98
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:35,930
So what is the solution for a colossal ego?

99
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:44,440
Colossal ego can only be conquered by forgiving 
others.

100
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:53,060
Those who have ego must learn if they feel 
hurt they must say, “forgive.”

101
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,810
Then another person hurts them, say, “forgive.”

102
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,670
And not only forgive but ask for forgiveness.

103
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,160
Both things should be done, more asking for 
forgiveness.

104
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,350
You have to ask for forgiveness if you have 
too much of ego.

105
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,350
It is very important.

106
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,569
Because if you have too much of ego means 
what?

107
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:15,390
That you have pampered it too much.

108
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,290
That means you have used it too much.

109
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:22,399
You have dominated people and that’s why 
you have such a lot of ego.

110
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,459
If you have such a lot of ego you must all 
the time try to humble down in your heart.

111
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:32,750
Now in the heart resides the spirit.

112
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,920
The ego, too much of ego in a person always 
takes you away from that spirit.

113
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,550
That’s why it is said, “Humble down in 
your heart.”

114
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:48,699
The reason is, in the heart resides that part 
of yours which gets completely obliterated

115
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:52,840
or forgotten once you start pumping up your 
ego.

116
00:09:52,840 --> 00:10:00,600
But ego has its limits, it ends up into stupidity 
and foolishness.

117
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,410
You take any person who is egoistical and 
who’s blowing his own trumpet.

118
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,980
You will immediately know because he’ll 
be stupid.

119
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:16,250
Without understanding what he’s doing he’ll 
be doing such stupid things that you will

120
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:23,490
start wondering, especially children, “What’s 
the matter with this fellow, he is quite funny?”

121
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:29,980
And then the stupidity you see faces the person 
then he sees for himself, “Oh God!

122
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,560
how did I become so stupid?”

123
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:38,490
The stupidity comes to you because you forget 
the existence of God and your relationship

124
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,249
with the whole.

125
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:44,670
You think, “I am on my own.

126
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,110
Why should I not do this?

127
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,509
What is wrong in this, what is wrong in that?

128
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:49,709
I should do these things.”

129
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:53,389
I mean in this country the way people are 
fighting for things.

130
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:58,279
I mean you must, anybody I mean, those so-called 
developing countries can’t understand what

131
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:01,050
kind of a thing happening to these people.

132
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:09,069
Because the other day My son-in-law Lav was 
reading an article that people are demanding

133
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,949
now that the son-in-law should be allowed 
to marry the mother-in-law.

134
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:17,790
And he just couldn’t understand how can 
people gather together and ask for such an

135
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,079
absurd thing like that.

136
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,370
She is your mother.

137
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,880
How can you say that way?

138
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:27,920
I mean it is something an impossibility for 
people, normal people to think like that.

139
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,129
That a son-in-law can marry the mother-in-law.

140
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:33,759
And what is there to make a law about it and 
to talk about it.

141
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,399
It’s a very difficult thing.

142
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,290
All kinds of stupid things we are doing in 
this country, which really makes everybody

143
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,320
roar with laughter.

144
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,009
Is because of our Mr. Ego companionship.

145
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:51,130
It is not easy to understand how he befools 
us.

146
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:57,220
It goes on befooling us all the time and then 
we think what’s wrong?

147
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,750
An eighty-year-old man running after a twenty-year-old 
girl.

148
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,310
And the twenty-year-old girl befooling this 
eighty-year-old man, supposed to be a statesman

149
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:10,410
this, that and his statue is erected somewhere 
there.

150
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:14,529
How is it possible?

151
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:20,000
It is only the ego makes you do all these 
nonsensical and stupid things.

152
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,490
Once you are in Sahaja Yoga you don’t know 
how to control your laughter sometimes the

153
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,019
way people are foolish.

154
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:27,019
Extremely foolish.

155
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:33,160
And this is what it is; it ends up in stupidity 
absolute stupidity.

156
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,410
I mean even if you want to write a novel you 
won’t get such beautiful characters as you

157
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,430
could around you, when you listen to them.

158
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:46,080
And you’re shocked, Oh God what’s this 
going on and very embarrassing too.

159
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:56,579
Extremely embarrassing and they become so 
foolish with their ego that one cannot understand

160
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:04,100
how thinking man, because by thinking you 
get your ego, becomes foolish.

161
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,889
There is no wisdom in a person whose ego is 
completely developed like that.

162
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,999
If somebody has an ego like that there is 
no wisdom in him.

163
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:19,930
You can see that he does not know what is 
wisdom.

164
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,410
He behaves in such an immature way.

165
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,990
He may be an elderly man, great grandfather 
of somebody but as soon as he opens his mouth

166
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,339
you are shocked at him.

167
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:33,170
You think from where this joker has come?

168
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,480
The maturity is completely lacking.

169
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,019
The other day somebody told Me that, “Mother 
how is it our parents are so stupid and we

170
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,019
are searching God?

171
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:48,339
And the elderly people are so foolish and 
we are searching God?”

172
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:51,720
And then I said, “No, maybe because of war 
the parents are disturbed, you see”.

173
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,040
Most of the parents were disturbed during 
war and they said, “Majority of them are

174
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
like this.

175
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,579
And the younger people are searching God and 
much wiser and we don’t know how to compromise

176
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:03,779
with them because they are not searching God.

177
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:07,860
Why is it they are not searching God and we 
are searching God?

178
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,920
And if there are some searching, they are 
very few.”

179
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,339
Now I said this may be due to war but somebody 
said, “Then what about America?

180
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:19,869
You see, in America the people didn’t face 
war so much, the stupidity that they have

181
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:21,180
is sometimes surprising.”

182
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:30,269
That is the same thing as I said, is the development 
of ego in a human being.

183
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:35,370
Now ego is the thing that makes you think 
about everything.

184
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:42,290
For example, now we have to, say go from here 
to Birmingham, all right.

185
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,320
So we think now how will I go?

186
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,749
Simple way is that I’ll take a train or 
I’ll take a car and go away.

187
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:54,430
If there’s no reservation needed I will 
just jump into the train or going by the car.

188
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,759
If the car is available I’ll go by car or 
by train finished.

189
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,670
What is there to think about?

190
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:04,170
But no, then we must plan it out, “I’m 
programmed now I have to go”.

191
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:09,149
You go to the station and find the train is 
not there because there was some accident

192
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:11,069
so the train is not moving.

193
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:15,000
So you are absolutely upset because you think 
that the train has gone now what to do.

194
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,100
In that upsetting you do not even remember 
that you have a car and you have to go by

195
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,100
the car.

196
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:27,529
Now that whole things upsets you because you 
had plans to go by train and you had planned

197
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:31,100
everything, now you cannot reach there and 
what will happen?

198
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,589
Now you are sitting here and worrying about 
it.

199
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:36,910
As a person who is spontaneous what will you 
do?

200
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:42,100
All right depends on, I may go by train or 
by car whatever I feel like at that time.

201
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,910
He is sitting tight.

202
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,869
So he goes to the train, sees if the train 
is there.

203
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:52,540
If it is, nicely there’s a space available 
he gets into it.

204
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,410
If the train is not available, all right, 
he comes home takes his car and goes away.

205
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:01,820
So now you have informed the people that you 
must meet at such and such a place.

206
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,820
That’s also is there you see.

207
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,110
So those people are running up down there 
and they will be there at the station.

208
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,319
Now what’s the matter?

209
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:10,720
Even if they’re at the station you can meet 
them at the station.

210
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,679
You go by train and you can meet them.

211
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:16,240
What is there to be that much upset about 
it?

212
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,850
You see you can always contact them.

213
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:24,709
But the way we get upset we have spoiled the 
complete program of going to Birmingham, which

214
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:27,230
is a very beautiful program that we have got.

215
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,829
We have to meet new people, we have to meet 
many people, we have to enjoy ourselves.

216
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:35,971
That’s all finished because we had planned 
something and it did not work out, we are

217
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:38,410
finished.

218
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,949
All these things make us a miserable person.

219
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:48,199
And we are so miserable and so grudging and 
so boring that those who are next to you just

220
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:52,970
get fed up with it and they say, “Now shut 
up.

221
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,749
If you are not going to Birmingham, if you 
are not going don’t go.

222
00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:01,100
But don’t eat my head now”, is a common 
experience of many.

223
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:06,610
If this Mr. Ego he’s so, he doesn’t want 
you to be happy.

224
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:10,660
He doesn’t want you to be relaxed.

225
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,560
He all the time gives you ideas and tells 
you, “Do this and do that and you must get

226
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,870
it done and this is to be done.

227
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:22,180
You had better inform that person, be meticulous 
about it,” and it will go to such details

228
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:27,330
that anything fails you are finished because 
your nerves are already finished and shattered.

229
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:34,740
Anything, even a drop of inconvenience comes 
into you or even a feather of disturbance

230
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,320
is there, you are finished.

231
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,440
And so everybody is rattling, ”We have tensions.

232
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,220
We have problems.”

233
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,430
Why?

234
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:50,620
What is the advantage of doing all these things?

235
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,010
No advantage you know that.

236
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,050
But then why do you do it?

237
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,540
Because you have a big ego.

238
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,730
It won’t allow you to rest.

239
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,660
Whatever you may try it won’t.

240
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,460
So what is the solution of that?

241
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,050
Morning till evening ask for forgiveness from 
God.

242
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:10,100
Pull your ears from both the sides and say, 
“Oh God, forgive me.

243
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,890
Oh God, forgive me.

244
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:18,160
And, oh God forgive me,” so this balloon 
of ego goes down a little.

245
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,850
Remember Him morning, evening, every time.

246
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,280
Remembering Christ brings down your ego very 
much.

247
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,040
He did everything that was possible that you 
should not develop your ego.

248
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,010
Everything that was possible.

249
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,820
He was born as an ordinary carpenter’s son.

250
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,410
Lived in the most ordinary conditions.

251
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:44,820
Kept Himself behind the whole scene.

252
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,230
He could have been born as Roman Emperor.

253
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,250
He could have been anybody there.

254
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,040
But no He was born Himself.

255
00:18:54,040 --> 00:19:02,140
You know that He took his birth in a place 
where even ordinary people do not take their

256
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,140
births.

257
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,330
But, there also the light was there.

258
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:10,700
Wherever He was born there was light and joy.

259
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,630
And this is the thing we have to know, that 
we have lost the joy because we have forgotten

260
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,800
God Almighty.

261
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:26,260
When we forget Him, that He is love and He 
is joy, naturally joy is also forgotten.

262
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,400
And then we see people are not at all happy.

263
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,450
They have affluence, they have money, they 
have everything, but still they are not happy.

264
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:41,070
All the time they are in such a mess that 
you don’t know how to talk to them.

265
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,060
If you say this word they’ll be angry.

266
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,770
If you say that word they’ll be angry.

267
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:49,780
They are not at all normal human beings.

268
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,160
They are sick people.

269
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,000
Sick with their ego.

270
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,520
It’s a very simple thing is to ask for forgiveness.

271
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,140
How many times do we do that?

272
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:07,480
Not even once a day, not even once a month, 
not even once a year.

273
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:13,070
Even on a Christmas day if we could say, “Forgive 
us Oh Lord for whatever we have done so far.”

274
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,110
It will work out.

275
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,500
But that day we must champagne to forgive 
Him more.

276
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:34,050
So we must have gossips and we must have all 
the arrogant things by the time it is the

277
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,050
end of Christmas.

278
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,040
This ego, yellow side one, is the one that 
presses your superego too much.

279
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
It does.

280
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:48,130
It presses it so much sometimes that a person 
forgets that others are hurt by what they

281
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,130
talk.

282
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:56,480
On the contrary they devise methods how to 
say things which are cutting, which are hurting,

283
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,240
which are painful to others.

284
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,200
They say such things, I mean all the time 
if you see.

285
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,540
A person say from a village if he comes and 
sees he’ll think, are they quarreling, what

286
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,540
are they doing?

287
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:14,250
I mean the whole discussion, even in the parliament 
I was surprised the way they talked to each

288
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:20,740
other, no bull will treat another bull that 
way, see.

289
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,590
Even a dog normally does not bark at another 
dog.

290
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:30,130
No animal in the world all the time is barking 
at its fellow man.

291
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,160
No animal in the whole world I can tell you 
this much.

292
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,310
Only the human beings if two people are there 
all the time they are going, ha ha ha ha all

293
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,320
the time that way.

294
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,650
How is it possible?

295
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:47,650
His ego and her ego or maybe both his ego 
are dashing at each other.

296
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:55,630
There is a kind of a funny type of feeling 
that oh I have mastered the thing, I have

297
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,400
got the thing, I have got the point.

298
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,740
I have proved the point.

299
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:08,190
But in that I have lost everything that was 
so beautiful and so much joy giving within

300
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,190
me.

301
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:15,860
Actually a sensible person would recede from 
the place where two people are having an argument.

302
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,450
Argument is a sign of tomfoolery.

303
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:23,740
I haven’t seen any argument coming to any 
end whatsoever.

304
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,790
If it is then it is all right.

305
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,020
But it never does come.

306
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,440
Because, if say, you ask Me questions I answer 
you, all right.

307
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,900
If you do not like the answer give it up.

308
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:42,150
But if you argue with Me still and I argue 
with you where will you end?

309
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:50,980
Argument is not going to lead you to any knowledge 
but a very terrible ego developing into you.

310
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,550
The whole modern concept is ego oriented.

311
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:59,520
All western countries are ego orientated.

312
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,500
They want to develop your ego and pamper it.

313
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,810
There are so many other ways by which they 
do.

314
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:11,420
Why I’m talking more about it because we 
are all supposed to be western people and

315
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,450
affluent people you see.

316
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,600
Supposed to be very wise and leading or misleading, 
I don’t know, the developing countries.

317
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:23,110
So we have to understand ourselves where are 
we as far as our understanding of things are

318
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,110
concerned.

319
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:29,620
How ego is pampered within us is by a large-scale 
method.

320
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,070
They work on your ego throughout to have all 
these so-called enterprises.

321
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,770
For example to a woman they’ll say, “Oh 
you must have a waist like this and you must

322
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:42,650
have a face like this and you must have –“ For 
a man, “You must this kind of a body.

323
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:47,310
You should be Mr. Universe or you should be 
something,” so the man starts working on

324
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,310
it immediately.

325
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:52,190
You must, there so many people I have seen 
running on the roads in this cold, I don’t

326
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,190
understand.

327
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,210
Like mad you know and some of them are Member 
of Parliament.

328
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:59,790
The whole night they keep awake and the whole 
day they are running about.

329
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,680
I say what are you doing?

330
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,420
What is the need to do this?

331
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,420
To keep good health you must do it.

332
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,260
To keep good health don’t work like mad, 
be a sensible and a wise person.

333
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:17,630
Wisdom is to be sought to keep good health, 
to be all right and not this kind of mad ego

334
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,090
orientated things.

335
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:24,000
So then the one way is to excite your ego 
about your physique.

336
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,390
Then there is ego about, you must have a big 
car.

337
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:31,140
You see people try to show off their possessions.

338
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,070
You have a big car, then they’re going about.

339
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,020
I mean they really look to me like jokers, 
that’s all they are.

340
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:41,760
I mean car I can understand is a convenience 
and a good quality car if somebody can afford

341
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,390
it should have it because it is a headache 
to have a bad car.

342
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,880
So it’s all right.

343
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,590
But by having a car you become something great.

344
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,590
You may not have food in the house but you 
must have a very good car to go about.

345
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,760
And all these ideas come.

346
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,990
Then they will advertise, you see, this will 
be a very good car for you.

347
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,400
What is it for you?

348
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,240
It is nothing but to pamper your ego.

349
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,910
All these advertisements are nothing but by 
which your ego is pampered.

350
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,910
All these things they’re treated.

351
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,630
Now in America if you go every handle has 
to be different.

352
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,190
Everything has to be different.

353
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,340
Why so much difference in everything?

354
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:20,040
Why do you want to have everything so different?

355
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,510
Is it some aesthetics, you think in that?

356
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:26,330
It is none of the aesthetics but is just to 
pamper your ego.

357
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:31,080
Even the so-called art connoisseurs are nothing 
but ego pamperers.

358
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,560
Your stamp collections this, that, all this 
is nothing but ego pampering.

359
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:39,790
And what a waste of time, you just think about 
it.

360
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:48,850
This ego thing comes into us because we are 
first of all, as I said, that in the west

361
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,220
the living was very difficult.

362
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,200
They had to fight the nature.

363
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,360
And when you have to fight the nature you 
have to develop your ego to fight it.

364
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,570
Or actually when you are fighting the nature 
the ego develops within you.

365
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:06,790
And then once that momentum has started in 
you it is very difficult to bring it down.

366
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:13,640
It is such a terrible disease that people 
have taken it for granted that that’s a

367
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,760
part of their lives.

368
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,990
You are not your ego.

369
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,380
You are not.

370
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:24,180
When I say that you must surrender yourself 
to God they think Mother why should we surrender?

371
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,050
Yourself means that ego with which you are 
identified.

372
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:31,290
I don’t say that you surrender your wisdom.

373
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:37,370
Or I can say surrender your ego to your wisdom.

374
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,780
But it is so difficult to give it up because 
we have learned to live with it, identified

375
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,780
with it.

376
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,690
We just cannot think of life without our ego, 
we just cannot.

377
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:54,660
And it has gone to such an extent that we 
don’t even realize how far we have gone

378
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,720
in cruelty.

379
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,370
Like, “I like this kind, I like that kind.”

380
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,850
You go to somebody’s house and you say like 
this.

381
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,730
Is indecent to talk like that.

382
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,460
It is vulgar to express, “I like.”

383
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,950
Who are you?

384
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,620
Are you God?

385
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,690
I want this.

386
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,040
I want that.

387
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,750
I am very particular about this.

388
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,010
I’m very, who are you?

389
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:26,540
Just ask yourself a question, “Who am I?

390
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,920
I’m the Spirit.

391
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,370
I’m that eternal being.

392
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:35,720
Have I become that?”

393
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,340
On the contrary we are hurting everybody’s 
Spirit by our ego.

394
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:45,360
Every moment when we talk to others we are 
hurting them.

395
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:52,760
Actually people have lost faith in God, because 
those who are in charge of God are so arrogant

396
00:27:52,760 --> 00:28:01,790
and so egoistical that it has become impossible 
for anybody to think of God, which is beyond

397
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,010
your ego.

398
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,830
You’ll be surprised, ego is absolutely superficial 
like a bubble.

399
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:13,240
It is just like a balloon, which can burst 
just like that.

400
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,370
And it should go.

401
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:18,770
It should go so that you should rise.

402
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:25,320
It should disappear so that your attention 
rises in your Spirit.

403
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:31,390
And that you see the whole world as a part 
of that Spirit that you are.

404
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:37,080
This is the boundary, which you have to cross 
and for that we have to take help from Christ.

405
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,170
Christ crucified himself.

406
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,710
Why?

407
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,600
Because what did He do?

408
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,400
Did He loot people?

409
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:52,140
Today you have thousands of these thugs coming 
here and looting you.

410
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,630
Nobody crucifies them.

411
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:56,490
What did He do?

412
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:04,850
He just challenged the ego of these Romans 
and of these Jews, those who were angry with

413
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:11,330
Him, and that’s why He was crucified.

414
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:15,010
And we have to crucify our ego now through 
His cross.

415
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:25,920
Otherwise we are going to do the same again 
to ourselves that in our own being we crucify

416
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,980
our Christ by our ego.

417
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:36,400
It is a very symbolic gesture of Christ, His 
birth in the most humble place, in a very

418
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,780
humble place.

419
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:43,680
He is born in the optic thalamus, you can 
say, is the place where there brain, all activities

420
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:52,270
coming and all the, all sorts of problems 
there chasing you, and there He lives and

421
00:29:52,270 --> 00:30:01,000
you have to just awaken Him there so that 
your ego is crucified once for all.

422
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,610
But I don’t think you fight your ego because 
it is not that important to fight.

423
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:08,010
You are fighting with your shadow.

424
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:14,610
You have shadow which is called as ego which 
is not to be fought and wasted, waste your

425
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,610
energy on him.

426
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:21,020
Just no need to fight, only thing if you stand 
in the center of the light you don’t see

427
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,020
any shadow.

428
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,280
It is so simple as that.

429
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:29,010
If you stand in the center of light that is 
Christ you don’t see any shadow anywhere.

430
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:33,680
But when I say this I may sound like other 
people who give sermons, “Stand in the shadow

431
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,430
of Christ or stand in the light of Christ.”

432
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,480
Now what does that mean?

433
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,720
Where is that light or where is that place 
where you should stand?

434
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:54,500
That place is here – the center of your 
optic thalamus where there is no thought.

435
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,100
You have to stand in thoughtless awareness.

436
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,900
Many people who have had a problem with Agnya, 
many people who have come

437
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,330
[Talk is interrupted here and a few words 
are missing]

438
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,700
…thoughts will stop and they will be beyond 
thought.

439
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:14,920
And this a very, very important Chakra for 
Sahaja Yogis because when the Kundalini rises

440
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:19,690
above, above the Agnya Chakra immediately 
there is no thought.

441
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:24,950
You do not get any thoughts from ego or superego.

442
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:30,900
But there is wobbling in the Agnya because 
of your imbalanced ways.

443
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:36,810
And the imbalanced ways are, that sometimes 
you are with ego or with superego.

444
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:42,430
This has happened to our people in the West 
because we have had so much of ego we got

445
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,000
really tired of it.

446
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,960
We got frightened with it.

447
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,870
Then we started taking to drugs and things 
to increase our superego.

448
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:55,860
But by doing that what we are doing is pushing 
by one end and bringing back another end and

449
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:03,820
that’s how we are wobbling our ego and superego 
by which we are not helping ourselves at all.

450
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:09,650
So what one has to do is to rise within oneself 
up to the point of Agnya and try to steady

451
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,650
your Agnya.

452
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,520
There are many people have asked Me one question.

453
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,250
How to steady the Agnya?

454
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:24,830
Agnya is placed at the crossing point of our 
nerves and also optic thalamus.

455
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:31,510
Now, so it is said that if you have wobbling 
eyes you’ll have a wobbling Agnya.

456
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,730
You have to steady your eyes.

457
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,200
You have to soothe them.

458
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:43,180
Now it is very, very out of date, ancient, 
old and all sorts of names that you call it

459
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,380
to a thing like that.

460
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:50,170
But you must steady your eyes and steady them 
in such a way that it is very soothing for

461
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,170
the eyes.

462
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:56,140
Which is the most soothing thing for the eyes 
is the green grass.

463
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:03,920
If you could see the green grass with your 
eyes means you walk with your eyes on the

464
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,920
ground.

465
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,290
Your eyes will be soothed, your Agnya will 
be all right.

466
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:13,960
That’s why Christ said that, “I tell you 
about the adulterous eyes”.

467
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,490
He talked about adulterous eyes.

468
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,030
The eyes with which you do adultery.

469
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,220
Is a very common thing these days.

470
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,280
Every woman a man must see.

471
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,890
Every man a woman must see.

472
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:28,320
As if it is the most important job.

473
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,830
If you have not seen one woman you’re finished.

474
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,600
I mean this is being modern.

475
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,340
But I am an old fashioned lady.

476
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:40,930
And at the time of Christ he said, “You 
should not have adulterous eyes.”

477
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:50,440
And the ones who have adulterous eyes are, 
no more than any other, but our Western Christians.

478
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,080
Who all the time even in the church, even 
when they’re giving sermons, their eyes

479
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,950
are moving with adultery.

480
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:06,430
These eyes have to be very, very pure, very, 
very deep and very loving when you want to

481
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:09,020
have your Agnya all right.

482
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,829
Because you receive through you eyes.

483
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:15,240
Say if you have closed your eyes you do not 
put your attention to anything because your

484
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,240
eyes are closed.

485
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,629
You are not adding more thoughts to yourself.

486
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:22,589
But if your eyes are open you are adding much 
more thoughts because everywhere the eyes

487
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:27,720
go the attention goes and you see things and 
create thoughts and put in them.

488
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:35,929
So your attention which has to go to the Spirit, 
which has to go to God, which has to shine

489
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:39,179
through the window of Divine.

490
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:47,850
This beautiful thing is ruined by the way 
we use our eyes and we do not respect it.

491
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:56,299
There’s nothing so pure and beautiful as 
the grass on the ground or the ground itself,

492
00:34:56,299 --> 00:35:03,289
which takes our feet, which supports us, which 
looks after us, enriches us.

493
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:08,740
We should put our eyes on the Mother Earth 
instead of looking at every person.

494
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:12,931
But from Sahaja Yoga point of view now many 
of you know what happens to your eyes when

495
00:35:12,931 --> 00:35:14,710
you look at somebody.

496
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,329
Maybe a entity might enter your eyes.

497
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:24,730
And it is, you’ll be amazed that it is the 
play of the entity what we call this so-called

498
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:25,730
flirting is.

499
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:30,400
I’ve talked about it before also and people 
didn’t like it when I told them about it.

500
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,309
But I have seen actual entities entering from 
eyes to eyes.

501
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:42,089
I have seen very simple people who come down 
to such places, say in a party.

502
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:46,410
In a party people are just exchanging entities 
from one eye to another.

503
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:51,040
Once it goes to another person he puts his 
entity into another person.

504
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,040
And that third goes into another person.

505
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,890
All the time your attention is diverted.

506
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,329
And you feel it is attracted towards something, 
you do not know why it is attracted.

507
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:01,980
Now the certain symbols are also made like 
that.

508
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:08,579
To add up to the problems, you see all the 
society is working at it.

509
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:15,960
That you should appear in such a way that 
every man should look at you.

510
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,259
Every woman should look at you.

511
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:18,259
Why?

512
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,609
What is the use?

513
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:23,440
Supposing I look at you what do I get?

514
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,950
What do I get by looking at a person?

515
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:28,790
What is the advantage just looking at a person?

516
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:33,349
We are wasting such a lot of energy for what?

517
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:41,039
In the same way if you are walking on the 
roads, we are seeing some beautiful things

518
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:42,039
all right.

519
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:44,960
If you have to buy something, all right go 
ahead, see those things, whatever you have

520
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,690
to select is all right.

521
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:51,960
But all the time just because your eyes are 
such, you are just doing it and you do not

522
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:59,210
know the reason why you are doing like this, 
all the time why your eyes are wobbling.

523
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:03,359
And that is a sure and certain sign for a 
person to become mad.

524
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:12,130
Absolutely, that’s a sure and certain sign 
is, when a person is mad how do you make it

525
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,780
out that a person is lunatic.

526
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:20,019
If you see his eyes the iris in the eyes are 
all the time wobbling.

527
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:21,869
They cannot keep it steady.

528
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:28,339
Or they are sick they’re also, you can see, 
that these eyes are all the time wobbling.

529
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:30,190
There is no steadiness.

530
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:34,369
Not only this but you have seen those people 
who have come in the Sahaja Yoga when they

531
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:37,609
close their eyes they find their eyes are 
flickering.

532
00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:40,869
Their eyelids are flickering.

533
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:46,380
That means there is some sort of a disturbance 
in the Kundalini rising.

534
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:56,930
Whole tension if you call it as hundred then 
at least eighty percent of it comes through

535
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,119
our eyes.

536
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:06,980
Then how important it is to protect our eyes 
from all kind of useless activities we are

537
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,080
doing.

538
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:17,190
Christ - Christ’s life shows so many aspects 
of how to respect others.

539
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:23,500
But one of them which has been very much misused 
throughout is that of the prostitute.

540
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:30,539
He saved the prostitute, He saved her no doubt.

541
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:33,640
But you spoil these prostitutes.

542
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:38,619
A good woman you make her into prostitutes.

543
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:41,730
You give her ideas by which she becomes a 
prostitute.

544
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:47,230
A good Huswife (old English word like housewife) 
is turned into a prostitute by an egotistical

545
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,230
man.

546
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:56,770
Young small girls who are virgins are being 
destroyed by your dirty glances.

547
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,720
Do you realize this?

548
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,869
That you are doing just the opposite what 
Christ had done?

549
00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:06,660
And you say that He saved, Christ, so even 
if we are prostitutes He’ll save us.

550
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,619
But why be prostitutes?

551
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:13,559
This is such a stupid style of thinking.

552
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:19,960
That we should become prostitutes so that 
Christ will save us.

553
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:28,800
One has to think about all these things in 
the proper light of Sahaja Yoga.

554
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,019
Unless and until you are realized My talk 
is just useless for you.

555
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:39,859
But once you are realized you will know that 
if you glance at someone you might suddenly

556
00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:41,569
get a headache at the back.

557
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:46,460
You might feel a dart has gone into your head 
or something has happened.

558
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:52,609
You might feel that you’re blinding with 
somebody’s face and you will get all kinds

559
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:57,640
of experiences by which you will know how 
important are your eyes.

560
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:03,790
All your nervousness and everything can be 
cured if you have pure eyes.

561
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:08,589
But it is such a vicious circle that through 
your eyes you gather all the bad and is accumulated

562
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:13,920
in the Agnya and you have to clear the Agnya 
to make the eyes clear.

563
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,940
It’s a vicious circle.

564
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:20,109
But it can start at a point as I said, we 
have to ask for forgiveness.

565
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:28,140
Secondly we have to bring Christ in our Agnya 
Chakra.

566
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:36,570
Thirdly we have to give up all drugs and all 
intoxicants and all smoking.

567
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:41,450
That happens automatically when you are a 
Sahaja Yogi, it will work out.

568
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:49,940
But eyes express the whole of your being, 
your brain, your body, your limbs everything.

569
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:58,609
And if your Agnya is all right then you eyes 
are perfectly all right.

570
00:40:58,609 --> 00:41:01,829
They emit nothing but love wherever they glance.

571
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:08,140
Only with a glance of your eyes you can raise 
the Kundalini.

572
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:12,109
Only with the glance of your eyes you can 
cure people.

573
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:19,780
Only with your glance you can bring joy into 
the destroyed and the ruined people.

574
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:24,470
So these eyes which you see are the windows 
of your being, of your heart.

575
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:32,210
When the Spirit is expressed through your 
eyes, you must have noticed yourself, that

576
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:38,440
when the Kundalini rises then the eyes become 
dilated.

577
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:46,900
And a realized soul has got black eyes because 
they have these eyes are dilated.

578
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,930
At least when I see them they are all dilated 
black eyes.

579
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:56,039
Apart from that a realized soul can be made 
out by his eyes which are sparkling.

580
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:58,190
There’s a sparkle like diamonds.

581
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:03,780
They sparkle all the time and you can make 
out from the eyes that this person is a realized

582
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,780
soul.

583
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:09,720
There’s a tremendous difference between 
a non-realized soul’s eyes and a realized

584
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,720
soul’s eyes.

585
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,230
So you can imagine how your Spirit sees through 
your eyes.

586
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:20,349
But if the eyes are not pure it doesn’t 
stay there long.

587
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:25,410
So if we have to understand Christ physically 
we have to respect our eyes.

588
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:31,460
Mentally we have to give up all that is impure 
in our mind.

589
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:36,369
Now, so we come to the impurities of the mind.

590
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:42,640
And the impurities of mind are, there are 
so many poisons, you know, about.

591
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,369
I mean there are books and books written about 
the poison.

592
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:48,730
And the psychologists are supposed to take 
out all your poisons.

593
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,780
I don’t know if they can do it at all.

594
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,410
But they have the worst Agnya.

595
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:58,670
All these psychologists have the worst Agnya 
and I don’t think they are capable of really

596
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,680
giving any relief to people who suffering 
mentally.

597
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,680
Mental sufferings are of two types.

598
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,200
Say the same thing is that one is…

599
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:17,839
MOTHER SAYS ASIDE: Vibrations are so much, 
I can’t stand it.

600
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:25,840
One type of mental troubles are where people 
oppress you very much.

601
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,519
You see you go on bearing the cross.

602
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:35,960
Now this is a very wrong idea people have 
about Christ.

603
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:42,339
Bearing the cross doesn’t mean that anybody 
who tries to oppress you should go on taking

604
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:45,160
the enslavement upon yourself.

605
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:51,619
You’re not to enslave to anyone whatsoever.

606
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:57,289
Anybody who tries to make a slave out of you, 
you should deny it absolutely.

607
00:43:57,289 --> 00:43:59,160
You should say Hum, I am.

608
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,599
Who are you to dominate me?

609
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:08,839
Anyone whether you are of a black skin, or 
a red skin or a yellow skin, nobody has right

610
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:11,480
to dominate anyone in this whole world.

611
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:17,440
And if anybody is doing it, “Oh what to 
do now, after all you see we are poor people,

612
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,930
or we are like this or he’s supporting,” 
and all that.

613
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:26,230
Then they are running away from their duty 
towards themselves.

614
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,160
Such people cannot get Realization.

615
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,640
Slaves are not going to become kings.

616
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:42,680
So the slavery that is supposed to be confused 
with bearing the cross is another confusion

617
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,079
of modern times.

618
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:49,430
We have to rise in our self-respect.

619
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:56,470
And we have to understand that no one in this 
world has a right to dominate us.

620
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:59,950
But then what is bearing of the cross is?

621
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:04,440
First of all the people of His level never 
suffer.

622
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,539
It’s just a joke going on.

623
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:12,710
It’s a Leela, it’s a play going on for 
them.

624
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:21,509
They never suffer, and even if they so called 
act as suffering they just do it because they

625
00:45:21,509 --> 00:45:23,280
want to do it.

626
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,259
They are not helpless people.

627
00:45:26,259 --> 00:45:30,009
They are not slaves.

628
00:45:30,009 --> 00:45:36,569
And those who think that by bearing it up 
and by suffering it we are becoming Christians

629
00:45:36,569 --> 00:45:40,450
they should know they are psychological cases.

630
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:46,869
And if they are crying and weeping and all 
the time saying, “What to do, you see I

631
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:50,829
am in love and my lover tortures me.”

632
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:54,500
You are neither in love neither you have a 
lover.

633
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,349
It is a kind of a psychological clubbing.

634
00:45:57,349 --> 00:46:01,700
That he is a dominating man and you like his 
domination, that’s why you are together.

635
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,290
Is a simple fact.

636
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:09,280
So every human being has his own self-respect.

637
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,359
And he must respect his self that is the Spirit 
within him.

638
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:15,029
And nothing should dominate it.

639
00:46:15,029 --> 00:46:16,589
Whether you belong to this country or that 
country, or this ism or that ism.

640
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:17,589
All this will break down.

641
00:46:17,589 --> 00:46:18,589
[The red part is not present in the tape with 
FV.

642
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:22,740
Also in the FV’s tape the following sentence 
is a single sentence, spoken unbroken by Shri

643
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,740
Mataji]

644
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:30,950
Under the rule of God nobody has the right 
to dominate anybody’s Spirit.

645
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:37,130
But when you are given freedom you go to the 
other side that is Mr. Ego.

646
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,130
You do not know how to use your freedom.

647
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:41,200
So you try to dominate others.

648
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,970
Your freedom is, everybody’s freedom is 
in danger.

649
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:51,299
You’re on top of everyone, and torturing 
everybody’s souls.

650
00:46:51,299 --> 00:46:59,260
And you are dominating by land and by properties 
or by possessions.

651
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:12,740
So either this way or that way, mentally if 
you are of this category or that category,

652
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,239
you are against yourself.

653
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:19,880
Just be in the center and see for yourself.

654
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,970
Just be looking at it.

655
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:27,470
Are you emitting love towards another person?

656
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:35,619
If you are a slave how can you love?

657
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:36,619
You cannot.

658
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:45,700
If you are free and abandoned how can you 
love?

659
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:50,690
Love has its own bondages very sweet and beautiful.

660
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:54,200
You have to live with them.

661
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,539
You enjoy those bondages.

662
00:47:55,539 --> 00:48:00,511
For a little child will come to your house 
and he will spoil your house no doubt, and

663
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,809
that he should do.

664
00:48:01,809 --> 00:48:06,160
And you should enjoy that spoiling.

665
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:12,950
Then your freedom if it is challenged by a 
little child’s crying, then you are not

666
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:13,950
wise people.

667
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:15,420
This is abandonment.

668
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:19,930
Or I would say it is loneliness.

669
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:31,380
It is cutting off from the primordial, from 
the big one, from the large one that you are.

670
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:35,849
Is not to be able to tolerate the freedom 
of others.

671
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:40,560
A child has no freedom to cry in the house.

672
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,630
What sort of freedom you conceive of.

673
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:49,559
A mother has no right to say something she 
wants to say about her child, which is her

674
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:52,230
duty to tell him what is right and wrong.

675
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:57,999
If the son does not have right to eat whatever 
he likes in his own mother’s family then

676
00:48:57,999 --> 00:49:00,430
what sort of freedom do you have?

677
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:04,489
It’s such a confusion of things.

678
00:49:04,489 --> 00:49:09,220
So this kind of freedom is just the opposite 
and extreme of enslavement.

679
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:13,369
But in the center is love where you are bound 
by everyone.

680
00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:16,989
I am bound by My children.

681
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:18,291
Yes, I am.

682
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:20,000
I am proud of them.

683
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,910
They bound Me and I bound them too.

684
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:28,160
It’s a mutual bounding which we enjoy among 
ourselves.

685
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:35,109
There is such a give and take when there is 
such a bondage of love.

686
00:49:35,109 --> 00:49:41,490
But do we understand the importance of bondage 
of love?

687
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:43,819
At the slightest pretext we break it.

688
00:49:43,819 --> 00:49:46,980
Say wife says, “I would like to go out today”.

689
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,460
The husband says “Why?

690
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:51,869
I am very tired don’t you understand?“

691
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:56,519
Or if the husband says, “I feel like eating 
something,” or some particular thing he

692
00:49:56,519 --> 00:49:58,099
says pancake or something, a small thing.

693
00:49:58,099 --> 00:50:01,200
“Oh I am very tired every time you are demanding.”

694
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:06,510
If she could just think by making that little 
thing he would be so very happy.

695
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,150
She should be dying to know what he wants.

696
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:11,329
And he should be dying to do what she wants.

697
00:50:11,329 --> 00:50:16,609
And then enjoy each other’s company or you 
are wasting all your properties that you have

698
00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:17,609
as human beings.

699
00:50:17,609 --> 00:50:21,749
You don’t know how much you are wasting 
from each other.

700
00:50:21,749 --> 00:50:27,930
Every moment is filled with such beautiful 
bondages, where exchanges are there.

701
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:29,989
What have you gained?

702
00:50:29,989 --> 00:50:34,170
The way you are fighting.

703
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,470
The way you are going about.

704
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:38,759
What have you gained let me see?

705
00:50:38,759 --> 00:50:44,900
When you die you have to announce in the paper 
that XYZ is dead and you find there is nobody.

706
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:48,579
And you have even to pay for people to visit 
you when you die.

707
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:52,079
This is the case today.

708
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,759
Such dryness, such emptiness, such loneliness 
exists.

709
00:50:56,759 --> 00:51:01,259
What have you achieved through this.

710
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:04,710
So this bondage we have to.

711
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:06,891
And there is no question of sacrifice you 
see, the way.

712
00:51:06,891 --> 00:51:07,891
We must sacrifice for the family.

713
00:51:07,891 --> 00:51:08,891
What are you sacrificing?

714
00:51:08,891 --> 00:51:16,319
I mean if you pay for your family you get 
the joy out of it.

715
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:20,099
That’s why you do it.

716
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:26,140
If you have to lead a nice good life you are 
not sacrificing anything but you are gaining

717
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,660
by that, leading a good life.

718
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:38,329
If your wife says, “Don’t go to the pub,” 
and if you do not go there, then you should

719
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:43,220
not say she is an orthodox, old fashioned 
this that, that and that and that.

720
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:47,852
But instead you should thank you stars that 
in this modern times also that there is somebody

721
00:51:47,852 --> 00:51:51,619
who’s telling you the truth.

722
00:51:51,619 --> 00:51:57,099
Because the whole edifice has come up, do 
you mean to say that truth should not be told?

723
00:51:57,099 --> 00:52:01,920
All this is falsehood in which you are living.

724
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,230
And if you have to be happy come down to reality.

725
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:11,269
Friends, also same thing.

726
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:16,690
With the friends what sort of relations do 
we have with our friends?

727
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:18,269
What do we expect from them?

728
00:52:18,269 --> 00:52:25,329
Sending them a Christmas card and then if 
they don’t send, feeling bad about it.

729
00:52:25,329 --> 00:52:29,529
There are no deeper bondages we have not lived 
with them.

730
00:52:29,529 --> 00:52:36,470
If you allow our self to be bound by them, 
they will be bound by us.

731
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,490
You better try this.

732
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:39,769
Try to be bound by them.

733
00:52:39,769 --> 00:52:41,670
Don’t be afraid of anybody else.

734
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:47,710
Just try to be bound by others and you’ll 
be amazed how much they will be giving you.

735
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:53,279
I am a living example of this.

736
00:52:53,279 --> 00:52:55,750
I can tell you I am a living example of this.

737
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,680
I am bound by all of you.

738
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,339
If somebody says, “Mother when are you going 
to leave us?”

739
00:53:01,339 --> 00:53:02,339
No I cannot.

740
00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:03,339
I cannot.

741
00:53:03,339 --> 00:53:04,930
I am just bound by you.

742
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:08,339
I just do not want to leave because I love 
you very much.

743
00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:10,589
How can I leave you?

744
00:53:10,589 --> 00:53:12,970
It’s impossible for Me.

745
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:16,960
So then, what do I gain out of this life?

746
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,880
Everything that is in this world.

747
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,619
What do you want Me to get?

748
00:53:21,619 --> 00:53:27,499
I cannot even count what I can get out of 
it.

749
00:53:27,499 --> 00:53:30,420
Immeasurable, ocean.

750
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,789
I become an ocean Myself.

751
00:53:32,789 --> 00:53:43,880
Break your ideas about your own personal freedom 
and liberation, is liberating your intelligence.

752
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:48,050
You‘re liberating your own wisdom.

753
00:53:48,050 --> 00:54:01,849
And the sweetness and the beauty which is 
never perishable whether you are old or young.

754
00:54:01,849 --> 00:54:04,249
That is going to be your own.

755
00:54:04,249 --> 00:54:11,989
But these poisons that are being built outside 
and inside you, please throw them away.

756
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:15,009
These are mental poisons.

757
00:54:15,009 --> 00:54:20,289
Through Agnya you can take them out.

758
00:54:20,289 --> 00:54:25,349
You see, this is an opening also through which 
many things go out.

759
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:28,989
Try to work it out.

760
00:54:28,989 --> 00:54:37,479
Look at the tree with love and you’ll find 
that the tree itself is giving you the joy

761
00:54:37,479 --> 00:54:39,799
of its creation.

762
00:54:39,799 --> 00:54:41,900
Because you’ll become thoughtless.

763
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:47,549
And the creator who has made that beautiful 
tree will be pouring all that joy which is

764
00:54:47,549 --> 00:54:49,640
stored into it into you.

765
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:55,030
Every human being is a store of joy.

766
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:58,950
Unlimited, I assure you, believe Me.

767
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:06,849
And don’t waste them because somebody is 
not properly dressed, or he’s not according

768
00:55:06,849 --> 00:55:11,750
to the way you want him to be which you learnt 
in your public school.

769
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:22,719
Every doorstep, everywhere there is beauty 
lying, do not miss it.

770
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:29,979
But if you have possessiveness about it, an 
adultery about it, then you can never enjoy

771
00:55:29,979 --> 00:55:33,769
them.

772
00:55:33,769 --> 00:55:42,900
You can never enjoy all that beauty, all that 
store, all that wealth that is in every human

773
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:47,390
being every moment it is bubbling.

774
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:52,410
For Agnya it’s a good thing, Christmas is 
coming.

775
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:59,690
And at the time that when I have to wish you 
Happy Christmas, that at this occasion I am

776
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:07,950
speaking about Agnya Chakra in which, what 
I said is, Agnya is one must know what to

777
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:10,619
order and how to obey.

778
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:13,099
Obey the Divine.

779
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:17,390
Obey your elders.

780
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:23,130
Obey your self and not your ego.

781
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,650
And then you can order also others.

782
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:33,060
Not only human beings, but you can even order 
the sun and the moon and all the winds and

783
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,200
everything in the world.

784
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:39,549
Everything you can control, everything with 
this Agnya.

785
00:56:39,549 --> 00:56:42,289
You try one thing.

786
00:56:42,289 --> 00:56:47,759
If you know somebody is going to do something 
wrong, just take his name and put it to Agnya.

787
00:56:47,759 --> 00:56:50,739
He’ll not do it, try it.

788
00:56:50,739 --> 00:56:57,319
This is a trick I’m telling about for those 
who are realized souls not for those who are

789
00:56:57,319 --> 00:57:00,680
not yet realized but those who are realized 
can try.

790
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:04,490
If the other person is doing something wrong 
you can try your Agnya.

791
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:10,780
Anything you order on your Agnya will be respected 
but your Agnya must have Christ there.

792
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:18,650
Because you have the great support awakened 
within you, which does not exist here but

793
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:19,670
into every man’s head.

794
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:30,460
It is all pervading into all small atoms and 
molecules, it is everywhere into the sun and

795
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,390
any place you go.

796
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:36,119
It is there.

797
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:43,619
So try to develop your Agnya that is the mastery 
of your self.

798
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:51,390
Those who have a good Agnya can master anything 
and understand that the idea about mastering

799
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:57,130
worldly things and mastering human beings 
and mastering this and some of them are mastering

800
00:57:57,130 --> 00:58:03,660
in, say, other crafts and things, best thing 
is to master your Agnya.

801
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:11,190
And you really become the master of yourself 
by which you can master many things.

802
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:17,680
And today on this great day when I’m wishing 
you a Happy Christmas, I wish you to have

803
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:26,779
the most powerful Agnya, that people when 
they see your forehead should know that Christ

804
00:58:26,779 --> 00:58:29,670
is reborn again with in you.
