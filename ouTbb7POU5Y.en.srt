1
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,700
Happy Easter to all of you!

2
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:35,030
It's a great day to come to Rome

3
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:41,280
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.

4
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Now we have to do the resurrection of Christianity,

5
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,950
which is just moving in the opposite direction

6
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,860
of Christ's resurrection.

7
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:11,700
As you know that Christ was

8
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,700
just chaitanya,

9
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,160
but He came in the body

10
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,610
of chaitanya.

11
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,240
The whole body was made of chaitanya,

12
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:41,160
and He resurrected Himself

13
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,450
to show to the world

14
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:52,200
that you can resurrect yourself also,

15
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:58,660
if you can fill your body with chaitanya.

16
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:08,400
There is always a struggle between the matter and the spirit.

17
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,490
In human life what we see

18
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:19,240
that matter is all the time trying to take over the spirit.

19
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,320
And that is how we fail in our resurrection.

20
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,360
We fail in our resurrection

21
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,450
because we give way to matter.

22
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:40,990
We have come from matter - easy to go back to matter.

23
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,820
But all the christian nations

24
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:54,780
have taken to the material development -

25
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:01,400
identification with the matter, not the sublimation of the matter.

26
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,200
Why we have gone wrong is

27
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,660
because matter has become so important to us.

28
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,400
We are so much identified with the matter, with our body,

29
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,780
with all that is material for us.

30
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,530
People are so much worried about the material things.

31
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:37,530
What I find that the whole culture has become materialistic

32
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,660
and they're absolutely ashamed about it,

33
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,450
but still they continue,

34
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:55,030
the way it is so shameful and so degrading.

35
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,950
It degrades human beings.

36
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:05,740
As I have come in the West I see this trend very clearly.

37
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,160
For example, in a household

38
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,780
whatever they purchase is for sale, all the time.

39
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,820
So whatever they will purchase, they will see to it

40
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,490
that it should be of a certain standard.

41
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,570
Like it should be,

42
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,280
if it has to be a diamond, it has to be a perfect diamond,

43
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,530
because it has to be sold again.

44
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,360
If they purchase the house, they are afraid that

45
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,160
we should not spoil it or we should not make it beautiful,

46
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:44,400
we should not try to do something

47
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,360
that will lower the price of the house

48
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:54,490
because we like the particular type of decoration.

49
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,860
Everything is for sale.

50
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,950
They never enjoy any matter, you see.

51
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,820
The enjoyment is not there.

52
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Whatever they buy, they think that "can we sell it back?"

53
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:13,410
Say, even about - I've seen even precious stones.

54
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,110
Like in India, everybody can afford to have precious stones,

55
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,820
because the rich will buy the most expensive ones,

56
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,110
then the poor people can buy ordinary ones,

57
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
like silver everybody can have,

58
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,410
because some can have silver which is hundred percent,

59
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,200
some can have little mixed up,

60
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,240
some can have with some other material.

61
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,610
But if you go to any country in the West,

62
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,780
it has to have the "hallmark", you see.

63
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,740
The hallmark has to be there. Otherwise they'll never purchase it

64
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,280
unless and until there is a hallmark,

65
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:58,400
there is a hallmark means, it can be resold.

66
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,200
Now, supposing in India you buy some...

67
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,070
everything without hallmarks ... there's no hallmark,

68
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,200
but, when you want to sell it also anytime,

69
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,950
I mean, if you have to sell it,

70
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,490
then you go in the market and they know

71
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,910
what is the intrinsic value of that particular silver

72
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,910
and that's how they pay you.

73
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,450
But we don't have hallmarks.

74
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,700
Now in gold, same thing they do is to have 9 carat gold -

75
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,490
with a hallmark.

76
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,400
What is 9 carat gold? Is not gold at all,

77
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,200
but they'll have a hallmark for that.

78
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,410
And that will be very expensive because you see

79
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,490
they don't have much gold so they put a hallmark

80
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,070
and make it expensive.

81
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:54,400
The whole economy is that stupidly built towards materialism.

82
00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:00,030
That matter is not for enjoyment but for selling off.

83
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,490
So they do not enjoy anything whatsoever in their lives.

84
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,530
Nowadays I don't know if plastic can be resold or not,

85
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,320
but I have seen people who are even particular about the plastic,

86
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,910
about stainless steel, about anything that they have.

87
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,490
May not be resold but now the, psychologically

88
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,400
they are built in such a manner

89
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,200
that they want to even preserve,

90
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,200
if there's a plastic thing, even there's a thread,

91
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,200
anything, a pin, they would like to preserve it, you see?

92
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,360
Nothing like throwing out anything.

93
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:46,400
All these things will lead us

94
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:52,570
into unhappiness, frustration and stupidity.

95
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,660
So now they form an anti-culture.

96
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,820
What is an anti-culture? Is nothing

97
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:05,240
but is another form of materialism, which is ugliness.

98
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,490
Like you paint your hair, you become something anti-culture.

99
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,450
If you wear holey pants, then you are anti-culture.

100
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,400
If you wear dirty clothes, then you are anti-culture.

101
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,320
But also these are sellable.

102
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,400
There are markets and markets where you can get

103
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:32,200
all dirty clothes, "stone washed" clothes.

104
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,570
All these fashions are coming

105
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,990
from the two sides or two faces

106
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,700
of materialistic attitude of human beings.

107
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,860
And they're unashamed sometimes the way they ask for a few things.

108
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,700
Supposing you know somebody has forgotten a spoon with someone;

109
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,820
so they'll telephone three times, "have you got my spoon with you?

110
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,530
Have you got my spoon?"

111
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,400
Unashamed, there's no culture about it.

112
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,030
While - I don't know - might have been better before -

113
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,400
that what I know about India,

114
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,860
that even now, in a good family, it is always said

115
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,400
that "if somebody's pen is with you, be careful and return it back,

116
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:24,360
but even if your gold is with someone, don't ask,

117
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,780
it's not done, it's not cultured, it's not sophistication."

118
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,030
But the whole sophistication has become materialistic,

119
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,700
it's maddening, and that maddens the Western mind.

120
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:43,110
For example, if you have to serve, say wines and things,

121
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,200
you have to have different type of cups,

122
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,200
different types of plates, different type of spoons.

123
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,490
You've got spoons for avocado,

124
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,570
you've got spoons for different things -

125
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,030
I mean, you go on like mad, and if that is not with you,

126
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,360
then they'll laugh at you.

127
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,110
If they'll come to your house, - "O God!

128
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,530
They served us avocado with ice-cream spoons!"

129
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,360
That's the greatest sin one can commit.

130
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:18,400
So the whole idea of sin becomes so materialistic and nonsensical.

131
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,280
So the resurrection cannot take place

132
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:25,160
when the matter is so dead and gone.

133
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,660
Then this matter enters into the brain.

134
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,400
When it enters into the brain it rots there.

135
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:39,530
Then you start discussing about, say, banking

136
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,780
or about how to economize this.

137
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,610
I mean the mantra is in London, as I say,

138
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,660
must be everywhere "save pounds".

139
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,530
As soon as you go to the airport, there is big mantra written

140
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:02,110
"Save pounds by hiring a taxi at Heathrow".

141
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:07,910
Just imagine - they are not even aware of what they are doing.

142
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:13,990
All the time save pounds, save money, save this, save ... for what?

143
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,860
Because they are so frustrated,

144
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:22,200
the whole material stuff is so frustrating

145
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:28,280
that they have to save money to get over that frustration.

146
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:37,530
And the frustration is counterbalanced

147
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:44,400
by drugs or by

148
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,950
drinking wines and all kinds of nonsensical things,

149
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,570
and also rotten cheese

150
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,450
or some sort of a thing that is absolutely a dead matter,

151
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,450
useless thing which makes you dead and sleepy,

152
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,700
so that you run away from reality,

153
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,740
because you are so frustrated that you want to have something

154
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,280
that will counteract it.

155
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,860
Then with that also, when they find, it's not done,

156
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,400
still they are extremely annoyed.

157
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,910
So what to do next?

158
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,910
If you are that unhappy you have to find out something else.

159
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,400
As I tell a story about children

160
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,570
who were naughty and the mother was going out,

161
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,410
so she told that "See, you are naughty children,

162
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,400
so I lock you up in the kitchen"

163
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,490
because anywhere else they can break something, spoil something

164
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,490
and she cannot sell them again, perhaps.

165
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,410
So, she puts them

166
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,200
in the kitchen thinking, "What can they ruin there?"

167
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,910
So when she came back, they said, "We ate all your tea leaves!"

168
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,950
Like that, when they get so frustrated,

169
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,030
they don't know what to do, so they put nails into their ears,

170
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,240
pins into their cheeks, something into their nose

171
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,110
- they don't know what to do with themselves, you see -

172
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,400
so they'll pull out their moustaches or they'll paint their hair,

173
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,780
or do all kinds of funny nonsensical things,

174
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,400
absolutely frustrated people!

175
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,450
But the worst part,

176
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,160
which cannot be understood is, that so confident about it!

177
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,860
They don't do it with any diffidence, it's complete confidence.

178
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,780
Their attention is all over to see "Now, how we should be?",

179
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,240
now if they see a tree which has leaves

180
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,200
which have become absolutely sort of crumpled down

181
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,200
because of malnourishment, so they want to be like that.

182
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,280
They want to become people who have malnourishment.

183
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,990
So they look like miserable people.

184
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,400
Their cheeks are inside, noses outside - sort of thing goes on -

185
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:14,660
and if you see them, they look like sickly people.

186
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,240
That's the sign of finding out

187
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,400
some way of expression of their frustration.

188
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:33,280
But Christ paved the way - the other way round.

189
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:38,400
He said, "Put chaitanya into your matter",

190
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,700
so you'll enjoy that chaitanya.

191
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:50,400
Put chaitanya, the vibrations, into the matter.

192
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,490
This is His message.

193
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,950
He didn't get resurrected only like His spirit going out,

194
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,200
but the whole His body resurrected Himself.

195
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:08,490
So He's talking about

196
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,570
the resurrection of the body, of the matter, within us.

197
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,280
In Sahaja Yoga also when we come in, kundalini rises,

198
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:26,700
She gives you realization, you do feel the chaitanya

199
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,740
in your hands, you feel it all around,

200
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,110
your faces shine like beautiful lotuses,

201
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:40,200
your skin improves, you look blooming, everything is fine,

202
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,910
but still there are material attachments,

203
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,570
which may be very subtle, could be very gross.

204
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:56,610
The gross could be like

205
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,700
"This is my carpet, this is my car,

206
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:09,400
this is my ornament" - something like that.

207
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,530
But if it comes to

208
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,860
the style of Christ,

209
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,490
you have to get identified with the matter which is vibrated,

210
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:30,360
which is vibrating,

211
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,570
which has got vibrating value -

212
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,740
not material value but vibrating value,

213
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,740
spiritual value, divine value.

214
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,860
Could be anything - could be flowers, could be water,

215
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,030
could be a sari, could be a seat, could be anything

216
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,070
that becomes valuable.

217
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:07,780
So attention starts shifting from gross to vibrations.

218
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:14,990
But, even now if you have the lurking

219
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,780
attention into material things,

220
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:27,700
then it's difficult for you to rise fast.

221
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:33,240
Everything that you use,

222
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,570
is it helpful for your vibrations or not?

223
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:43,700
Everything that you do, is it good for your vibrations or not?

224
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,400
Or is it the same old fashion you are carrying?

225
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:53,570
Like the mad people I saw yesterday - they had come for holiday

226
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:58,410
and they didn't know how to enjoy,

227
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,400
they were trying everything, you see.

228
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:05,200
They must have paid lots of money to their tourism,

229
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,070
poor things, they must have paid lots of money in the hotels,

230
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,530
they must have paid lots of money in the restaurant,

231
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,280
but I felt they were not enjoying at all,

232
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,700
none of them were enjoying - they were miserable

233
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,660
and they didn't know what to do.

234
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,780
And at the end of it I was thinking, that they might just go

235
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:29,360
and break their heads with frustration.

236
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,110
So matter can never give you joy.

237
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,320
Only the matter that is vibrated,

238
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,990
that has vibrations, can give you joy.

239
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,530
A human being can never give you joy,

240
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,200
may be your wife, may be your children,

241
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,400
may be your father, mother or anyone,

242
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:54,400
unless and until that person is, has got vibrations,

243
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:58,200
because joy is the blessings of God.

244
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,200
And unless and until you have connected with God,

245
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,400
whatever you may try, whatever you may acquire,

246
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,990
you can never have that joy.

247
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,950
You may have that artificial confidence,

248
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,910
because a person who is frustrated has to say

249
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,820
- show outside that - "Oh no, I'm not frustrated. I am very happy."

250
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:24,360
It's like to be tense and say, "I'm very relaxed" - it's like that.

251
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:30,360
So, they may just, for keeping up the images,

252
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,280
might say that "We are very confident",

253
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:37,400
but they're very diffident people. They are weak.

254
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:43,450
So it could be your children, it could be anyone, any human being.

255
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,490
Maybe you might think too much of that person,

256
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,660
you may be very much identified with that person,

257
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,200
you may think that this is the greatest thing,

258
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,110
greatest person you have ever met, it cannot give you joy.

259
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,660
But an ordinary person, a laborer,

260
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:04,860
maybe a beggar, maybe somebody, a Sadhu,

261
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,860
sitting alone in the forest,

262
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,610
will be such a joy-giving personality.

263
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:17,610
He may speak, may not speak, will be such a precious,

264
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,950
valuable thing for you,

265
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,400
than a person who is rich, well placed, highly adored.

266
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:32,070
That's where Christianity has failed, coveting with the kings.

267
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:37,530
Now this Mr. Pope here, my husband went and saw him

268
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,860
and the Pope was very nice to him because he is, comes from a,

269
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:46,910
he's a big man in the material world. He won't see Me!

270
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,400
Or I may not see him!

271
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:10,490
So the whole value system, the whole value system has to change,

272
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,030
and that value system is

273
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,780
that you care for nothing else but for your spirit.

274
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,320
Nothing matters but the spirit.

275
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:28,400
The spirit gives you the comfort of a palace.

276
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:34,700
It gives you the bliss of all the protection.

277
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:43,280
It gives you the joy of all the relationships of the world.

278
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:50,400
Then why should you care for something which is no good?

279
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,320
You can see it so clearly.

280
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:58,410
If you have your vision clear, you can see it so much around you,

281
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:09,240
that these people look so unhappy, so miserable,

282
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,570
running after this, running after that.

283
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,400
Now first they were hippies, then they became punks,

284
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:21,200
now they're becoming well-dressed gentlemen.

285
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,320
Everything is from this to that, to that to this,

286
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:28,240
leading them nowhere whatsoever.

287
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:33,160
So clearly you see that you are away from them.

288
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,240
You are in a different realm and you see them.

289
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:42,910
So don't go near them.

290
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:48,660
Try to show that

291
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,070
beauty in you, so that they come to you

292
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,320
and see for yourself, see for themselves,

293
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:01,400
that you are resurrected people, you are resurrected.

294
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,860
Spirit is always there in your heart,

295
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:10,740
always there, watching you, seeing you,

296
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,200
but now because the matter that surrounds the spirit

297
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,860
is being resurrected, is being vibrated,

298
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,400
your eyes shine, your skin shines,

299
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:33,200
your face shines, you look so beautiful -

300
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,610
that is what is resurrection.

301
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:41,740
In Sahaja Yoga, there's no place for stupid seriousness.

302
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,410
What are you serious about?

303
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:47,400
"Oh, I have to sell my diamond and you know

304
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:53,410
they said there's a little black in it."  So what? Wear it!

305
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:02,700
All this seriousness comes from the dead matter in your head,

306
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:08,490
and you know on the dead grows the fungus,

307
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:14,450
and also you know that this fungus gives you all kinds of diseases.

308
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,110
So keep away from all that is dead.

309
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,200
Only the chaitanya makes

310
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,410
the matter vibrate,

311
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,990
and unless and until you are connected with God,

312
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,780
you cannot vibrate anything.

313
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:43,030
Those great saints, prophets, incarnations who came on this earth

314
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,240
tried to tell this to all of us, that "get connected with God".

315
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:54,110
Everybody said the same thing.

316
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,400
Of course I have done the job Myself!

317
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,070
That's good, they're appreciating it.

318
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:09,160
And you have to just think about it that

319
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:14,360
this connection should not be loose, it should not be disturbed,

320
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:20,070
it should not be doubting. Fix it up properly.

321
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:25,070
Then you will never lose it for anything whatsoever like

322
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,860
"My wife is like this, my husband is like this,

323
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,700
my brother is like this".

324
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:36,660
These are the signs of very weak personalities.

325
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,570
If you are a strong personality,

326
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,700
with those vibrations if you are strong,

327
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:46,610
then you make the other person also stronger

328
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,610
and bring the other person into Sahaja Yoga

329
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,240
and give him the nectar of life.

330
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:56,610
So today is the message that we have to resurrect

331
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:02,700
our matter, within and without.

332
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,820
So you are raising your kundalini upward, is all right.

333
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:11,660
Also you have to spread it - horizontally -

334
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,700
to your hands, to your feet,

335
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:20,530
to your body, to your face, to your thought, to everything.

336
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:26,700
What is a mantra is nothing but a thought which is vibrated.

337
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,030
Any thought that is vibrated is a mantra,

338
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:37,030
but the vibrations can only be carried by a particular type of,

339
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,490
or we can say a particular coefficience is needed.

340
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:52,160
In dress, in thinking,

341
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,610
in anything that is worldly,

342
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,070
there is a kind of a coefficience that works out the vibrations.

343
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,280
If that coefficience is not there, you cannot catch the vibrations

344
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:11,530
and you cannot also give vibrations.

345
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,660
So there are only two divergences,

346
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:17,280
one is the left, another is the right; there are not too many:

347
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,410
very easy to get rid of them.

348
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:26,320
There are only two turns in Italy, one is right or left.

349
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,400
So in the same way within us

350
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,030
if you don't go to the left and you don't go to the right,

351
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,950
you keep in the center,

352
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:42,110
you are vibrated! You can vibrate everything!

353
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,740
But to keep in the center, not to go to any extremes.

354
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,860
Even in Sahaja Yoga there are people like mad,

355
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,490
they meditate for twelve hours.

356
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,990
What is there to meditate for twelve hours?

357
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,700
I mean you are already in meditation.

358
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:01,950
Or else they will make a picnic out of Sahaja Yoga.

359
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,030
One extreme to that.

360
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:11,160
What is needed is to think that,

361
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:17,530
"I am the spirit and I am connected with God.

362
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:23,400
How much am I connected? How much I am sucking in?

363
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:27,700
How much I am getting to it?"

364
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,360
That's all.

365
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,530
You don't have to do too much about it.

366
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,200
Those days are gone when people used to break their heads,

367
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,360
stand on their heads or go to Himalayas.

368
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,160
But peculiarities in temperament

369
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,200
is not a sign of a good Sahaja Yogi.

370
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,110
All the peculiarities come from the matter.

371
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,280
So a peculiar person in Sahaja Yoga,

372
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:59,400
maybe he might be bhootish or he might be egoistical.

373
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,280
One of the two things in a peculiar person.

374
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,910
There are no peculiarities in a sahaja yogi.

375
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,660
There are individualities, but not peculiarities.

376
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:13,110
Means everybody will have the nose that he had, it won't change,

377
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,070
he'll have the eyes which he had,

378
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,780
but there will be a light in the eye.

379
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:21,200
In the same way we can see about our clothes -

380
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,700
we start wearing sober clothes,

381
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:27,240
but not pale clothes or dirty clothes:

382
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:30,200
we wear colorful things because we are colorful.

383
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,320
At Sahasrara there are seven colors.

384
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,860
Today I wore this color,

385
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,280
because this is the color of spring in India,

386
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,320
because all the flowers are yellow

387
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,660
and there is also mustard which is yellow

388
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:47,110
and this is called as a color of the spring.

389
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:53,200
In Indian culture, you see, there's a day on this

390
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:59,070
that they wear this particular color to celebrate the spring,

391
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,160
because we're very sort of connected with the nature.

392
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,200
So today we have received a very nice message

393
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,990
from New York as if they have dreamt that I'm going to wear

394
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,450
a color of the spring,

395
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,610
so I wish somebody could read it out to you

396
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,200
what they have said, and you will be surprised how it tallies,

397
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,400
how it tallies with what I'm wearing today -

398
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,700
and as soon as I wore this sari

399
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,660
the thing became hot and I knew this would be.

400
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:37,910
That is the moment it became hot and I'm sorry for that,

401
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,490
because you are finding it rather too much.

402
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,990
So, today is a day to celebrate the spring

403
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,610
and as you know I was born in spring

404
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:54,530
and that Christ was resurrected in spring.

405
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:59,490
So the spring starts after the resurrection of Christ.

406
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,320
In the same way we are now in the spring mood,

407
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:06,780
to enjoy, to be happy,

408
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:11,280
to be just blissful.

409
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:17,570
But not to be frivolous, not to be vulgar, not to be childish.

410
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,490
That's the way a Sahaja Yogi should be!

411
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:28,780
And I'm very happy that at this spontaneous arrangement of Mine

412
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:32,410
to come to Rome, so many of you have come.

413
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,490
It shows how much you love Me and I can't express really

414
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,820
what I feel about the whole thing,

415
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:43,400
except for tears coming to My eyes.

416
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,820
For whatever Christ has sacrificed His life,

417
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:52,660
which was a terrible thing to happen, that He sacrificed His life,

418
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,910
He suffered so much,

419
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:58,610
but the outcome of that is you - all of you here -

420
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,570
who are resurrected today and your Agnyas are cleared,

421
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,860
and everything is so very fine.

422
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:11,240
May God bless you!
