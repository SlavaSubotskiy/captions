1
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:21,179
It is such a honor for all of us to pay this
homage to the great poet, printer and a prophet

2
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:34,340
that was William Blake.
When I first came to England, they have been

3
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:43,320
telling Me that England is a place of scholarship
and you can see lots of museums and exhibitions

4
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:55,810
and suddenly I told the Sahaja yogis that
I would like to go and see Tate Gallery for

5
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:05,790
William Blake's paintings. They were surprised
because I seldom go to any one of them, specially

6
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:13,450
the libraries and the books. And when I went
there, I saw this great poet, this great personality,

7
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:33,180
pouring out His heart with such concern, with
such honesty, with such understanding and

8
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:40,930
perception of the Divine to the people of
England, to understand the great powers of

9
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:51,710
Divinity. But to My surprise there were some
funny people; they had brought some magnifying

10
00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:01,509
glasses and they were looking at the drawings
and were watching the private parts of people.

11
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:09,390
I said, " Look at these wretched, absolutely
baser people, who cannot see the sublime,

12
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:17,970
the highest, which He wanted to paint," and
they were taking photographs.

13
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:26,349
I was surprised the way people reacted and
then I realized how tormented He must have

14
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:36,180
been in His lifetime to live with such people,
who have no sense of Divine. He must have

15
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:45,219
cried in the wilderness; He must have wept;
He could not have been accepted, it's impossible.

16
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:52,340
Such low level minds cannot accept something
that's sublime and great and My heart bled

17
00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:00,010
with pain. Oh God! Why did He take His birth
in a place like this? To torment Himself,

18
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:11,230
to torture Himself, saying something which
cannot be accepted. But it's not so. I knew

19
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:22,230
who He was, what He is doing, why He was here.
We do not know about Him much, because from

20
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:31,599
the books you can't understand who He could
have been.

21
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:38,599
He was an Incarnation., of Bhairavanath. That's
whom you call the St. Michael, or St. George,

22
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:49,989
who is as you know the Saint - Angel of England.
That's why He had to incarnate and for Him,

23
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:03,739
this was His role, to talk about Divine in
a open, fearless manner. He had to use symbolic

24
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:17,749
language, He had to use. It's not difficult
to understand Him at all; if you are a realized

25
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:29,109
soul, you'll read through it, sometimes laughing,
sometimes weeping, enjoying the whole drama,

26
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:37,319
what He has tried to explain. When I read
Him I am amazed at His sense of humor; how

27
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:46,319
He openly comes out with such remarks. I feel
He is like Markandeya in India, or Kabir Dass

28
00:04:53,580 --> 00:05:00,580
in India, who slashed the whole society with
their sword all the time to see that they

29
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:08,539
are brought to the proper shape, without fear.
But so gentle, if you read the Song of the

30
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:20,639
Thel, it's so gentle; and all of them who
were Him perhaps or of the same style, extremely

31
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:34,830
open, straightforward, you can say even blatant
and extremely gentle.

32
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:47,900
The vision of Christ, that He has described,
is the one which He sees through His own enlightened

33
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:56,770
eyes and He sees that the vision is completely
distorted, is the opposite of what Christ

34
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:08,969
was. I also felt the same way. I took My birth
in a Protestant, Christian family and I was

35
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:16,259
shocked the way the Christians were. I said
" Are these the Christians?" Now the point

36
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:23,259
He brings forth is very clear cut, you can
understand, that in the mannerism if you are

37
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:30,669
gentle, " I'm sorry" , "I'm afraid" , " I
doubt." Just look at that. It's very commonly

38
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:38,629
we use this language. He says that Christ
was not a gentleman of that kind. I also say

39
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:48,139
I'm not seeking election, I'm not here to
please you, but I am here to make you please

40
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:57,830
yourself; to enjoy yourself, to have your
all wealth, enjoyed, manifested.

41
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:09,939
That is how He also put the vision of Christ
before you, that He was not a gentle man,

42
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,400
who would go around and be extremely gentle
to people and nice to them, superficially,

43
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:26,819
only the mannerism of it, but He would be
so gentle with the people who are lowly. He

44
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:38,689
created Divinity out of fishermen, who were
ordinary people, uneducated, absolutely we

45
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:45,689
can say, people who were one of the lowest
in the strata of society. He picked them up

46
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:53,479
and made them Divine. He didn't go to the
ministers and the prime ministers and the

47
00:07:53,479 --> 00:08:00,479
governors. He did not. When you see all the
great people who are supposed to be looking

48
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,610
after the religion part of it, they are busy
only with governors and they are only busy

49
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:19,610
with the kings and the queens; who must go
and bow to them. They are politically activated

50
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:20,569
people.

51
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:27,430
How can a Divine person get into this mess
of politics which human beings have created?

52
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:32,039
But we don't understand it, because we try
to rationalize everything and thank God He's

53
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:38,860
the one who talked against rationality; and
against all the intellectual ideas of putting

54
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:45,860
down Christ to the mere level of a human being,
because He was Himself Divine and He could

55
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:53,140
understand Christ. He was so much pestered
and actually persecuted that He used to get

56
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:03,050
depression sometimes and He had problems of
money, problems of convincing His brother

57
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:12,540
and sister, everybody trying to make Him feel
uneasy. Such a fine soul came on this earth

58
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:24,730
to talk of Jerusalem. What did He mean by
Jerusalem? What is Jerusalem? We go to Jerusalem

59
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:34,170
for pilgrimage. Why? Because Christ was born
there. England will become Jerusalem when

60
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Christ will be born here. But how many of
English people today care for the spirit?

61
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:48,310
English language itself is such a funny one,
that we use the word spirit for drinking,

62
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:55,310
the spirit that you call alcohol; spirit for
the dead souls, which hang around, many more

63
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:04,779
here, and spirit for the atma, the spirit.

64
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:14,339
When He came on this earth, the industrial
revolution had not taken its respite. People

65
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:22,029
were still entering into those 'mills' as
he calls them and He saw the scribes how they

66
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:28,860
were behaving and He saw the whole myth of
religion. He does not know that all the religions

67
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:35,399
were doing the same nonsense everywhere, not
only Christianity. You go to any other country

68
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:42,040
and see every religion is the same style of
a nonsense, which is opposite of what the

69
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:49,040
prophets told them, of what the incarnations
told them, of what all the great sages told

70
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:56,500
them. This is not only about Christianity,
but still nobody can forgive it, because Christianity

71
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:05,410
has a special fervor, has a special role,
has a special meaning, that's what He's tried

72
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,680
to also say, that Moses came on this earth
to lay down the code of conduct, morality,

73
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:21,680
the moral thing, and also He describes Milton
as a person who describes a Deity who is above

74
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:31,139
everything, a puritanical Deity. But He describes
the Divine humanity. Also He describes the

75
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:41,639
Christ who came on this earth for the emancipation
of human beings; not to tell them, "Don't

76
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,660
do this and don't do that." That was all right
at the time of Moses in the beginning of it,

77
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:53,660
the code of it, and He calls it a 'moral'
Christianity, meaning 'immoral' must be, because

78
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:01,040
if you force someone, into something and pass
such laws and regulations at this time, modern

79
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,329
times, it's going to be impossible for human
beings to follow and they'll fall into some

80
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:07,500
other traps.

81
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Strict rules of anything, imposed on people
who are not realized souls, can push them

82
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,839
into some sort of problems, they can become
criminals, they can become violent as a reaction

83
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:28,839
and we see the reaction today acting, that
the hypocrisy of the whole thing is exposed.

84
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,430
Like in India or anywhere else, they will
say, "You should not be attached to money,

85
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:38,009
give the money to the church, to the temple,
to the mosque, to all the people to enjoy

86
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:45,009
it." The kind of life people led in those
days in the name of God, was no model for

87
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:56,339
anyone and that's how poets like Him were
born again and again. I would say that in

88
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:02,250
Lebanon a great poet, like Kahlil Gibran,
was born, and then in India we had so many

89
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:09,250
such poets, who just lashed the society and
lashed all these ideas of the intellectuals,

90
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:17,300
the ideas of the religions, the ones who were
trying to curb them. Because there was no

91
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:23,600
genuineness, there was no sincerity. If we
are honest people, we really mean it, then

92
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:30,600
let us face it and see for ourselves what
we have to achieve.

93
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:37,550
So that is how He came as a poet, a remarkable
poet, the way He rhymes it and the sense of

94
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:44,550
humor He has and the way He unfolds the beauty
of words as any poet should do. In Sanskrit

95
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:54,040
it is said, vakyam rasatmakam kavyam - poetry
is full of rasats; rasats means the essences,

96
00:13:56,829 --> 00:14:03,829
the explosion of essences through words. If
it could be done, then the magic of it is

97
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,819
called as poetry and that's what you find
in Blake. Such a great poet; poetry is only

98
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:18,740
great when it talks of the Divine and when
it talks of the baser things, takes you to

99
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:25,740
the baser things. The other day I heard one
Australian poet and I was amazed at his bathroom

100
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:32,889
singing, it was horrible; how can you call
it a poetry which sings of baser things of

101
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:39,060
life, which takes you to the baser things
and pleasures? But He has very clearly, if

102
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:45,579
you can understand Him, has said, "What are
these books for? This is to collect money

103
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:52,579
out of them." Now how do you collect money?
By playing on the weaknesses of the people,

104
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,850
pampering their ego, pampering their greed.

105
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,959
All these things, if you can do, you can very
nicely befool them and they feel very happy

106
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:09,199
and nice, that oh what a book it is. As we
have had great writers also in this country.

107
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:14,769
I would say Shakespeare was a great evolved
soul, but the deterioration you see later

108
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:20,319
on, like people like Hemingway and all those
coming up. I don't know how, after Somerset

109
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,529
Maugham and all that, suddenly these horrible
Hemingway people coming up and people buying

110
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:31,529
their books like hot cakes. We've lost all
our moorings, we have lost all our roots,

111
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:38,629
but one thing good has happened out of this,
leading the way of Freud, making him Christ;

112
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:46,899
all that has led to problems and people now
realize, now realize, that's why the prophecy

113
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:55,519
was there, that's why He was a Prophet. He
warned people of what is going to happen,

114
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:01,589
but who is bothered? He was treated as an
insane personality. If you go to the lunatic

115
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:08,589
asylum, everybody will think you are insane,
that's the way lunatics look at a sane personality.

116
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:17,529
His wisdom was condemned. People thought that
He is getting all these hallucinations, He's

117
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:25,620
talking out of His hat, because they have
no brains to understand, they have no enlightenment,

118
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,180
they have no perception, that's why they treated
Him that way.

119
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,980
Now He is dead, of course they're selling
His books, making big money; selling His plates,

120
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:41,980
what He painted, but when He lived, nobody
bothered. And now they can use Him the way

121
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:50,540
they like. I've met some very funny people
here, in this respect, the way they have shown

122
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:57,180
great interest in Blake in saying that, "He
says that a naked woman is the best." I said,

123
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:03,259
"Where? How could He say such a thing? He
was innocent." Now we do not understand what

124
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:10,259
His is innocence also. Just like Markandeya
describing His mother, her breast and everything,

125
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:17,410
like a little child. A child doesn't see,
sex in a naked body, he does not see. And

126
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:26,000
the beauty of a woman He describes. That means
all women are walking nude, everywhere, now.

127
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,780
Are you exciting the innocence of people,
or are you exciting the baser self of the

128
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:38,420
people? We have to be natural, are you natural?

129
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:45,420
All these perversions and all these diversifications
has come because man does not have a simple

130
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:54,560
mind, he's a crooked person. This 'crookery'
has to go from the mind. That is important;

131
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:01,560
but if I say that , I'm not doing My job here,
I know that. I know for definite that is not

132
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:09,930
the way it is going to work out. That's why
Christ, the One who said, "Forgive, forgive

133
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:18,530
them." Otherwise how can God meet man, with
this 'crookery', with all this kind of cunning,

134
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:27,700
how can God reach man without forgiveness?
He cannot reach man if he listens to Moses,

135
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:34,890
can He? He cannot. If He has to come to human
beings, He has to forgive and that's what

136
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:43,560
is in Sahaja Yoga in the beginning. We tell,
you must forgive everyone, you forgive yourself,

137
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:50,160
don't feel guilty. Now in Christianity just
the opposite has been done, let us face it

138
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,500
and know for yourself that you have to go
and confess to the priest. The priest also

139
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:02,430
gets mad with your confession, you are already
mad. What is there to confess in the ocean

140
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,570
of forgiveness? It just dissolves.

141
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:10,680
What a message Christ gave us that the greatest
weapon we have got is to forgive others and

142
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:17,680
forgive ourselves because God forgives us
and this is the message we have to know, that

143
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:23,900
we have to forgive ourselves. Instead of that,
for all that we do wrong, all that we try

144
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:30,900
to do against our spirit, we feel guilty and
moreover if the teachings are such, that "you

145
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,100
better feel guilty", all the time what we
are doing is to feel guilty and catch on this

146
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:44,100
chakra on the Left Vishuddhi, to such an extent,
that in the West wherever I go I tell them,

147
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:52,200
first of all, you just say one mantra, "Mother,
I am not guilty." Take it out of you, who

148
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,930
are you to feel guilty? When God loves you
so much, He has made you the epitome of evolution,

149
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:08,930
you are at the highest point, why should you
judge yourself and feel guilty? Is He not

150
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:17,500
capable of forgiving you? Have you no faith
in His ocean of love? But this is the basics

151
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:28,020
of the mistakes that are committed in the
name of Christ. I'm telling to the priests,

152
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:34,380
now who is a priest here, coming from theological
college, can you learn about Divinity in the

153
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,860
theological college? Did Christ go to any
theological college? How did He get it, how

154
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:46,570
did He get the knowledge - through enlightenment,
enlightenment has to be there. The way He

155
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:53,430
has clearly stated everything, nobody liked
it, because of vested interest. Everybody

156
00:20:53,430 --> 00:21:00,190
has vested interest. Nobody is sincere, honest,
and they want to exploit others to make money.

157
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:07,190
You cannot make money in the name of God.
Is sin. Such people can never enter into the

158
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,830
kingdom of God. That's why Christ has said,
"You'll be calling Me, Christ, Christ, I won't

159
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,990
recognize you." That's a fact.

160
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:23,990
So if you have to be a truthful person, just
a truthful person, do not feel guilty about

161
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:30,720
it. Do not feel you have committed sin. There's
a little story in India that one missionary

162
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,510
came to a village in India. Indian people
are in the villages very simple, you know,

163
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:42,510
they are not so sophisticated. So when he
was going, they praised him a lot, "Sir, we

164
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:48,340
are thankful to you that you have told us
what is sin and that we are sinners." They

165
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:55,340
didn't know they were sinning. And this is
one of the things that Blake brought forth

166
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:05,130
for us to show that Christ was a person who
brought a new message over Moses. Of course

167
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:10,630
Moses was needed at the time when Jews had
to come up, that was the time they needed

168
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:15,700
it and He brought these shariat laws; it was
Moses who started but Muslims are following

169
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:22,700
them. Now when today we are in this twentieth
century, sitting down here, we have to see

170
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:34,660
what is the prophecy of this great man, William
Blake. Can you imagine, His birthday was in

171
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:41,430
this month, Guru Nanaka's birthday in this
month, Mohammed Sahib's birthday on this month,

172
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:48,430
all these great people were born on this month.
Now, this month also we celebrated the Diwali.

173
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:03,150
Such a great month is this one and in this
month those who are born have to be great

174
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:11,450
people.

175
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:18,450
In the whole understanding of Blake, I find
a single lonely man, plowing this land with

176
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:33,930
the seeds of wisdom. I'm here just to reap
it; He's the one who planted, watered, made

177
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:45,290
ready by Shakespeare, you can say; you have
had many great poets here, Wordsworth another

178
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:52,290
one who really is enchanting and beautiful.
I think Wordsworth must have seen the fate

179
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:59,120
of William Blake and he said better describe
the nature, forget about human beings; he

180
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:06,120
must have thought of it, thinking it to be
an incorrigible land where He cannot sow anything.

181
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:15,430
But whatever it is, what Blake has done is
to give you a new vision and a new idea, because

182
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:33,150
in the West, Christ has been shrunk to a position
of someone who was just a human being and

183
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:48,130
now, when you hear the way people describe
Him, I'm amazed. From where did they get this

184
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:55,870
vision? Have they got eyes or are they blind
to talk like this about Him? I hear the bishops

185
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:02,870
talking like that, all your archbishops talking
like that. Have they no fear of God? What's

186
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:09,460
going to happen to this country if you talk
about Christ like that? And you are going

187
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:16,460
to have now pictures and films showing Him
to be a unrighteous personality, showing His

188
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:23,790
Mother naked. No respect. Even Blake, I don't
know if you have noticed it, He paints human

189
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:33,760
beings naked all right, but not gods. Christ
He never painted, He never paints them that

190
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:42,140
way, the respect. While we, the great intellectuals
of modern times are trying all these tricks,

191
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,920
just to bring forth the wrath of God upon
ourselves.

192
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,340
The second point about Him was that He was
a printer. We should think why did He become

193
00:25:53,340 --> 00:26:00,340
a printer? Why Blake took to printing? He
has described Himself the hell where the books

194
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:06,480
were created and how He has described, how
at every chakra we created a devil and put

195
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,480
them in the libraries. I'm ... that's why
against the books very much, Myself. But why

196
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:20,220
did He become a printer? It's very important
to know and why He wrote so much about printing.

197
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:27,220
We see the media today. The media, that's
the devil He described. The media is the one

198
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:35,270
has ruined you completely believe Me - just
to make money out of you, playing upon your

199
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:42,270
weaknesses, making your children and you weaker
and weaker, the society completely being destroyed,

200
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:50,260
systematically. This is the media He wanted
to hit, that's why He took His birth and became

201
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:57,620
a printer. He could have been anything else.
No poet was a printer in England or anywhere

202
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:04,620
else. It was Blake, who became that. The reason
was He wanted to show that this media is the

203
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,250
one and let Him cut it at its root.

204
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:16,250
But as you know, evil grows, whether you like
it or not and today's media we cannot understand

205
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:23,490
to what extent it has destroyed us, our roots,
our faiths, all our sublime and righteous

206
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:34,630
visions. I know that I Myself was asked by
your television people and all that, to come

207
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:44,410
down and talk to them. But amazed at the way
the people told Me that an Anglo Saxon brain,

208
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:52,280
God knows who made that brain, cannot understand
anything that can be done without money. I

209
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,880
said you first get your realization, otherwise
I'm not coming to your programs, or to your

210
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,880
televisions. That's the triumphant pride of
Christ you can see in His crucifixion. He

211
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:14,510
didn't care, He could have gone fallen at
the feet, you see, as our politicians do,

212
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:18,990
morning 'til evening, moving from one place
to another. He would have gone to the scribes

213
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:25,310
and the Pharisees and said, "Oh, please forgive,
I will serve you all My life, I'll sell everything."

214
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:32,310
He would not accept that bribe. He went with
that triumphant pride on the cross. But what

215
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:44,510
does it show? What does it show? That we,
the stupid, crucified that great Personality

216
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:51,140
and today are we not again crucifying Him?

217
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:58,140
That's why I'll say that He was a great Prophet,
because He makes prophecies that, if you do

218
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:05,440
not take to the right path, if you do not
take to the higher seeking, all these things

219
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:14,450
will show. Now we have to understand, because
it concerns us. This is what is happening

220
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:21,250
to us, to us, to our children, to our families,
to our society, to our country. Let us face

221
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:28,250
it and understand that compassion of God can
fail in such horrible, blazing hearts, which

222
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:40,900
doesn't have any understanding of the spirit.
Sahaja Yoga came on this earth long time back,

223
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:03,920
much before I came on this earth, and today
it has come to England. We should say I came

224
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:11,010
here twelve years back. It took fourteen years
for Blake to write Jerusalem and I think after

225
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:21,260
fourteen years also if I could really feel
satisfied that I've been able to do some justice

226
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:28,260
to Him in this Jerusalem that He wanted to
build, I'll be very much grateful to you all.

227
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:37,120
But it's not so, it's a very disappointing
thing. People don't want to listen anything,

228
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:44,660
they want to listen to something that they
like, that you have to play on their weaknesses;

229
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:51,250
all the time tell them that whatever wrong
you are doing is a good thing; go ahead with

230
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:51,690
it.

231
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:58,690
Now the compassion and love of Christ can
work out miracles, no doubt. It can work out,

232
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:07,380
because He came for us. The whole universe
was created for us. It is for us to receive

233
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:14,490
all the blessings of the Divine. It is we
who are going to become the spirit. As He

234
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,940
said, "You are to be born again". But the
conditioning, of the subtle conditionings

235
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:24,940
of these ... surroundings and the atmosphere,
the history and all that, is so much embedded

236
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:36,550
in us, but we don't realize and are not aware,
that we have to look upward.

237
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:48,920
Blake's life was another crucifixion, I feel.
When I read Him, tears fall continuously sometimes.

238
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:05,070
What a Son of a great Father, who said Christ
was not bothered about His parents. He ran

239
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:14,630
away from the house at the age of twelve years.
That means all the boys are now running from

240
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:21,540
their houses at twelve years taking to drugs;
that's the best way we can pay homage to Him,

241
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:27,020
by running away from the houses taking to
drugs, because Christ ran away from the house

242
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:32,920
at the age of twelve years. And He said, "This
is My Father's business," that's what He writes,

243
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:38,950
"What do I care for the parents?" That does
not mean that you should not respect your

244
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:45,950
parents, but it means that, "I am at a higher
seeking, I have a higher seeking, I have to

245
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:53,970
move in another direction. You have lived
in this direction, whatever it is you have

246
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,880
balanced your life, but I have to ascend."

247
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:05,390
And this is the message He has tried to put
forward before you, very clearly. That is

248
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:12,390
so obvious, so clear cut. Wherever He's so
fiery, wherever He's so compassionate, wherever

249
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:20,300
He's so gentle, wherever He's so modest, the
inner line is one that, "Achieve your ascent;

250
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:28,930
achieve your higher being; become that." He
has prepared grounds for us here in England.

251
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:35,740
As I have told you many a times, England is
a very important part of the universe, which

252
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:42,740
I don't know how many Englishmen realize.
It is the heart of the universe; it is small,

253
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:50,420
but so important. But what do we get from
the heart? What do we have in the heart? Racialism.

254
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:59,270
If Christ comes here, you'll throw Him out
because He's not English, or do you believe

255
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:05,840
that He was English?

256
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:12,840
What do we get ? We can't love our children,
we kill our children, we ill-treat them. You

257
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:19,290
are sitting in the heart of the universe.
This is the heart of the universe and what

258
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:26,290
do you have to give to the world? The spirit.
The spirit resides in your heart and that's

259
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,960
why Blake said that England has to become
Jerusalem, because it is the heart. That means

260
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:45,519
spirit has to come in the attention of the
universe, otherwise things won't work out,

261
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:54,059
but from where is it going to come, this spirit,
where is going to be awakened? It is going

262
00:34:57,049 --> 00:35:04,049
to be awakened in the human beings, and where
are those human beings - in the heart? Where

263
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:10,400
are they living? Even those who have come
here, immigrants and all that, they are gone

264
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,650
cases, useless, good for nothing. And those
who are living here are already lethargic;

265
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:22,650
the heart is lethargic, it cannot pump anything
out of it. First it was over pumping, tried

266
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:31,579
to impress the whole world, and now after
the impression, it is in depression.

267
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:39,759
This heart has to awaken, to make the whole
world a spiritual being. Do we realize our

268
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:49,640
responsibility? Do we understand this - what
is the role we have to play as a spiritual

269
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:56,640
being? You have to play a role as a spiritual
being now; but we are not, we are busy with

270
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:04,910
all other nonsensical things, but with the
spirit. I have labored for twelve years, as

271
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:12,000
I said, and I think I'll have to stay here
for two years more, fourteen years, and then

272
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,000
only maybe, I hope so, Jerusalem will start
showing its results in this country. You can

273
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:26,490
do it, you are the only ones who can do it,
nobody else. You are entitled to that. God

274
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:33,970
has chosen you to be born here, with a purpose.
But you can't talk to any one about religion,

275
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:41,349
they don't discuss religion. But what religion?
Religion which contains all the religions

276
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:48,319
of the world. Religion which is the inner
balance, the tranquility within you, which

277
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:54,089
gives you the ascent and we don't discuss
it. This is out of etiquette, we can discuss

278
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:59,349
all the drunkards and all the pubs of the
world, but we cannot discuss such a horrible

279
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:05,000
thing like religion, which is so innate and
within ourselves.

280
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,529
You cannot have anything in the newspaper
about it. But, He has described all the fake

281
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:17,849
gurus and all the satanic people with such
a strong description of all these and you

282
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:24,849
see them and thousands follow these nonsensical
people, pay them money, become beggars, but

283
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:33,130
they don't want to come to reality. Why, I
ask Myself, why it's happening like this?

284
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:42,890
No use going to any excuses. Here is someone
who has given you such a lot of explanation.

285
00:37:47,779 --> 00:37:54,779
Holy Ghost, He says, and Holy Ghost ... a
vacuum. You ask anyone, I was surprised, when

286
00:37:55,109 --> 00:38:02,109
it was asked to some very big bishop, "What
do you think of Holy Ghost?" He says, "I'm

287
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:10,779
agnostic, agnostic." Then ... from India ... asks
him, "Then what are you doing here?" He said,

288
00:38:10,779 --> 00:38:15,849
"I am doing my job, as you are doing your
job." [unknown name and word] it's all quiet.

289
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:20,710
He's agnostic, he doesn't know anything about
Holy Ghost.

290
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:27,660
What is Holy Ghost? William Blake has said,
"It resides within you." Why don't we find

291
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:33,319
out where does it reside? ... Why not we go
out of the way to find out? Bible cannot contain

292
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:37,809
Christ, the whole universe cannot contain
Christ. Let us go out and find out what others

293
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:43,589
have to say about it. But we are very insular
self-opinionated, great people sitting here

294
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:49,759
in complete lethargy. We have no time, we
don't think anybody to be considered about

295
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:56,759
it, let us go out and see. What is Holy Ghost
is very simple; Holy Ghost is the Kundalini.

296
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:06,289
See, you use logic, not rationality but logic,
is different. If you use your logic, you will

297
00:39:06,289 --> 00:39:13,289
see that we have a Trinity, Holy Trinity.
We have God Almighty, all right, and we have

298
00:39:14,029 --> 00:39:21,029
the Son and the Holy Ghost. Have you heard
of any father having a son without the mother?

299
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:30,759
Then who is the Holy Ghost is the Primordial
Mother. Automatically you come to that conclusion,

300
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:34,369
but Mother should not be mentioned.

301
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:41,369
That's why Blake has said about the daughters
of Albion, because He knew the way the women

302
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:49,170
were suppressed in this life. Very sophisticated
ways. In Sanskrit it is said, yatra narya

303
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:55,299
pujyante tatra ramente devata "Where the women
are worshipped, there remains the domain of

304
00:39:55,299 --> 00:40:01,569
the deities." Where they are worshipped, and
they have to be worshipful, not the harlots,

305
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:08,569
in the brothels and the women who walk nude
and show off their nudity to excite the baser

306
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:18,109
self, but the ones who are worshipful, where
they reside, reside the gods. So these women

307
00:40:20,539 --> 00:40:25,809
were suppressed and suppressed to such an
extent that they did not want to talk about

308
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:32,809
God as a Woman, anywhere. So Holy Ghost is
something abstract, a dove. All right, it's

309
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:41,029
a dove, then what. What does it do the dove?
Why is it so important that we should have

310
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,230
blessings from the dove? Nobody explains,
it's a mystery.

311
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:51,380
We have to live with a mystery; everything
is a mystery, the banking is a mystery here,

312
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:56,599
the where does the money go is also a mystery.
It has something to do with the mafia, that's

313
00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:01,589
also a mystery, then the Masonic people are
organizing the Switzerland bank is also a

314
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:07,400
mystery. Everything mysterious and hidden
and kept aside, "Oh, that is not to be said,

315
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:14,400
this is just 'overseas banking' Oh good, very
good name." It's 'overseas banking', it is

316
00:41:15,259 --> 00:41:21,069
this, it is that, and we carry on with this
hypocrisy, we carry on with all these false

317
00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:25,849
notions, "Oh that's all right, that's all
right, that part is all right." This is not

318
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:32,849
forgiveness. What is the forgiveness for the
cunning? What is the forgiveness for the crooked?

319
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:42,749
What is the forgiveness for satan? Discrimination
is needed when we talk of forgiveness. Forgiveness

320
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:54,059
is for the people who think they have committed
sins. It's only in thinking you commit sins,

321
00:41:54,630 --> 00:42:01,549
otherwise you do not. Look at a dog, look
at a tiger, look at all these people, if tiger

322
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:06,180
has to eat the cow, it eats; does it commit
any sin? It does not know about a sin. "Now

323
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:12,249
I didn't know what is sin is," he will say
that, "I didn't know it was a sin, you see

324
00:42:12,249 --> 00:42:18,809
I just ate it, but what is the sin?"

325
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:25,809
Just to condemn someone all the time, "You
are the sinners, you did this sin, you did

326
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:32,910
that sin." Human beings, they are the temple
of God. With what care, with love, affection,

327
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:43,710
delicacy they are created. For what? This
lotus has been brought out of the mire of

328
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:54,680
illusion for what? To be condemned? To be
trampled? To be ill-treated in this way, that

329
00:42:56,829 --> 00:43:03,829
too in the name of God? Lotuses are created
to be offered to the Gods, with their fragrance,

330
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:16,230
to illuminate the whole world. They are the
poetic genius of the Lord, as He has described.

331
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:26,619
While we look at human beings as something
to be exploited, to be suppressed, to be oppressed

332
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:39,950
and so, as He says, there are two types of
people, and He has given horrible names to

333
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:46,950
them, who try to oppress the people, who try
to devour the people and He calls that the

334
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:53,490
religion now has become the compromise between
the two.

335
00:43:53,490 --> 00:44:00,490
While the innocent suffer, while the simple
suffer, while the seekers suffer, while the

336
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:07,690
good suffer, that's the fact. Let us all of
us join together now and get our realization.

337
00:44:09,869 --> 00:44:15,299
Become the spirit. Is the easiest thing to
do for you, because the Holy Ghost, which

338
00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:22,299
is the Kundalini, is within you. In the triangular
bone She resides and She can be awakened.

339
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:30,039
Now one may say that, "Why didn't He talk
about Kundalini? Whatever He talked, who listened

340
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:36,720
to him? Whatever He said, who tried to understand;
till today I don't find many people have understood

341
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:43,720
Him. Whatever He manifested, who bothered
to know about it? And if He had talked of

342
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:52,700
something more, it would have been obscure.
But He says, "I don't care for the idiots

343
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:59,700
for whom My sayings are obscure." He says
clearly. He has used only thrice the word

344
00:44:59,809 --> 00:45:06,809
'idiot' I think, many times 'stupid' and so
many times 'the fools'. Above all that, to

345
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:15,799
Me, all of them are God's own children. I
know how He was angry. I know why He was angry

346
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:26,319
and I also understand Him that He thought
that, before Sahaja Yoga coming here, let

347
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:33,880
Me scold them, let Me give them a thump, let
Me open them with a big blow, so they are

348
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:42,140
ready. But in His criticism, I read, they
said He was not acceptable because He went

349
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,480
too far.

350
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:48,869
Same with Me. People don't accept Me because
I go too far. I must try to please them. Am

351
00:45:48,869 --> 00:45:54,049
I seeking your votes that I should try to
please you? I have to tell you the truth,

352
00:45:54,049 --> 00:46:01,049
whether you like it or not. I want you to
accept it because that's what I am here for.

353
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:07,130
I'm here for that, that you accept the truth
and get it. I'll do my level best. I can make

354
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:12,109
food for you, I can give you good food to
you, I can give you presents, I can do whatever

355
00:46:12,109 --> 00:46:19,109
a Mother can do for Her children. But when
it doesn't work out, She has to shout sometimes.

356
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:29,849
She has to say things clearly, because you
have to get it. Now you cannot force it on

357
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:36,029
people, this is the biggest problem is. You
cannot force Self-realization on to people,

358
00:46:36,029 --> 00:46:43,029
you cannot do it by force. Say if the ... supposing
Russians tell Me they are very much interested

359
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:48,329
to know about Sahaja Yoga. No doubt. But if
they tell Me that, "You come to our government

360
00:46:48,329 --> 00:46:55,329
and give them realization", I cannot, I cannot
do it. You have to be free people. When you

361
00:46:57,029 --> 00:47:04,029
are free, then you are abandoned, see, the
wages of freedom we are paying. Nobody is

362
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,910
free, in New York if you go, I have to take
out all these ornaments, which I am supposed

363
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:15,789
to wear because of My family. I have to go
there without a purse, I have to tie up my

364
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:22,789
purse inside here see something, otherwise
they'll rob it. Nothing is safe.

365
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:29,890
So this kind of a freedom which leads to violence,
to butchery; actually the way we have butchered

366
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:36,400
our children, butchered our elders, the way
insulted every one of them, all that goes

367
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:42,230
hand in hand with freedom. This is no freedom,
this is absolutely unleashed abandonment of

368
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:49,230
the brutal self within us. So whether you
go to Russia or to here Sahaja Yoga is in

369
00:47:50,289 --> 00:47:57,289
a problem, whether you go to the left or to
the right, I just don't understand, where

370
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:06,839
will it prosper, where freedom is used with
wisdom, with respect. If you cannot respect

371
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:13,950
the freedom of others you do not have the
freedom at all, you have never known the freedom,

372
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:20,950
you have never enjoyed the freedom. So the
freedom of human beings has to be respected

373
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:28,960
and when this freedom is respected, then only
you can get your realization and then only

374
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:35,960
you can enter into higher freedom, into complete
liberty that Blake has described.

375
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:44,730
There are seekers, so many seekers in this
country, and so many are lost, so many are

376
00:48:47,609 --> 00:48:54,609
lost. There have been people who are saved
by Sahaja Yoga, who have been taking drugs,

377
00:48:56,289 --> 00:49:02,670
overnight they gave up, overnight. How? It's
a mechanism within you, God has built that,

378
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:07,690
that power of the spirit when it enlightens
you, you just become so powerful, you give

379
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:12,930
up. But beforehand if I say, "Don't have this
and don't have that", you cannot do it. You

380
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:19,470
do not have that power of the spirit. Most
of the incarnations who came before Christ

381
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:24,890
didn't realize this point, that human beings
are not enlightened, they don't have the power

382
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:29,749
of the spirit within them. Christ realized
it and He said it openly, "You are to be born

383
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:36,749
again." Not only that, but He said, "First
of all forgive, talk of forgiveness." So that

384
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:44,749
they settle down, that they are not paranoid,
that they are not upset. Let them be settled

385
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:50,779
down in peace and in compassion and then awaken
their kundalini and then give them realization.

386
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:56,329
So then you have the power, then there is
no temptation, nothing like that. Will you

387
00:49:56,329 --> 00:50:03,329
tempt Christ with anything? You cannot. In
the same way you do not get enslaved to any

388
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:10,239
temptations. You rise in your own beauty and
glory, and your own strength and power. You

389
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:17,239
don't have to get subdued to anything. This
is what is Self-realization. Sahaja Yoga came

390
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:25,190
to London about twelve years back when I came.
Now I am not an immigrant for your information,

391
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:32,190
at all. I just came by chance, I should say,
or by God's ordained programming. My husband

392
00:50:33,809 --> 00:50:40,000
got elected to this job out of hundred and
thirty-four nations, you see. He was elected

393
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,039
, we came here, just because he was elected,
not even appointed, but elected, and elected

394
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:52,039
four times unanimously. He is the senior most
senior secretary-general. So we had to come

395
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:58,720
here, and that's how I'm here, otherwise I
may not have ever come to England to teach

396
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,640
Sahaja Yoga.

397
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:08,640
With Blake, One feels compelled to try and
try and try to establish Jerusalem, whatever

398
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:18,369
may be the case, whatever may be the disappointment,
whatever may be the disgust, doesn't matter.

399
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:27,410
One has to do it. He had such faith in the
England's soil that we have to build the Jerusalem.

400
00:51:30,769 --> 00:51:37,769
But first, everyone of you who are here must
get your realization and humble down before

401
00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:46,609
your realization. You are not to be arrogant
with it. He said Christ was not humble before

402
00:51:47,289 --> 00:51:54,289
human beings, but before God He was. Before
His Father He was. In the same way, you have

403
00:51:55,759 --> 00:52:02,759
to be humble before your spirit and before
your Self-realization and you have to get

404
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,569
to the higher state. It's surprising that
in India, we had all this knowledge all these

405
00:52:08,569 --> 00:52:13,809
years, but we were supposed to be heathens,
I don't know what else they called us. We

406
00:52:13,809 --> 00:52:18,829
were supposed to be slaves. Nobody wanted
to know anything about it, the knowledge of

407
00:52:18,829 --> 00:52:24,309
the roots existed and our intellectuals also
never bothered, they always followed Oxford

408
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:31,309
and Cambridge traditions. With this Oxbridge
business, we never got through people to tell

409
00:52:34,049 --> 00:52:39,880
them about this great knowledge we had in
that country and everything subsided.

410
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,660
This knowledge is not meant for India, is
not meant for any particular place, is meant

411
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:49,680
for the whole world, as your knowledge of
science, all the knowledge of the tree is

412
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,759
meant for the whole world, which you gave
it to us, or to give it to all the eastern

413
00:52:53,759 --> 00:52:57,859
countries and people accept it. What's the
harm in accepting the knowledge which comes

414
00:52:57,859 --> 00:53:04,859
to you for your benevolence; only because
it is from the eastern side you feel so insecure

415
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:13,039
about it? From where did Christ come? He came
from America? I think He must have run away.

416
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:23,329
Despite that I must say among all of them,
British are the most matured. But we run after

417
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:34,049
Americans, we run after French, we run after
everyone, not being aware of ourselves, what

418
00:53:34,049 --> 00:53:41,049
we are, we are wisdom. We are the people who
represent the heart of the universe and time

419
00:53:47,609 --> 00:53:53,470
has taken, from Him to this time, that we
have matured now. I hope we have matured enough

420
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:59,789
to understand that there has to be a breakthrough.

421
00:53:59,789 --> 00:54:06,789
When they published My handbills, you see,
somehow it so happened that My face has come

422
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:14,529
out quite black in that. I said, "Forget it,
nobody will come to our program, if you show

423
00:54:14,529 --> 00:54:20,059
such a black face they'll say, 'oh, somebody
coming from Africa is trying to teach us what

424
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:27,059
is Jerusalem'." So they had to re-do it, to
show that I am not that black. What difference

425
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:36,900
does it make, the skin deep color? The color
comes from the heart, the beauty comes from

426
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:48,349
the heart, the exuberance of the heart expresses
that beauty on your being and the beauty of

427
00:54:50,359 --> 00:54:57,359
the truth is that, that it acts, it works.
It just doesn't decorate itself, it doesn't

428
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:03,849
try to take to ways and methods of luring
people but it acts, whether you like it or

429
00:55:03,849 --> 00:55:10,849
not it acts. Let us work it out. Is simple.
Instead of going into intellectual feats and

430
00:55:15,749 --> 00:55:22,749
going into the direction of finite understanding
through your brains, let us go to the infinite;

431
00:55:22,849 --> 00:55:28,849
that's only possible when you get to your
spirit, which is infinite, which creates the

432
00:55:28,849 --> 00:55:34,470
collective consciousness within. Which creates,
I say, which means knowledge, but knowledge

433
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:40,410
does not mean what you know through your brain,
but what you know through your central nervous

434
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:47,019
system; that you can feel it, that you can
feel the chakras of everyone on your fingertips.

435
00:55:47,019 --> 00:55:53,180
Mohammed Sahib has said, "At the time of resurrection
your hands will speak". But look at the Muslims,

436
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:58,720
they never, never talk of the resurrection,
when most of Koran is nothing but resurrection.

437
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,710
They talk of the doomsday because they have
to make money by frightening people. Beware

438
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:07,380
of the doomsday, you give the money, we'll
save you, we'll give a certificate; at the

439
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:12,519
doomsday you stand with the certificate, you'll
be saved. First they will go down in the doomsday.

440
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:19,519
This is for every religion, people have used
it for very baser things, making money, creating

441
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:34,039
political ideas. I can't understand how can
diamonds be thrown into dirt like this, and

442
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:43,769
covered with that, and the fragrance turned
into filth. It is beyond Me. The powers of

443
00:56:46,489 --> 00:56:53,420
human beings sometimes supercede that of God,
you can see the way they can change the forms,

444
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:58,519
they change the beauty, change everything
that is reality, into something nonsensical

445
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:05,229
and stupid. And they live with it, they don't
want to know about it; they enjoy it. "We

446
00:57:05,229 --> 00:57:12,229
are very happy people, what's wrong." What
a waste, one feels, of this creation. One

447
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:21,460
feels with what aspirations and visions these
human beings were created on this earth. And

448
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:30,079
then what should we do to make them understand
what they are, to make them aware with that

449
00:57:32,569 --> 00:57:39,569
perception, with that vision of the Divine
that they are? Sometimes, I also cry in the

450
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:49,859
wilderness and share some of the pathos of
all these poets who came on this earth and

451
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:56,420
suffered, and suffered, and suffered.

452
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:03,420
I hope today, with all this anguish, whatever
I am telling you, you will try to see that

453
00:58:04,539 --> 00:58:11,539
sincerity is the only way you can understand
yourself. No books , nothing, no conditioning,

454
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:19,940
no denial, nothing can convince you but the
sincerity to know the spirit, which is within

455
00:58:20,849 --> 00:58:27,849
you and this sincerity I call it as the pure
desire. If you have that pure desire, which

456
00:58:30,479 --> 00:58:34,150
is the power of your kundalini, you will get
your realization. Now, just now, the shoot.

457
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:41,150
That's all is needed, the pure desire to be
the spirit, nothing more than that. But when

458
00:58:44,819 --> 00:58:51,819
it is awakened, then it is to be looked after,
that's very important; it has to be looked

459
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:59,319
after, it has to be kept burning, it has to
be maneuvered and kept at a point that you

460
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:06,299
start growing more and more. I need not tell
you all about Sahaja Yoga, it's going to be

461
00:59:06,299 --> 00:59:13,299
too much for you, but how Blake has worked
for us. So many poets have done this job and

462
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:24,410
now the new great poets are coming to finish
us off, to please the media, to make money,

463
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:31,640
befool us, using flowery words, pleasing sentences,
taking us to hell directly. Beware of them,

464
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:45,289
beware, save your children from them, save
the whole community. The whole of England

465
00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:51,900
has to be saved because if the heart dies,
the whole universe will die.

466
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:58,599
May God bless you.

467
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:05,599
The Sahaja yogis didn't want Me to allow you
to ask Me questions but I think better ask

468
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:21,279
Me some questions.
Q.....about the chakras....

469
01:00:21,279 --> 01:00:28,279
Shri Mataji: Yes sir. That's what I said,
that I didn't talk about them because it would

470
01:00:28,839 --> 01:00:35,559
be too long a lecture but we have got a book
on this, a little book and there it is all

471
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:42,559
written though I say that before realization
don't even read that book, can create problems.

472
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:48,960
You can know all about the subtle side, the
chakras and everything without paying anything,

473
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:55,960
without any effort. There are people now in
England, you will be surprised, so many of

474
01:00:56,289 --> 01:01:03,289
them are excellent Sahaja yogis who are experts
and they will tell you all about it very clearly.

475
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:08,410
We have got books to explain. As you see there
are seven chakras are shown here. The lowermost

476
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:11,089
is the Mooladhara Chakra, is the innocence.

477
01:01:11,089 --> 01:01:18,089
Q:...can you see it with your eyes, outside
the body, can you see it?

478
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:26,630
Shri Mataji: If you see something then you
are not that. And people have seen it because

479
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:32,190
they were not that, because they moved on
the sides, on the sympathetic nervous system,

480
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:37,569
what we call the Ida and Pingala. When you
go on sympathetic nervous system you can see

481
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:41,979
it from outside. Like this building you can
see it from outside, but when you are in it

482
01:01:41,979 --> 01:01:47,400
you don't see it, you see only the inside.
So that's what it is, when you ascend, you

483
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:54,400
need not see anything, you become, you get
the powers. People have seen it no doubt,

484
01:01:57,779 --> 01:02:04,779
but that one should not ask for. I can see
the glass - better to drink the water. Now

485
01:02:13,979 --> 01:02:15,009
what else?

486
01:02:15,009 --> 01:02:22,009
Q:....what do You do with all Your wealth,
all your money?

487
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:31,719
Shri Mataji: My money? Are you from the bank?
What I do with My money - what do you want

488
01:02:37,469 --> 01:02:44,469
Me to do? What sort of a question is this?
Ask a simple straightforward question madam

489
01:02:48,089 --> 01:02:53,989
I don't understand what do I do with My money,
I don't do anything with it. Actually My husband

490
01:02:53,989 --> 01:03:00,049
manages his money, I ask him whatever I like.
Of course he earns a lot no doubt, he earns

491
01:03:00,049 --> 01:03:05,019
very much. I sometimes tell him, "I'm ashamed
the way they give you money," because he doesn't

492
01:03:05,019 --> 01:03:10,150
even pay any tax you know. Of course I do
spend some money on Sahaja Yoga, I must confess

493
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:17,150
I have to sometimes, what to do? One has to
and these people have their own ashrams, where

494
01:03:18,099 --> 01:03:22,549
they stay, and look after it. For this hall
they must have collected some money I don't

495
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:26,200
know, I don't know what do they do with their
money, I don't know, I have no idea, I've

496
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:30,619
never seen that. They are honest people, they
all know all about it. I don't know anything,

497
01:03:30,619 --> 01:03:37,619
I have nothing to do with it. This is the
aggressiveness, "What do I do with My money"

498
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:44,150
Just look at this. Yes sir?

499
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:51,150
Q....a man has mental illness, he wants to
know whether he'll have it after he dies....

500
01:03:58,299 --> 01:04:05,299
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, just now you can
cure it. Why to think of death? You can be

501
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:15,319
cured of your mental illness at least, minimum,
that could be done.

502
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:28,140
Q....How can you tell that it's Self-realization?
You feel a breeze but how does it become...

503
01:04:39,299 --> 01:04:44,940
Shri Mataji: You see, when you feel the cool
breeze is the beginning of it, all right?

504
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:49,819
Now you have to see what this cool breeze
is, all right? Now if you go to a college

505
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:56,239
of science or a college of medicine what you
have to do is to see what it is, isn't it;

506
01:04:56,239 --> 01:05:03,239
and to see whatever it says does it prove.
Now, when you see the cool breeze in your

507
01:05:03,329 --> 01:05:10,329
hand, what happens that it is, as I said,
is the compassion of God say for example,

508
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:17,019
you just believe in the hypothesis just now.
Now what is this compassion doing, is made

509
01:05:17,019 --> 01:05:24,019
you a computer. On the fingertips you can
tell what centers are catching, of yours and

510
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:30,739
of others, so you become the diagnosis. Now
if you know a little few gestures by which

511
01:05:30,739 --> 01:05:37,739
you can handle this power, you can cure them.
That's the minimum, all right? You can know

512
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:43,150
from this whether you have mental problem
or you have emotional problem, or you have

513
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:49,579
physical problem and of what nature. This
is how is the self-knowledge starts, from

514
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:51,180
the very basics.

515
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:55,779
What's your problem with you, first let us
see the problem on the centers, all right?

516
01:05:55,779 --> 01:06:00,930
Then you move forward when you go with it,
then you understand what's the problem with

517
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:06,059
others; then what's the problem in the collective;
then what's the problem of this country; and

518
01:06:06,059 --> 01:06:13,059
if you know how to solve them, sitting down
here, you can do it, you can solve it. But

519
01:06:13,259 --> 01:06:19,289
this is the breeze which has to be felt first
because this is the breeze which we call as

520
01:06:19,289 --> 01:06:26,219
the all-pervading power of God. Now, just
because I say you should not believe Me, because

521
01:06:26,219 --> 01:06:32,660
blind faith is of no use, but you can experiment
and see for yourself. Even little children

522
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:37,390
know. They can tell you what is catching in
you, what chakras are catching. You can have

523
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:42,650
ten children, 'fold' their eyes, put them
before a gentleman, immediately they'll raise

524
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:48,890
this finger or this finger. Supposing they
raise this finger, means this person feels

525
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:55,619
terribly guilty. He must be a Catholic that
he feels so guilty. That the children won't

526
01:06:55,619 --> 01:07:02,130
say but you will know that this is the chakra
is caught up here because he's feeling guilty.

527
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:08,119
Like that you can go on finding on your own
being like a laboratory the whole thing becomes

528
01:07:08,119 --> 01:07:15,119
like a computer because it is knowledge, knowledge
through your central nervous system, through

529
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:22,200
your evolutionary process. But you have to
practice and understand what it is. If I give

530
01:07:23,029 --> 01:07:27,749
you a car, how will you know it moves unless
and until you get into it and know how to

531
01:07:27,749 --> 01:07:34,749
drive it, isn't it. You have to give some
time, not much, but you enjoy, best part of

532
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:39,890
it you enjoy doing the whole thing. It just
flows automatically, you don't have to do

533
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:45,289
anything about it.

534
01:07:45,289 --> 01:07:52,289
But one has to learn, little bit, what it
is. Before realization you don't have to do

535
01:07:54,650 --> 01:08:00,880
anything, it just forms spontaneously as the
seed is sown in the Mother Earth, all right?

536
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:05,969
Then when it comes out, then you have to look
after it; the same way you have to look after

537
01:08:05,969 --> 01:08:12,969
your realization, respect it. Then you become
the masters. We have one master standing here

538
01:08:13,729 --> 01:08:20,729
and we have so many. They are just like you
to look at, but they know so much and they

539
01:08:24,609 --> 01:08:29,049
are so humble. They don't go about with a
big plate on their heads "I am the master

540
01:08:29,049 --> 01:08:33,460
of this and master of that" nothing. They
are doing all their jobs, they are doing very

541
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:40,460
well, they are blessed and also they are helping
people to get their realization. You'll be

542
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:47,880
surprised in Sahaja Yoga very difficult to
get an unemployed person. All of them are

543
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:53,460
employed. If they are unemployed they get
employment with God also. Basically they are

544
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:55,450
employed by God. All right?

545
01:08:55,450 --> 01:09:02,450
Q... is this the only way to get realization?
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course; there cannot

546
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:14,400
be another, God could not make thousand and
one, could He? That would be too much of a

547
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:20,270
headache , like as you sprout the seed, how
do you do it? Spontaneously. Sahaja Yoga means

548
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:27,270
spontaneous, living process is always spontaneous.
Now supposing we want to sprout a seed and

549
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:33,179
we take out the primule, push it out and push
it inside the Mother Earth, will it sprout

550
01:09:33,179 --> 01:09:40,179
- no. You have to take advantage of the powers
of the Mother Earth, to sprout a seed, isn't

551
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,339
it?

552
01:09:43,339 --> 01:09:50,339
Q. ...saying she has not come across Sahaja
Yoga in the religions, that there are many

553
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,850
religions.
Shri Mataji: In the religions there's no ... religions

554
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:03,080
are no religions, that's the trouble is. I
have told you all this just now that there

555
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:09,040
is nothing, they will never mention that is
sensible, but it's not so. I would say Sikhism,

556
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:16,040
we can say is the latest religion. I mean
there are so many verses about, much later

557
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:23,020
than Islam, Sikhism came on this earth and
they have said that, complete description,

558
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:27,490
I mean you don't understand Hindi otherwise
I would have told you - Ida, Pingala, Sushumna

559
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:32,270
- everything they have described - Kabira
has described at such length that we have

560
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:38,250
in India a great poet Gyaneshwara and He has
described all about kundalini. If you go in

561
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:41,780
Maharashtra and tell them that somebody is
going to awaken the kundalini, they'll all

562
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:46,770
rush, they know all about it.

563
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:53,770
How many years did Christ live? How many times
He could talk to people? How many of them

564
01:10:54,910 --> 01:11:01,910
accepted Him and how many of them understood
Him? He went to a wrong place, I tell you;

565
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:10,950
all were deaf, dumb and brainless. How will
they understand? How could He talk about Kundalini

566
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:20,880
when everybody was after His life? But He
did talk of Holy Ghost, He talked of the Comforter

567
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:26,840
He was going to send. He talked of so many
things in that short time. Do you know for

568
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:33,100
four years I was struggling with seven hippies
in London; for four years. I must say, it's

569
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:40,100
very creditable for Him in three and a half
years to talk so much. How many years Blake

570
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:46,920
had to work hard to talk to you? Is it easy
to talk to people about truth? Very difficult;

571
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:52,110
everybody is extremely intelligent and wise,
nobody want to listen to anything, do they?

572
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:59,110
But in India we have a tradition; we know
it; that you have to ascend. The whole thing

573
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:04,730
works out that way. If they talk of kundalini,
not in the North so much, but in Maharashtra,

574
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:08,850
if you go, if you go in the South, you'll
be amazed six thousand people, seven thousand

575
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:13,040
people come in a village. They have seen it,
these people have seen it, they come in bullock

576
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:20,040
carts, they come in, any way that is possible
for them, buses, and trains, and they walk

577
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:26,110
miles together when they hear I'm there.

578
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:33,040
Once I was coming from a program in the night
and suddenly I found lots of people lying

579
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:36,550
on the road. I said, "Who are these people?"
They said, "Mother we couldn't reach Your

580
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:38,660
program, we were late, You give us realization
here." I said: "All right, have it." They

581
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:45,660
had it, they are the ones who'll get much
faster than anyone else, I know, that's why

582
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:51,210
I don't mind spending some time here. Once
I go there, you will see the whole country

583
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:55,870
would be ablaze, I'm not telling you lies,
you ask the people who have been there. They

584
01:12:55,870 --> 01:13:02,060
are very different type of people, to them
most important is their spirit. If you tell

585
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:08,310
them what, the way we talk about Christ here,
so disrespectfully, without understanding,

586
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:15,310
they are shocked. Any Indian who is a Christian
or a Muslim or a Hindu, doesn't treat the

587
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:22,700
way you treat Bible. The respect they have
has come to them traditionally. Of course

588
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:28,760
you don't judge Indians by the Indians who
have come here. They like your company, they

589
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:35,700
are this type, they are materialistic, they
want to have money, they have come here to

590
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:42,700
earn money, but the people who are in India
in the villages, not in the cities, are still

591
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:49,310
seeking, seeking God, they're very simple
people, humble people.

592
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:55,890
Traditionally we have known for thousands
of years. I talk of Markandeya who was there

593
01:13:55,890 --> 01:14:02,540
twelve thousand years back, who incarnated
here as William Blake. Twelve thousand years

594
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:08,460
back He said the same thing which is said
in England after twelve thousand years, because

595
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:15,460
that time I don't know what was here, may
be only jungles, I think. And that is also

596
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:23,710
waste, isn't it, tell Me, isn't it? How much
could Christ talk about kundalini? He talked

597
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:32,140
of Holy Ghost. But why stick on to that, now
I have come to talk to you. Better take your

598
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:40,760
realization; when He came, they talked of
Moses, when Moses came they talked of Abraham.

599
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:47,760
What about the present, I am with you, why
not have your realization? All religions were

600
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:58,770
built for this day, that you get your realization,
to give you the balance, to give you that

601
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:04,250
property by which you ascend. Like when we
have an aeroplane, we fix it up properly;

602
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:10,570
in the same way they wanted to fix you up,
but the religions went astray, they made people

603
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:15,000
crooked, the things they fixed, wrong bolts
into wrong places, the whole aeroplane is

604
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:22,000
in a tattered condition if it flies, it will
all fall down. Better give up all those ideas.

605
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:30,370
But kundalini is such a great force, it's
such a great force; it comforts you, it cures

606
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:37,120
you, it builds up all your centers and slowly
moves upward and when if you get realization,

607
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:44,120
also it goes back, attends to all these problems
that 

608
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:58,550
you have. It's such a mother she is. Any other
question, please?

609
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:08,050
Q. Why are you to be known as Mataji, Mother?
Shri Mataji: I didn't follow.

610
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:15,610
Yogi: Nor did I. Why are You to be known as
Mataji?

611
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:23,120
Shri Mataji: As Shri Mataji? That's the title
they gave Me, what can I do? In India. You

612
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:36,120
have to be an Indian to understand that. There
are certain things described, about Shri Mataji.

613
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:46,440
If you have read any books, of Adi Shankaracharya,
or of Markandeya Himself, then you will know

614
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:59,330
and the qualities described there of such
a person, if they find it in someone, they

615
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:08,230
call that person by that name, isn't it? Like
Gandhiji was called as Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma

616
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:17,930
means a bigger spirit than others, because
he had that. He didn't care for himself or

617
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:26,150
his own family, everything for his own, but
he thought of the whole country; that's why

618
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:33,150
he was called Mahatma. Now, but I didn't call
Myself; if others want to call I think is

619
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:42,810
all right, I have no objection. You can call
anything, whatever you see, you can call that.

620
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:51,220
By calling that, what is your objection? Can
I ask you this question? Beg pardon? [No objection]

621
01:17:54,680 --> 01:18:01,680
No objection. All right, that's all right.
See, then it's all right, if you understand

622
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:11,830
that it is must be some reason also.
(Further question from same person)

623
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:18,060
Q. Do you have some divine power?
Shri Mataji: That you better find out; I am

624
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:25,060
not going to be tactless on that. Christ said
what was the truth, that He was the Son of

625
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:32,100
God, all right, but they crucified Him. I
don't want to get crucified so soon.

626
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:48,040
[INAUDIBLE Q:] But the one who is an Indian,
who is an Indian and Englishman. [Hindi].

627
01:18:54,300 --> 01:19:01,300
You see 
it is for an ... Indians understand it better.
[Hindi]

628
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:26,290
I'm sorry I'm speaking in Hindi because I
have to little bit chastise the Indians here,

629
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:43,440
I hope you don't mind. [Hindi]

630
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:55,230
Now, what is another question please? Yes
please?

631
01:19:56,820 --> 01:20:03,820
Q. Yogi: Mother, she is 

632
01:20:56,020 --> 01:21:03,020
asking if you can cure physical ailment, I
mean the answer's yes, that comes from Self-realization,

633
01:21:08,150 --> 01:21:13,890
no question.
Shri Mataji with your permission, the majority

634
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:20,200
of people have come for the experience and
are anxious to have, I may be mistaken, but

635
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:24,210
I think most people would like to stop questions
and ...

636
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:25,890
Shri Mataji: But sometimes you know those
who want to ask, let them ask, otherwise the

637
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:32,890
brain will again put out a question. Now madam,
what is it..?

638
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:41,230
(SY. She's asking You, Mother, what life was
like for You as a child)?

639
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:45,310
Shri Mataji: As a child? I mean that's another
story; you come and see Me, I'll tell you

640
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:52,310
all about it. Why do you want to know about
My past and future? Let us at the present

641
01:21:55,710 --> 01:22:02,710
time to get your realization; makes no difference
what I was as a child, or what I was as an

642
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,690
old woman.

643
01:22:04,690 --> 01:22:11,690
Yogi: ... She's asking whether you have an
opinion about the growth of interest in spirituality

644
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:21,760
in England...
Shri Mataji: What spirituality?

645
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:26,010
Yogi asks questioner: spiritualism or spirituality?
Questioner answers: spiritualism.

646
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:33,010
Shri Mataji: That's the witchcraft, revived;
very, very dangerous. Ah, is very dangerous,

647
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:39,710
never go near that, all this parapsychology
and all those things. We have described all

648
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:43,640
these things in our book; you can have a look
at it. Is a very comprehensive thing, Sahaja

649
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:48,250
Yoga is. Is the witchcraft, you may call it
spirituality, because a spirit can be also

650
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:55,250
a dead soul as I told you, in English language.
There is no 'ism' about God. It's infinite.

651
01:22:59,150 --> 01:23:06,150
'Isms' are all finite things.

652
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:15,530
Q. SY: she's praising Your lecture, Mother,
and saying now that....she'll go back to read

653
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:39,510
Blake again.
Shri Mataji: I'm very happy, I'm very happy

654
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:44,790
that you say that, madam, it's really such
a great poet, but you'll be surprised in India,

655
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:50,630
none of them brought Blake. We never read
Blake there, never; you see we studied English

656
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:56,250
language, we studied Shakespeare, we studied
so many things, but never they mentioned Blake,

657
01:23:56,250 --> 01:24:03,250
you know. I don't know why. In the whole education
system of India, they never mentioned Blake.

658
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:10,250
[another inaudible question ...]
Shri Mataji: That's very nice, such books

659
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:18,600
you must read. Such books you must read.
[Here someone disclaims in Sanskrit]

660
01:24:39,670 --> 01:24:44,590
You see there's a Sanskrit scholar here, but
the greatest Guru is the Mother, don't you

661
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:51,590
think so? The Mother is the Guru of the gurus.
But it's very difficult, because guru is a

662
01:24:54,930 --> 01:25:01,930
hard stuff, you see. A mother has to be very
soft, kind, gentle to manage the show, but

663
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:09,310
the guru can be very hard and they are very
hard people, but Mother as a guru is a difficult

664
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:16,020
task, it's very enjoyable.

665
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:22,920
Now I have given at least eleven lectures
on Guru tattwa, all right? So you can take

666
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:29,310
tapes from them, you can read it and you will
enjoy it very well. Here the Guru tattwa is

667
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:35,830
expressed in the Void, there, where the ten
Gurus actually incarnated basically and they

668
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:42,830
reincarnated. Say we can start from Adi Nath,
then we can come to other ones like Nanaka,

669
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:52,280
Janaka. Janaka was much earlier, then we can
say Abraham, Moses. All these were Guru tattwa,

670
01:25:54,690 --> 01:26:01,690
Socrates, all these were Guru tattwa people,
the people who came as Prophets; the ones

671
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:09,550
who came on this earth to teach us balance,
to teach us the code of life. That was also

672
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:15,600
important part, but that was forgot. Why?
Why the code, why the religion? Religion is

673
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,180
for the ascent, to build you up.

674
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:24,980
Q. ?Tattwa
Shri Mataji: Tattwam assi, that's what is

675
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:31,980
the tattwa there; tattwa is there; tattwa
is nothing but your kundalini is your tattwa,

676
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:39,660
is the principle....

677
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:46,660
Q: [INAUDIBLE] Parvati, Shiva; She's also
called as Kundalini.

678
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:56,390
Shri Mataji: Of course. Yes, yes, it is all
over, same thing. I'm just giving you the

679
01:26:57,570 --> 01:26:59,060
gist of it.

680
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:06,060
SY: She's asking, Mother, who was Mother Durga,
she's asking about who was Mother Durga?

681
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:17,720
Shri Mataji: A very direct question; I told
you, I'm very tactful, I'm not going to confess

682
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:25,870
anything. You better find out, it's better
to find out. It's nice, isn't it? To find

683
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:29,540
out yourself.

684
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:36,540
Yogi: ...I'll explain, Mother, the program
is that tonight will be the experience of

685
01:27:38,890 --> 01:27:45,030
realization and we have another program on
Saturday evening, here in the same place,

686
01:27:45,030 --> 01:27:49,910
which will be for this knowledge part; after
realization, the knowledge makes more sense,

687
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:54,960
so it's better to get the experience...
Shri Mataji: But our experience is very funny,

688
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:01,890
I must tell you that for My program, even
if there may be one thousand people, for getting

689
01:28:01,890 --> 01:28:08,890
realization, after that they just get lost,
never grow. That's only more in England, they

690
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:19,130
just don't ... they'll get lost, I think they
must be going to the pub after that. I can't

691
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:24,710
explain why it happens but they just get lost,
they don't want to know anything anymore.

692
01:28:24,710 --> 01:28:31,710
I don't know why, I cannot explain, I mean,
is something I cannot explain. All right,

693
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:40,960
let's have it now.

694
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:47,960
So now, if we are all settled down, it's very
simple, Sahaj also means simple, Sahaj; saha

695
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:56,760
means 'with' ja means 'born'; is born with
you, this right to get this union, this yoga,

696
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:01,300
is born with you, is within you and is the
living process of the living God so it is

697
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:07,400
spontaneous. Everything that is living is
spontaneous and should happen to all of you,

698
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:14,400
no doubt about it. You don't have to do anything
as I said but you have to receive the power

699
01:29:14,410 --> 01:29:21,410
within yourself, to invite the kundalini to
rise. Now first thing I have to request, I

700
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,250
hope it is not too much of it, that we have
to take out our shoes to touch the Mother

701
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:32,150
Earth. Is very important because the Mother
Earth is the one which sucks in, for a while.

702
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:39,150
I don't know, is there a carpet there? Be
in a mood of reception, and also of well-being,

703
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:57,680
in a happy mood, because this is the greatest
moment of our lives.

704
01:30:08,410 --> 01:30:15,410
Now as I said that these fingers, here five,
six and seven, on the same way this way, represent

705
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:22,560
the two sides of the chakras within us, the
sympathetic sides, so we have to put our hands

706
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:30,640
like this, just like this, simple as that.
And sit, not crossed legged but putting both

707
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:41,330
the feet with respect, towards the Mother
Earth, in parallel to each other. Now maybe

708
01:30:44,050 --> 01:30:47,960
some of you must have started feeling the
cool breeze, I don't know, might have, because

709
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:53,680
today's lecture was rather too terrific and
William Blake must have worked it out I'm

710
01:30:53,680 --> 01:31:00,680
sure. But otherwise is very simple. Now we
have to do is to ourselves awaken our own

711
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:08,270
kundalini, which is very simple, which I will
tell you. In the heart resides the spirit

712
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:14,650
so first we'll have to put our hand to our
heart. I will tell you one by one. And then

713
01:31:14,650 --> 01:31:19,460
in the upper part of your stomach where the
guru tattwa is here, the principle of guru

714
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:26,460
is there. Then in the lower part of the abdomen,
where it is the divine, or we can say the

715
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:42,660
pure knowledge that exists and which works.
This is the center through which the pure

716
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:50,220
knowledge, the pure technique, works. Then
we take this hand again back, same way, up

717
01:31:53,080 --> 01:32:00,080
to this point where, it is here, when we are
guilty we catch this chakra. Now here works

718
01:32:10,570 --> 01:32:17,570
our self-confidence, our faith in God that
He forgives us. Then we put our hand on top

719
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:25,790
of our head - this is the Agnya Chakra, which
is very important. Here we forgive everyone;

720
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:32,500
then at the back of the Agnya Chakra again,
where we have to say that, "If we done any

721
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:38,030
mistake, oh God forgive us". These are the
two sides of the Agnya Chakra. And then you

722
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:45,030
put your hand, stretch it, put this part on
the fontanel bone area, the soft bone which

723
01:32:45,650 --> 01:32:52,650
was on top of our head and press it hard and
move it hard, for a while. That's all one

724
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:56,390
has to do. I'll tell you one by one.

725
01:32:56,390 --> 01:33:02,470
First and foremost thing is, we have to close
our eyes, because eyes take out our attention;

726
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:09,460
but attention will be sucked inside our body
in the sense it will go through the - just

727
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:15,070
like this cloth - it is spread out, but as
kundalini rises, She sucks it in and then

728
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:22,070
pierces through this attention, enlight[en]ing
all of that. It's a happening that takes place

729
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:32,720
without any trouble whatsoever. As a result
of that, what you get is the cool breeze coming

730
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:39,670
out of your head; you can also feel the cool
breeze in your fingertips; then later on in

731
01:33:39,670 --> 01:33:46,670
your hands and you get that shine on your
skin. Christ has said, "The face that does

732
01:33:50,030 --> 01:33:57,030
not shine cannot become the star." And then
you get that glint of shine of the spirit

733
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:05,620
in your eyes. That's all, is not the point,
is much, much, much, much more but just a

734
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:15,820
wee bit that we have to today testify and
later on to find out have we got realization

735
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:21,870
all right, then can we work it out, can we
do this, because later on we have to play

736
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:28,180
our role now as a spiritual being, that's
the point one has to understand.

737
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:35,180
So now, have respect for yourself first of
all; and not to feel guilty at all. You are

738
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:45,440
the temple of God, really believe Me you are
made that way, only the light is to be kindled

739
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:51,780
and that is in your heart. When the kundalini
rises, she's something like an energy that

740
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:58,780
does that because when she pierces through,
this is the place where the God Almighty resides,

741
01:34:59,530 --> 01:35:06,530
who is reflected in our heart as the spirit
and the all-pervading power, which is the

742
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:16,500
Primordial Mother, the Holy Ghost, this vibrations
that you feel, the power of God, the love

743
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:26,030
of God which is represented within us as the
kundalini, rises and unites us, our attention

744
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:35,140
to the Divine. The spirit enlightens the attention
and by that enlightenment you know, on your

745
01:35:39,090 --> 01:35:44,820
fingertips, on your central nervous system,
through your new collective consciousness

746
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:51,820
about yourself and about others. Through Sahaja
Yoga you know how to cure, improve, and through

747
01:35:53,660 --> 01:36:00,660
this happening, through the spirit you enjoy
because spirit - the nature of spirit is satchidanand,

748
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:09,620
means it is the truth, it becomes the attention
and it is the source of joy. Without getting

749
01:36:12,550 --> 01:36:19,550
realization you can be happy and unhappy but
you cannot be joy, which has no dualism. You

750
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:27,370
become the source of joy. Such a person, when
he meets someone; he sees someone, he looks

751
01:36:27,370 --> 01:36:34,370
at someone, just a kataksh is sufficient to
raise the kundalini - just a glance is sufficient

752
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:43,800
to cure that person; just a thought, can give
comfort to the other person. Miracles after

753
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:49,940
miracles, so many miracles that as Sahaja
yogis say, "miracle' has lost its meaning

754
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:56,230
Mother, in Sahaja Yoga," that's true. So miracles
of miracles and every moment you feel that

755
01:36:56,230 --> 01:36:59,830
God is looking after you.

756
01:36:59,830 --> 01:37:06,830
When this great volcano burst, exploded in
Mexico, a miracle happened they say, that

757
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:20,210
the children were saved. The wrath - no this
was not in Mexico but later on more in Colombia,

758
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:30,030
because Colombia is sending all kinds of these
horrible things all over the world, making

759
01:37:30,030 --> 01:37:37,030
money out of it. The wrath of the Mother Earth
poured that mud and the people were drowned

760
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:46,050
but the children survived. Their heads were
above the mud, the body inside the mud. The

761
01:37:46,050 --> 01:37:51,570
same Mother Earth looked after them because
they should not be burned so She covered them

762
01:37:51,570 --> 01:37:58,570
with the mud, why? Because of the innocence
in them. Those who have even the slightest

763
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:05,840
innocence in them will become realized souls,
no doubt about it - slightest, a very wee

764
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:13,760
bit. All the seekers are a special category
of people and they have to become realized

765
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:14,340
souls.

766
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:18,770
So forget about the past, forget whatever
you have done in your seeking, whatever you

767
01:38:18,770 --> 01:38:25,770
are told, whatever you are branded with, just
forget it and forgive yourself, once for all.

768
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:31,110
This is I am telling you this because this
is one of the biggest problems of the West

769
01:38:31,110 --> 01:38:37,170
that everybody sits down with a bad, horrible
trouble here and sometimes I feel it so much

770
01:38:37,170 --> 01:38:43,440
that I can't even hear people. Is terrible.
This portion is so bad here so I have to request

771
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:50,440
you that please forgive yourself. You are
the glory of God, without you God has no meaning

772
01:38:54,470 --> 01:39:00,170
also. It is He who is anxious, much more then
you are, to give you realization. Just help

773
01:39:00,170 --> 01:39:01,390
Him out a little.

774
01:39:01,390 --> 01:39:08,390
All right. Let us see. So we put our both
the hands like this, close our eyes. Now you

775
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:16,030
have to keep the left hand all the time towards
Me, because is the desire, is expressed through

776
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:20,930
it is the power of desire in the left hand
which expresses that you want to have realization.

777
01:39:20,930 --> 01:39:26,350
The right hand is the power of action so you
move your right hand but don't open your eyes.

778
01:39:26,350 --> 01:39:33,350
You have to keep your eyes all the time shut,
just the opposite of mesmerism as you can

779
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:40,780
see. Now please close your eyes; now put your
right hand on your heart.

780
01:39:53,840 --> 01:40:00,840
Now here you have to say, or ask Me a question,
"Mother am I the spirit?" You may call Me

781
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:11,370
Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever suits you.
"Mother am I the spirit?" is a fundamental

782
01:40:11,370 --> 01:40:16,820
question and if you are a computer it will
answer. "Mother am I the spirit?" Ask the

783
01:40:16,820 --> 01:40:23,820
question three times please. Put your left
hand properly, please close your eyes; everybody

784
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:33,880
should do it, please. It's uncivil not to
close your eyes; please close your eyes because

785
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:41,800
others may feel self-conscious so please close
your eyes, to be courteous.

786
01:40:47,790 --> 01:40:54,590
Now you have to take down your right hand
on the upper part of your stomach, on the

787
01:40:54,590 --> 01:41:01,590
left hand side, we are working only on the
left hand side. Here is the principle of the

788
01:41:02,770 --> 01:41:09,170
master. If you are the spirit, automatically
you have to ask the second question, "Mother

789
01:41:09,170 --> 01:41:16,170
am I my own master? Mother am I my own guru?"
Please ask this question, you have to ask

790
01:41:17,010 --> 01:41:24,010
this question three times again, without fear,
with all confidence you ask this question,

791
01:41:25,730 --> 01:41:32,730
you are the spirit, you are your master.

792
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:43,490
Now move your right hand on the lower part
of your abdomen on the left hand side, lower

793
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:53,000
part of your abdomen on the left hand side.
This is the center of the divine work, of

794
01:41:54,290 --> 01:42:01,290
the divine knowledge or the pure knowledge,
of the technique of divine manifestation.

795
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:09,890
At this point I cannot force you to do anything,
as I told you, you have to be free, I can

796
01:42:12,690 --> 01:42:19,530
only request you and here I say that you have
to ask for the divine knowledge, you have

797
01:42:19,530 --> 01:42:26,530
to ask for the pure knowledge and when you
ask for it the kundalini will start moving.

798
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:34,610
Here with sincere heart, in a humble way you
have to say, "Mother may I have the pure knowledge,

799
01:42:36,290 --> 01:42:43,290
Mother may I have the divine technique?" Ask
this question six times because this center

800
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:50,880
has got six petals.

801
01:43:05,550 --> 01:43:12,550
Now to make the way easy for kundalini, we
go along the same centers upwards so you put

802
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:39,260
your right hand on the upper part of your
abdomen, to make it easy for the kundalini

803
01:43:40,010 --> 01:43:47,010
to rise you have to open this center by asserting,
by saying "Mother I am my own master", by

804
01:43:54,090 --> 01:44:01,090
saying "Mother I am my own master", ten times
because there are ten petals, ten Sat gurus

805
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:26,560
basically who incarnate ten times, of Prophets,
the Masters.

806
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:58,800
Now raise your right hand on your heart, press
it. With the same confidence you have to say

807
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:10,000
twelve times "Mother I am the spirit, I am
the spirit, I am the spirit". Just assert,

808
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:26,720
that's a fact, that's the truth. Press it
with your fingers. Now, twelve times, have

809
01:45:48,670 --> 01:45:55,670
full confidence in you, believe Me you are
the spirit, you have to just become in the

810
01:45:55,670 --> 01:46:02,670
sense it has to come in your attention on
to your central nervous system.

811
01:46:26,170 --> 01:46:33,170
Now raise the right hand on the left hand
side of your neck, in the corner where the

812
01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:43,740
neck and the shoulder meet, press it hard,
take it backwards, press it hard. This is

813
01:46:43,740 --> 01:46:49,170
the most difficult center in the West, as
I told you, that we feel guilty all the time

814
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:56,170
but as I have told you, God is the ocean of
love, ocean of compassion, but above all He

815
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:06,640
is the ocean of forgiveness. He's the ocean
of forgiveness. When He's the ocean of forgiveness,

816
01:47:10,630 --> 01:47:16,550
what guilt can we have that He cannot wash
away or dissolve it? So just you have to say

817
01:47:16,550 --> 01:47:23,550
sixteen times because there are sixteen petals,
to say sixteen times with full belief in yourself,

818
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:30,500
"Mother I'm not guilty, Mother, I'm not guilty,
Mother, I'm not guilty" sixteen times will

819
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:37,500
you please say that "Shri Mataji I'm not guilty".
If you still feel you are guilty and you can't

820
01:48:18,970 --> 01:48:22,860
forgive yourself, better say it to punish
yourself hundred and eight times, if that

821
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:29,860
pleases you.

822
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:44,180
When you forgive yourself you have to forgive
others and so the greatest message of Christ,

823
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:05,640
that we have to forgive others you have to
put your hand to the center which is the adornment

824
01:49:06,490 --> 01:49:13,490
or we should say which adorns Christ, on the
Agnya Chakra on your forehead, please put

825
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:21,130
your right hand across,. Press it hard and
here you have to say with full belief in yourself

826
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:38,880
and in your powers that, "Shri Mataji I forgive
everyone". Some may say that's very difficult

827
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:47,720
but what do we do when we forgive or not forgive
- no logic in it. But when we say that, then

828
01:49:48,470 --> 01:49:55,470
we are out of the clutches of other people,
so please say, "Shri Mataji I forgive everyone.

829
01:49:58,340 --> 01:50:05,340
Now say it with your whole heart, how many
times is not the point, please say it with

830
01:50:18,110 --> 01:50:23,260
your whole heart. Now you move your hand backwards
onto the back side of the same center - Agnya

831
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:30,260
- press it hard. Now here, you have to say
once only without feeling guilty at all, without

832
01:50:35,350 --> 01:50:42,350
feeling no remorse, no condemnation, to God,
one for your satisfaction, "Oh Lord, if I

833
01:50:44,060 --> 01:50:51,060
have done anything wrong, please forgive me"
but don't feel guilty, that's very important.

834
01:50:53,490 --> 01:51:00,490
Even without saying He has forgiven you. Better.

835
01:51:06,420 --> 01:51:13,420
Now raise your right hand on top of your head,
stretch your ... stretch your palm, press

836
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:21,040
it hard on the fontanel bone area, which was
the soft bone in your childhood, press it

837
01:51:23,150 --> 01:51:30,150
hard, move it seven times. Again here I cannot
force anything on you. You have to say that

838
01:51:31,630 --> 01:51:38,630
you want your Self-realization that, "Mother,
please give us our realization. We want our

839
01:51:38,820 --> 01:51:44,860
Self-realization. Please give me my Self-realization"
and press it hard and move it seven times

840
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:51,860
and say that. I'm sure it will work out.

841
01:52:02,130 --> 01:52:09,130
Now bring down your hand, slowly, and bend
your head a little bit and feel with your

842
01:52:42,820 --> 01:52:49,820
left hand if there's a cool breeze coming
out of your fontanel bone area. Try to bend

843
01:53:06,650 --> 01:53:12,510
your head a little, little bit and about four
inches above the head, bend it a little, that

844
01:53:12,510 --> 01:53:19,510
works out better sometimes. With your left
hand, right hand towards Me and with the left

845
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:32,320
hand you see the breeze. Right hand towards
Me and then with the left hand you see, you

846
01:53:32,670 --> 01:53:38,610
can feel it better, with the left hand on
top of your head; first with the left hand.

847
01:53:38,610 --> 01:53:45,610
Aah. Now put the left hand towards Me and
with the right hand just see if it is blowing

848
01:53:46,990 --> 01:53:53,990
because it should come in both the hands.
Open your eyes, open slowly and watch Me without

849
01:53:58,030 --> 01:54:05,030
thinking. Let us see if you can do it - just
without thinking, just watch Me, without thinking.

850
01:54:09,570 --> 01:54:16,570
There's no thought in your mind, no thought.
Now just put your hands like this, are you

851
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:30,880
feeling the cool breeze in the hand?

852
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:36,870
Now put your hands up in the air, like this,
and in your heart ask a question, "Is this

853
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:42,900
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Ask the
question, put it up nicely, ask the question

854
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:49,610
three times: "Is this the cool breeze of the
Holy Ghost? Is this the brahma shakti? Is

855
01:54:49,610 --> 01:54:56,610
this the all-pervading power of God? Ask the
question. Now put down your hands and see

856
01:55:00,610 --> 01:55:07,610
for yourself if you feel the cool breeze.
All those who have felt the cool breeze on

857
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:21,400
the head, coming out of the head, or on their
fingertips or in the hands please raise your

858
01:55:24,730 --> 01:55:31,730
hands, both the hands. That's Blake. You all
have become Blake. May God bless you.

859
01:55:34,630 --> 01:55:41,620
So many. May God bless you. But I must warn
you, after this don't talk about it because

860
01:55:41,620 --> 01:55:48,300
it is beyond reasoning. Secondly you must
come back, must all of you come back and work

861
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:55,300
it out. Those who haven't got realization
will also receive it. Those who have got it,

862
01:55:56,330 --> 01:56:03,330
will establish it. Please come back. You will
enjoy the silence, the stillness within. But

863
01:56:08,110 --> 01:56:15,110
that's just the beginning of it. We have to
go further. Otherwise you won't be able to

864
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:22,440
manifest it properly. It has to be looked
after. It's just a shoot that has come out,

865
01:56:23,830 --> 01:56:30,830
a little shoot we have to look after it. May
God bless you all. Thank-you very much. Why

866
01:56:43,230 --> 01:56:50,230
not sing Jerusalem to them ... will be good
idea.

867
01:57:07,030 --> 01:57:14,030
Yogi: Mother with Your permission the music
group would like to sing one song for You

868
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:38,560
but before that we have a little memento of
this evening which we would like to present.

869
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:39,830
Shri Mataji: You want to sing, all right?
You have all the arrangements here. All right.

870
01:57:39,830 --> 01:57:42,400
If you don't mind, just sit down for five
minutes.

871
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:49,400
Yogi: So Garuda take wing.
While we were preparing the program of Blake's

872
01:57:53,180 --> 01:57:53,780
Birthday Festival Mother, we found out there
was an Exhibition of Blake's work in London

873
01:57:53,780 --> 01:58:00,780
in one of the galleries and we very much wanted
to give You something that was made by His

874
01:58:05,290 --> 01:58:12,290
own Hands and with the good wishes of all
the Sahaja yogis of England we've been able

875
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:17,460
to do it for You.
Shri Mataji: Oh that's too much, that's too

876
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:17,710
much Gavin, that's too much.

877
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:17,830
Yogi: No it's something special Mother, we
hope that it'll be our pledge to try to do

878
01:58:17,830 --> 01:58:18,080
some justice to You as You've tried to do
some justice to Blake.

879
01:58:18,040 --> 01:58:20,690
Shri Mataji: I'm so proud of Him, really.
Can you - I am not good at opening. Done so

880
01:58:20,690 --> 01:58:24,190
well. Ohh. What a beautiful one. Trigunatmika.
Do you see the trigunatmika is there? What

881
01:58:24,190 --> 01:58:24,440
a vision. I mean how can you understand Him
without Sahaja Yoga ... picture, you cannot

882
01:58:24,210 --> 01:58:24,460
... May God bless you. Thank-you very much

883
01:58:24,220 --> 01:58:31,220
Yogi: This is the engraving of 
the Daughters of Job from the illustrations
to Book of Job.

884
01:58:40,850 --> 01:58:41,900
Shri Mataji: What is?
Yogi: Daughters of Job.

885
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:48,900
Shri Mataji: Trigunatmika. Three Powers - the
Comforter, and the Counselor and the Redeemer,

886
01:59:00,140 --> 01:59:07,140
three Powers, which you will know, later on.
We have those three Powers within ourselves.

887
01:59:18,570 --> 01:59:18,920
Go ahead.

888
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:20,350
Yogi: [INAUDIBLE]
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

889
01:59:20,350 --> 01:59:21,130
[The mike is not all right. Loudly.]
Song: 'Seek and You Will Find'.

890
01:59:21,130 --> 01:59:21,380
Song: 'Jerusalem.' Yogi: We'd like everyone
to stand up to sing Jerusalem.

891
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:21,410
Shri Mataji: May God bless you all and bless
this country. God bless you.
