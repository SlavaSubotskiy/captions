1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,990
I’m really sorry for being late but your 
Grand Hotel here only delayed me.

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:14,480
We had ordered for a tea for forty-five minutes 
and they couldn’t prepare tea for us!

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,390
Now what’s happening to us here?

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:23,190
We have to understand that people are not 
normal in these modern times.

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,110
There’s something going wrong with them 
somewhere.

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:33,870
And maybe something serious is happening within 
us, which is giving such a collective effect

7
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,360
outside.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,090
Now the trouble is, we do not know what we 
are inside.

9
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:46,760
Unless and until we know what we are, unless 
and until there is light within us, we cannot

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,830
understand what the problem with us is.

11
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:58,040
We just accept whatever we know with whatever 
our limited awareness is.

12
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:05,760
Because the human awareness has not reached 
that state of fruitfulness where one can say

13
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,440
that, “I know definitely this is my use.

14
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,980
I know definitely, why I am here.

15
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:21,370
I know definitely, what is my purpose – why 
I became a human being from the amoeba stage;

16
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:26,280
why all these troubles were taken by the nature 
to make me a human being."

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,390
We have not been able to answer these questions 
at all.

18
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,890
But the human mind is such that it compromises 
with everything.

19
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:46,240
You see, it is like a little oyster which 
gets a stone inside its little house, the

20
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,240
shell.

21
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,750
So he says, “Alright, now I’m not going 
to bother much now.

22
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,750
It’s alright."

23
00:01:51,750 --> 00:02:00,750
So it goes on weaving around that little part 
of that stone, whatever it is, which is just

24
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,780
troubling it.

25
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,850
Then by some movement he gets a little more 
pinch, then he goes on again and again and

26
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,069
again like that.

27
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:12,360
That’s how we live in this world most of 
the time and we think, “Oh!

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,010
We are on top of the world.

29
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,930
Nothing is wrong with us,” till we come 
face to face to something that is disastrous.

30
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,970
Some disaster shocks us and then, “Oh!

31
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,450
How it happened?”

32
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,689
Like war.

33
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:36,909
Till we reach to the point of war, we are 
preparing for war in many ways.

34
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:41,700
But when the war breaks on us then we are 
shocked and we say, “Oh God!

35
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,799
What happened?”

36
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:47,810
Today the war is within, within ourselves, 
not without.

37
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,249
We are not realising how it is building up 
within ourselves.

38
00:02:52,249 --> 00:02:55,999
For example, cancer is the physical war within 
ourselves.

39
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:58,840
We are not aware of that.

40
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,700
We just accept our body as it is.

41
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,390
Tomorrow we go to the doctor and he says,“You 
have got cancer."

42
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,209
[So] we jump in the sea – finished!

43
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,790
We don’t know how it is caused, why it has 
caused, what have we done to ourselves?

44
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,299
Another person is alright for normal purposes.

45
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:20,769
Suddenly, the psychologist said that, “You 
better go to the lunatic asylum."

46
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:21,769
And we are there!

47
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:25,890
We find ourselves in a lunatics and we are 
wondering, “How is it I am here?

48
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,319
Supposed to be sane!”

49
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:37,420
Then you find certain people who are seeking 
their spirituality or all other seeking.

50
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,989
They think, “Oh we have got this, we’ve 
got that.

51
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:46,199
We should have this and we are now on top 
of the world!”

52
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,319
And where do you find yourself?

53
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,000
You have lost all your money, everything.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,150
You are nowhere.

55
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,680
You are a recluse.

56
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,840
You are fragmented.

57
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,709
You have no relationship with your society.

58
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:02,269
As you have come, you have added nothing to 
your society, nothing to yourself and have

59
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:05,450
just finished your life like that.

60
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:12,849
We have given nothing to the nature from which 
we have taken, nothing to the society that

61
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:18,810
we are living in, nothing to the country where 
we are, nothing to the universe that has made

62
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,829
us, and nothing to God who has created us.

63
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:27,770
Because in the name of God also I have seen 
such hocus-pocus going on.

64
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:33,669
All kinds of hocus-pocus going on in this 
world: you don’t imagine how far people

65
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:36,240
can go with this kind of a thing!

66
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,830
They want to make money.

67
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,810
All kinds of thing they’ll start, “Oh, 
there’s a place here.

68
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,470
If you go, you will get cured."

69
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:49,000
Thousands of people will be going there [but] 
it’s all hocus-pocus!

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,270
Just imagine!

71
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,389
All the money is exhausted, everything.

72
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:54,800
You find that, “Oh you have achieved nothing."

73
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,699
Then you think that, “Alright, let’s have 
some fun!”

74
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:00,419
At least you have nothing to do, “Let’s 
have some fun!”

75
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:09,639
So what is the idea for fun is also very funny 
because the fun is that how we give up our

76
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,639
respectability.

77
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:20,460
You see fun means: Today I saw…we went to 
a shop and we had parked at an angle from

78
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:30,710
the main road and there was a big pub where 
some boys, young boys, good, nice boys, were

79
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,970
taking some beer or something.

80
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,819
And a girl came and parked the car in one 
place.

81
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:41,889
When she went away they got down from their 
pub – they were on the balcony, came down,

82
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:48,159
lifted her car, actually lifted, all of them; 
put it on the other side and put the same

83
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,789
type of car in her place.

84
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:53,340
They took about, to do this, half an hour.

85
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:59,500
And they thought they were having fun: laughing, 
joking, this thing, that thing.

86
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,550
How can such foolish fun make you happy?

87
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,550
This is stupidity.

88
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,550
Wasting your time.

89
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,550
Idiocity.

90
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:11,460
I mean, I can understand a little boy doing 
it.

91
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,919
But behind it is something sinister.

92
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,680
As if they were possessed, I felt.

93
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,990
They didn’t know how much the girl will 
be worried unnecessarily.

94
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:28,380
On the contrary, if they had put in that much 
effort to do good to someone, the joy would

95
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,130
have been much more lasting.

96
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:38,540
But this is the problem with human beings, 
that they do not recognise, they do not know.

97
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,430
They have no moorings.

98
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,830
They cannot fathom where they are, where are 
they drifting.

99
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:54,480
As long as there’s nothing that is troubling 
them, they go on moving onto same lines.

100
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,440
Of course, in the modern times, despite all 
this, there’s a big seeking going on.

101
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,509
People are born with seeking.

102
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:03,590
Children are born with seeking.

103
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,320
From childhood, they find that there’s something 
wrong.

104
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,840
They find sometimes, even in their family, 
as if their parents, their relations are extremely

105
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,850
narrow-minded, they are very funny.

106
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,439
They find some people in the society extremely 
aggressive.

107
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,540
Or all kinds of things they find.

108
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,840
And then they open their eyes and they start 
seeing relatively, “Am I also one of them?

109
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,340
Am I going to be one of them?”

110
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:35,650
Then relatively they start seeing, “No, 
no, no, no, that’s not the life.

111
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,729
There’s something wrong."

112
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:43,190
Because these people who are born like that 
are of a different calibre, of a different

113
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,360
temperament, of a very different quality.

114
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:53,220
But they also gradually lose their quality 
when they get into the mundane life and when

115
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,349
they accept other people so easily.

116
00:07:55,349 --> 00:08:00,990
They also accept that, “Oh, alright, whatever 
was there was ego.

117
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,389
So this was too much of a ego in us.

118
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,150
It was a colossal ego within us.

119
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,719
By ego we dominated,” So they say, “Alright.

120
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:09,919
Let’s go back."

121
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,629
You try to become primitive.

122
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:15,199
Now you cannot become primitive because the 
brain is not.

123
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,870
Your brain is over-developed.

124
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:24,430
Even if you try, you cannot become primitive 
because in a primitive man, thinking process

125
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,530
is very little.

126
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:30,659
While what you do, your only life, is nothing 
but thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking,

127
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:31,659
thinking!

128
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:36,500
Like two horns of thinking all the time growing 
out of you and creating a circle all around

129
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
you!

130
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,760
How can you become primitive?

131
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:46,270
So also these are all only conceptions within 
ourselves or convictions that we’ll become

132
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,270
that.

133
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,820
By convictions, you do not become.

134
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:57,140
Supposing I have convinced myself that I am 
the Queen of England.

135
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,360
Will I become?

136
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,860
Or I get an idea, conceive an idea, that I 
am this and this.

137
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,860
Will I become?

138
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,280
I have to become!

139
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:15,200
I mean it is so simple as that, isn’t it.

140
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
It is so practical.

141
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,230
You see, if I tell you that you have to have 
your tea, alright.

142
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,440
Then you will say, “I have never had my 
tea.

143
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,470
What about the tea?”

144
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,520
Till you have it you have to have it.

145
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,660
But you’ll say, “No.

146
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:34,000
Alright, as long I said I will have my tea, 
up to that point it’s alright."

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,410
[As if] I have had already.

148
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:42,130
That kind of misconception we have: that without 
doing it we feel quite satisfied about it.

149
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,280
And this is called as The Great Illusion of 
Kali Yuga, called as ‘Mahamaya’.

150
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:52,510
Is the greatest illusion is this – that 
human beings are made to believe what they

151
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,620
are not.

152
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,090
They accept such a situation, many a times.

153
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:06,980
It’s alright in a drama, [if] you are watching 
a very big hero, say, Napoleon fighting and

154
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,980
Wellington fighting.

155
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,980
Suddenly you feel, “Oh, I am Napoleon!”

156
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,980
Maybe, alright.

157
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:18,080
But in real life also we get assumptions like 
that which are really falsehood which are

158
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
not ourselves.

159
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,220
So we come to the point – what are we?

160
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,550
Actually, what are we?

161
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,310
If these are assumptions and conceptions, 
what are we?

162
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,000
Really, what are we?

163
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,340
And we are nothing but the Spirit.

164
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:43,160
We are that Eternal Being within us, reflected, 
which is called as ‘Spirit’, the Atma.

165
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,290
That is what we are.

166
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,040
The rest of it has no meaning at all.

167
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:55,670
For example, there’s a lamp, which has no 
light in it – what will you do with it?

168
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,910
Say there is a tube which has no light in 
it – what do you think about it?

169
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:10,080
Supposing this machine is here and it doesn’t 
work – what do you call it ?

170
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
A junk!

171
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,330
In the same way, if we do not find out that 
light within us, if we do not enlighten ourselves

172
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:23,750
with that light, we are not finding out our 
meaning, our purpose.

173
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:30,390
We are wasting our life, either with our ego 
or with our conditioning.

174
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:35,390
Conditioning, of course, can be found out 
in no time.

175
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:40,360
Very easy to find out the conditioning, which 
takes place through this left side channel,

176
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,740
which is called as the Ida Nadi.

177
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,330
It’s a subtle channel within us called as 
‘Ida Nadi’.

178
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:56,820
This is the power we have got by which we 
desire.

179
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:03,040
In Sanskrit, this one is called as ‘Mahakali 
Power’.

180
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,600
The power of desire, by which we desire.

181
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,950
Desire does not have a materialised thing.

182
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:17,350
People may desire to become the King of England 
but that’s not so, isn’t it.

183
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,700
Just, it’s a desire.

184
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:26,740
So the power of desire comes through this 
one which is called as ‘Mahakali’.

185
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,580
This Power flows through in a channel called 
as ‘Ida’.

186
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,920
Now, the names are in Sanskrit.

187
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:41,090
The trouble is [that] all this was discovered 
thousands of year back by seers who gave it

188
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,530
a Sanskrit name.

189
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:47,320
Also it has some meaning that these names 
they got it from the Unconscious.

190
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:53,220
So these are not Sanskrit names but are the 
names actually of that thing.

191
00:12:53,220 --> 00:13:01,230
So this is the Ida nadi which manifests within 
us the power of desire.

192
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:08,270
It is also called as ‘Chandra Nadi’ meaning 
the Line of Moon.

193
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:17,060
On the right hand side, you see another power 
by which we act, the power of action; called

194
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:26,970
as the Mahasaraswati Power which resides within 
us as the power to act.

195
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,700
In two ways, we act.

196
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,800
And also power to act, to think.

197
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,930
Like whatever we have to do, we think about 
it.

198
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:45,920
So, it can be divided into two halves: one 
is when we act because of our physical capacities,

199
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,680
and when we think, because of our rational 
capacity.

200
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,130
So these two powers reside within us in a 
very subtle way.

201
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:04,880
And outside they express themselves in the 
gross as two sympathetic nervous systems,

202
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,140
called as left and the right sympathetic nervous 
system.

203
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:16,500
By the left sympathetic nervous system, we 
accept all the conditioning, which Freud has

204
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:22,440
described, as conditioning, through this one, 
because it takes you to your past.

205
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,600
So this represents the line of your past.

206
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,250
The right hand side one gives you the future.

207
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,750
That is the one which gives us the idea of 
the future.

208
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,490
For example, animals do not have much idea 
of the future.

209
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,770
They mostly live with their conditioning.

210
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:47,660
Only their left side is really developed, 
so much so, that the pineal body, which is

211
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:54,010
in our brain, which controls our Left Side, 
is more developed in animals than in human

212
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,010
beings.

213
00:14:55,010 --> 00:15:02,720
Then, as a human being, your Right Side starts 
working because we think, we speak, and we

214
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,550
think of the future, [so] Right Side is developed.

215
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:13,550
With the conditioning, you develop a superego 
by which you can be a person who is very frightened,

216
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:20,120
who takes aggressions from others, who are 
very subdued, over-subdued.

217
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,510
You run away from your duties.

218
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,040
You escape things.

219
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,890
Lots of things are there if you are overdeveloped 
[on the] Left Side.

220
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,520
But if you have overdeveloped [the] Right 
Side then you develop that horrible yellow

221
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,860
thing like a bile called as Mr.

222
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,190
Ego.

223
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:41,820
And this ego today is quite prevalent everywhere 
and is a big problem because after Realisation

224
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,761
we start seeing it and then we don’t know 
whether to laugh or to cry the way things

225
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:47,761
work out.

226
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:55,380
So this ego is also responsible for our funny 
behaviour towards others.

227
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:02,950
Now the problem of ego is that people do not 
find it out till they really suffer badly.

228
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:07,771
Because ego is something that doesn’t give 
trouble to the individual so much, as to the

229
00:16:07,771 --> 00:16:09,310
society.

230
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,800
It gives to the society.

231
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,420
For example, such a place or a such a community 
where the ego is prevalent, the families will

232
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:24,920
break and the societies will break, people 
will be extremely arrogant and troublemakers

233
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:31,650
and they will be the ones who will have all 
kinds of aggressions on other countries and

234
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,880
they will not allow anybody to aggress them.

235
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,380
They will suppress other people.

236
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,590
This is Mr.

237
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,790
Ego working.

238
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,120
So you do not find the mistake of the ego.

239
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,300
Ego can be developed with so many things by 
the society itself.

240
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:49,220
Like you must have seen they always say that, 
“If you wear this dress you will look very

241
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,220
nice."

242
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,220
Now you think, “Ah, that’s the one I should 
go in for.

243
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,070
Oh, that’s the one for me!”

244
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:59,340
All such pampering of that ego can be worked 
out in a society, which is absolutely hovering

245
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,580
with ego.

246
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:07,170
Now to say that ego is better or superego 
is better, I say both are equally the same,

247
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,250
because both take you away from reality.

248
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,890
While reality is in the centre is the most 
beautiful thing, and that is you.

249
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,839
These are artificial, two balloons.

250
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,040
They can be punctured in no time and you could 
be yourself.

251
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,829
They are just trying to put you down.

252
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:28,180
Whether it is ego or superego, they are hiding 
your Spirit, which is in your heart.

253
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:35,169
Now we have an arrangement within us, which 
God has created within us, very beautiful

254
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:36,402
– because He has created everything within 
us.

255
00:17:36,402 --> 00:17:39,010
We have not created anything within us.

256
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,990
Even if you want one hair to grow, we cannot 
make it grow!

257
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,730
I mean every thing He has done.

258
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,930
We have done nothing about ourself or about 
nature.

259
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,670
We cannot transform one flower into a fruit, 
that’s what we are.

260
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,590
But we think no end of ourselves because of 
Mr.

261
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,070
Ego being there, you see.

262
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,720
Because he makes us feel, “Oh!

263
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
We are great!”

264
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,180
Some people even say, “How can there be 
God?

265
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,250
After all, we have done this, we have done 
that!”

266
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,190
Now, I ask them, “What have you done?

267
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,230
Except for changing a chair to a table and 
table to a chair!”

268
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:17,340
And then the chair sits on your head and the 
table also sits on your head because you cannot

269
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,260
live without them.

270
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:26,020
The matter, which we have converted from dead 
to dead, is also giving us habits.

271
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,090
So we have done nothing!

272
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,230
To think that we have achieved something is 
really tomfoolery.

273
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:36,690
But see in the nature, see everywhere – the 
living work of God is so evident.

274
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,180
What a tremendous power is working it out.

275
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,980
After all, you have become a human being from 
amoeba.

276
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,900
How have you become?

277
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,910
There must be some tremendous power that has 
done this.

278
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,890
And what is that power?

279
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,800
That is what we have to become.

280
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:58,750
Now within us also lies that special thing 
called as ‘Kundalini’ which is a three

281
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,680
and a half coiled power within us, which is 
our germinating power.

282
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,760
This power we have to awaken.

283
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:14,740
If this power is awakened, then She rises 
in the centre, in the present, integrating

284
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:20,900
all these centres: one, two, three, four, 
five, six, seven centres.

285
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:30,220
All of them representing our seven beings 
within us; also representing our growth in

286
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:36,480
the evolutionary process, like the milestones, 
integrating all of them, enlightening them.

287
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,820
And She takes us to that point where we become, 
again I say ‘we become’!

288
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
We do not assume.

289
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,860
It’s not a conception.

290
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,860
You become.

291
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,860
You become that.

292
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,400
You become the Spirit.

293
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,960
You become Realised.

294
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,790
You get Realisation.

295
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,410
It is not just talking about it.

296
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,900
It has to happen.

297
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,250
If it does not happen, say, it does not happen 
to my own children, I will say, “It does

298
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,250
not happen.

299
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,250
What can I do about it?

300
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,610
I cannot sprout your seed!”

301
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,760
The seed has to be sprouted and sprouting 
has to take place.

302
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,420
It’s not a plastic seed.

303
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,559
It is the real seed.

304
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,180
And every real seed must be sprouted.

305
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,930
And every real seed can be sprouted.

306
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:26,510
But unless and until it is sprouted we cannot 
say that it is there.

307
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:31,790
Now the sprouting of the seed takes place 
by the rising of the Kundalini, going through

308
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:37,900
all these centres and piercing through this 
area called as the fontanel bone.

309
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,100
Now you know that you are ‘baptised’.

310
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,030
This bone is baptised here.

311
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,200
But nobody knows what it means, the baptism.

312
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,309
Christ has said, “You have to be born again."

313
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:54,300
Now how many churches are doing that job?

314
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,700
Only by giving a so-called blessing over here, 
do you get awakening of your Kundalini?

315
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,170
I mean, let us face it!

316
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:13,150
By going to any one of these Theological colleges 
and Theo (God) experts, can they produce this

317
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,150
effect?

318
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,120
Because this college is different.

319
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,030
This is the college of God.

320
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:25,540
Your authority doesn’t come by wearing a 
particular type of a dress and the gown and

321
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,300
standing very seriously and saying, “Alright, 
I bless you!”

322
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,410
Who are you to bless?

323
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,410
It’s such a mockery going on!

324
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:36,250
I mean, they have no right, they have no authority, 
they have no technique.

325
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:43,360
Same about Hindus in India: I mean, if you 
think that Hindus are sensible people, you

326
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,360
are sadly mistaken.

327
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,890
We have thugs, absolute thugs as Brahmins.

328
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:51,640
They are not Brahmins, they are actually Roman 
soldiers born in India.

329
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,049
You see their faces.

330
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:56,340
In Benares, especially they look like Romans!

331
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:01,500
Horribly dishonest and aggressive they are.

332
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,690
It’s all mockery going on in the name of 
God.

333
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,770
But when the Kundalini really rises before 
a person, who is an authorised person, you

334
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:15,590
can see with your naked eyes the pulsation 
of the Kundalini in the triangular bone, even

335
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,110
above it, wherever it is there.

336
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,650
Now there are so many people here who have 
seen.

337
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,850
In London, we have so many people who have 
seen it.

338
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:30,300
But, still the question of ego is quite a 
lot; it’s quite a lot because people can’t

339
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,300
believe it.

340
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,550
They just don’t want to believe it.

341
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,260
They want to continue with their nonsense.

342
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,180
They just don’t want to get it.

343
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,720
And also, they feel, “Why Mataji?

344
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,850
Why should she do it?”

345
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:47,020
I mean, I said, “Now if it is my lot, what 
am I to do?

346
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,883
Now you better do it!”

347
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:51,270
If you can take my place, I’ll be very happy 
to settle down.

348
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,420
Now, you know I have been travelling, travelling 
for months together.

349
00:22:54,420 --> 00:23:02,460
Now Portugal, from Portugal I came then this 
programme, that programme and it’s too much!

350
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,090
But what I feel that if supposing that’s 
my work, I should do it, isn’t it?

351
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,900
And whatever is your work, you should do it!

352
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,760
I mean, I don’t feel that.

353
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,570
You know so many other things [that] I do 
not know.

354
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,570
I don’t know even how to drive!

355
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,460
I’m so bad at many things!

356
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,570
So I do not feel bad.

357
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,540
Why should you feel so bad if I know the work 
of Kundalini?

358
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:27,170
Moreover, I do it out of love; just love, 
nothing but love.

359
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,320
In that love I find also lots of happiness 
and that is what is essential.

360
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,740
I have come for that purpose only.

361
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,740
It has to be done.

362
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,470
If it is not done, what is going to happen 
to this human race?

363
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,310
Nothing but destruction you can see it clearly, 
writ large.

364
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:44,929
It’s not a frivolous thing that we should 
give up.

365
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:48,000
We have to understand that we have to get 
transformed.

366
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,920
The whole human race has to be transformed.

367
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,480
And this is the Last Judgment today.

368
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,090
It has started.

369
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,929
You are going to be judged by your Kundalini.

370
00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:57,929
How?

371
00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:00,809
God is not going to weigh you, how many seers 
(an Indian measure equal to 1.25kg) you weigh.

372
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:05,120
Like the way you have here beauty competitions.

373
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,540
It is the Kundalini, which is going to say 
how far you are.

374
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,200
I have seen people in Birmingham before I 
have come.

375
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,920
I found, I am sorry to say, but in Birmingham 
I have seen [that] people are very frivolous.

376
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,120
They come to my programme, get their Realisation 
– finished!

377
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,330
They are not bothered about it, to see what 
it is, what they have to do, why they got

378
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,330
it.

379
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:32,210
It’s like Christ’s parable that: you throw 
some seeds here and some seeds there and so

380
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,480
many of them are just wasted.

381
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:43,510
It’s such a sad tale of human callousness 
and lack of self-esteem.

382
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:49,070
Absolutely, it is a very sad tale.

383
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,280
You do not know what we are facing.

384
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,340
And that’s why people play with their lives 
in such a cheap way.

385
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,990
It’s most surprising.

386
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:02,100
Tomorrow their children are going to teach 
them a lesson!

387
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,010
And I don’t know what’s going to happen 
to your children.

388
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:15,991
So now, I have to request you to be attentive 
about it, to get to it, work it out, have

389
00:25:15,991 --> 00:25:26,130
it within you and know all the knowledge about 
yourself and about the Spirit.

390
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:31,330
It is a very simple thing to give Realisation 
but very difficult, in this country specially,

391
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:35,010
to maintain it.

392
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:46,020
So, for you, it is necessary to put in an 
effort after Realisation, not before.

393
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,750
Before you cannot.

394
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,929
Before that somebody will work it out.

395
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:55,250
But after Realisation, you have to look after 
yourself, look after your being.

396
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,890
This is what you have to see, this is what 
you have to have.

397
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:06,890
Now some people have been to some other things 
like I would say ‘TM’ (Transcendental

398
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:07,890
‘Meditation’) now.

399
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:08,890
I went to Portugal.

400
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,790
I was surprised the boys had nothing.

401
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,270
They did not know what they were doing.

402
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,580
They did not know they had no feeling, nothing.

403
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,330
They did not know if they were Realised or 
not Realised, if I was Realised or not Realised.

404
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,360
They had no sensitivity, they had no awareness 
developed, nothing!

405
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:30,620
What they were doing was saying some ‘mantra’, 
and by saying that mantra, they were really

406
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:35,220
cutting out all the sensitivities within them 
because these were artificial things.

407
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,570
I mean, you can do it.

408
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,570
Why take mantra?

409
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,650
Even if you say, “Stone, stone, stone, stone, 
stone, stone,” and go on saying for three

410
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,500
months, you will be in the lunatic asylum.

411
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,500
And the people from this TM now are coming 
as epilepsy.

412
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:52,380
We have here two people who have come with 
epilepsy.

413
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,929
But I told them, “Why don’t you tell your 
mantra?”

414
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:55,940
They said, “Why do You want to know?”

415
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:02,320
I said, “Because you are under that conditioning 
which I have to remove.

416
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,950
I know already but you have to tell me to 
show the courage that you want to get rid

417
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:07,950
of it."

418
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:08,950
They said, “It’s a secret."

419
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,760
I said, “How can that be a secret?”

420
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,890
What is secret in nature?

421
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,210
Have you seen anything?

422
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,730
See the ocean.

423
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,720
See the flowers.

424
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:25,720
The best is open.

425
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:32,900
Absolutely the whole Brahma, the whole Truth 
is open.

426
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:38,530
If it is not open, it is not Truth.

427
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:42,570
If it is hidden, how can it be the Truth?

428
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,800
Truth is light.

429
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,143
It has to be transparent, absolutely clear-cut.

430
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:50,830
But this secrecy business can be only with 
thugs and with mafias and things like that,

431
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,110
because they are afraid.

432
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,690
They are afraid of the statues of God, of 
His laws.

433
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:01,280
That’s why it is a secret.

434
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,799
In nature or in any God’s work, in any great 
man’s life, what was secret?

435
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:13,450
They were standing on top of the hills and 
mountains and shouting, “Be awakened, you

436
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,290
the blind!”

437
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:19,600
What was done secretly in Christ’s life, 
I would like to know.

438
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,960
Was there anything secretive in His lifetime?

439
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,299
Why this kind of a secrecy working?

440
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:31,390
Why not people understand?

441
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:39,520
It is important that human beings must know 
that the time has come for them to transform;

442
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:46,210
to enter into the kingdom of God; to be the 
citizen of God; to be looked after by His

443
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,210
angels and all-pervading Divine love.

444
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,840
He is a Father who is compassion and love.

445
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,390
He forgives all our sins and everything because 
He wants us to have all His powers and all

446
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,730
His beauty.

447
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:08,250
You cannot understand a Father of that kind 
who is absolutely, impatiently waiting for

448
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,110
you, who is so anxious.

449
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:20,540
And that is the only concern He has out of 
everything that, “When are my children going

450
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:25,050
to know me?”

451
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:31,180
At this stage, when we cling on to things, 
which are useless, and nonsense.

452
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,480
You must know that, “What did we know in 
our awareness?”

453
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,340
This is the only question you should ask yourself.

454
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,340
Do I know what’s the matter with this person?

455
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,560
Do I know what’s the matter with me?

456
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,520
If there is light, I will know.

457
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,620
I will know the other person as well as myself.

458
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,540
Supposing you have a light in your hand, you 
see yourself and you see the other person.

459
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:56,960
But if there is light within you, you see 
your light and in your light you see the other

460
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,960
person.

461
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,940
That’s what happens in Realisation that 
you get collectively conscious, you become

462
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,940
collectively conscious.

463
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,950
Again I say, you actualise that awareness.

464
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:11,850
It is not that I tell you, you are all brothers 
and sisters but it just happens to you that

465
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,309
you start feeling others on your fingertips.

466
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:19,559
This is a very dynamic thing should happen 
to all of you.

467
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,870
It’s not per chance I am here.

468
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:26,330
It looks like that because my husband got 
elected to this post and I had to come from

469
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,330
India.

470
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,910
But it’s not per chance.

471
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,710
It is the tribute to this great country that 
I had to be here and tribute to my English

472
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,620
children that I had to be here to look after 
you.

473
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:40,480
For I must tell you, I have told so many people, 
and I must tell you – of course it should

474
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:47,770
not give you ego but is a simple thing – that 
English young people are the best in the whole

475
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,770
world.

476
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:53,990
Among all the young people, they are sensible, 
scholarly, wise, logical.

477
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,320
If you give them logic, they are sensible.

478
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,600
But for Birmingham, I cannot say just now.

479
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,070
Let’s see how it works out.

480
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:06,340
We have some very good high people, very great 
people but some.

481
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:11,370
On the whole, England is the heart of the 
whole universe.

482
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,370
From here, everything circulates.

483
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,559
You have no idea of this country.

484
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,950
You have no esteem of this country.

485
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,720
The way we have tortured our motherland here.

486
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,530
I wish people could know.

487
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,740
She is suffering within herself.

488
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:30,440
Only Blake has cried, he has cried of Jerusalem 
and that’s what I’m talking about.

489
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,000
He could see that vision because he was that 
sensitive.

490
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,970
He’s the one who was a Realised soul, and 
he was that sensitive, He could feel it.

491
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:43,150
And the way he has described, the way he has 
talked [about] the glory of this country.

492
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:51,090
All this inertia, all this lethargy, all these 
curses that are settling into this country

493
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:54,810
are because of our foolishness and stupidity.

494
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,360
You are the most dynamic people.

495
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,500
And not only that, in spirituality you are 
very dynamic.

496
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,330
For your spiritual work, you can be very, 
very dynamic.

497
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:08,650
You are the ones who are going to throw away 
all the shackles of nonsense and you are the

498
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:13,260
ones who are going to recreate a beautiful 
arena for the whole world.

499
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,580
That’s why I am here.

500
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,240
I have been here for six years, you won’t 
believe that.

501
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,170
And again I am here for six years, perhaps, 
I hope so.

502
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:27,200
I hope something substantial will be done 
in all the parts where the English, who are

503
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,490
my children, who are saints of the past, are 
born in this country.

504
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:39,490
Receive this and settle into it and not waste 
the energy in the ego that your forefathers

505
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:46,130
did: who were nonsensical, they just wasted 
their life!

506
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,480
Because you are not the same.

507
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,530
You are different people.

508
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,550
You are people, very different.

509
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,170
Your aspirations are different.

510
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:57,500
Of course there were some great people also 
in the past, I am not saying that, but not

511
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,240
so many as there are today.

512
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:07,440
But they will be lost if they try to follow 
the mundane type of understanding of life.

513
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,270
It is much subtler, much greater.

514
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:13,850
Unless and until you are Realised, you cannot 
understand what I am talking.

515
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,540
Krishna has said, “yasa pashyati sa pashyati” 
(यः पश्यति स पश्यति)(Bhagavad

516
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,660
Geeta 5.5) (meaning) “The one who can see, 
can only see,” [So] what’s the use of

517
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,660
talking to the blind?

518
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,660
And I went to see Mr.

519
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,070
Mascaró (who translated Bhagavad Geeta into 
English), you might have heard his name from

520
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,660
Cambridge and, aaah, the love and everything!

521
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,440
The way he surrendered himself and absolutely.

522
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,600
And he said, “Mother, ya sah pashyati sa 
pashyati!”

523
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,160
The one who can see can only see.

524
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,160
How many can see you?

525
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,160
Can they see you?”

526
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,160
I said, “I am sorry, not so many.

527
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,160
I am sorry for them."

528
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,611
He said, “I have a friend who has a Nobel 
Prize and he has developed this thing ,and

529
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:45,611
he’s got a Nobel prize.

530
00:33:45,611 --> 00:33:48,350
Oh, he’s so blind, he’s so blind!

531
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:52,919
He doesn’t know Who has given him this power, 
how has he got this.

532
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,510
Who has made this universe, he doesn’t know.

533
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,850
But how can you talk to him?”

534
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,210
I said, “He’ll come.

535
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:02,090
He’ll come when many will be there.

536
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,510
Then they start thinking, “Oh, so many have 
gone?

537
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,330
Let’s also follow!’”

538
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,399
But the transformation is the only way which 
is the most convincing.

539
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:14,139
If there is no transformation in you, who 
is going to believe in Sahaja Yoga or in me?

540
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:18,720
Like many people who know me personally say 
that “You are unique.

541
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,720
You are different.

542
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,999
But we can’t believe that you can transform 
people."

543
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:22,999
I am not transforming.

544
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:25,309
There is already all [the] arrangements there!

545
00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:28,809
All the cord is there, just to put to the 
plug to the mains!

546
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:29,809
That’s all I am doing.

547
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:30,809
I am not transforming them!

548
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:34,229
You are just ready for it and it works out.

549
00:34:34,229 --> 00:34:36,480
So please take your Realisation.

550
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,009
Maintain it.

551
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,030
And receive that glory which is meant for 
you.

552
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,030
May God bless you.

553
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,030
Questions, please.

554
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,030
Not nonsensical, “I read in a book of a 
tantric…” and this and that.

555
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,030
All that I don’t want to discuss any library 
and any controversial points.

556
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,030
Please ask something sensible.

557
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,030
And I think you will know what to ask.

558
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,030
Thank you.

559
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,030
Thank you very much.

560
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,030
Without any fear, I am your Mother.

561
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,030
I am not a guru.

562
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,200
Absolutely, I am your Mother.

563
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,679
You are your own guru.

564
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:57,849
Only thing [is] I have to give you the keys 
of your gurudom, that’s all.

565
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:06,670
Just ask me a very simple question, coming 
from simplicity, not complicated.

566
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:10,650
How many!

567
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:19,609
I must say we got fifty people.

568
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:21,599
Just I had gone for a wedding.

569
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,239
Imagine, to have fifty people Realised.

570
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:24,849
And such great love.

571
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:26,869
You don’t know how much.

572
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:28,490
And the recognition is so great.

573
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,410
I mean, I was amazed at those people.

574
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:34,009
I think poverty is a blessing in a way.

575
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:41,150
Wonderful people, very beautiful.

576
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:44,720
Questions please.

577
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,540
I mean, many of you cannot think because your 
Kundalini has crossed this (Agnya).

578
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,569
When it crosses Agnya, you cannot think.

579
00:35:50,569 --> 00:35:55,150
You go into thoughtless awareness, so you 
just cannot think.

580
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,880
Even if you want, you cannot think, that’s 
the problem.

581
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,329
So just try to think!

582
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:03,910
This is your own Kundalini which is transforming.

583
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:10,619
In Australia today, I received a trunk call 
from Australia and they said, “Mother, we

584
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:13,319
don’t have to say anything about anything.

585
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:15,079
Just the Kundalini does the job!”

586
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:18,489
Now these Australians were supposed to be 
convicts and things!

587
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:21,519
Imagine their children are doing such wonders!

588
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:25,859
Much more than in England, for your information.

589
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:50,210
Two boys came to India, two of them, and they 
have got now two hundred people.

590
00:36:50,210 --> 00:37:01,880
Hm, what is it, what is it?( Somebody asks 
a question.)

591
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,150
What is he saying?

592
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:12,490
“I, I, I” I only hear “I, I, I."

593
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:22,019
Yogi: He says there are lots of people he 
knows in Birmingham who feel in a similar

594
00:37:22,019 --> 00:37:27,960
way, that they have given up.

595
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:34,880
They have been disappointed and given up.

596
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,829
Shri Mataji: What is disappointment?

597
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:42,509
Is it selling something here?

598
00:37:42,509 --> 00:37:46,390
Your whole attitude is of ego.

599
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:53,690
We are disappointment in you or in me?

600
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,910
Yogi: No he says other people, not him.

601
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,109
People he knows.

602
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,890
Shri Mataji: What are they disappointed?

603
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,769
Seeker: They just talk about life and different 
things, you know.

604
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:03,769
Things don’t work out.

605
00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:04,769
Shri Mataji: What is it?

606
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:05,769
Related to them.

607
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:06,769
No.

608
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:07,769
Isn’t it?

609
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:15,779
Seeker: A lot of people around us feel how 
confused and corrupt and other things, you

610
00:38:15,779 --> 00:38:16,779
know.

611
00:38:16,779 --> 00:38:23,160
And we are part of them.

612
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:44,000
How I am now, I’ll tell you the truth, I’m 
declining and I don’t like it.

613
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:59,140
This here, to me, is like a last chance, you 
know, for me trying to understand this world.

614
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,140
Shri Mataji: Alright.

615
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,140
You are a very nice boy.

616
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,140
And this should work out.

617
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,151
Now what you said is correct but even if you 
want to love somebody, people don’t like

618
00:39:06,151 --> 00:39:07,151
it.

619
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:08,151
You see, they want to hate.

620
00:39:08,151 --> 00:39:09,151
This is possible.

621
00:39:09,151 --> 00:39:10,299
I do not say.

622
00:39:10,299 --> 00:39:11,769
But now how to make people love?

623
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:18,279
Even when we love somebody, we do not love 
the way it should be Divine.

624
00:39:18,279 --> 00:39:22,809
The Divine love is something like the sap 
rising in the tree.

625
00:39:22,809 --> 00:39:29,319
It goes to every part of the tree, goes to 
all the flowers, doesn’t get attached to

626
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:30,570
any one and comes back.

627
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:37,499
Supposing it gets attached to one flower, 
“This is my flower, my child, my son, my

628
00:39:37,499 --> 00:39:39,710
community, my, my, my."

629
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,710
Alright?

630
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,710
It’s finished.

631
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:45,150
The tree is finished, the flower is finished.

632
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,150
Alright?

633
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,230
So the Divine love is, is all-pervading.

634
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,069
It exists all the time.

635
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:51,140
It articulates within us.

636
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,819
But still we are not feeling it.

637
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:55,310
Like I would say there is ether here.

638
00:39:55,310 --> 00:40:00,000
There are lots of scenes and sceneries here, 
but we cannot see.

639
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,809
When you just plug a television, you start 
seeing them, catching them.

640
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:10,380
In the same way, your television is not yet 
plugged, that’s why people are disappointed.

641
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:15,109
You are disappointed actually in yourself 
because you find that, “What is this instrument

642
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:16,499
for?”

643
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:19,229
Sometimes it is loved by somebody.

644
00:40:19,229 --> 00:40:21,029
Somebody it is thrown by somebody.

645
00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:24,900
Somebody tries to mishandle sometimes.

646
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,170
Somebody wants to fondle it.

647
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:29,339
What sort of an instrument is this one?

648
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:36,739
But then you reach a point where you become 
the Spirit, and the Spirit enjoys itself.

649
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:41,960
The joy the Spirit has is enjoying itself 
all the time.

650
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,719
Our Spirit is enjoying itself.

651
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:46,270
It is not bothered whether other loves you 
or not.

652
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,990
It doesn’t bother.

653
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,650
The Spirit in your heart enjoys itself.

654
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,650
Alright?

655
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,880
But what happens [is that] we are not aware 
of it.

656
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:01,259
So when this thing happens to you, your attention 
becomes enlightened by that enjoyment of the

657
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:03,249
Spirit and you enjoy.

658
00:41:03,249 --> 00:41:05,380
You become a different person all together.

659
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,380
You forget all this.

660
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:12,200
All these discriminations, nonsenses, everything 
drops out just like that because you become

661
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,880
that Universal Being.

662
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,530
This is not talking only, my child, it is 
happening.

663
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:18,849
It has to happen.

664
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:22,839
When it will happen, you will see the whole 
world will be changed.

665
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:24,849
That has to change.

666
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:29,839
After all, God never created some place here 
and some place there, He created one universe

667
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:30,839
and one world.

668
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:32,519
It is human beings madly, they have changed 
[it].

669
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,390
“Now this is your territory, this is mine!”

670
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,390
It’s all falsehood!

671
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,390
To me it is a myth.

672
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:40,549
You know, till the end I had to go to Portugal.

673
00:41:40,549 --> 00:41:43,719
I had not taken my visa – can you imagine?

674
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,719
– in the morning.

675
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:46,519
Then they asked me, “What about your visa?”

676
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:47,519
I said, “What visa?”

677
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:48,519
“To Portugal."

678
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:49,519
I said, “I never do.

679
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:50,519
I have to take visa?”

680
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:53,092
He said, “Of course you have to take a visa!”

681
00:41:53,092 --> 00:41:55,059
So in the morning, you see, everybody has 
to rush from my husband’s office to get

682
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:56,059
their visa.

683
00:41:56,059 --> 00:41:57,250
I just travel just like that.

684
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,079
I thought, “What is the need?”

685
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:02,410
Like a criminal carrying the number of your 
passport and everything.

686
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:05,910
Isn’t it funny?

687
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:10,079
Imagine to a person like me who is absolutely 
naive in human affairs.

688
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,079
It’s absurd.

689
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:12,329
Why to carry on this?

690
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:20,420
After all, we are all human beings created 
by one God, on one Earth, in complete unison.

691
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:25,529
We are part and parcel of that one Primordial 
Being.

692
00:42:25,529 --> 00:42:30,630
We are cells in that body of that Great Being.

693
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,609
And we are fragmented.

694
00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:38,650
That’s why, once you know that you are the 
part of that, your fragmentation goes away

695
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,180
and you become that.

696
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:43,650
You become that.

697
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:51,359
Then all your sense of security is established, 
all your self-esteem is established, all your

698
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,650
glory comes to you and you start distributing 
it.

699
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:59,400
I say [that] this is the meeting point of 
capitalism into to communism.

700
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,000
When you have no capitalism means in the sense 
you have no capital of your own.

701
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,670
After all these capitals, all will vanish.

702
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:06,849
This is useless.

703
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:09,309
But the capital of your Spirit, when you have, 
you distribute.

704
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:10,769
You give.

705
00:43:10,769 --> 00:43:13,709
That’s the greatest communism.

706
00:43:13,709 --> 00:43:16,140
You can’t live without it.

707
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,670
You have to distribute your love.

708
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:23,970
See if I don’t get any human beings then 
I’ll get some plants or something or some

709
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:27,099
flowers, I’ll try to love them.

710
00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:28,300
It’s like that.

711
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,300
Alright?

712
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,741
You just wait and see.

713
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,999
And you get all of them who are disappointed 
for nothing at all.

714
00:43:33,999 --> 00:43:35,520
Their connections are loose still.

715
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,569
I have to just screw them up a little.

716
00:43:39,569 --> 00:43:41,039
Alright?

717
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:42,519
( laughing)

718
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:47,539
Not to get disappointed my child the Reality 
is so beautiful.

719
00:43:47,539 --> 00:43:49,609
It’s just lying ahead of us.

720
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:51,270
Don’t be worried.

721
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,270
Everything is going to be alright.

722
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,270
Alright?

723
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,270
May God bless you.

724
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,270
Now any other question?

725
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:56,270
What a sweet thing to say, isn’t it?

726
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:59,230
You want to ask some questions?

727
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:07,519
Lady seeker: Can you tell us about death?

728
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,630
Shri Mataji: Death?

729
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:13,740
Lady seeker: Yes

730
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:20,460
Shri Mataji: Now, why of all the things?

731
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:24,780
Alright, I’ll tell you.

732
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,020
Death doesn’t exist.

733
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:32,339
There’s nothing like death.

734
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:40,020
We are made of five cocoons, you see.

735
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:44,949
One of them is the cocoon of food called as 
annamay kosh (अन्नमय कोश

736
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:46,099
– made from food).

737
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:50,210
Only that drops out (on death).

738
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:55,619
And also a little bit of water within us also 
drops out.

739
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:56,619
The rest of it remains.

740
00:44:56,619 --> 00:44:57,660
Nothing to die!

741
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:04,969
I wish we could die but we cannot! (laughing) 
It’s just changing of cloths!

742
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:11,720
Like when I came to Birmingham, I just changed 
my clothes in the hotel and came here: to

743
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,250
be refreshed, to be new.

744
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,440
It’s just like that.

745
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:24,059
As our clothes become dirty, we change them, 
or become old, we just change it.

746
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:25,539
That’s all.

747
00:45:25,539 --> 00:45:29,999
Death doesn’t exist, it’s a myth.

748
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:34,681
But we believe – you see, this is another 
conception – that by dying we solve the

749
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:35,681
problem.

750
00:45:35,681 --> 00:45:41,200
Like we had some Swedish girls, much younger, 
seventeen year old girls and they had vibrations

751
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,630
just like a dead body!

752
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:43,630
I was amazed.

753
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:48,640
I called them in my house and I said, “What’s 
the matter with you?

754
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,099
Why are you having such vibrations?

755
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:51,319
What are you doing?

756
00:45:51,319 --> 00:45:52,710
What is your pastime?”

757
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,519
They said, “Mother, our main thing is that 
we are planning how to commit suicide!”

758
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:57,999
Can you imagine?

759
00:45:57,999 --> 00:46:02,130
Sweden, the most affluent country.

760
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:11,400
The young girls of seventeen years, blossoming 
like flowers, should think of their death.

761
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,609
Why?

762
00:46:13,609 --> 00:46:19,410
Because what does not die, is your Spirit.

763
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:22,089
You seek your Spirit.

764
00:46:22,089 --> 00:46:28,829
That’s why people want death because they 
have not found that eternal thing.

765
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:30,839
Nothing dies.

766
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:33,859
It’s a myth.

767
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:44,739
You should think of life and of eternal life.

768
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:55,150
If we really want to be sensible, we should 
really not think of death because then we

769
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:59,880
go onto the left hand side, onto the subconscious, 
then into the collective subconscious.

770
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:05,310
Like these, you must have seen these supernatural 
business going on, you see, and then you can

771
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:11,019
be possessed by them and you can be very much 
in trouble.

772
00:47:11,019 --> 00:47:16,869
Now practically every day I must be driving 
them out in thousands, can you imagine?

773
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:25,130
Yesterday I went to a place where there were 
all installed there very nicely, some old

774
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:26,849
johnnies sitting there still.

775
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:29,980
I said, “Now, why don’t you depart and 
take your births?

776
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,240
Or go to your own places?”

777
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,880
They just don’t want to go.

778
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,950
They act as, what you call, these spirits 
and things like that.

779
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:40,950
So forget it.

780
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:50,369
We have to live in the present because it’s 
the most beautiful thing, absolutely beauty.

781
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:56,979
What is in death?

782
00:47:56,979 --> 00:47:59,260
Nothing to be so serious.

783
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,660
Cheerfulness is the sign of life.

784
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:07,599
What are you all upset about so much?

785
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,910
What is your problem?

786
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:15,549
Now tell me.

787
00:48:15,549 --> 00:48:23,359
All the problems can be solved if you get 
your Realisation, believe me, even so called

788
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:24,380
material problems.

789
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:28,690
Not to that extent.

790
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:37,380
You will not become [Mr.] Fords but you will 
be satisfied souls and also you will have

791
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,380
sufficient.

792
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,940
“Yoga kshema vahamyaham”, Krishna has 
said.

793
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:43,450
(meaning) “When you get your yoga, I look 
after your wellbeing."

794
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:49,779
Your physical, mental, emotional and your 
material, everything He looks after.

795
00:48:49,779 --> 00:48:50,849
Alright?

796
00:48:50,849 --> 00:48:52,990
It’s assured!

797
00:48:52,990 --> 00:49:09,910
Seeker: Now matter which way it comes to you 
and it’s true, you recognise the person.

798
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:13,829
Shri Mataji: You do recognise?

799
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:16,309
May God bless you for that.

800
00:49:16,309 --> 00:49:18,989
You are very sensitive because people don’t.

801
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:22,859
If they had recognised, why did they crucify 
Christ?

802
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:28,650
Just imagine these thugs whom we are giving 
so much of money and people are going to them,

803
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:31,999
and the nonsensical people, how they are using 
your women and all sorts of life they are

804
00:49:31,999 --> 00:49:37,589
leading, and how we have surrendered to them 
with all of our intelligence and rationality

805
00:49:37,589 --> 00:49:38,589
and to Christ?

806
00:49:38,589 --> 00:49:41,619
What did we give Him is a cross?

807
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:46,289
You have to really have a proper sensitivity 
to understand Truth, really.

808
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:49,739
Otherwise normally people are naive.

809
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:56,509
If somebody comes with two horns, they like 
that person much more than a normal person.

810
00:49:56,509 --> 00:50:01,729
One must carry a circus, you know!

811
00:50:01,729 --> 00:50:03,989
The circus is on.

812
00:50:03,989 --> 00:50:11,559
Truth is something which doesn’t require 
any adoration with it – nothing.

813
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:17,269
It shines by itself.

814
00:50:17,269 --> 00:50:24,170
And there are many Realised-souls born on 
this land of your England like these children

815
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:25,170
are.

816
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:29,529
They are all born realised and they have feelings 
and some of them are born with the knowledge

817
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:32,140
of Kundalini – many, many.

818
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:40,329
You don’t know what dynamic people are going 
to [be] born in this country, very dynamic.

819
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:49,369
We have already had a birth of a very dynamic 
person in London.

820
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:51,829
Ask these children.

821
00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:54,490
They are must be getting cool breeze.

822
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:56,969
Are you getting cool breeze my children?

823
00:50:56,969 --> 00:50:58,069
In the hand?

824
00:50:58,069 --> 00:50:59,509
Is he?

825
00:50:59,509 --> 00:51:02,390
What is he saying?

826
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:05,279
Yogini: Not too cool

827
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:08,880
Shri Mataji: Not too good?

828
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,990
But still it is coming, yah?

829
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:15,989
See they never will be satisfied because other 
vibrations are also here.

830
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,549
Now, what about you?

831
00:51:18,549 --> 00:51:19,829
Let’s see.

832
00:51:19,829 --> 00:51:22,380
Just see, not yet?

833
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:26,219
Put your hands just like this.

834
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:27,499
Let’s see?

835
00:51:27,499 --> 00:51:31,299
Please put your hands like this.

836
00:51:31,299 --> 00:51:32,299
Just like that.

837
00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:38,240
Put both the feet straight and sit very comfortably 
but with a little alertness.

838
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,079
Straight, like this.

839
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,930
Just like this.

840
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:44,819
You start receiving that through your fingers.

841
00:51:44,819 --> 00:51:48,210
And an invitation is sent to the Kundalini 
when She rises.

842
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,569
And now close your eyes.

843
00:51:49,569 --> 00:51:57,249
Please close your eyes.

844
00:51:57,249 --> 00:52:03,650
Now what happens is that you start feeling 
a cool breeze on your hand, through your fingers.

845
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:08,869
A kind of a cool breeze which is known as 
“The cool breeze of the Holy Ghost”.

846
00:52:08,869 --> 00:52:16,599
That is the first thing, that’s the first 
symptom.

847
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:21,579
Put your both the feet on the ground.

848
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:23,280
Touching [the ground] if possible.

849
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,690
If they cannot touch, it’s alright, but 
normally [they should].

850
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:30,009
And little apart.

851
00:52:30,009 --> 00:52:33,390
Don’t open your eyes.

852
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:37,920
Just keep them [closed].

853
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,459
It will be alright.

854
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:43,459
Do not think.

855
00:52:43,459 --> 00:52:45,839
Do not think.

856
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:46,990
Thinking should be finished.

857
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:49,440
If it is not finished then open your eyes 
and watch me.

858
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,630
If there is no thought coming then it is alright.

859
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:53,940
Just open your eyes and watch me without thinking.

860
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:58,339
You can do it.

861
00:52:58,339 --> 00:52:59,670
Better?

862
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:05,000
Watch me without thinking.

863
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,319
Got a Hamsa [catch].

864
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:16,729
Now don’t worry about declining and all 
that.

865
00:53:16,729 --> 00:53:17,729
Alright?

866
00:53:17,729 --> 00:53:19,510
Don’t feel guilty about anything.

867
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:22,239
Because I am talking about the ocean of love.

868
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:25,700
You see, you are standing before the ocean.

869
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:26,700
Now what is your guilt?

870
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,390
It’s just a spec.

871
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:30,539
Alright?

872
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:31,539
Now forget it.

873
00:53:31,539 --> 00:53:32,719
Close your eyes.

874
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:35,779
Now don’t think about any guilts or anything 
like that.

875
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:44,979
That’s a nonsensical thing, absolutely nonsensical 
because compared to the ocean of forgiveness,

876
00:53:44,979 --> 00:53:46,130
what is a guilt?

877
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:47,289
Just forget it.

878
00:53:47,289 --> 00:53:50,059
You are going to just get it.

879
00:53:50,059 --> 00:53:52,809
It’s freely being distributed.

880
00:53:52,809 --> 00:53:56,339
It’s your own.

881
00:53:56,339 --> 00:53:58,259
Do not condemn yourself.

882
00:53:58,259 --> 00:54:00,599
This is the temple of God.

883
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:08,810
Love yourself, first of all, respect.

884
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:11,550
Now better.

885
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:15,029
Close your eyes my child.

886
00:54:15,029 --> 00:54:16,410
Close your eyes.

887
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:23,549
You must get it to understand everything.

888
00:54:23,549 --> 00:54:28,569
We have to forgive others.

889
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:29,569
Just forgive.

890
00:54:29,569 --> 00:54:32,670
We must know that it’s a myth.

891
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,940
If we do not forgive, also, we are just torturing 
ourselves.

892
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,940
We are not torturing anybody else.

893
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,829
Just forgive everyone.

894
00:54:38,829 --> 00:54:41,349
Just say, “I forgive."

895
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:43,749
Then only we can ask for forgiveness, isn’t 
it?

896
00:54:43,749 --> 00:54:49,229
You just forgive and then ask for forgiveness 
from God, that, “By mistake if I have done

897
00:54:49,229 --> 00:54:55,719
any mistake, by any sort of aggression or 
any torture, or anything – please forgive

898
00:54:55,719 --> 00:54:56,779
me."

899
00:54:56,779 --> 00:54:59,960
And He forgives.

900
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,160
Just forgive.

901
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,299
Ask for His forgiveness and He’ll forgive.

902
00:55:05,299 --> 00:55:06,619
Nothing needed.

903
00:55:06,619 --> 00:55:13,630
Just to ask for it and He will do it.

904
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:21,920
But do not condemn yourself because your Father, 
the almighty Lord has created you and He cannot

905
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:28,619
make any mistakes.

906
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:33,109
You might have done some wrong but doesn’t 
matter.

907
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:40,619
Sakshat Shiva Parvati, Om Sakshat Shiva Parvati, 
Om Sakshat Shiva Parvati

908
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:43,539
Om Sakshat Atmam, Om Sakshat Atmam.

909
00:55:43,539 --> 00:55:46,190
Please pay attention to your heart now.

910
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:47,720
And just say, “I am the Spirit."
