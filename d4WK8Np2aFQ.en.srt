1
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:12,303
Now if you have left Agnya,

2
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:18,475
that means there’s possession on it.

3
00:04:22,322 --> 00:04:26,497
That means all of you have got something

4
00:04:27,202 --> 00:04:34,213
of that kind, already you’re caught up, you’re not clean.

5
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,584
What is the mantra for this, Gavin?

6
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:43,018
For the back Agnya,

7
00:04:43,662 --> 00:04:55,966
Mahaganesh. Mahaganesh, Mahabhairava, correct. Now see,

8
00:04:57,326 --> 00:05:06,326
in the brain you’ve got all these seeds of the gods

9
00:05:07,596 --> 00:05:13,533
and they are the seeds because they’re the causal of these.

10
00:05:14,226 --> 00:05:17,852
So the first, the causal is created

11
00:05:18,243 --> 00:05:22,665
and then the deities are created.

12
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:30,817
So, for example, causal of the Mother Earth is fragrance, all right

13
00:05:31,268 --> 00:05:34,506
So from fragrance comes the Mother Earth.

14
00:05:35,844 --> 00:05:41,067
In the same way the causal of Brahmadeva is Hiranyagarbha,

15
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,210
all right?

16
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,920
He’s called as Hiranyagarbha.

17
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,899
He’s the causal of Brahmadeva.

18
00:05:53,726 --> 00:05:57,975
Where does he stay in the brain? In the brain of the Virata

19
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:07,222
whatever deities live are the causal and ours also,

20
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:09,268
because they’re reflected.

21
00:06:09,422 --> 00:06:12,046
So the causal ones are here

22
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:17,013
in our brain, in our brain, in our brain.

23
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,192
At the back here,

24
00:06:23,826 --> 00:06:27,688
around the Agnya,

25
00:06:28,926 --> 00:06:31,582
now I give you the name,

26
00:06:32,755 --> 00:06:37,743
no, around the Agnya. Agnya is Mahaganesha and Mahabhairava,

27
00:06:38,056 --> 00:06:43,859
Agnya, at the back. And in front…

28
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:01,102
At the back is actually Mahaganesha, just in the center.

29
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,091
Just in the central point is Mahaganesha,

30
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,306
which is the minutest point.

31
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:13,279
Around him moves Mahabhairava, all right?

32
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:21,359
And around this, the rest of it that moves is Hiranyagarbha,

33
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:24,152
all right? Now did you follow that?

34
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:32,644
So when you think, or whatever thinking you do,

35
00:07:35,524 --> 00:07:39,675
through this superego, through this superego,

36
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:45,054
you get the development of this Hiranyagarbha. Did you follow that?

37
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:53,157
And also otherwise, is also, who acts when you think?

38
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:58,478
Is Hiranyagarbha. Isn't it.

39
00:07:59,953 --> 00:08:01,721
This is Swadishthana,

40
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:05,612
we call it, this is Swadishthana chakra around it, all right?

41
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:09,802
So Swadishthana is divided into left and right.

42
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:14,348
Left Swadishthana is Hiranyagarbha

43
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:17,549
and right Swadishthana is also Hiranyagarbha,

44
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,031
at the back here.

45
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:23,182
So now to point out first of all, at the back, if you move,

46
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:25,029
is Mahaganesha.

47
00:08:26,831 --> 00:08:34,389
Around him moves Bhairava, who protects Mahaganesha.

48
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:42,503
Around it moves, now who? Hiranyagarbha, at the back.

49
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:48,441
But Hiranyagarbha has left and right side while Bhairava

50
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:56,930
and Ganesha, they move on each other. Did you follow that point?

51
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:09,627
Now in front, in the center here,

52
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:16,570
is who? Kartikeya, in the center;

53
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:21,281
Christ is in the center, in the

54
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:25,566
center itself where the optic chiasma is.

55
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,394
Here outside is Kartikeya. What is Kartikeya?

56
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:41,463
Kartikeya is the protector of Christ. Around Kartikeya,

57
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:47,066
they’re all protectors of Christ, moves who?

58
00:09:47,747 --> 00:09:55,312
Now, who is Mahabhairava’s counterpart?

59
00:09:56,886 --> 00:10:00,825
Mahahanumana, Mahahanumana, all right?

60
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:07,075
And around that, what does move? Ekadasha Rudra.

61
00:10:18,103 --> 00:10:21,952
The movement of Ekadasha Rudra

62
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:27,617
is not circular, it is move like that.

63
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:35,058
It moves like that. Or you can say, move like that.

64
00:10:42,882 --> 00:10:48,631
Now what is Ekadasha Rudra? Let us see.

65
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:56,123
Can you give the names? Of Ekadasha. Take one by one.

66
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,939
Buddha,

67
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:04,480
right? Mahavira.

68
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:12,275
Then Christ, then Mahabhairava.

69
00:11:13,396 --> 00:11:15,513
How many of them, four.

70
00:11:18,273 --> 00:11:23,210
Then Mahaganesha, five.

71
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:26,484
Did I say Bhairava?

72
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:32,221
Again, again say it one by one, Buddha,

73
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:42,119
Mahavira, Christ, Mahaganesha, Mahabhairava.

74
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,320
All right, this is very clear cut for you

75
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,285
because just now I’ve told all of them.

76
00:11:52,142 --> 00:11:58,276
Buddha, Mahavira, Christ.

77
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:11,294
Then, what else, four are left, four are still left.

78
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:18,109
Mahahanumana, you didn’t tell? Mahahanumana, how much it is now?

79
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:25,150
Three left, no four are left, four, now what are these four?

80
00:12:25,465 --> 00:12:30,276
Mahahanumana. Say, it’s very simple.
I just now discussed with you Mahahanumana,

81
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:42,372
Mahabhairava, two, Buddha, Mahavira. Four, now, Kartikeya.

82
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:46,692
Kartikeya, Ganesha, sixth.

83
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,971
Christ, seventh. Now four more are left,

84
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:53,124
now who are the four more,

85
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,854
let’s see, can I have it?

86
00:12:59,184 --> 00:13:01,425
Pat, come along.

87
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,399
You’ve done lot of reading.

88
00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:11,642
Try to, I have written it down into something, eleven of these.

89
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:19,855
yogini: Hiranyagarbha

90
00:13:21,286 --> 00:13:22,970
Brahmadeva,

91
00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:26,664
Hiranyagarbha, correct.

92
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:31,888
Vishnu, Narayana,

93
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:36,421
Lakshmi Narayana, how much it is.

94
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:43,017
Shiva, Parvati, everyone.

95
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:48,240
Shiva and Shakti, all right?

96
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:50,636
Eleven of them.

97
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:56,557
Lakshmi Narayana is one, Brahmadeva Saraswati is...

98
00:13:56,846 --> 00:13:58,934
Shiva Parvati, as two.

99
00:14:00,302 --> 00:14:06,292
All eleven are there. Why Shiva and Parvati?

100
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:10,266
Two have to be taken because Shiva is the Guru,

101
00:14:10,694 --> 00:14:12,563
Parvati is the Shakti.

102
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:17,952
So if you catch on void,

103
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:19,907
the beginning of the trouble starts

104
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:22,485
because Shiva is the central path.

105
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,425
There Shiva is to be taken as Guru,

106
00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:32,914
Shiva is Guru, Shiva is the one

107
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:36,441
who is our Guru. He is our spirit.

108
00:14:38,183 --> 00:14:42,870
But he’s not the spirit

109
00:14:47,535 --> 00:14:52,677
that protects because spirit needs no protection.

110
00:14:54,265 --> 00:14:57,333
Whom do you protect then, also.

111
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:04,499
So when you protect,

112
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:09,868
you protect the spirit but what protects it

113
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:16,651
is the Guru personality which is Shiva,

114
00:15:17,111 --> 00:15:19,721
which is Shiva actually.

115
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:21,877
Did you get that?

116
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:25,671
Now you might say how is Shiva is

117
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,950
“Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devom, Maheshwara,

118
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:32,873
Guru Sakshat, Parabrahma, Tasmai Shri Guruveh Namah.”

119
00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:42,694
Because Guru means a person who is

120
00:15:44,168 --> 00:15:51,398
full of Gurutwakashan, is weight, is the gravity.

121
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:57,527
Person who is with gravity, which has some sense,

122
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,877
which is density,

123
00:16:02,813 --> 00:16:08,114
which is our spirit. Otherwise we have no density, we’re useless.

124
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:12,148
Our spirit goes away, we float in the air as bhoots.

125
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:19,557
 So the Guru is everything.

126
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:28,208
Today I’ve called you here to tell you how to become a Guru.

127
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:33,454
So that’s why I’ve given you this introduction. Is it clear to you?

128
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:39,330
All right let Me know. Now…

129
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,188
See that? (not clear) Just laugh at yourself.

130
00:16:50,434 --> 00:16:53,625
With all your knowledge of how many years
I’ve been talking to you,

131
00:16:53,782 --> 00:16:55,089
look at this, this is the point.

132
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,252
How Mother raising your kundalini just like that.

133
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,666
Do I tell you something?

134
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,644
You all have gone to the wrong gurus, you have done,

135
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:04,501
because…nothing of the kind. Just because

136
00:17:05,295 --> 00:17:06,895
you’re not set here,

137
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,663
it’s the Ekadasha Rudra on your forehead,

138
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:14,194
If you bow before any wrong guru.

139
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:18,771
With that your Ekadasha Rudra…

140
00:17:18,973 --> 00:17:23,056
Sahaja Yoga is very simple you know?

141
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:27,845
If you put your glass upside down...(not clear)

142
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:33,964
if you put it like this, it is exposed to the...(not clear).

143
00:17:36,677 --> 00:17:38,786
Sahaja Yoga is so simple,

144
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:44,121
do you follow that point?

145
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:50,857
So we reach one conclusion, by mental understanding

146
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,879
you cannot understand Sahaja Yoga.

147
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,840
So as a guru

148
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:07,751
what should you have?

149
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:13,911
I’ve made a promise. That’s different.

150
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:19,195
Yogini is asking a question...

151
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:31,642
You are telling like this,

152
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:41,112
if I say that, “What is the test of,

153
00:18:43,764 --> 00:18:49,667
say, guru?” Do you say that it should not become artificial?

154
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:57,655
Now let’s see again quite straight forward, what is the question?

155
00:18:59,854 --> 00:19:02,621
No, no, what is the question?

156
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:11,752
Now try to remember.

157
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:17,912
Yogi: What should we have?
Shri Mataji: Not at all!

158
00:19:21,296 --> 00:19:23,791
So what is the question, let's see exactly.

159
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:27,879
Exactly.

160
00:19:37,738 --> 00:19:41,405
Yogini: How do you clearing the catch from seing a false guru?

161
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:58,903
This is another question, but the question I asked is:

162
00:20:00,143 --> 00:20:04,283
then what must a guru do?

163
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:09,395
The thing I said, by discussion

164
00:20:09,651 --> 00:20:15,388
Sahaja Yoga doesn’t work out then what should we do?

165
00:20:18,938 --> 00:20:22,442
 I asked the question what should we do?

166
00:20:35,132 --> 00:20:37,420
Make it simple always

167
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:42,766
related to your Mother, you’ll get the answer. Hah! All right?

168
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:48,893
To neutralize the old guru

169
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,141
who has been a bad guru

170
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:57,699
you have to surrender to the real guru.

171
00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:02,219
If your guru is the real guru

172
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:08,938
then you surrender to the Mother of your real guru.

173
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,603
Because your real guru is also surrendered to Me.

174
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:28,970
So all gurus are to be surrendered at the lotus feet of your Mother

175
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:40,021
Then if it is Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, Shiva, Krishna,

176
00:21:40,323 --> 00:21:42,688
Christ, anyone of them also,

177
00:21:42,912 --> 00:21:46,617
Ekadasha still is more than your Mother’s...

178
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,361
It is very difficult

179
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,029
because we want to stick on to something,

180
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,100
even the real guru. Christ is a real guru

181
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:06,599
Christ you know of is to be also surrendered at the lotus feet

182
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:10,093
of your Mother because we also know that.

183
00:22:11,606 --> 00:22:15,244
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, all of them are My servants.

184
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,889
Adi Shakti is the Mother.

185
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:21,605
She’s the Mother of all the gurus,

186
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:27,628
of all the prophets, of all the incarnations, of all the deities.

187
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:38,621
After Her, only Parabrahma is created, after that only Parabrahma.

188
00:22:42,923 --> 00:22:46,209
So when you have got someone like that to surrender,

189
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:49,272
is the real problem, is a maya.

190
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:55,478
That is the biggest problem because you’ve got somebody so easily.

191
00:22:58,046 --> 00:23:01,762
Arjuna was a great warrior till the war started,

192
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:10,929
and somebody was a great swimmer when he came to the ocean.

193
00:23:15,902 --> 00:23:18,302
Allow your mind to do the work,

194
00:23:23,158 --> 00:23:24,825
allow your mind.

195
00:23:30,947 --> 00:23:36,438
So to be the highest guru we’ve to be completely surrendered.

196
00:23:42,217 --> 00:23:44,527
Now when you’re surrendered,

197
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:47,797
you don’t doubt.

198
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:50,659
For Me this finger is completely surrendered, say,

199
00:23:50,782 --> 00:23:53,249
to My body, it doesn’t doubt My body.

200
00:23:55,213 --> 00:23:57,013
Supposing I’m pressing and

201
00:23:57,601 --> 00:24:01,322
it receives the information that you’re doing that

202
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:05,675
she informs the brain

203
00:24:07,661 --> 00:24:10,786
and informs the body that I’m doing that.

204
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:16,134
It says some thing must be done to remove it, the whole body acts,

205
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,866
all the fingers act

206
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:19,585
and all the power flows there,

207
00:24:19,686 --> 00:24:22,886
the energy flows there where the finger is hurt.

208
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:28,070
So when you are surrendered

209
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:32,167
there is no question of individualism.

210
00:24:34,936 --> 00:24:38,402
Those people who think of any kind of individualism

211
00:24:41,554 --> 00:24:44,941
are going to go out of the circulation of Sahaja Yoga.

212
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:52,482
From the beginning, I’ve told you many a time if we

213
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:56,498
take out all those people who want to

214
00:24:58,018 --> 00:25:01,834
assert their individualism of any kind.

215
00:25:05,227 --> 00:25:06,400
You see,

216
00:25:07,348 --> 00:25:10,482
this is a branch, all right, you can see here.

217
00:25:11,132 --> 00:25:15,863
In the last stage, I use the same analogy better and better.

218
00:25:17,247 --> 00:25:19,591
Outside is the same, all right?

219
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:24,151
If inside and outside is the same and the rest is (not clear).

220
00:25:29,645 --> 00:25:33,003
If this has to become this, what has to .

221
00:25:35,222 --> 00:25:40,550
This myth has to go, all right?

222
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:43,539
This myth has to vanish.

223
00:25:45,246 --> 00:25:47,771
So this myth is based on what,

224
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,810
our ego and superego only.

225
00:25:51,105 --> 00:25:53,728
Which are actually the end result

226
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:56,279
of all the nonsense we have been.

227
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:57,638
In a sense,

228
00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:04,699
all this has to go, vanish, it doesn’t exist at all,
that is the way you surrender.

229
00:26:06,052 --> 00:26:07,468
Indulgence

230
00:26:11,923 --> 00:26:15,653
You cannot be a guru unless and until at least

231
00:26:16,734 --> 00:26:19,345
at least you are open to it,

232
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,395
that’s coming and going, but supposing you’re like this.

233
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:27,394
Could be like the

234
00:26:27,577 --> 00:26:31,799
story I heard in India that there was a stupid fool,

235
00:26:32,154 --> 00:26:34,045
two of them.

236
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:39,951
They went inside the restaurant to have something.

237
00:26:40,235 --> 00:26:42,343
They sat down on a table

238
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:51,498
and they saw a glass like this.

239
00:26:53,097 --> 00:26:57,097
They said, “What sort of a glass is this, it has no mouth.”

240
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:00,150
So they called the bearer and said,

241
00:27:00,311 --> 00:27:05,429
“See we can’t have food unless and until
it has a mouth, take it back.”

242
00:27:07,465 --> 00:27:11,465
They said, “What sort of a glass is this, it has no water?”

243
00:27:14,531 --> 00:27:16,037
Because (not clear)

244
00:27:20,131 --> 00:27:26,892
But when you’re surrendered the mouth and bottom is... luckily its…

245
00:27:32,827 --> 00:27:36,009
That surrendering is to be achieved

246
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:41,882
if you’re going to be the gurus.

247
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:56,567
This is all mental, how do you open?

248
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,393
Have a bandhan.

249
00:28:04,656 --> 00:28:08,589
How many times you give yourself bandhan?

250
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,850
Before sleeping,

251
00:28:24,424 --> 00:28:28,259
after getting up, then namaskar to your Mother,

252
00:28:30,787 --> 00:28:33,984
touching My feet, very important,

253
00:28:34,324 --> 00:28:37,464
not to come on to the Agnya, supposed to correct.

254
00:28:37,613 --> 00:28:40,422
Even sitting down there I’m catching.

255
00:28:40,627 --> 00:28:43,254
Actually just do it now.

256
00:28:43,977 --> 00:28:45,881
No, again.

257
00:28:46,714 --> 00:28:51,091
Do it on both the feet, again you try.

258
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:59,576
First right and then left. Ah! See now.

259
00:29:00,925 --> 00:29:04,459
It’s not mental, this is the point I’m bringing you.

260
00:29:06,466 --> 00:29:10,672
It is not mental, now this is (not clear).

261
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,573
you all become mentally alert

262
00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:18,303
See you must surrender to the Mother and...open your heart.

263
00:29:19,964 --> 00:29:24,233
So, sweetness is open your heart…not clear.

264
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:30,295
When others come we don’t tell them this is
how we open our heart. Don’t tell them.

265
00:29:37,221 --> 00:29:40,332
How you open your left Vishuddhi, just say,
“Mother I am not guilty.

266
00:29:40,497 --> 00:29:43,761
Mother I’m not guilty. Mother I’m not guilty.”

267
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:48,770
Too much thinking, too much talking is bad.

268
00:31:49,938 --> 00:31:52,851
Not talking, not thinking is bad.

269
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:56,480
But little thinking, little talking is good.
