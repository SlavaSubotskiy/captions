1
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,860
Yogi asks about taking of photos during Shri Mataji's talk.

2
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,910
But when I am talking, one should not.

3
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,750
You have to sing one song more, smaller one.

4
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,810
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

5
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,920
As I told you yesterday, that truth is what it is.

6
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,790
It cannot be conceptualized, and

7
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:00,850
cannot be felt at this human awareness.

8
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:11,700
For that you have to become a subtler being that we call

9
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,830
as the spirit.

10
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:26,700
Today I'm going to tell you about the nature of spirit.

11
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,910
Spirit is the reflection of the Father, the God Almighty.

12
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,810
The seat of that is on top of fontanel bone area,

13
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,790
but He is reflected in our heart;

14
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,830
while Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost,

15
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,910
the Primordial Mother.

16
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:32,780
So this spirit, when it is enlightened into our attention,

17
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,920
our attention becomes active:

18
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,910
in the sense that if you pay attention to something,

19
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,880
it doesn't act there, but on the contrary

20
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:05,840
wherever you pay attention, that acts upon you.

21
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,920
On the contrary an enlightened soul,

22
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,770
even a glance of such a person

23
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:34,690
can manifest peace, joy in the other person.

24
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:01,850
The spirit, when it starts showing through your central

25
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,770
nervous system, you develop a new dimension

26
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,780
on your nerves,

27
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:27,750
by which you can feel your own centers,

28
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,780
that is self - knowledge,

29
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:35,780
and you can feel the centers of others.

30
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:52,700
It is absolutely accurate sensation you get on your fingertips.

31
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:02,720
If you know how to put these centers all right,

32
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:11,780
then you get physical, mental, emotional complete balance.

33
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,750
The center is like this, and when we start using it on the right

34
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:37,710
side or left side too much, then it becomes constricted.

35
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:48,720
Sometimes a certain shock can just break it,

36
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,860
and then you develop maladies, physical and mental.

37
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,710
But when the Kundalini passes through these centers

38
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,770
She puts them right and enlightens them, because

39
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,820
She's now connected to the spirit.

40
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:43,910
So the spirit tells us what is wrong with us.

41
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:53,680
This is the Last Judgment.

42
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:59,720
Also this is the Resurrection Time.

43
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,830
We are going to judge ourselves,

44
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,740
and we are going to resurrect ourselves

45
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,720
through Sahaja Yoga.

46
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:28,680
Spirit is the source of truth, absolute truth.

47
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,720
If you have ten children who are realized souls, and if you

48
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:44,910
tie up their eyes, and put somebody before him and ask

49
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:52,700
what's wrong, then they will all put up one finger.

50
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,680
That means they all are saying that something wrong

51
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,910
with the throat of the gentleman.

52
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:24,710
And if you ask the gentleman, "Is something wrong with

53
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:29,840
your throat?" he says, "Yes, but how do you know?".

54
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,820
In the light of the spirit gradually you understand

55
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,730
this divine Power, which is all-pervading.

56
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,800
And if you know how to work out this divine Power,

57
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:12,810
you can also raise the Kundalini of others

58
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:24,870
and give them, others realization.

59
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,870
Also you will know which man is truthful

60
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,910
and which man is not,

61
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,720
because immediately as soon as you put fingers towards

62
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:51,850
such a person, you will feel terrible heat if he is a crook;

63
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,690
because in your awareness you develop a new dimension

64
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,860
called as collective consciousness.

65
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,730
First you develop a state, what we call as nirvichar samadhi,

66
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,900
meaning   thoughtless awareness.

67
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,770
For example, therel s a nice carpet here and I look at it,

68
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,690
and I start thinking about it.

69
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:58,690
But after enlightenment you see something

70
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,730
and there is no thought;

71
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,880
because thoughts come from the past or from the future,

72
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,880
but in the present there is no thought.

73
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:32,750
So when you see something, whatever joy is created by the

74
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:41,780
artist starts pouring on you and absolutely soothes you down.

75
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:56,820
Your stress, your worries all disappear,

76
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:04,740
because spirit is the source of peace.

77
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:10,730
There are many people who start talking about peace,

78
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:15,830
but they have no peace within themselves.

79
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:22,840
They also get Nobel Prizes in peace, but what's the use -

80
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,790
they have no peace within themselves.

81
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,910
But it is like a wheel: when the wheel is moving

82
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,810
and you are at the periphery, you are disturbed;

83
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:59,710
but if you go to the axis of the wheel, it's peaceful.

84
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:11,680
In the same way you, your state becomes that of an axis.

85
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,750
Like if you are standing in the water, there are waves coming

86
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,860
and you are afraid of the waves -

87
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,760
like the thoughts, coming from the right and left,

88
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,700
future and past.

89
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,840
But if you get into the boat,

90
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,760
then you are no more afraid of the waves.

91
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,880
But if you learn how to swim, you can get into the waves

92
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:06,840
and bring people with you back to the boat.

93
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,710
This is the third, this is the second state where you arrive, is

94
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:29,820
the doubtless awareness, nirvikalpa samadhi,

95
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:39,780
where you become very knowledgeable.

96
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:52,700
The light of the spirit enlightens your brain.

97
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:00,890
What we know through human awareness is very little,

98
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,840
but when the brain is enlightened you start discovering

99
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,830
new things.

100
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:21,720
We have some scientists who have discovered lots of things

101
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:25,920
after coming to Sahaja Yoga.

102
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:34,820
It gives a new dimension to your creativity.

103
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,820
We have many artists, musicians who have become

104
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:43,820
world - famous after coming to Sahaja Yoga.

105
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,800
Physically you feel all right; all incurable diseases

106
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,800
can be cured, most of them can be cured with Sahaja Yoga.

107
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,780
Some people take more time, some less, but most of them

108
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,850
are cured.

109
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:33,680
But it is not meant for people who are frivolous,

110
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:44,830
or people who do not want their realization.

111
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,900
It is meant for people who seriously are seeking

112
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,850
honestly the truth.

113
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:04,680
People who have been even spoilt by false gurus or for

114
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,690
following some religions in the wrong way,

115
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,880
all can be saved.

116
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:28,820
In the light of the spirit you become your own master,

117
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,800
because you see the truth.

118
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:40,780
For the first time you feel this all-pervading Power

119
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:45,720
which does all the living work;

120
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:59,680
and then if you know how to handle this great power,

121
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,750
you can become masters.

122
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:13,690
You become extremely dynamic, fearless,

123
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,840
but at the same time very compassionate.

124
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,820
And this has to happen to all of you.

125
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:37,870
Only those who do not want, or those who are not destined,

126
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,750
will not get it.

127
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,810
But it is not a plastic growth, that you can create

128
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:58,780
thousand flowers of plastic -

129
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,870
it is reality,

130
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:15,740
and so the becoming is important in Sahaja Yoga.

131
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,830
Above all,

132
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:33,890
your spirituality, your divinity start expressing itself

133
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,900
and you become automatically righteous,

134
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,730
and you enjoy your virtues.

135
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,880
The greatest thing about Sahaja Yog today is that

136
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:10,740
it's a collective happening.

137
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,830
Before this, people had to cleanse themselves

138
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:31,850
by going to Himalayas or hiding themselves in some caves.

139
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,890
They had to do lots of penances.

140
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:48,870
But in Sahaja Yoga, collective work

141
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:55,840
makes you absolutely perfect.

142
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:05,790
It is like if My nail is broken then it will not grow -

143
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:16,890
it has to be connected with the whole.

144
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:21,810
Once you are connected to this divine Power,

145
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:28,760
then you all become part and parcel of the whole.

146
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,790
You are not only guided, but also very much protected

147
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,870
and blessed.

148
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,720
Specially it gives you joy.

149
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:59,880
Joy cannot be expressed, cannot be described.

150
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:11,770
It doesn't have duality of happiness and unhappiness;

151
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,830
it is absolute in its nature.

152
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:22,830
It is just to be experienced,

153
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,840
and that is what will happen to you.

154
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,880
Today again if you have some questions,

155
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,910
I would like to answer; but again I have to tell you that

156
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:48,850
I have not come here to take anything from you.

157
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:03,840
So please ask Me a question, any question which is relevant.

158
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,750
Thank you very much.

159
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:41,850
Can the energy Kundalini be activated forever?

160
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:52,790
Yes, of course. Continuously.

161
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,820
You have to know about it,

162
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:12,720
for which you don't have to pay anything.

163
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:21,690
All this knowledge is absolutely free.

164
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:32,760
You cannot pay for the divine work.

165
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:59,880
I would like to ask, why the things and events repeat again?

166
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,860
They are all our mistakes, these are human mistakes.

167
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,710
Human beings have to change,

168
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,720
they have to be transformed.

169
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,740
The question was, whether the energy can be awaken

170
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,850
by some exercise?

171
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,850
No, it cannot be.

172
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:54,770
It cannot be by any exercise, or by reading or by anything.

173
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,770
It is a living process.

174
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:01,750
Like the seed, you cannot force it to sprout.

175
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:05,700
You have to put it into Mother Earth.

176
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,700
Why some religions are afraid even of pronouncing

177
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:01,850
of the word "yoga"?

178
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,770
They all have to be upset.

179
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:13,840
All the religions are just making money.

180
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:30,880
 Yoga   means  Union with the Divine.

181
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:39,710
All scriptures have said that you have to be born again.

182
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,740
Nobody is paying attention to that;

183
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,820
they are just busy collecting money.

184
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:09,790
You was talking about rebirth of some energy,

185
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,800
but the Bible is saying, that no one can please God

186
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,770
and Jesus Christ says, that we are born from Holy Spirit

187
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:26,750
and not from our own energy...

188
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,860
He has never said so.

189
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:14,920
You better read your Bible again.

190
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:20,790
Of course word of God is there, no doubt.

191
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,770
Hello!

192
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:29,830
I am quoting from the Bible in the name of Jesus Christ.

193
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,710
Jesus Christ replied: Amen Amen I'm telling you,

194
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,700
who was not born from the water and spirit,

195
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,890
cannot enter to the Kingdom of God.

196
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,710
What is it?

197
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,840
It is not - it is of course the word of God.

198
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,810
Hello, listen, sit down. I'll tell you.

199
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,740
Sit down. I'll tell you what.

200
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:52,690
It is, Christ has said that it is the word of God,

201
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,720
and I am using word of God alone. Sit down.

202
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,850
Also He has said that  I'll send you the Holy Ghost.

203
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:07,830
If I am the Holy Ghost, I am God also. Please be seated.

204
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,840
If I am the Holy Ghost,

205
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,760
how will you recognise Me, as a Christian?

206
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:17,800
How will you recognise Me?

207
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:25,690
I am the Holy Ghost.

208
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,750
I have to say this, because if you bring Bible here,

209
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,820
I'll have to tell you; because,

210
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:44,810
because I give comfort -

211
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,790
we have cured so many people in the whole world.

212
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,760
There are three doctors who have got M.D. in Sahaja Yoga.

213
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,780
There are forty doctors in Russia

214
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,830
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga.

215
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,760
And I am counselling you, I am telling you

216
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,790
what Christ could not tell, because in three-and-a-half years

217
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:27,870
He was killed.

218
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,880
They were the same people who were reading Bible

219
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:43,740
and saying,  This is not our Saviour - and they killed Him.

220
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:51,860
And the third thing is the redemption.

221
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,860
Holy Ghost has to be a Redeemer, and that's what it is:

222
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,680
I am giving you Realization.

223
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,680
This time don't miss it.

224
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,790
Three-and-a-half years they allowed Christ to live,

225
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:22,700
and they are using His Bible when I'm here.

226
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,860
When Christ was there, they were using the Old Testament

227
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:36,780
to decry Him, and talking about Moses.

228
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:49,880
By reading Bible, if you people would have achieved

229
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,920
anithing, you would have seen to it.

230
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,840
I was Myself born in a Christian family.

231
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,730
And do you know what Christians have done

232
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,790
with this Bible?

233
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,730
If you go to South America you'll be shocked.

234
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,740
Billions and billions of Red Indians were killed by

235
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,830
Christians showing them Bible.

236
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,750
In India they brought Bible in one hand

237
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:40,810
and a gun in the other.

238
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,760
Don't miss it.

239
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,900
The time has come for you to get your Realization,

240
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,830
to take your resurrection.

241
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,770
You were born in a Christian religion,

242
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:17,780
so you believe in Bible; but those who are born in Islam,

243
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,790
they believe in Koran only.

244
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,890
They think all the Christians will go to hell,

245
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:40,890
and the Christians think that all the Muslims will go to hell.

246
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,890
What about the Jews?

247
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:54,810
When you have blinkers and when you put blinkers,

248
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,830
you do not see the unity of God.

249
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,760
This has...

250
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:19,800
Those people who read Koran, Bible, Gita, anything,

251
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,710
they follow any religion, commit any sin.

252
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,830
Are they righteous?

253
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,790
Christ has asked you to be humble.

254
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,810
Where are the Christians who are humble?

255
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,810
I would like to see - they are so arrogant.

256
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,760
Christ went to the extreme of morality:

257
00:43:55,850 --> 00:44:00,720
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

258
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:16,730
Let us see which Christians have that kind of eyes.

259
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:25,840
Only the Sahaja yogis have those innocent eyes.

260
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,900
You all are to be born again, you should have

261
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,790
an actualization of baptism.

262
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:41,830
You should feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost out of

263
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,890
your fontanel bone area.

264
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,740
We have had enough of sermons and lectures

265
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,760
and Bible-reading.

266
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:07,890
Let us read the book of reality, the book of reality.

267
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:13,880
No blind faith is needed.

268
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:21,700
You have to feel the all-pervading Power.

269
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,750
You can prove it through Sahaja Yoga that Christ

270
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:33,810
was the Son of God -  you can prove it.

271
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,850
they cannot prove.

272
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,850
Can they give Self-realization?

273
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,880
(You better take another hall and give address there.

274
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,880
No one wants you. Just throw him out.)

275
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:17,750
You should not believe blindly into anything whatsoever.

276
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,810
You must have the proof of everything.

277
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,840
If you don't have the proof, why do you believe in Bible,

278
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:32,700
why do you believe in Gita, why do you believe in Koran,

279
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,860
just blindly believing into it?

280
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,780
Please I would like to ask you in the name of this lady.

281
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:08,700
and she would like to tell you, what is the matter...

282
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:21,830
I can treat her later on. We'll treat you, no doubt.

283
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,770
It will take some time, madam? Wer ll treat you, all right?

284
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,730
Just now I want to give Self-realization to all of them.

285
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:42,750
That is very important.

286
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,850
They have come here to get their Self-realization.

287
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,740
All right.

288
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:23,860
(Ask them to give, give these boys some bandhans.)

289
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,870
I had to say it, I'm sorry. I had to say -

290
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:45,740
the time had come to say this, see, so I'm happy.

291
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:02,920
Those who do not want to have Self-realization

292
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,720
should please leave the hall.

293
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:15,720
It is not civil to come to somebody else's meetings

294
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,760
and disturb it.

295
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,870
It is a divine work which is going on, and you have

296
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,740
no business to disturb.

297
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:41,910
So people are paid for this kind of work, I know;

298
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,810
but why not seek your benevolence?

299
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:04,840
Why stick onto these ideas and get ruined forever?

300
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:16,740
There is no wisdom in this kind of a blind faith.

301
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:25,850
Now so many Muslims and Jews worship Christ,

302
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,840
because it's a proof for them.

303
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,870
It is not because they go to church and listen to someone,

304
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:42,840
and then accept something.

305
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:56,860
If it is a proof, then as honest people you have to accept.

306
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:16,750
They say in English,

307
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:20,900
proof of the pudding is in the eating of it,

308
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:30,820
not by talking or by reading something.

309
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:37,750
If you are hungry, you will get it;

310
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:44,780
not those who are living on words and books.

311
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:55,730
One poet has said in India - his name was Kabira - he said,

312
00:51:55,830 --> 00:52:04,820
by reading too much, even the educated have become stupid.

313
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:40,690
Now, as you know, there are two forces within us:

314
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:41,910
what we call the left sympathetic and

315
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:45,750
the right sympathetic nervous system.

316
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:58,890
They work when we are in emergencies.

317
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:04,770
But the third one is called as the parasympathetic,

318
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:12,770
which supplies the energy to bring the whole system

319
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:15,820
into balance.

320
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:27,870
Actually the left side is the power of desire,

321
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:36,790
and the right side is the power of action.

322
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:44,760
Christ could not tell all these things, they crucified Him.

323
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:58,800
This is the problem, that His work has to be completed.

324
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:13,900
Now we will be using our left power of desire,

325
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:20,710
expressing with your hand like this.

326
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:35,770
But there are three conditions which you must have:

327
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:43,920
that if you have pure desire to get your realization,

328
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:57,870
then be sure that you all will get your Self-realization.

329
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:10,860
You should now have no diffidence.

330
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,800
Let it be, doesn't matter. They are useless people, you see;

331
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:29,900
they are paid by someone.

332
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:33,900
You forget it.

333
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:39,850
So there are three conditions: first is, you should be

334
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:46,720
confident that you will all get your Self-realization.

335
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:58,710
All right. Then the second condition is that you are

336
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,910
not to feel guilty at all.

337
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:09,870
You have to forget the past.

338
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:14,780
You have to be in the present.

339
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:21,840
If you feel guilty, then you catch this center very badly,

340
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,730
and as a result you develop even physical problems,

341
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:32,790
apart from mental torture.

342
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:45,730
You develop angina, spondylitis,

343
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:50,820
and many diseases from the lethargic organs.

344
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:06,850
All right. The third condition is that you have to forgive

345
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,720
everyone,

346
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,910
everyone in general;

347
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:23,830
not to think about anyone who has troubled you.

348
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,870
Even the gentleman who tried to disturb you: forgive him,

349
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:41,920
just forgive.

350
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,900
Because whether you forgive or don't forgive,

351
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:48,690
you don't do anything.

352
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:55,690
But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

353
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:05,840
So logically you must forgive.

354
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,920
Actually you don  t do anything.

355
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,880
But why should we torture ourselves for others

356
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:17,760
when they are enjoying themselves?

357
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:29,710
And done t consider yourselves as anything low.

358
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:34,800
Now you are a human being, and there's

359
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:40,810
a last breakthrough that you have to achieve,

360
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:49,710
which is the actualization of your baptism.

361
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,840
You have to take out your shoes for about ten minutes

362
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:04,690
and put them, your feet, on the Mother Earth.

363
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,890
On your lap.

364
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,920
This is suggestive that you are desirous

365
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:25,760
of having your Self-realization.

366
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:33,910
We'll tell you about the centers on the left-hand side

367
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:40,680
which we'll be nourishing ourselves.

368
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,890
Now please put your right hand on your heart, where resides

369
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:00,840
the spirit.

370
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:10,740
On the heart. Left side, left side.

371
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,790
If the spirit shines in you, then it guides you;

372
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:22,910
that's how you become your own master.

373
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,840
So now please take down your hand in the upper portion of

374
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:40,790
your abdomen, on the left-hand side.

375
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:46,890
This is the center of your mastery.

376
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:59,760
Now, here is the center made by all the prophets,

377
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:06,880
which when enlightened, makes you the master of

378
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:12,690
handling divine Power.

379
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,920
Please sit down. Don't disturb us, at least.

380
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:26,730
If you are Christians, sit down. Please don't disturb us.

381
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:34,690
Sit down. Be humble, listen. Please be seated.

382
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:37,870
At least behave like Christians.

383
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:49,860
Now, you have to take your right hand in the lower portion

384
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:54,810
of your abdomen, on the left-hand side.

385
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:03,710
This is the center of pure knowledge,

386
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:10,790
not bookish knowledge but pure knowledge which works,

387
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:17,710
which works the divine Power;

388
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:24,770
by which you give realizations to others, cure others,

389
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,800
everything.

390
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:34,840
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your

391
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:38,920
abdomen, on the left-hand side.

392
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:49,900
Now, again on your heart.

393
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:56,820
On your heart.

394
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:12,720
Now in the corner of your neck and your shoulder,

395
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:18,920
and turn your head to your right.

396
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:22,700
I have already told you that this center goes out of order

397
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:28,820
when you feel guilty. Don't feel guilty at all.

398
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:40,920
Now, take your right hand and put it

399
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:46,800
on your forehead across.

400
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:53,690
Put down your head.

401
01:03:53,760 --> 01:04:02,820
Here you have to forgive everyone in general.

402
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:08,900
Now, please take your hand back

403
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:12,910
on the back side of your head,

404
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:19,910
and push back your head.

405
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:26,830
Here you have to say without feeling guilty,

406
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:31,700
without counting your mistakes, for your satisfaction,

407
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:34,780
"Oh, divine Power, if I have done anything,

408
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:38,680
please forgive me."

409
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,750
Now, please stretch your palm,

410
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:06,810
and put the center of your palm on top

411
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:12,890
of the fontanel bone area,

412
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:20,710
and press it down, your head.

413
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:25,850
Push back your fingers so there's a good pressure.

414
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:35,830
And now move your scalp slowly,

415
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:45,840
seven times clockwise.

416
01:06:11,830 --> 01:06:16,720
Now, take down your hand.

417
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:21,860
That's all we have to do.

418
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:24,690
You can take out your spectacles

419
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:27,840
because you have to close your eyes,

420
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:37,810
and also if there's anything tight here or on your waist,

421
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,710
please take it out.

422
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:01,780
Now again put your left hand towards Me,

423
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,880
both the feet away from each other,

424
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:13,730
and close your eyes and put your right hand on your heart.

425
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,680
Here you ask Me a very fundamental question

426
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:38,750
you can call Me  "Mother" or "Shri Mataji" - three times,

427
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:54,810
"Mother, am I the spirit?" Ask this question three times.

428
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:55,850
Loudly.

429
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,700
If you are the spirit, you are your master.

430
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,680
So please take your right hand in the upper portion

431
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:29,880
of your abdomen, and ask Me another question -

432
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:32,830
on the left-hand side -

433
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:37,850
"Mother, am I my own master?"

434
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:02,880
I've already told you that I respect your freedom,

435
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:08,910
and I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

436
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:25,730
So please take down your right hand in the lower portion of

437
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:29,790
your abdomen, on the left-hand side.

438
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:38,910
You have to ask for pure knowledge.

439
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:41,880
So please say six times,

440
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:45,910
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

441
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:49,720
Loudly.

442
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:11,870
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

443
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:19,820
the Kundalini, the reflection of the Holy Ghost, starts rising.

444
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:31,890
Now please take your right hand

445
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:37,780
onto the upper portion of your abdomen

446
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,860
on the left-hand side.

447
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:53,720
We have to nourish these centers with our full confidence.

448
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:04,780
Here you have to say with full confidence,

449
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:12,900
"Mother, I am my own master."

450
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:44,740
I've already told you that the fundamental truth about you

451
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:49,870
is that you are the pure spirit.

452
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:57,720
You are not this body, you are not this mind,

453
01:11:57,820 --> 01:12:02,890
you are not this ego or these conditionings,

454
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:08,690
but you are pure spirit.

455
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:23,850
So now raise your right hand on your heart,

456
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:30,790
and with full confidence say, twelve times,

457
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:35,830
"Mother, I am the pure spirit."

458
01:12:43,810 --> 01:12:46,700
The divine Power

459
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:54,890
is the power of compassion and love,

460
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:11,840
it is the ocean of pure knowledge,

461
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:25,750
but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

462
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:37,730
So whatever mistakes you might commit,

463
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:46,910
the ocean of forgiveness can dissolve it with its power.

464
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:59,710
So now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and

465
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:07,720
your shoulder, and put your head to your right.

466
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,800
Here

467
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:19,710
you have to say with full confidence, sixteen times,

468
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:26,810
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

469
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:39,800
I have already told you,

470
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:44,810
logically whether you forgive or don't forgive,

471
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:49,720
you do not do anything.

472
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:01,840
But if you do not forgive, then you play into wrong hands

473
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,770
and torture yourself.

474
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:19,820
So now raise your right hand to your forehead,

475
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:25,880
and put down your head.

476
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,860
Here from your heart, not how many times, say,

477
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:36,790
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

478
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:05,890
Now, take back your right hand on the back side

479
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:13,790
of your head, and push back your head.

480
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:18,740
Here you have to say, without feeling guilty,

481
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,880
without counting your mistakes, for your own satisfaction,

482
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:26,820
"Oh, divine Power, if I have done any mistakes,

483
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:31,830
please forgive me."

484
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:48,810
Say it from your heart, not how many times.

485
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,700
Now,

486
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:09,790
stretch your palm,

487
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:16,740
and please put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone

488
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:21,850
area, which was a soft bone in your childhood.

489
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:32,790
Now bend your head.

490
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:39,860
Push back your fingers to put a pressure on your scalp.

491
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:48,890
Now move your scalp slowly, seven times.

492
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:53,910
But here again I cannot force Self-realization on you.

493
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:57,790
I respect your freedom. So say seven times,

494
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:04,750
"Mother, please give me Self-realization."

495
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:12,730
Now, please take down your hands.

496
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:22,760
Please put your hands like this towards Me,

497
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:35,710
and watch Me without thinking.

498
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:38,910
Like this, like this.

499
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:42,920
Now bend your head,

500
01:19:43,810 --> 01:19:46,740
and with the left hand see if there's

501
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:49,720
a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your own head -

502
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:53,820
you have to certify yourself.

503
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,920
Don't put the hand on top of your head but away from it,

504
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:18,760
and see for yourself. This is the proof.

505
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:27,680
Now, please put the left hand towards Me,

506
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:36,720
and put down your head again and see with the right hand.

507
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:41,700
Some people get it far away also.

508
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:51,730
Now with the right hand again.

509
01:20:58,790 --> 01:21:06,860
Now, please put both your hands towards the sky like this,

510
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:11,740
and ask a question,

511
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:16,880
one of those - one of these questions you ask,

512
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:24,750
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

513
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:34,820
Or second one, "Mother, is this the divine love of God?"

514
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:44,710
Or "Mother, is it Ruh or Paramchaitanya?"

515
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:56,810
Any one of these, you ask question three times.

516
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:06,730
Now please put down your hands. They've got it!

517
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:10,760
Put down your hands, please.

518
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:15,900
Like this you put it now.

519
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:21,860
Those who have felt cool or hot breeze

520
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:25,730
out of their fontanel bone,

521
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:29,820
or on their hands or fingertips,

522
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:33,770
please raise both your hands.

523
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:51,740
This is the proof. May God bless you.

524
01:22:51,830 --> 01:22:56,920
Now you have become really Christians.

525
01:22:58,730 --> 01:23:02,780
Now you have become saints.

526
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,750
This has to grow,

527
01:23:06,830 --> 01:23:10,720
your divinity has to grow.

528
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:16,900
As I told you, it will grow in collectivity.

529
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:24,740
We have here a very good center, and there are many people

530
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:29,730
who know about Sahaja Yoga very well.

531
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,830
You all should come,

532
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:43,710
and become great Sahaja yogis.

533
01:23:46,770 --> 01:23:50,720
You have to save your fellow-men here;

534
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:05,680
and you'll become masters in no time.

535
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:11,730
You don't have to pay for anything.

536
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,850
May God bless you.

537
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:27,780
I would like to meet you people today, tonight, if possible.

538
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:39,870
Now, they should come up...

539
01:25:35,690 --> 01:25:40,780
Don't talk with them. They are negative people.

540
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,830
