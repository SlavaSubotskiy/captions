1
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:08,983
First time when I came to United States, I
came to Los Angeles first.

2
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:12,054
Because, it’s a place of angels.

3
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:18,264
Actually, I thought that it must be a very
holy place to come down.

4
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:25,482
First of all, in this great land of United
States.

5
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:33,113
Now, as you know that United States or America,
the whole of it, is the Vishuddhi chakra.

6
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:43,013
Out of which, we have three sides to the Vishuddhi
chakra.

7
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:50,272
So, the central part of the Vishuddhi chakra
is United States.

8
00:05:50,304 --> 00:05:55,703
The central part of the Vishuddhi chakra is
governed by Shri Krishna.

9
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:59,719
And His power is Radha.

10
00:05:59,823 --> 00:06:01,506
“ RA - DHA “ .

11
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:07,668
“RA” means energy, “DHA” is the one
who has sustained the energy.

12
00:06:07,693 --> 00:06:08,747
“RA - DHA”.

13
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:10,191
“dha-re-ti-saa” .

14
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:18,718
So, she’s the one who has sustained the
energy, and so, she’s called as Radha.

15
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,093
She’s the power of Shri Krishna.

16
00:06:22,093 --> 00:06:30,543
The word Krishna comes from the word - krishi,
means - the plowing, or you can say, agriculture

17
00:06:30,543 --> 00:06:33,183
is called as “krishi”.

18
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:41,293
The one who plows and puts the seed in the
soil, is doing the krishi.

19
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:45,573
And, that’s why he’s called as Krishna.

20
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:55,101
Now, the seed that he has sown, is the seed
of spirituality.

21
00:06:55,144 --> 00:07:03,821
It is Shri Krishna who said, in sanskrit - “nainam
chindanti shastrani nainam dahati pavakah

22
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:09,600
na chainam kledayanty apo na sosayati marutah.

23
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:14,463
” meaning - it
cannot be, means, the spiritual life or you

24
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:23,925
can say, the eternal life, or the spirit,
cannot be killed by anything, by any weapon,

25
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:32,093
neither can be blown away by air, nor can
it be sucked in, nor can it be destroyed.

26
00:07:32,093 --> 00:07:38,412
So, to prove that, Christ came on this earth,
and through his resurrection he proved, what

27
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:41,813
Shri Krishna has said.

28
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:47,953
And most of you Sahaj yogis know the relationship
of Christ and Shri Krishna - why he was called

29
00:07:47,953 --> 00:07:48,953
Christ.

30
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:50,833
Christ word comes from the same - Krishi.

31
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:57,248
And, his first name comes from the word Yashoda.

32
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,883
Yashoda is also called as je-su or ye-su.

33
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:10,403
And that’s why (Krish) Christ was called
as Je-su or Ye-su.

34
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:14,673
Some people call him Yesu, and some people
call him as Jesu, because of Yashoda (the

35
00:08:14,673 --> 00:08:19,285
mother), the foster mother of Shri Krishna.

36
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:27,232
Also, you know that Radha was the same as
MahaLakshmi, so she was the same as the mother

37
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,703
of Christ, Mary.

38
00:08:28,703 --> 00:08:35,105
These, all these things we can prove it in
Sahaj Yoga.

39
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:41,362
Because, when the Kundalini moves up to the
Vishuddhi chakra, and if it stops there, you

40
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:49,313
can ask the question - (“Was Krishna the
son of mother Mary - no) Was Jesus the son

41
00:08:49,313 --> 00:08:51,383
of mother Mary?

42
00:08:51,383 --> 00:09:01,013
Was the son of Ra, was the same as Radha,
and then the Kundalini moves.

43
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:07,213
So, Sahaja Yoga today is a thing which proves
what has been said so far.

44
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,213
It proves.

45
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:11,683
It’s not just a cock and bull story.

46
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:14,293
Because people do not believe into all these
things.

47
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:16,203
They think that it’s all cock and bull story.

48
00:09:16,203 --> 00:09:17,203
Who was Christ?

49
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:18,203
Who was Krishna?

50
00:09:18,203 --> 00:09:19,203
Who was Radha?

51
00:09:19,203 --> 00:09:20,793
After all, there was no God.

52
00:09:20,818 --> 00:09:27,219
But only in Sahaja Yoga, today, we can prove
it, that what we say is the truth.

53
00:09:27,297 --> 00:09:33,573
Because, as through realization, you get connected
to the mains.

54
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,743
Your vibrations start flowing.

55
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:40,613
Like the computer, you start working.

56
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:46,783
And whatever question you ask, answer comes
to you as tremendous vibrations, or it stops

57
00:09:46,783 --> 00:09:49,693
or you might get heat or you may get blisters.

58
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:55,293
So, the whole message is communicated to you
through your finger tips.

59
00:09:55,293 --> 00:10:03,413
As Mohammad Sahab has very clearly said, that
“at the time of resurrection, your hands

60
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:05,263
will speak”.

61
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:08,803
But the muslims do not want to talk about
resurrection at all.

62
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:11,673
Because, they want to frighten people with
the doomsday.

63
00:10:11,673 --> 00:10:16,476
They don’t want to talk about the resurrection
time which is going to come, which is the

64
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:17,825
intermediary time.

65
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:24,893
Because they want to use the time, which will
frighten people by saying that “now your

66
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:26,003
doomsday is coming”!

67
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:30,723
Now, your doomsday is coming, so everybody
is frightened about God and they think that

68
00:10:30,723 --> 00:10:35,614
now we should just wait for our doom, nothing
else is in between.

69
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,623
So, this is how the Vishuddhi chakra is a
special one.

70
00:10:39,623 --> 00:10:45,293
Now Vishuddhi chakra (is) was created on the
Saturday.

71
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:52,053
So, it is the Saturn - that’s the important
star of the Vishuddhi chakra.

72
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:58,654
So, whenever the Saturn is at the highest,
America will be in a better place to do things.

73
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:04,413
But, I don’t think they know much about
themselves.

74
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:09,443
They don’t know what they are, why they
are on this earth, what is their work, what

75
00:11:09,443 --> 00:11:16,353
they are supposed to do, or what is the purpose
of God of creating America.

76
00:11:16,353 --> 00:11:23,843
The first job of the Vishuddhi chakra within
us was that, when we became human beings,

77
00:11:23,843 --> 00:11:27,263
we raised our heads up like that.

78
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:33,163
When you raise your head up like that, you
have become a human being, in the sense that

79
00:11:33,163 --> 00:11:36,583
now, there is a new movement in your consciousness.

80
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:45,193
Now the new movement in your consciousness
started about 6000 years back when Shri Krishna

81
00:11:45,193 --> 00:11:47,363
came on this earth.

82
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:51,173
That the new movement was, that it is the
Father.

83
00:11:51,173 --> 00:11:58,183
The advent of the Father was celebrated, and
that’s how people developed a kind of a

84
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:04,435
new instrument within themselves, called ego.

85
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:11,933
When the brain was lifted like this you see,
it expanded in a pyramidical - it’s a pyramid

86
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:13,913
- it became a pyramid.

87
00:12:13,913 --> 00:12:16,813
In an animal, the brain is flat.

88
00:12:16,813 --> 00:12:18,533
And, gradually it rises.

89
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:24,113
When the head was raised, when the responsibility
was taken of raising the head, the brain started

90
00:12:24,113 --> 00:12:27,272
growing in such a way that it became a pyramid.

91
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:34,583
And when it became a pyramid, the attention
became a different attention from that of

92
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,583
animal.

93
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:43,593
Because, when the waves of your consciousness
fell on the sides of the pyramid, they went

94
00:12:43,593 --> 00:12:50,353
into the parallelogram of forces, by which
the resultant force - the resultant force

95
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:59,143
- now, it falls like this, goes like that,
the resultant force is like that - had two

96
00:12:59,143 --> 00:13:02,042
sides - one was this, another was this .

97
00:13:02,268 --> 00:13:09,733
So the consciousness, or we can say, the attention
- instead of going inside, started going out!

98
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:15,443
So, one part of the resultant was going outside
and that’s how, when you became a human

99
00:13:15,443 --> 00:13:18,932
being, your attention went outside.

100
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:23,073
Is the human beings only, who have their attention
outside.

101
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:30,162
Not that the animals don’t have, but the
attention of human beings are such that they

102
00:13:30,187 --> 00:13:32,154
create reactions.

103
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:35,353
Like, you see something.

104
00:13:35,353 --> 00:13:43,122
Now, I see Doctor’s house for example, then
a reaction starts in my mind - what is this,

105
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:48,502
what does this mean, how much it must have
cost, from where did he buy it!

106
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:51,732
Anything you see, it starts giving you a reaction.

107
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:53,093
Not to the animals.

108
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:58,983
Animals, at the most they will say - this
I must eat, that I must eat, that I must get!

109
00:13:58,983 --> 00:14:01,163
But, they do not think about it.

110
00:14:01,163 --> 00:14:04,713
It’s only the human beings who reflect.

111
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:11,833
And this reflection comes because of the pyramid-like
structure of the brain.

112
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:21,553
And, this has a special reaction in the brain
itself, that we start developing our own ego,

113
00:14:21,553 --> 00:14:25,283
our own myths, our own mental projections.

114
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:32,543
And when we develop our own mental projections,
this ego starts developing - I know - what’s

115
00:14:32,543 --> 00:14:35,533
wrong, all these nonsensical things come.

116
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:39,923
And once that starts working out, the balloon
of the ego starts rising.

117
00:14:39,923 --> 00:14:45,533
It starts pushing the other balloon which
was within us, is of the superego - as an

118
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:46,533
animal.

119
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:47,893
And then, comes up in the center.

120
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:52,942
That’s how we now become normal human beings.

121
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:57,653
But then we start increasing our ego.

122
00:14:57,653 --> 00:15:07,803
It starts overlapping the superego, and a
calcification takes place, by which we develop

123
00:15:07,803 --> 00:15:08,983
our I-ness.

124
00:15:08,983 --> 00:15:16,632
So, it is all the happening that takes place
after we have lifted our head, raised our

125
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:20,083
head, and we are no more like animals.

126
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:27,692
So, Vishuddhi chakra has a very big part to
play in the human evolution, that by developing

127
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:35,131
your Vishuddhi chakra, you have become human
beings, first of all.

128
00:15:35,156 --> 00:15:44,093
Secondly, because it is the chakra of the
father, who becomes again, the primordial

129
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:48,185
- as you call it, in a (marathi).

130
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,166
macrocosm.

131
00:15:56,264 --> 00:15:59,283
You become the macrocosm.

132
00:15:59,283 --> 00:16:04,672
You are the microcosm, and the father is the
macrocosm.

133
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:12,172
So, you become that because of the Vishuddhi
chakra, which is governed by Shri Krishna,

134
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:16,262
who becomes that macrocosm, called as Virat.

135
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:20,052
In the brain it is expressed in this part

136
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:22,802
In this part of the head.

137
00:16:22,802 --> 00:16:31,723
It is here that you start manifesting your
macrocosm qualities - at this point.

138
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:38,472
Now, this Vishuddhi chakra has a speciality
- is that, we always say that the responsibility

139
00:16:38,472 --> 00:16:39,472
on my shoulders.

140
00:16:39,472 --> 00:16:43,453
Always we say that - the responsibilities
are on my shoulders.

141
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:50,479
The reason is, the Vishuddhi chakra gives
you the sense of responsibility.

142
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:55,110
And that’s why you know, the Americans feel
responsible for the whole world.

143
00:16:55,135 --> 00:16:57,460
Naturally!

144
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:03,552
It’s perfectly understood, that they feel
responsible for the whole world.

145
00:17:03,552 --> 00:17:14,203
But how much they are aware of their role
as the responsible people, that’s a different point.

146
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:22,482
But they feel, they are responsible, but their
role, as responsible people, if they understand

147
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:26,132
that they have to be ideals.

148
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:27,442
Ideals.

149
00:17:27,442 --> 00:17:33,782
Because a person who is a responsible person
in a family, has to be the ideal for others.

150
00:17:33,782 --> 00:17:37,756
It started very well, I should say, at the
time of Abraham Lincoln.

151
00:17:37,781 --> 00:17:39,168
It started very well.

152
00:17:39,248 --> 00:17:45,352
When you started talking about democracy,
is also - democracy is nothing but collectivity.

153
00:17:45,634 --> 00:17:50,856
He started talking about the collectivity
of the people, by the people.

154
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:58,222
All that shows that the sense of collectivity
started coming right in this Vishuddhi chakra.

155
00:17:58,222 --> 00:18:08,514
But then, people who are in the center, can
only remain normal.

156
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:16,453
But those who bend too much, or who bend backward
too much, both suffer from problems.

157
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:22,900
The ones who bend forward to others, are the
people who get their superego.

158
00:18:22,963 --> 00:18:26,643
They get over-humble-down, like developing
countries are.

159
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:33,252
And those who bend backward, are the people
who try to dominate others.

160
00:18:33,252 --> 00:18:36,533
Who have ego.

161
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:44,752
So, because of sudden blessings of God, they
discovered so many things.

162
00:18:44,752 --> 00:18:48,752
The ego started developing in America too
much.

163
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,713
But ego is like a balloon, as I told you.

164
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:55,773
And, keeps you floating in the air.

165
00:18:55,773 --> 00:18:59,105
And when you are in the air, you become shallow
people.

166
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,242
You have no moorings.

167
00:19:01,242 --> 00:19:07,903
But, it has one more advantage, if you knew
you are floating in the air, you can have

168
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,744
a complete comprehensive view.

169
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:20,492
Complete vision of the Whole, if your eyes
are pure and your intentions are clear-cut.

170
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:29,192
Now (the) another thing that happens by their
coming here, was the problem, that they felt

171
00:19:29,192 --> 00:19:32,301
that - we are a very new nation.

172
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:36,292
It has an advantage, as well as, it has a
disadvantage.

173
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:45,352
Advantage is that if you are new, it’s very
good because you can be transformed into something

174
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:49,851
better very easily, because there is no conditioning
in your mind.

175
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:59,072
You are very clean, absolutely ready, to become
something (?).

176
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:05,893
Or else, can be possibility that, you are
so new that you are awed by everything that

177
00:20:05,893 --> 00:20:12,312
is old, which is very true about Americans,
that they bought all the old bridges from

178
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:15,773
England to bring them down here.

179
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:19,273
And the cravings about the old is too much
here.

180
00:20:19,273 --> 00:20:21,983
And that, as if whatever is new, is all absurd!

181
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:24,783
So, maybe even Sahaja Yoga maybe an absurd
thing for them.

182
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:32,172
Because according to them, this is something
new.

183
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:36,652
Because they are new nations, they have started
discarding all that is new.

184
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,132
Is an absurd thing.

185
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:45,393
Now, we must say that Sahaja Yoga, as it is
today, is the most ancient thing.

186
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:54,513
It started with the universe and now the culmination
point has come, because it is a living process.

187
00:20:54,513 --> 00:20:58,973
As you see a flower on the tree, it’s the
first new flower.

188
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:06,773
But the flower has come out of a seed, which
has got the roots and then it became the trunk,

189
00:21:06,773 --> 00:21:12,263
then it became the leaves, and then it has
now become a flower.

190
00:21:12,263 --> 00:21:17,492
So, though it looks a new flower, it has a
big heritage.

191
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:23,242
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga is as ancient
as this universe is.

192
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:30,972
But to people, who have such a hankering for
traditionalism, find it difficult to find

193
00:21:30,972 --> 00:21:32,602
out what is real tradition.

194
00:21:32,602 --> 00:21:37,182
Only those who are traditional people, can
know what is real tradition.

195
00:21:37,182 --> 00:21:45,192
Last time I came here, in America, and I was
shocked that a person came to interview me.

196
00:21:45,192 --> 00:21:51,453
And when he was talking, he asked about one
gentleman who was most untraditional from

197
00:21:51,453 --> 00:21:52,632
Indian point of view.

198
00:21:52,632 --> 00:21:54,851
His name was Ramakrishna Paramhamsa.

199
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:57,636
He married a woman and made her a mother.

200
00:21:57,764 --> 00:21:58,565
I mean, it’s,

201
00:21:58,629 --> 00:22:00,295
nobody has done it.

202
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:01,207
Rama has not done it.

203
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:02,500
Krishna has not done it.

204
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:04,612
It’s an absurd stuff.

205
00:22:04,612 --> 00:22:07,733
But for them, he was the most traditional
man.

206
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:10,794
And he told me that , mother your Sahaja Yoga
is not traditional if you don’t believe

207
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:12,762
in Ramakrishna.

208
00:22:12,794 --> 00:22:18,173
Last fifty-sixty years, all such neo-traditional
people came up.

209
00:22:18,173 --> 00:22:22,083
Another one was this Pondicherry fellow.

210
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,033
Another absurd situation.

211
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:29,233
He called this woman a mother, and his relation
with her is ambiguous.

212
00:22:29,233 --> 00:22:31,503
You don’t know what relationship they had.

213
00:22:31,503 --> 00:22:36,593
I mean that is something, in Indian tradition,
is an impossible situation.

214
00:22:36,593 --> 00:22:39,193
You have to have clear-cut relationship with
everyone.

215
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:40,413
You cannot have ambiguous.

216
00:22:40,413 --> 00:22:44,943
Neither a friend, nor a wife, nor a mother
or a sister.

217
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:47,633
That kind of a situation is most untraditional.

218
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:48,903
Is never thought of.

219
00:22:48,903 --> 00:22:51,823
I mean, you Indians can know this is not possible.

220
00:22:51,823 --> 00:22:54,223
This is an absurd situation.

221
00:22:54,223 --> 00:22:58,107
But, for some people, he is traditional.

222
00:22:58,162 --> 00:23:03,713
What happened, about sixty years back, I think
about the time of my birth only, the negativity

223
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:09,443
started taking a new form in understanding
the western confusion.

224
00:23:09,443 --> 00:23:13,283
They are all western in this, if you see them.

225
00:23:13,283 --> 00:23:18,455
And the western confusion they took over for
their own advantages.

226
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,233
They used it for their own advantages.

227
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:26,413
And this is where the western people have
failed to make them out.

228
00:23:26,413 --> 00:23:37,170
The other day, at the Jungian place, I was
to talk to Jung people with Sahaja Yoga and Jung.

229
00:23:37,286 --> 00:23:43,151
Now Jung, I came to know only when he died,
because there was a little article about him.

230
00:23:43,176 --> 00:23:45,405
I never studied psychology.

231
00:23:45,436 --> 00:23:48,273
Of course, I tried to learn some vocabulary
to talk to them.

232
00:23:48,273 --> 00:23:50,823
Sometimes I thought, I may have to talk to
them also.

233
00:23:50,823 --> 00:23:55,703
But these Jungians, all very intellectuals
and great people sitting before me, you see.

234
00:23:55,703 --> 00:24:00,293
(not clear)[I won’t heard of them?] the
President of American Jungian society.

235
00:24:00,293 --> 00:24:06,375
I’d just gone through a book, just before
starting it, and I saw some diagrams

236
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,117
 which really puzzled me.

237
00:24:09,142 --> 00:24:13,033
The first conception they had, of course it’s
all mental conception of Jung.

238
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:18,343
I don’t blame him because he got realization
but he did not know how the state was created,

239
00:24:18,343 --> 00:24:25,433
was what the framework of the state and his
movement was still of a seeker to find out

240
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:27,163
how he got his realization.

241
00:24:27,163 --> 00:24:29,103
And, all movements were linear.

242
00:24:29,103 --> 00:24:31,853
They were not expanding from one point all
over.

243
00:24:31,853 --> 00:24:34,113
So, it was not so integrated.

244
00:24:34,113 --> 00:24:39,123
Now, the thing they showed was that at the
bottom of it was the unconscious, which is

245
00:24:39,123 --> 00:24:40,743
never going to be conscious.

246
00:24:40,743 --> 00:24:46,413
On top of that was the (conscious) unconscious
that can be conscious.

247
00:24:46,413 --> 00:24:50,073
Then, there was subconscious and on top of
that was the ego.

248
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:55,243
I mean what a mess of a thing it was I tell
you.

249
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:59,953
I told them, see, now the word unconscious
itself is confusing.

250
00:24:59,953 --> 00:25:01,253
What do you mean by unconscious?

251
00:25:01,253 --> 00:25:06,053
Whatever you don’t feel on your central
nervous system is unconscious - alright?

252
00:25:06,053 --> 00:25:07,663
But, what does that mean?

253
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:10,453
We don’t feel the subconscious.

254
00:25:10,453 --> 00:25:13,573
Then, subconscious is also unconscious.

255
00:25:13,573 --> 00:25:20,263
Whatever we don’t feel - for example, there
are certain sounds of certain frequencies

256
00:25:20,263 --> 00:25:22,303
we don’t hear at all.

257
00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:26,223
We hear whatever is tolerable to us as human
beings.

258
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:28,163
That you all scientists know.

259
00:25:28,163 --> 00:25:30,553
We don’t hear everything.

260
00:25:30,553 --> 00:25:34,733
So, all that is unconscious - means it’s
a mixed bag.

261
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,423
All sorts of things mixed up together.

262
00:25:36,423 --> 00:25:40,583
But God is not a hodge podge person you see.

263
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:43,213
He is a clear-cut gentleman.

264
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:44,613
He knows what he is doing.

265
00:25:44,613 --> 00:25:46,123
He is the greatest organizer.

266
00:25:46,123 --> 00:25:51,863
And, how can he put you into a bag like that
- that the unconscious is below, then on top

267
00:25:51,863 --> 00:25:56,873
of it is the unconscious that is going to
be conscious, on top of it is the subconscious,

268
00:25:56,873 --> 00:26:00,783
on top of the consciousness, on top of that
the ego!

269
00:26:00,783 --> 00:26:06,013
So you go down, carrying all this inside you
and where do you go?

270
00:26:06,013 --> 00:26:09,103
Now, how do you go?

271
00:26:09,103 --> 00:26:16,630
So the first mistake was that there are layers
one on top of another - it’s not so.

272
00:26:16,655 --> 00:26:20,503
They are placed vertically.

273
00:26:20,503 --> 00:26:25,693
The ego is on the right hand side and superego
on the left hand side.

274
00:26:25,693 --> 00:26:30,323
The future on the right hand side and the
past on the left hand side.

275
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:35,803
So the subconscious on the left hand side
and the supraconscious on the right hand side.

276
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,653
And the central path is kept clear cut.

277
00:26:37,653 --> 00:26:44,605
I mean in any organization, say if you go
to the airport, do you have like this that

278
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:48,063
you have to pass through the walls to go to
the aeroplane.

279
00:26:48,063 --> 00:26:54,403
If we human beings don’t commit such horrible
mistakes, how can God commit such a mistake?

280
00:26:54,403 --> 00:26:58,213
So it was absolutely wrong to think that way.

281
00:26:58,213 --> 00:27:03,943
So, the central path is in the center while
the right side is on the right side and the

282
00:27:03,943 --> 00:27:06,043
left side on the left side.

283
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:09,413
And you don’t have to go to the subconscious
at all.

284
00:27:09,413 --> 00:27:14,073
Because they justified all these people who
are trying to make them hypnosis or they are

285
00:27:14,073 --> 00:27:20,443
trying to hypnotize them or to give them a
new type of a - sort of an experience - all

286
00:27:20,443 --> 00:27:22,453
that was unconscious, we should accept that.

287
00:27:22,453 --> 00:27:26,101
Even some people if they start suddenly jumping,
they say - oh that’s great.

288
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:30,870
So the sensations that you get from the subconscious
and the supraconscious

289
00:27:30,895 --> 00:27:32,853
were accepted as something great.

290
00:27:32,878 --> 00:27:36,623
It was a confusion of your intellectuals I
should say.

291
00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:37,623
Complete.

292
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,263
But it is not so.

293
00:27:39,263 --> 00:27:41,433
Your path is straightforward.

294
00:27:41,433 --> 00:27:43,343
Absolutely for Kundalini.

295
00:27:43,343 --> 00:27:49,773
Only thing, the one who has to raise it had
to come - that’s all.

296
00:27:49,773 --> 00:27:54,563
But otherwise, it’s all very well, there
is no need for you to get into that horrible

297
00:27:54,563 --> 00:27:55,563
subconscious.

298
00:27:55,563 --> 00:27:58,288
When I told them, they were amazed.

299
00:27:58,313 --> 00:27:59,835
They said - Mother it is so simple.

300
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,863
I said - it’s very simple.

301
00:28:00,863 --> 00:28:03,493
Your unconscious is divided into four.

302
00:28:03,493 --> 00:28:09,103
One is the collective subconscious, one is
the collective supraconscious, one is - you

303
00:28:09,103 --> 00:28:17,813
can say - the collective hell, and on top
is the super collective consciousness.

304
00:28:17,813 --> 00:28:21,723
So where do we have to go?

305
00:28:21,753 --> 00:28:23,568
We should know our destination.

306
00:28:23,593 --> 00:28:25,963
Then, we have to reach.

307
00:28:25,963 --> 00:28:32,151
And that is how the problem of all these people
getting entangled with Muktanand.

308
00:28:32,176 --> 00:28:34,893
Yes, they asked me a question - What is wrong
with Muktanand?

309
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:36,423
Why is he so dangerous?

310
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:40,725
One lady, poor thing, as Sahaj would have
it, she came, she said - oh I went there,

311
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,133
I broke my back and I’m finished once and
for all.

312
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:44,583
He’s such a dangerous man.

313
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:45,583
He flattered me.

314
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:47,903
I went there and I don’t know what has happened
to my back.

315
00:28:47,903 --> 00:28:51,483
I can’t sit for more than ten minutes in
one place, I have to get up.

316
00:28:51,483 --> 00:28:54,663
And I have a vibrator, I have to always put
it like that.

317
00:28:54,663 --> 00:28:56,343
So I said, see the dangers.

318
00:28:56,343 --> 00:29:02,883
Then the another theory they started that
we must suffer if we have to go to God.

319
00:29:02,883 --> 00:29:03,883
Why?

320
00:29:03,883 --> 00:29:05,373
I mean that’s not God’s idea by any chance.

321
00:29:05,373 --> 00:29:07,773
Why should you suffer?

322
00:29:07,773 --> 00:29:09,983
He made Christ suffer for you - finished now.

323
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:10,983
You better not suffer.

324
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,803
There’s no need to suffer at all.

325
00:29:12,803 --> 00:29:18,493
So, all these ideas penetrated into these
western people.

326
00:29:18,493 --> 00:29:23,683
And these mental projections - they accepted
without even understanding what is written

327
00:29:23,683 --> 00:29:24,683
in other books.

328
00:29:24,683 --> 00:29:25,743
We should see.

329
00:29:25,743 --> 00:29:30,263
And they could only go as far as the sixty
years where all these horrible people who

330
00:29:30,263 --> 00:29:32,393
went to India, very shallow people.

331
00:29:32,393 --> 00:29:37,403
They saw some of these tantric books, because
they wanted to justify Freud through Indian

332
00:29:37,403 --> 00:29:38,423
culture.

333
00:29:38,423 --> 00:29:43,093
So they got the tantricas, erotic things and
all that and brought these books and some

334
00:29:43,093 --> 00:29:47,013
of them read - I don’t know what books - to
say that Kundalini is in the stomach, somebody

335
00:29:47,013 --> 00:29:48,673
says in the brain.

336
00:29:48,673 --> 00:29:50,923
I mean they don’t know where the Kundalini
is.

337
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:52,493
They are writing such big big books.

338
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:53,493
Can you imagine?

339
00:29:53,493 --> 00:29:55,503
Such big big books they have written.

340
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:58,523
Now, when the books are written, every book
is not a scripture.

341
00:29:58,523 --> 00:30:03,003
But to them, if it is written in the book
you see, it’s a scripture.

342
00:30:03,003 --> 00:30:06,113
And that’s how the whole confusion started
going on.

343
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:12,540
So these people came down, took full advantage
of it and now they have become great gurus

344
00:30:14,098 --> 00:30:15,769
with lot of money.

345
00:30:15,794 --> 00:30:17,278
Rich people.

346
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:31,553
But now, as the hand of God is great, one
by one, they are getting out of the heads

347
00:30:31,553 --> 00:30:34,003
of these people.

348
00:30:34,003 --> 00:30:38,843
And now I hope a day will come when people
will see the light.

349
00:30:38,843 --> 00:30:43,523
So the task of Sahaja Yoga is to establish
the truth within yourself.

350
00:30:43,523 --> 00:30:45,943
It is not that we can have membership.

351
00:30:45,943 --> 00:30:49,593
We cannot have a person enroll into it.

352
00:30:49,593 --> 00:30:54,093
We cannot call them as branded Sahaja yogis.

353
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:57,273
It’s the growth of the person - that is
to be seen.

354
00:30:57,273 --> 00:31:02,103
Now there are so many lectures which I have
given about ritambhara pragya and all these

355
00:31:02,103 --> 00:31:07,443
things and I think for every sahaja yogi it
is necessary to listen to those lectures,

356
00:31:07,443 --> 00:31:13,513
go through it, understand them and to meditate
so that you grow.

357
00:31:13,513 --> 00:31:15,643
Because it is not a plastic thing that we
can create.

358
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:24,543
It’s a living process of the living energy
of the living God.

359
00:31:24,543 --> 00:31:27,373
And so, it has to grow.

360
00:31:27,373 --> 00:31:33,453
By thinking you cannot make it grow but by
not thinking, you allow it to grow more and

361
00:31:33,453 --> 00:31:34,453
more.

362
00:31:34,453 --> 00:31:39,323
As it starts growing within you, then only
you realize what you are.

363
00:31:39,323 --> 00:31:44,503
That’s the only way you have to reach that
state of superconsciousness and establish

364
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,003
yourself there.

365
00:31:46,003 --> 00:31:48,785
Then only you will know what I’m talking
about.

366
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,263
Now today’s puja is another thing.

367
00:31:51,263 --> 00:31:52,263
Now, what is a Puja.

368
00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:55,206
Can you people say what a puja is?

369
00:31:55,357 --> 00:31:59,393
Actually yesterday I had a puja and it’s
not easy for me to bear the pujas to be very

370
00:31:59,393 --> 00:32:01,653
frank you know.

371
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:05,743
Because the vibrations are so much that I
don’t know.

372
00:32:05,743 --> 00:32:10,163
And then, I went to the airport - two hours
we took out the vibrations and put them for

373
00:32:10,163 --> 00:32:12,573
all the New York airport.

374
00:32:12,573 --> 00:32:13,633
It was necessary.

375
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:15,033
It worked out.

376
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:21,534
Because vibrations start flowing with tremendous
force and if you people do not absorb it,

377
00:32:21,534 --> 00:32:26,093
it takes time for it to ooze out from my body.

378
00:32:26,093 --> 00:32:28,703
Makes me rather heavy with it.

379
00:32:28,703 --> 00:32:36,163
But, then it oozes out and I feel better and
only thing that happens by saying the mantras,

380
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:43,102
you awaken the deities within yourself and
start receiving the vibrations.

381
00:32:43,102 --> 00:32:49,243
And when your deities are awakened, they are
awakened through the power of the deities

382
00:32:49,243 --> 00:32:53,893
within me - they have to work very hard to
do that, and that’s how they emit too much

383
00:32:53,893 --> 00:32:59,183
vibrations which must be absorbed by you when
your deities are awakened.

384
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:00,943
That’s how it works.

385
00:33:00,943 --> 00:33:03,003
You cannot describe it in words.

386
00:33:03,003 --> 00:33:05,096
You cannot tell it in words.

387
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:07,560
It’s a happening that has to take place.

388
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:11,503
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga first,
can go little bit like that

389
00:33:11,528 --> 00:33:12,758
in the beginning.

390
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:18,783
Gradually they settle down, come round, grow
into it, then it becomes alright.

391
00:33:18,783 --> 00:33:22,383
Some people just shoot off in one day, and
they are there.

392
00:33:22,383 --> 00:33:23,883
Makes no difference whatsoever.

393
00:33:23,883 --> 00:33:27,983
Because it’s a growing thing and it has
to grow.

394
00:33:27,983 --> 00:33:33,533
With some people , the land is so fertile,
or maybe something, that it just works out

395
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:34,533
fast.

396
00:33:34,533 --> 00:33:36,723
So, nobody should blame anyone.

397
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:40,117
And specially, one should not feel guilty
because that’s the vishuddhi on the left

398
00:33:40,142 --> 00:33:41,164
hand side.

399
00:33:41,267 --> 00:33:46,793
Specially for America, I’m wearing this
stone which is called as the black sapphire.

400
00:33:46,793 --> 00:33:50,313
Because, this is the stone of Shri Krishna.

401
00:33:50,313 --> 00:33:52,923
It’s the stone of Vishuddhi chakra.

402
00:33:52,923 --> 00:33:55,423
Every chakra has a stone.

403
00:33:55,448 --> 00:33:59,944
And this is the stone of the Vishuddhi chakra,
so I’m wearing this, just for coming to

404
00:33:59,969 --> 00:34:00,626
America.

405
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:16,783
And, I hope that today’s worship will bring
out the potential of this country by exciting

406
00:34:16,783 --> 00:34:22,783
the deities, Shri Krishna himself, who is
in charge.

407
00:34:22,783 --> 00:34:25,643
By pleasing him.

408
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:27,123
By making him active.

409
00:34:27,123 --> 00:34:33,153
And, he has great qualities, and one of the
greatest qualities he has that he has the

410
00:34:33,153 --> 00:34:35,663
- sanwahra shakti - by which he can kill the
demons.

411
00:34:35,663 --> 00:34:40,573
And, all those demons who are settled down
here, are really mistaken.

412
00:34:40,573 --> 00:34:46,883
Because, if this is the place of Shri Krishna,
they are very dangerously placed.

413
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:51,713
Because once he is awakened here, they all
will be completely finished through his sudarashan

414
00:34:51,713 --> 00:34:56,573
chakra, which he has in his hand and he can
just kill them one by one.

415
00:34:56,573 --> 00:35:03,679
But first he’s to be pleased, and he’s
to be awakened, he has to be “prasanna”.

416
00:35:03,704 --> 00:35:04,813
That’s the word.

417
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:07,053
Prasanna means, to be pleased.

418
00:35:07,053 --> 00:35:08,513
And then, it works out.

419
00:35:08,513 --> 00:35:13,973
So today first we will have Ganesha’s puja,
little bit, because Ganesha’s puja is meant

420
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:16,653
just to establish the innocence.

421
00:35:16,653 --> 00:35:20,083
The innocence of the place.

422
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:22,233
Once the innocence is established, that’s
the most important.

423
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:23,233
That’s the essence of everything.

424
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:24,283
Ganesha is the essence.

425
00:35:24,283 --> 00:35:31,463
And, then we will have Shri Krishna puja and
then the puja of the Devi of the Power.

426
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:37,293
So, that’s how we’ll have three pujas
- one after another, but a short time every

427
00:35:37,293 --> 00:35:38,293
time.

428
00:35:38,293 --> 00:35:38,313
Alright?
