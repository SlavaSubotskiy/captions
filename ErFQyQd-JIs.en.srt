1
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:12,466
Beautiful!

2
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:23,613
So beautiful it is. I’ll step down. Wow,
it’s so nice.

3
00:00:23,814 --> 00:00:27,430
How are you? May God bless you all.

4
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:29,239
May God bless you.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,533
So. Hello!

6
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:36,134
Actually it was to start at eleven,

7
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:39,292
because my watch was one hour before.

8
00:00:39,493 --> 00:00:42,596
Poor thing, then she had to prepare
something

9
00:00:42,797 --> 00:00:44,824
and it took exactly so much time.

10
00:00:45,024 --> 00:00:47,922
So I think you are quite in time for
everything.

11
00:00:48,123 --> 00:00:50,864
Thank you.

12
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:10,281
Keep the flowers here, will be a good idea.

13
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:21,197
Hallo.

14
00:01:31,283 --> 00:01:37,606
Basa. Hallo, how are you? Good.

15
00:01:39,203 --> 00:01:42,306
Please, please, be seated.

16
00:01:50,017 --> 00:01:55,919
I think, Nick, you’ll have to come to
Houston, if you don’t mind. Alright?

17
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,491
We’ll get you the ticket and you come
along to Houston with us,

18
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:05,320
because this thing has to be handled
now further on, eh?

19
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:09,445
Yogi: I’m very lucky, Mother.
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

20
00:02:10,147 --> 00:02:13,433
Come forward.

21
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:15,161
Keep the door open, I think will be
a good idea.

22
00:04:15,362 --> 00:04:18,045
It’s just the door, keep side open, will be
actually a good idea.

23
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:21,993
With the door open it should act.

2
00:05:03,817 --> 00:05:10,215
First time when I came to United States,
I came to Los Angeles first.

3
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,372
Because it’s a place of angels.

4
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:18,494
Actually, I thought that it must be a very
holy place to come down,

5
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:26,600
first of all, in this great land of United
States.

6
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:30,203
Now, as you know that United States
or America,

7
00:05:30,404 --> 00:05:35,045
the whole of it, is the Vishuddhi chakra.

8
00:05:35,246 --> 00:05:42,715
Out of which, we have three sides
to the Vishuddhi chakra.

9
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:50,508
So, the central part of the Vishuddhi
chakra is United States.

10
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:57,094
The central part of the Vishuddhi chakra
is governed by Shri Krishna.

11
00:05:57,295 --> 00:06:00,868
And His power is Radha.

12
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:07,900
“RA – DHA”. “RA” means energy, “DHA” is
the one who has sustained the energy.

13
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,481
“RA – DHA”. “dha-re-ti-saa”.

14
00:06:11,682 --> 00:06:16,514
So, she’s the one who has sustained
the energy,

15
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:22,184
and so, she’s called as Radha. She’s
the power of Shri Krishna.

16
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:27,269
The word Krishna comes from the word –
Krishi, means –

17
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:33,284
the ploughing, or you can say, agriculture
is called as “Krishi”.

18
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:41,673
The one who ploughs and puts the seed
in the soil, is doing the krishi.

19
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:45,766
And, that’s why he’s called as Krishna.

20
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:56,474
Now, the seed that he has sown, is the seed
of spirituality.

21
00:06:56,675 --> 00:07:00,257
It is Shri Krishna who said, in Sanskrit –

22
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:04,594
“Nainam chindanti shastrani
nainam dahati pavakah

23
00:07:04,795 --> 00:07:10,171
na chainam kledayanty apo
na shoshayati marutah”

24
00:07:10,372 --> 00:07:14,311
meaning – it cannot be, means,
the spiritual life

25
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:18,883
or you can say, the eternal life, or
the Spirit,

26
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:24,136
cannot be killed by anything, by any
weapon,

27
00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:27,520
neither can be blown away by air,

28
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:32,802
nor can it be sucked in, nor can it be
destroyed.

29
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:36,013
So, to prove that, Christ came on this
earth,

30
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:41,965
and through His resurrection he proved,
what Shri Krishna has said.

31
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:45,031
And most of you sahaj yogis know
the relationship

32
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:48,402
of Christ and Shri Krishna – why he was
called Christ.

33
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:52,520
Christ word comes from the same – Krishna.

34
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:57,726
And, his first name comes from the word
Yashoda.

35
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:00,865
Yashoda is also called as Jesu or Yesu.

36
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:10,423
And that’s why (Krish) Christ was called
as Je-su or Ye-su.

37
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:13,539
Some people call him Yesu, and some people
call him as Jesu,

38
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,949
because of Yashoda (the mother), the foster
mother of Shri Krishna.

39
00:08:19,757 --> 00:08:23,728
Also, you know that Radha was the same
as Mahalakshmi,

40
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:31,584
so she was the same as the mother
of Christ, Mary.

41
00:08:31,785 --> 00:08:34,808
These, all these things we can prove it
in Sahaj Yoga.

42
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:40,121
Because, when the Kundalini moves up
to the Vishuddhi chakra,

43
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:43,700
and if it stops there, you can ask
the question –

44
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:47,215
“Was Krishna the son of mother Mary?

45
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:52,013
(She corrects Herself) Was Jesus the son
of mother Mary?

46
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:59,554
Who was the son of Ra, was the same
as Radha?”

47
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:01,540
And then the Kundalini moves.

48
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:07,173
So, Sahaja Yoga today is the thing which
proves what has been said so far.

49
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:11,483
It proves. It’s not just a cock and bull
story.

50
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:14,554
Because people do not believe into all
these things.

51
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:17,198
They think that it’s all cock and bull
story. Who was Christ?

52
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,791
Who was Krishna? Who was Radha? After all,
there was no God.

53
00:09:20,992 --> 00:09:27,528
But only in Sahaja Yoga, today, we can
prove it, that what we say is the truth.

54
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:33,060
Because, as through realisation, you get
connected to the mains,

55
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:37,473
your vibrations start flowing,

56
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:40,571
like the computer, you start working.

57
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:43,201
And whatever question you ask,

58
00:09:43,402 --> 00:09:46,104
answer comes to you as tremendous
vibrations,

59
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:49,986
or it stops or you might get heat or you
may get blisters.

60
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:57,413
So, the whole message is communicated
to you through your fingertips.

61
00:09:57,614 --> 00:09:59,909
As Mohammad Saheb has very clearly said,

62
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:05,271
that “At the time of resurrection, your
hands will speak”.

63
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:09,021
But the Muslims do not want to talk about
resurrection at all.

64
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:12,684
Because, they want to frighten people
with the doomsday.

65
00:10:12,885 --> 00:10:16,294
They don’t want to talk about the
resurrection time which is going to come,

66
00:10:16,495 --> 00:10:18,055
which is the intermediary time.

67
00:10:18,256 --> 00:10:23,338
Because they want to use the time, which
will frighten people

68
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,635
by saying that, “Now your doomsday
is coming”.

69
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:29,927
Now, your doomsday is coming, so everybody
is frightened about God

70
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:32,682
and they think that now we should just
wait for our doom,

71
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,828
nothing else is in between.

72
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:40,055
So, this is how the Vishuddhi chakra is
a special one.

73
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:46,743
Now Vishuddhi chakra was created
on the Saturday.

74
00:10:46,944 --> 00:10:52,591
So, it is the Saturn – that’s the important
star of the Vishuddhi chakra.

75
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:55,389
So, whenever the Saturn is at the highest,

76
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,923
America will be in a better place to do
things.

77
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:05,589
But I don’t think they know much about
themselves.

78
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,499
They don’t know what they are, why they
are on this earth,

79
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,340
what is their work, what they are supposed
to do,

80
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:16,490
or what is the purpose of God of creating
America.

81
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:22,570
The first job of the Vishuddhi chakra
within us was that,

82
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,294
when we became human beings, we raised
our heads up like that.

83
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:30,203
When you raised your head up like that,

84
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:34,547
you have become a human being, in the sense
that now,

85
00:11:34,748 --> 00:11:37,717
there is a new movement in your
consciousness.

86
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:44,167
Now the new movement in your consciousness
started about 6000 years back

87
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:47,316
when Shri Krishna came on this earth.

88
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:51,447
That the new movement was, that it is
the Father.

89
00:11:51,648 --> 00:11:56,614
The advent of the Father was celebrated,
and that’s how

90
00:11:56,815 --> 00:12:04,788
people developed a kind of a new instrument
within themselves, called ego.

91
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:08,077
When the brain was lifted like this
you see,

92
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:14,090
it expanded in a pyramidical – it’s
a pyramid – it became a pyramid.

93
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:18,595
In an animal, the brain is flat. And,
gradually it rises.

94
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:21,659
When the head was raised, when
the responsibility was taken

95
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:24,768
of raising the head, the brain started
growing

96
00:12:24,969 --> 00:12:30,280
in such a way that it became a pyramid.
And when it became a pyramid,

97
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:35,714
he attention became a different attention
from that of animal.

98
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:40,238
Because, when the waves of your
consciousness

99
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:46,790
fell on the sides of the pyramid, they went
into the parallelogram of forces,

100
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:52,670
by which the resultant force –
the resultant force…

101
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:57,893
Now, it falls like this, goes like that,
the resultant force is like that –

102
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:02,634
had two sides – one was this, another
was this.

103
00:13:02,835 --> 00:13:05,812
So, the consciousness, or we can say,
the attention –

104
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:10,285
instead of going inside, started going
outward.

105
00:13:10,486 --> 00:13:13,447
So, one part of the resultant was going
outside

106
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:19,046
and that’s how, when you became a human
being, your attention went outside.

107
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:23,808
Are the human beings only, who have their
attention outside.

108
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:25,874
Not that the animals don’t have,

109
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:32,507
but the attention of human beings are such
that they create reactions.

110
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:36,424
Like, you see something.

111
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,832
Now, I see Doctor’s house say for example,

112
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:44,733
then a reaction starts in my mind – what is
this, what does this mean,

113
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:48,667
how much it must have cost, from where
did he buy it!

114
00:13:48,868 --> 00:13:51,686
Anything you see, it starts giving you
a reaction.

115
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:54,776
Not to the animals. Animals, at the most
they will say –

116
00:13:54,977 --> 00:13:58,868
this I must eat, that I must eat, that
I must get.

117
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:01,950
But, they do not think about it.

118
00:14:02,151 --> 00:14:05,081
It’s only the human beings who reflect.

119
00:14:05,282 --> 00:14:12,573
And this reflection comes because of the
pyramid-like structure of the brain.

120
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:18,239
And this has a special reaction in
the brain itself,

121
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:22,488
that we start developing our own ego,

122
00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:26,246
our own myths, our own mental projections.

123
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:29,694
And when we develop our own mental
projections,

124
00:14:29,895 --> 00:14:33,285
this ego starts developing, “I know”
“what’s wrong”,

125
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:35,526
all these nonsensical things come.

126
00:14:35,727 --> 00:14:40,372
And once that starts working out,
the balloon of the ego starts rising.

127
00:14:40,573 --> 00:14:43,987
It starts pushing the other balloon which
was within us,

128
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:46,189
is of the superego – as an animal.

129
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,847
And then, comes up in the centre.

130
00:14:49,048 --> 00:14:53,506
That’s how we now become normal human
beings.

131
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:57,717
But then we start increasing our ego.

132
00:14:57,918 --> 00:15:02,969
It starts overlapping the superego,

133
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:09,387
and a calcification takes place, by which
we develop our I-ness.

134
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:15,913
So, it is all the happening that takes
place after we have lifted our head,

135
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:20,510
raised our head, and we are no more
like animals.

136
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:25,064
So, Vishuddhi chakra has a very big part
to play

137
00:15:25,265 --> 00:15:30,447
in the human evolution, that by developing
your Vishuddhi chakra,

138
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:35,438
you have become human beings, first of all.

139
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:41,517
 Secondly, because it is the chakra
of the Father,

140
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:50,019
who becomes again, the primordial – as you
call it in…,

141
00:15:50,274 --> 00:15:54,475


142
00:15:55,582 --> 00:15:59,336
macrocosm. You become the macrocosm.

143
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:05,527
You are the microcosm, and the Father
is the macrocosm.

144
00:16:05,728 --> 00:16:09,864
So, you become that because of
the Vishuddhi chakra,

145
00:16:10,065 --> 00:16:12,287
which is governed by Shri Krishna,

146
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:16,562
who becomes that macrocosm, called
as Virat.

147
00:16:16,763 --> 00:16:22,886
In the brain it is expressed in this part.
In this part of the head.

148
00:16:23,087 --> 00:16:27,686
It is here that you start manifesting

149
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:33,880
your macrocosm qualities – at this point.

150
00:16:34,081 --> 00:16:37,219
Now, this Vishuddhi chakra has
a speciality – is that,

151
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,807
we always say that the responsibility
on my shoulders.

152
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:44,542
Always we say that – the responsibilities
are on my shoulders.

153
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:50,724
The reason is, the Vishuddhi chakra gives
you the sense of responsibility.

154
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:55,353
And that’s why you know, the Americans
feel responsible for the whole world.

155
00:16:55,554 --> 00:16:58,162
Naturally!

156
00:16:59,013 --> 00:17:03,786
It’s perfectly understood, that they feel
responsible for the whole world.

157
00:17:03,987 --> 00:17:11,169
But how much they are aware of their role

158
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:14,940
as the responsible people, that’s
a different point.

159
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:17,070
But they feel they are responsible,

160
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:22,726
but their role, as responsible people,
if they understand,

161
00:17:22,927 --> 00:17:27,256
then they have to be ideals. Ideals.

162
00:17:27,457 --> 00:17:31,117
Because a person who is a responsible
person in a family,

163
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:33,897
has to be the ideal for others.

164
00:17:34,098 --> 00:17:36,010
It started very well, I should say,

165
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:39,601
at the time of Abraham Lincoln. It started
very well.

166
00:17:39,802 --> 00:17:42,756
When you started talking about democracy,
is also –

167
00:17:42,957 --> 00:17:45,838
democracy is nothing but collectivity.

168
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:51,202
He started talking about collectivity
of the people, by the people.

169
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,127
All that shows that the sense
of collectivity

170
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:58,875
started coming right in this Vishuddhi
chakra.

171
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:08,799
But then, people who are in the centre,
can only remain normal.

172
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,639
But those who bend too much, or who
bend backward too much,

173
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,085
both suffer from problems.

174
00:18:17,286 --> 00:18:23,195
The ones who bend forward to others, are
the people who get their superego.

175
00:18:23,396 --> 00:18:27,247
They get over-humbled-down, like
developing countries are.

176
00:18:27,448 --> 00:18:31,461
And those who bend backward, are the people

177
00:18:31,662 --> 00:18:36,646
who try to dominate others; who have ego.

178
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:44,853
So, because of sudden blessings of God,
they discovered so many things,

179
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:48,763
the ego started developing in America
too much.

180
00:18:48,964 --> 00:18:52,147
But ego is like a balloon, as I told you.

181
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:55,705
And, keeps you floating in the air.

182
00:18:55,906 --> 00:18:59,393
And when you are in the air, you become
shallow people.

183
00:18:59,594 --> 00:19:02,707
You have no moorings.

184
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:07,392
But it has one more advantage, if you knew
you are floating in the air,

185
00:19:07,593 --> 00:19:10,998
you can have a complete comprehensive view.

186
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:16,761
Complete vision of the Whole, if your eyes
are pure

187
00:19:16,962 --> 00:19:20,533
and your intentions are clear-cut.

188
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:28,128
Now (the) another thing that happens
by their coming here, was the problem,

189
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:33,221
that they felt that – we are a very new
nation.

190
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:37,209
It has an advantage, as well as, it has
a disadvantage.

191
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,556
The advantage is that if you are new,
it’s very good

192
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:46,760
because you can be transformed into
something better very easily,

193
00:19:46,961 --> 00:19:50,160
because there is no conditioning in your
mind.

194
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:59,840
You are very clean, absolutely ready,
to become something great.

195
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:04,367
Or else, can be possibility that, you are
so new

196
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:07,152
that you are awed by everything that is
old,

197
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:10,283
which is very true about Americans, that
they bought

198
00:20:10,483 --> 00:20:15,775
all the old bridges from England to bring
them down here.

199
00:20:15,976 --> 00:20:19,215
And the cravings about the old is too much
here.

200
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,964
And that, as if whatever is new, is all
absurd.

201
00:20:22,165 --> 00:20:25,071
So, maybe even Sahaja Yoga may be
an absurd thing for them.

202
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:29,489
Because according to them, this is
something new.

203
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:37,345
Because they are new nations, they have
started discarding all that is new.

204
00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:39,815
Is an absurd thing.

205
00:20:40,016 --> 00:20:43,296
Now, we must say that Sahaja Yoga,
as it is today,

206
00:20:43,497 --> 00:20:48,304
is the most ancient thing. It started
with the universe

207
00:20:48,505 --> 00:20:54,442
and now the culmination point has come,
because it is a living process.

208
00:20:54,643 --> 00:20:59,008
As you see a flower on the tree, it’s
the first new flower.

209
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:05,061
But the flower has come out of a seed,
which has got the roots,

210
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:09,699
then it became the trunk, then it became
the leaves,

211
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:12,593
and then it has now become a flower.

212
00:21:12,794 --> 00:21:17,472
So, though it looks a new flower, it has
a big heritage.

213
00:21:17,673 --> 00:21:23,271
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga is as ancient
as this universe is.

214
00:21:23,472 --> 00:21:29,574
But to people, who have such a hankering
for traditionalism,

215
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:32,813
find it difficult to find out what is real
tradition.

216
00:21:33,014 --> 00:21:38,279
Only those who are traditional people,
can know what is real tradition.

217
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,601
Last time I came here, in America, and
I was shocked

218
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:45,168
that a person came to interview me.

219
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:49,658
And when he was talking, he asked about
one gentleman

220
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:53,017
who was most untraditional from Indian
point of view.

221
00:21:53,218 --> 00:21:55,598
His name was Ramakrishna Paramhamsa.

222
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,158
He married a woman and made her a mother.

223
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,170
I mean, [it’s ..] nobody has done it.
Rama has not done it.

224
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:04,894
Krishna has not done it. It’s an absurd
stuff.

225
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:07,738
But for them, he was the most traditional
man.

226
00:22:07,939 --> 00:22:10,499
And he told me that, “Mother your Sahaja
Yoga is not traditional

227
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,030
if you don’t believe in Ramakrishna”.

228
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:18,369
Last fifty-sixty years, all such neo-
traditional people came up.

229
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:25,065
Another one was this Pondicherry fellow.
Another absurd situation.

230
00:22:25,266 --> 00:22:29,905
He called this woman a mother, and his
relation with her is ambiguous.

231
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:32,177
You don’t know what relationship they had.

232
00:22:32,378 --> 00:22:36,335
I mean that is something, in Indian
tradition, is an impossible situation.

233
00:22:36,536 --> 00:22:39,320
You have to have clear-cut relationship
with everyone.

234
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:41,201
You cannot have ambiguous.

235
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,865
Neither a friend, nor a wife, nor a mother
or a sister.

236
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:49,195
That kind of a situation is most
untraditional. Is never thought of.

237
00:22:49,396 --> 00:22:52,484
I mean, you Indians can know this is
not possible.

238
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:58,363
This is an absurd situation. But, for some
people, he is traditional.

239
00:22:58,564 --> 00:23:03,230
What happened, about sixty years back,
I think about the time of my birth only,

240
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:10,669
the negativity started taking a new form
in understanding the western confusion.

241
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,166
They are all westerners, if you see them.

242
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:18,664
And the western confusion they took over
for their own advantages.

243
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:21,445
They used it for their own advantages.

244
00:23:21,646 --> 00:23:27,849
And this is where the western people have
failed to make them out.

245
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:33,354
The other day, at the Jungian place,
I was to talk

246
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:37,651
to Jung people with Sahaja Yoga and Jung.

247
00:23:37,852 --> 00:23:40,948
Now Jung, I came to know only when he died,

248
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:45,485
because there was a little article about
him. I never studied psychology.

249
00:23:45,686 --> 00:23:48,593
Of course, I tried to learn some vocabulary
to talk to them.

250
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:51,626
Sometimes I thought, I may have to talk
to them also.

251
00:23:51,827 --> 00:23:54,051
But these Jungians, all very intellectuals

252
00:23:54,252 --> 00:23:56,377
and great people sitting before me,
you see.

253
00:23:56,578 --> 00:24:02,176
About hundred of them, the President
of American Jungian society.

254
00:24:02,377 --> 00:24:04,784
I’d just gone through a book, just before
starting it,

255
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:09,344
and I saw some diagrams which really
puzzled me.

256
00:24:09,545 --> 00:24:13,253
The first conception they had - of course
it’s all mental conception of Jung.

257
00:24:13,454 --> 00:24:16,090
I don’t blame him because he got
realisation

258
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,529
but he did not know how the stage was
created,

259
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,566
was what the framework of the stage
and his movement

260
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:27,515
was still of a seeker to find out how
he got his realization.

261
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,930
And, all movements were linear. They
were not expanding

262
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:34,640
from one point all over. So, it was not
so integrated.

263
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:37,900
Now, the thing they showed was that
at the bottom of it

264
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,955
was the unconscious, which is never going
to be conscious.

265
00:24:41,156 --> 00:24:46,726
On top of that was the (conscious)
unconscious that can be conscious.

266
00:24:46,927 --> 00:24:51,214
Then, there was subconscious and on top
of that was the ego.

267
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:55,178
I mean what a mess of a thing it was
I tell you.

268
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:59,882
I told them, see, now the word unconscious
itself is confusing.

269
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,724
What do you mean by unconscious?

270
00:25:01,925 --> 00:25:06,571
Whatever you don’t feel on your central
nervous system is unconscious – alright.

271
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:11,481
But, what does that mean? We don’t feel
the subconscious.

272
00:25:11,682 --> 00:25:15,230
Then, subconscious is also unconscious.

273
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:19,132
Whatever we don’t feel – for example,
there are certain sounds

274
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:22,453
of certain frequencies we don’t hear
at all.

275
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:26,267
We hear whatever is tolerable to us
as human beings.

276
00:25:26,468 --> 00:25:30,447
That you all scientists know. We don’t
hear everything.

277
00:25:30,648 --> 00:25:34,800
So, all that is unconscious – means it’s
a mixed bag.

278
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,262
All sorts of things mixed up together.

279
00:25:37,463 --> 00:25:43,357
But God is not a hodge podge person, you
see. He is a clear-cut gentleman.

280
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:46,591
He knows what he is doing. He is
the greatest organiser.

281
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:51,398
And, how can he put you into a bag like
that – that the unconscious is below,

282
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:54,940
then on top of it is the unconscious that
is going to be conscious,

283
00:25:55,141 --> 00:25:58,506
on top of it is the subconscious, on top
of the consciousness,

284
00:25:58,707 --> 00:26:00,858
on top of that the ego!

285
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:05,000
So you go down, carrying all this inside
you

286
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:09,122
and where do you go? And how do you go?

287
00:26:09,323 --> 00:26:15,029
So, the first mistake was that there are
layers one on top of another –

288
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:20,399
it’s not so. They are placed vertically.

289
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:25,815
The ego is on the right-hand side and
superego on the left-hand side.

290
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:30,644
The future on the right-hand side and
the past on the left-hand side.

291
00:26:30,845 --> 00:26:33,275
So, the subconscious on the left-hand side

292
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:35,792
and the supraconscious on the right-hand
side.

293
00:26:35,993 --> 00:26:40,939
And the central path is kept clear cut.
I mean, in any organisation,

294
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,969
 say if you go to the airport, do you have
like this,

295
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,774
that you have to pass through the walls
to go to the aeroplane?

296
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:52,517
If we human beings don’t commit such
horrible mistakes,

297
00:26:52,718 --> 00:26:55,169
how can God commit such a mistake?

298
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,452
So, it was absolutely wrong to think that
way.

299
00:26:58,653 --> 00:27:01,646
So, the central path is in the centre,

300
00:27:01,847 --> 00:27:06,237
while the right side is on the right side
and the left side on the left side.

301
00:27:06,438 --> 00:27:09,305
And you don’t have to go to
the subconscious at all.

302
00:27:09,506 --> 00:27:13,705
Because they justified all these people
who are trying to make them hypnosis

303
00:27:13,906 --> 00:27:16,305
or they are trying to hypnotise them

304
00:27:16,506 --> 00:27:20,388
or to give them a new type of a – sort
of an experience –

305
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:22,564
all that was unconscious, we should accept.

306
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:26,449
Even some people if they start suddenly
jumping, they say – oh, it’s great.

307
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,660
So, the sensations that you get from
the subconscious

308
00:27:29,861 --> 00:27:33,068
and the supraconscious were accepted
as something great.

309
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:37,579
It was a confusion of your intellectuals
I should say. Complete.

310
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,137
But it is not so.

311
00:27:40,338 --> 00:27:44,047
Your path is straightforward. Absolutely
for Kundalini.

312
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:49,603
Only thing, the One who has to raise it
had to come – that’s all.

313
00:27:50,746 --> 00:27:52,579
But otherwise, it’s all very well,

314
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:57,267
and there is no need for you to get
into that horrible subconscious.

315
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,660
When I told them, they were amazed.
They said – Mother, it is so simple.

316
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,751
I said – it’s very simple. Your
unconscious is divided into four.

317
00:28:03,952 --> 00:28:06,564
One is the collective subconscious,

318
00:28:06,765 --> 00:28:09,773
one is the collective supraconscious,

319
00:28:09,974 --> 00:28:12,904
one is – you can say – the collective hell,

320
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:20,513
and on top is the super collective
consciousness.

321
00:28:20,714 --> 00:28:23,779
So where do we have to go? We should
know our destination.

322
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,274
Then we have to reach.

323
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:31,551
And that is how the problem of all these
people getting entangled

324
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,539
with Muktanand. Yesterday they asked
me a question –

325
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,880
“What is wrong with Muktanand? Why is he
so dangerous?”

326
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:40,275
One lady, poor thing, as Sahaj would have
it, she came, she said –

327
00:28:40,476 --> 00:28:43,573
“Oh, I went there, I broke my back and
I’m finished once and for all.

328
00:28:43,774 --> 00:28:46,353
He’s such a dangerous man. He flattered me.
I went there

329
00:28:46,554 --> 00:28:48,988
and I don’t know what has happened
to my back. I can’t sit

330
00:28:49,189 --> 00:28:51,556
for more than ten minutes in one place.
I have to get up.

331
00:28:51,757 --> 00:28:55,003
And I have a vibrator, I have to always
put it like that”.

332
00:28:55,204 --> 00:28:58,361
So, I said, “See, the dangers”.

333
00:28:58,574 --> 00:29:00,882
Then the another theory they started that
we must suffer

334
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,356
if we have to go to God. Why?

335
00:29:03,557 --> 00:29:07,644
I mean that’s not God’s idea by any chance.
Why should you suffer?

336
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:09,713
 He made Christ suffer for you – finished
now.

337
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,988
Now you better not suffer. There’s no need
to suffer at all.

338
00:29:13,189 --> 00:29:18,466
So, all these ideas penetrated into these
western people.

339
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:21,395
And these mental projections they accepted

340
00:29:21,596 --> 00:29:25,663
without even understanding what is written
in other books. We should see.

341
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:28,563
And they could only go as far as those
sixty years

342
00:29:28,764 --> 00:29:32,511
when these horrible people who went
to India, very shallow people,

343
00:29:32,712 --> 00:29:35,108
they saw some of these tantric books,
because they wanted

344
00:29:35,308 --> 00:29:38,549
to justify Freud through Indian culture.

345
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,386
So, they got the tantrikas, erotic things
and all that,

346
00:29:41,587 --> 00:29:45,300
and brought these books and some of them
read, I don’t know what books

347
00:29:45,501 --> 00:29:48,420
to say that Kundalini is in the stomach,
somebody says in the brain.

348
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,326
I mean they don’t know where the Kundalini
is.

349
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:52,933
And they are writing such big big books,
can you imagine?

350
00:29:53,134 --> 00:29:55,544
Such big big books they have written.

351
00:29:55,745 --> 00:29:59,206
Now, when the books are written, every
book is not a scripture.

352
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:03,012
But to them, if it is written in the book
you see, it’s a scripture.

353
00:30:03,213 --> 00:30:06,412
And that’s how the whole confusion started
growing on.

354
00:30:06,613 --> 00:30:09,312
So, these people came down, took full
advantage of it

355
00:30:09,513 --> 00:30:16,354
and now they have become great gurus
with lot of money.

356
00:30:16,555 --> 00:30:18,318
Rich people.

357
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:23,026
But now, as the hand of God is great,

358
00:30:23,227 --> 00:30:34,037
one by one, they are getting out of
the heads of these people.

359
00:30:34,238 --> 00:30:38,883
And now I hope a day will come when people
will see the light through.

360
00:30:39,084 --> 00:30:43,706
So the task of Sahaja Yoga is to establish
the truth within yourself.

361
00:30:43,907 --> 00:30:46,376
It is not that we can have a membership.

362
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:49,688
We cannot have a person enrol into it.

363
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:54,543
We cannot call them as branded Sahaja
yogis.

364
00:30:54,744 --> 00:30:57,704
It’s the growth of the person that is to be
seen.

365
00:30:57,905 --> 00:31:00,303
Now there are so many lectures which
I have given

366
00:31:00,504 --> 00:31:03,820
about Ritambhara Pragnya and all those
things and I think

367
00:31:04,021 --> 00:31:08,469
for every sahaja yogi it is necessary
to listen to those lectures,

368
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:13,387
go through it, understand them and
to meditate so that you grow.

369
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:16,081
Because it is not a plastic thing that we
can create.

370
00:31:16,282 --> 00:31:24,535
It’s a living process of the living energy
of the living God.

371
00:31:24,743 --> 00:31:27,474
And so, it has to grow within you.

372
00:31:27,675 --> 00:31:30,119
By thinking you cannot make it grow

373
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,840
but by not thinking, you allow it to grow
more and more.

374
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:36,762
As it starts growing within you,

375
00:31:36,963 --> 00:31:39,749
then only you will realise that what
you are.

376
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:43,573
That’s the only way you have to reach
a state of that super consciousness

377
00:31:43,774 --> 00:31:45,898
and establish yourself there.

378
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:48,997
Then only you will know what I’m talking
about.

379
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:53,660
Now today’s puja is another thing. Now,
what is a Puja?

380
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:55,655
Could be people say what a puja is.

381
00:31:55,856 --> 00:31:59,106
Actually, yesterday I had a puja and it’s
not easy for me

382
00:31:59,307 --> 00:32:01,453
to bear the pujas to be very frank,
you know.

383
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:05,928
Because the vibrations are so much that
I don’t know.

384
00:32:06,129 --> 00:32:09,410
And then, I went to the airport – two hours
we took out the vibrations

385
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:14,345
and put them for all the New York airport.
It was necessary.

386
00:32:14,546 --> 00:32:19,975
It worked out. Because vibrations start
flowing with tremendous force

387
00:32:20,176 --> 00:32:23,185
and if you people do not absorb it,
it takes time

388
00:32:23,386 --> 00:32:29,111
for it to ooze out from my body. Makes
me rather heavy with it.

389
00:32:29,312 --> 00:32:32,782
But then it oozes out, I feel better

390
00:32:32,983 --> 00:32:36,952
and only thing that happens by saying
the mantras,

391
00:32:37,153 --> 00:32:42,998
you awaken the deities within yourself
and start receiving the vibrations.

392
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:47,161
And when your deities are awakened,
they are awakened

393
00:32:47,362 --> 00:32:50,434
through the power of the deities within me.

394
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,375
They have to work very hard to do that,

395
00:32:52,576 --> 00:32:55,240
and that’s how they emit too much
vibrations

396
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:59,214
which must be absorbed by you when your
deities are awakened.

397
00:32:59,415 --> 00:33:03,695
That’s how it works. You cannot describe
it in words.

398
00:33:03,896 --> 00:33:07,794
You cannot tell it in words. It’s a
happening that has to take place.

399
00:33:07,995 --> 00:33:09,903
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga first,

400
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:13,029
can go little bit like that in
the beginning.

401
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,035
Gradually they settle down, come round,

402
00:33:16,236 --> 00:33:18,742
grow into it, then it becomes alright.

403
00:33:18,943 --> 00:33:22,303
Some people just shoot off in one day, and
they are there.

404
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,494
Makes no difference whatsoever.

405
00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:28,381
Because it’s a growing thing and it has
to grow.

406
00:33:28,582 --> 00:33:31,718
With some people, the land is so fertile,

407
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,576
or maybe something, that it just works
out fast.

408
00:33:34,777 --> 00:33:36,682
So, nobody should blame anyone.

409
00:33:36,883 --> 00:33:38,763
And specially, one should not feel guilty

410
00:33:38,963 --> 00:33:41,703
because that’s the Vishuddhi on the
left-hand side.

411
00:33:41,904 --> 00:33:47,766
Specially for America, I’m wearing this
stone which is called as the black sapphire.

412
00:33:47,974 --> 00:33:52,841
Because, this is the stone of Shri Krishna.
It’s the stone of Vishuddhi chakra.

413
00:33:53,042 --> 00:33:55,432
Every chakra has a stone.

414
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,527
And this is the stone of the Vishuddhi
chakra,

415
00:33:57,728 --> 00:34:01,778
so I’m wearing this, just for coming
to America.

416
00:34:01,979 --> 00:34:15,084
And, I hope that today’s worship will bring
out the potential of this country

417
00:34:15,285 --> 00:34:22,374
by exciting the deities, Shri Krishna
himself, who is in charge.

418
00:34:22,575 --> 00:34:27,283
By pleasing him. By making him active.

419
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:31,584
And, He has great qualities, and one
of the greatest qualities He has

420
00:34:31,785 --> 00:34:35,857
that He has the samhara shakti, by which
He can kill the demons.

421
00:34:36,058 --> 00:34:40,694
And, all those demons who are settled down
here, are really mistaken.

422
00:34:40,895 --> 00:34:43,746
Because, if this is the place of
Shri Krishna,

423
00:34:43,947 --> 00:34:46,773
they are very dangerously placed.

424
00:34:46,974 --> 00:34:51,168
Because once He is awakened here, they all
will be completely finished

425
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:53,964
through his sudarshan chakra, which He has
in his hand

426
00:34:54,165 --> 00:34:56,838
and He can just kill them one by one.

427
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,549
But first He’s to be pleased, and He’s
to be awakened,

428
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:05,103
He has to be “prasanna”. That’s the word.

429
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:08,645
Prasanna means, to be pleased. And then,
it works out.

430
00:35:08,846 --> 00:35:11,266
So today first we will have Ganesha’s
puja, little bit,

431
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:17,407
because Ganesha’s puja is meant just
to establish the innocence.

432
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:20,046
The innocence of the place.

433
00:35:20,247 --> 00:35:22,397
Once the innocence is established, that’s
the most important.

434
00:35:22,598 --> 00:35:25,249
That’s the essence of everything. Ganesha
is the essence.

435
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,505
And, then we will have Shri Krishna puja

436
00:35:27,705 --> 00:35:33,008
and then the puja of the Devi,
of the Power.

437
00:35:33,209 --> 00:35:36,050
So, that’s how we’ll have three pujas –
one after another,

438
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:40,773
but a short time every time. Alright?
