1
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:53,094
Last night was a night of complete darkness,
that they call it as amavasya; and just now

2
00:07:53,094 --> 00:07:58,575
only the first phase of the moon has started.

3
00:07:58,575 --> 00:08:13,635
Today we are here to celebrate the day when
the Sahastrara was opened out.

4
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:18,714
Also you have seen in the photograph.

5
00:08:18,714 --> 00:08:27,515
It was actually a photograph of my brain,
which showed how the Sahastrara was opened

6
00:08:27,515 --> 00:08:28,565
out.

7
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:33,545
The light of the brain now could be photographed.

8
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:38,084
It’s something great these modern times
have done.

9
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:44,015
So the modern times have brought a lot of
things which can prove the existence of the

10
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:46,005
Divine.

11
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:53,565
Also it can prove about me.

12
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:59,165
It can convince you what I am.

13
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:10,535
This is very important because, in the modern
times, this advent has to be recognised, has

14
00:09:10,535 --> 00:09:11,865
to be fully recognised.

15
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:17,375
This is one of the conditions for all the
Sahaja Yogis.

16
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:27,425
Now let’s see what’s happening in the
modern times, in the brains of the people.

17
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:37,535
In the brains of the people today, if you
see, there is an attack on the Sahastrara.

18
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:45,175
There has been an attack since long but in
the modern times it’s the worst time.

19
00:09:45,175 --> 00:09:59,425
They are trying to make the limbic area very
insensitive.

20
00:09:59,425 --> 00:10:17,945
Very depressive novels, very depressive thoughts
and very depressive music, you can say, like

21
00:10:17,945 --> 00:10:20,055
Greek tragedy nonsense.

22
00:10:20,055 --> 00:10:39,094
All these things came from the medieval period
till, we should say, this new age has started.

23
00:10:39,094 --> 00:10:43,965
That one itself was no good for our limbic
area.

24
00:10:43,965 --> 00:10:47,234
That made us very depressive.

25
00:10:47,234 --> 00:11:00,525
We took to alcoholism to escape from the so-called
miseries.

26
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:15,055
But then came this modern age in which people
became overactive – over-activity started.

27
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:23,415
With that the brain also became overactive.

28
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:32,975
In addition to the dullness before, it’s
gone to the other extreme of over-activity.

29
00:11:32,975 --> 00:11:43,934
So to dull it again they took to drugs, they
took to very horrible music.

30
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:51,995
That’s how they made this limbic area very,
very insensitive.

31
00:11:51,995 --> 00:12:04,585
So a drug which was just a stimulus to begin
with was to be taken in greater quantity and

32
00:12:04,585 --> 00:12:13,884
later on they had to take the drugs which
were of a much more severe nature.

33
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:20,485
It went on like that and now we know that
this drug is the only way people think they

34
00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:23,645
can survive.

35
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:26,384
Why?

36
00:12:26,384 --> 00:12:28,624
Because of the tension [that] they talk of.

37
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:32,765
In the modern times we have something called
‘tensions’.

38
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:34,335
It was never there before.

39
00:12:34,335 --> 00:12:36,615
People never talked of their tensions.

40
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:39,655
Now every body says, “I’m in a tension!”

41
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:41,855
“You give me a tension!”

42
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,415
What is this tension?

43
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:48,875
It’s because of my advent.

44
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:57,414
The limbic area wants to know about me.

45
00:12:57,414 --> 00:13:06,896
And the Kundalini also, as Sahaja Yoga is
increasing, is trying to rise in people; because

46
00:13:06,896 --> 00:13:09,134
you become the channels.

47
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:22,905
Wherever you go, you generate vibrations,
and these vibrations give a challenge to the

48
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:29,914
Kundalini, or a message, and in various people
it rises.

49
00:13:29,914 --> 00:13:36,134
It may not rise up to the Sahastrara, or it
may even rise up to Sahastrara but it falls

50
00:13:36,134 --> 00:13:39,914
back, because there’s no recognition.

51
00:13:39,914 --> 00:13:46,884
So every time they do something, this Kundalini
comes up and gives them a pressure, because

52
00:13:46,884 --> 00:13:52,624
their Sahastrara is not open.

53
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,064
It’s a closed door.

54
00:13:54,064 --> 00:14:00,474
Because of the closed door this gives them
a kind of a pressure in the head, which they

55
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:05,145
don’t understand, and they call it as ‘tension’.

56
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:12,795
Actually the Kundalini is trying to push it
out, itself, but it cannot.

57
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:21,434
And those also who get their Realisation,
if they do not make their Sahastrara alright,

58
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:24,944
they go on getting into tensions.

59
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:40,094
So, though Sahastrara has been opened out
so many years back, still we have some things

60
00:14:40,094 --> 00:14:45,925
to be done – is to clear out our Sahastrara,
first of all.

61
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:57,515
So first is the breaking of the Sahastrara,
then once it opened out, the brahmarandhra

62
00:14:57,515 --> 00:15:15,275
opened out, then we started feeling the grace,
and it moved onto our Ida and Pingala – the

63
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:19,634
grace not the Kundalini.

64
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:29,184
And the grace, which is chaitanya, all round,
soothed down our Left and Right sides by which

65
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:38,414
our chakras opened more, and more threads
of the Kundalini started piercing through.

66
00:15:38,414 --> 00:15:45,535
So I always tell Sahaja Yogis that it’s
important that you must meditate.

67
00:15:45,535 --> 00:15:52,594
If your Sahastrara is alright, all your chakras
will be alright because, as you know, that

68
00:15:52,594 --> 00:16:00,355
the peethas, or the controlling centres of
all these chakras, are in the brain around

69
00:16:00,355 --> 00:16:03,275
the limbic area.

70
00:16:03,275 --> 00:16:13,195
So if your Sahastrara is clear everything
works out in a very different way.

71
00:16:13,195 --> 00:16:19,935
How to keep the Sahastrara alright, is the
big problem [which] always people ask me.

72
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:22,485
You know that I reside in the Sahastrara.

73
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:30,055
I have incarnated on the lotus of one thousand
petals.

74
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:36,134
That’s why I could break it also.

75
00:16:36,134 --> 00:16:39,695
As I am today, as you see me.

76
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:44,465
Of course they say, “Sahastrare Mahamaya”
(सहस्त्रारे महामाया)

77
00:16:44,465 --> 00:16:54,584
So this is the illusion which is all the time
there for you, which is very elusive.

78
00:16:54,584 --> 00:17:02,074
It had to be that way because you could not
have faced me otherwise with all the lights

79
00:17:02,074 --> 00:17:13,655
coming out of me or the way you saw yesterday
Sahastrara – some sort of abstract colours

80
00:17:13,655 --> 00:17:16,825
thrown on all sides and the lights thrown
outside.

81
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:21,995
Please don’t take photographs when I’m
speaking, alright?

82
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:22,995
You can take later on.

83
00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:23,995
There’s no hurry about.

84
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:26,465
Just pay attention to My lecture.

85
00:17:26,465 --> 00:17:28,865
Please, pay attention.

86
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:30,465
It’s important.

87
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:37,325
It is to be, this, told beforehand, that nobody
should take photographs during puja because

88
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:41,935
it is a very intense thing [that] one has
to work it out.

89
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,035
Please, pay attention.

90
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:48,215
Even if you don’t understand, it has effect
on you.

91
00:17:48,215 --> 00:17:57,995
So I would request you to pay full attention
to me when I am talking.

92
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,195
It works better.

93
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:08,084
Now this Sahastrara is to be looked after
by you.

94
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:13,555
It’s the temple of your Mother.

95
00:18:13,555 --> 00:18:18,315
When you say you put me in the heart, actually
you put me in the Sahastrara.

96
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:23,644
Because, as you know, the brahmarandhra here
(Shri Mataji touches her brahmarandhra) is

97
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:31,475
the fontanel bone area, has got the peetha,
the centre, which controls the heart, which

98
00:18:31,475 --> 00:18:41,625
is the seat of the Sadashiva or you can say
of Shiva.

99
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:46,865
So when you put me in the heart actually you
put me there.

100
00:18:46,865 --> 00:18:54,584
So to raise it from heart to there, or to
bring it from there to the heart, is the problem

101
00:18:54,584 --> 00:19:01,975
of two types of people.

102
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:10,834
Some people who are sensitive in their heart
– I would say in Europe we can say Italians

103
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:14,536
are very sensitive on their heart – the
first thing they do as soon as they see me

104
00:19:14,536 --> 00:19:22,305
they put their hands to their heart.

105
00:19:22,305 --> 00:19:31,065
And that is what it is, that, if you try to
feel me in your heart, to begin with, it’s

106
00:19:31,065 --> 00:19:32,965
much easier.

107
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:36,125
To feel me in your heart.

108
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:47,824
Now you might say, “How to do it?”

109
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:54,835
You have to love me as I love you.

110
00:19:54,835 --> 00:20:03,665
You have to love each one of yourselves, because
you are all within me.

111
00:20:03,665 --> 00:20:09,454
And you cannot teach someone how to love.

112
00:20:09,454 --> 00:20:10,824
Love is within.

113
00:20:10,824 --> 00:20:19,105
And love manifests if, just, you open your
heart.

114
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:25,774
Now what stops it, we should examine that.

115
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:28,965
Firstly, the conditioning.

116
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:36,514
In the West to express your love is regarded
as sinful actually.

117
00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:42,355
It takes them time to say, “I love you,”
but “I hate you!” even a child could go

118
00:20:42,355 --> 00:20:44,225
on saying, “I hate you!

119
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:45,345
I hate you!

120
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:46,475
I hate you!”

121
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:48,425
But to hate someone is sinful.

122
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:53,634
To anyone, to hate, is sinful.

123
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:54,634
So to say that, “I hate you!

124
00:20:54,634 --> 00:21:02,725
I hate you!” is a sinful act.

125
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:14,334
So what one has to do is to say, [to] go on
saying, “I love you."

126
00:21:14,334 --> 00:21:23,265
After all, you must love a person who is so
dear to you.

127
00:21:23,265 --> 00:21:32,625
Anyone who has done something good for you,
you love that person.

128
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:39,905
But if the Adi Shakti Herself has given you
the rebirth, it should be the easiest thing

129
00:21:39,905 --> 00:21:44,975
to love.

130
00:21:44,975 --> 00:21:54,225
And if She says that, “They are all within
my body,” so it should be even easier to

131
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:57,115
love each other.

132
00:21:57,115 --> 00:22:10,415
So the whole cleansing of the Sahastrara is
done through this love, this love which is

133
00:22:10,415 --> 00:22:23,735
not conditioned, which is not inhibited, which
doesn’t want any respite or doesn’t want

134
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:28,045
any return – nirvaaj.

135
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:33,444
But the conditionings are too much.

136
00:22:33,444 --> 00:22:41,764
First the problem of conditioning comes to
you when you think that, “This condition

137
00:22:41,764 --> 00:22:53,435
makes me hate someone,” or, “I cannot
love someone because this is the condition!”

138
00:22:53,435 --> 00:23:04,475
But actually the conditioning itself is so
absurd, if you see it one by one.

139
00:23:04,475 --> 00:23:15,925
To make it simple, I would like you to understand
the conditioning part where I read once an

140
00:23:15,925 --> 00:23:21,144
article, an interesting one, “Who killed
the romance?”

141
00:23:21,144 --> 00:23:23,865
So he said “the hairdressers”.

142
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:30,274
I was wondering how is he connecting romance
with the hairdressers?

143
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:38,855
Because people used to go to a hairdresser
and one hairdressing was liked by a person.

144
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:42,925
So he would say that, “I love that hairdressing!”

145
00:23:42,925 --> 00:23:51,144
Now supposing his fiancée, or his wife wore
another type of hairdressing, because everyday

146
00:23:51,144 --> 00:23:59,445
new things are coming, then immediately the
husband would say, “Oh I hate you because

147
00:23:59,445 --> 00:24:03,645
of your hairdressing!”

148
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:07,975
Because he loves one type of hair dress, that’s
why he loves.

149
00:24:07,975 --> 00:24:10,395
Otherwise if you have another hair dress you
hate it!

150
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:13,225
“I don’t like it!”

151
00:24:13,225 --> 00:24:20,845
To say that “I don’t like it” and “I
like it”, itself, is a sign that the conditioning

152
00:24:20,845 --> 00:24:25,465
is too much.

153
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:31,115
You make a proper hair dress and you dress
up properly and you come out and then suddenly

154
00:24:31,115 --> 00:24:35,965
people say, ”Oh I hate it!”

155
00:24:35,965 --> 00:24:37,225
Who are you?

156
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:41,194
What right we have got to say that to anyone?

157
00:24:41,194 --> 00:24:48,535
You are not a judge appointed by any law courts.

158
00:24:48,535 --> 00:24:57,745
So why do we say, to hurt someone, to say
“I hate it”?

159
00:24:57,745 --> 00:25:03,725
On the contrary you must say that, “Alright,
I like this but you could do better."

160
00:25:03,725 --> 00:25:12,265
That’s the sign of love when you want a
person to be dressed up in a way that is appealing.

161
00:25:12,265 --> 00:25:21,585
But this is on a very, very baser level that
we see people.

162
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:32,284
Then we go further to see a person: how intelligent
he is, how smart he is, how charismatic he

163
00:25:32,284 --> 00:25:41,255
is, how charming – that’s another word
which is very elusive.

164
00:25:41,255 --> 00:25:46,775
These are also kind of conditionings of the
mind that you think that a particular style

165
00:25:46,775 --> 00:25:56,924
of a person is a loveable person, that you
love that person.

166
00:25:56,924 --> 00:26:00,715
It’s so much outside.

167
00:26:00,715 --> 00:26:05,554
Or some people actually do not love but show
they love because somebody has more money.

168
00:26:05,554 --> 00:26:11,085
And the money, he’s not going to part with,
no doubt, but you love that person because

169
00:26:11,085 --> 00:26:20,135
he has more money, or he has a better car
or he’s better dressed, whatever it is.

170
00:26:20,135 --> 00:26:29,515
So this kind of an idea one has also is a
killer of love.

171
00:26:29,515 --> 00:26:36,174
If love is killed, the joy is lost, you cannot
have joy without love.

172
00:26:36,174 --> 00:26:44,895
I say, joy and love, both are just the same.

173
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:49,304
Then it gets even subtler and subtler and
subtler.

174
00:26:49,304 --> 00:26:56,455
Then we start loving our own children, that’s
very common.

175
00:26:56,455 --> 00:27:02,674
I mean, of course, also some people don’t
even love their children, I mean there are

176
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:05,894
all kinds, you see.

177
00:27:05,894 --> 00:27:10,635
But then they go on, “This is my child,
this is my child, this is my child!”

178
00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:21,885
That again is the death of love.

179
00:27:21,885 --> 00:27:28,304
As I told you before: the sap of the tree
rises, goes to every fruit, goes to every

180
00:27:28,304 --> 00:27:31,595
leaf, goes to every part and comes back.

181
00:27:31,595 --> 00:27:33,065
It’s not attached.

182
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:42,285
If you are attached to one part or to one
flower because it is more beautiful then the

183
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:47,105
tree will die and the flower will also die.

184
00:27:47,105 --> 00:27:52,424
So that’s the death of the love.

185
00:27:52,424 --> 00:28:00,325
So you have to have love which doesn’t get
entangled or attached.

186
00:28:00,325 --> 00:28:01,845
Every time I tell like this they say, “How
to do it?”

187
00:28:01,845 --> 00:28:09,404
The love of the Spirit is of that kind.

188
00:28:09,404 --> 00:28:16,154
Love of conditioned mind is different.

189
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:25,485
A conditioned mind can love in a limited way
because it is conditioned.

190
00:28:25,485 --> 00:28:35,745
Then the greatest enemy of love is ego within
us, which is like a balloon on top of our

191
00:28:35,745 --> 00:28:36,745
head.

192
00:28:36,745 --> 00:28:43,174
And this ego gives us a very big tension.

193
00:28:43,174 --> 00:28:50,985
The conditioning of course, like they see
a carpet.

194
00:28:50,985 --> 00:28:56,575
Now it is, according to their conditioning,
is not good.

195
00:28:56,575 --> 00:28:59,915
So they say, “Oh what a carpet it is!”

196
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:00,915
Or something.

197
00:29:00,915 --> 00:29:06,585
This kind of conditioning of very low level.

198
00:29:06,585 --> 00:29:11,255
And the higher level at the most, is that
you love your own country, so “My country

199
00:29:11,255 --> 00:29:12,255
is the best!”

200
00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:19,534
Whether it is killing people, whether it is
destroying the world peace, it’s all right

201
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:22,245
because “I belong to a particular country
which is the best!”

202
00:29:22,245 --> 00:29:26,825
We can never criticise our country and countrymen.

203
00:29:26,825 --> 00:29:31,325
It goes on subtler and subtler.

204
00:29:31,325 --> 00:29:35,885
But on the intelligence side it is even worse!

205
00:29:35,885 --> 00:29:43,435
Because intelligently if you have understood
that something is good then nobody can save

206
00:29:43,435 --> 00:29:46,345
you!

207
00:29:46,345 --> 00:29:49,115
Because through your brain you have understood.

208
00:29:49,115 --> 00:29:58,125
Actually it is very surprising: I was reading
the book written by Rabindranath Tagore and

209
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:08,935
an Englishman had given a very beautiful preface
to that, an introduction, and he said that

210
00:30:08,935 --> 00:30:14,315
the creativity is killed in the West.

211
00:30:14,315 --> 00:30:20,495
So he asked a gentleman who was an Indian
critic.

212
00:30:20,495 --> 00:30:23,305
He said, “Don’t you criticise your poets?

213
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:27,205
You don’t have people who are critics?”

214
00:30:27,205 --> 00:30:33,335
“Yes, yes we have, they criticise,” “So
what do they criticise?”

215
00:30:33,335 --> 00:30:41,544
“Oh, they can criticise that, this time
there was no rain so we had problems and things."

216
00:30:41,544 --> 00:30:44,554
He said: “No, no, no, no!

217
00:30:44,554 --> 00:30:49,955
We are thinking about the poet, do they criticise
the poet, do they criticise an artist?”

218
00:30:49,955 --> 00:30:55,155
So he says: “Is it meant for criticism?”

219
00:30:55,155 --> 00:31:01,625
“It is created, whatever he felt is created.

220
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:08,005
But supposing he has put something very vulgar
then of course we don’t like it.

221
00:31:08,005 --> 00:31:12,105
But if it is created by a beautiful mind,
it has to be beautiful."

222
00:31:12,105 --> 00:31:14,345
“Then you don’t criticise?”

223
00:31:14,345 --> 00:31:18,404
He says, “No, because we cannot create like
that.

224
00:31:18,404 --> 00:31:26,975
So what business have you got to criticise?”

225
00:31:26,975 --> 00:31:32,615
This is how, ‘intelligently’, what we
have done: we have norms about everything,

226
00:31:32,615 --> 00:31:34,845
about art about every creation.

227
00:31:34,845 --> 00:31:36,615
We don’t like this carpet.

228
00:31:36,615 --> 00:31:37,615
Why?

229
00:31:37,615 --> 00:31:45,235
Because it doesn’t appeal to our intellectual
understanding of the norms we have reached

230
00:31:45,235 --> 00:31:49,465
and in that frame it doesn’t fit in so we
don’t like it.

231
00:31:49,465 --> 00:31:56,535
Can you even create one inch of that?

232
00:31:56,535 --> 00:32:00,445
So this ego gives you an unauthorised action.

233
00:32:00,445 --> 00:32:05,485
It is unauthorised, anadhikar cheshta (नधिकार
चेष्टा).

234
00:32:05,485 --> 00:32:06,485
Un-authorised.

235
00:32:06,485 --> 00:32:10,755
You have no authority to criticise.

236
00:32:10,755 --> 00:32:18,185
You can’t do anything, so why should you
criticise?

237
00:32:18,185 --> 00:32:24,105
Better [to] appreciate and see for yourself
that you are not in authority, you are not

238
00:32:24,105 --> 00:32:28,404
worthy of it, to criticise.

239
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:34,225
If you are not worthy of it why should you
criticise anything?

240
00:32:34,225 --> 00:32:43,644
And, otherwise also, you must know [that]
you are a slave of your ego.

241
00:32:43,644 --> 00:32:49,565
Whatever you ego dictates and your intelligence,
so-called ‘intelligence’, brings you to

242
00:32:49,565 --> 00:32:51,424
a point, to have some norm.

243
00:32:51,424 --> 00:32:57,294
And then it becomes a collective ego of a
particular community, of a particular country,

244
00:32:57,294 --> 00:32:59,465
of a particular ideology.

245
00:32:59,465 --> 00:33:00,845
It’s collective.

246
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:10,294
So then they say, “Oh we think this is no
art!”

247
00:33:10,294 --> 00:33:18,154
That is the reason we cannot have masters
any more in art.

248
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:21,914
We can’t have Rembrandt, we can’t.

249
00:33:21,914 --> 00:33:25,985
Poor Rembrandt must have himself suffered
a lot.

250
00:33:25,985 --> 00:33:28,554
You know Gauguin suffered a lot.

251
00:33:28,554 --> 00:33:30,675
All these artists suffered a lot.

252
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,414
Even Michelangelo suffered a lot.

253
00:33:33,414 --> 00:33:40,005
Not only monetarily, not only monetarily,
but otherwise: criticise, criticise, criticise.

254
00:33:40,005 --> 00:33:41,534
So I think people have given up.

255
00:33:41,534 --> 00:33:46,345
I met an artist who had done lots of art work
and I said, “Why don’t you show me?”

256
00:33:46,345 --> 00:33:48,605
He said, “No I don’t want to show you.

257
00:33:48,605 --> 00:33:49,605
It’s created for myself."

258
00:33:49,605 --> 00:33:52,195
I said, “I would like to see!”

259
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:57,225
I saw, it was beautiful, very beautiful, I
said, “Why don’t you show?”

260
00:33:57,225 --> 00:33:58,705
He said, “No use.

261
00:33:58,705 --> 00:33:59,705
People will just criticise.

262
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,955
I do it for my own pleasure.

263
00:34:01,955 --> 00:34:10,664
They’ll just spoil the whole joy of my creation."

264
00:34:10,664 --> 00:34:16,385
So one of the basic things we should avoid
is to criticise others.

265
00:34:16,385 --> 00:34:21,235
Better to criticise yourself.

266
00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:27,524
Criticise yourself, criticise your brothers
and sisters, criticise your country, criticise

267
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:34,965
all the habits you have and laugh at yourself,
is the best way.

268
00:34:34,965 --> 00:34:43,545
If you know how to laugh at yourself then
you will not object or will not stand in the

269
00:34:43,545 --> 00:34:47,034
way of any creativity of another person.

270
00:34:47,034 --> 00:34:51,745
So with ego you become so unauthorised.

271
00:34:51,745 --> 00:34:53,554
You can criticise anything.

272
00:34:53,554 --> 00:34:58,745
You think you have a right.

273
00:34:58,745 --> 00:35:01,135
Who has given you this right to criticise?

274
00:35:01,135 --> 00:35:04,705
Is the question one should ask to oneself.

275
00:35:04,705 --> 00:35:12,225
How can we criticise anyone?

276
00:35:12,225 --> 00:35:21,465
As saints, as you are now, of course, you
can make out who is caught up, who has given

277
00:35:21,465 --> 00:35:25,335
bad vibrations, who has the problem.

278
00:35:25,335 --> 00:35:27,005
You know that.

279
00:35:27,005 --> 00:35:28,675
You know it.

280
00:35:28,675 --> 00:35:30,345
It’s not conditioning.

281
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:36,825
It’s not just you are doing because there’s
some ego, but you are feeling it on you fingertips.

282
00:35:36,825 --> 00:35:40,794
It’s an actual feeling within you.

283
00:35:40,794 --> 00:35:44,445
It’s the bodha (बोध: knowledge), by
which you know.

284
00:35:44,445 --> 00:35:48,395
Then what should you do?

285
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:53,185
In your love, you have to tell the person,
if possible, that, “This is wrong with you.

286
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:54,534
Better be corrected!”

287
00:35:54,534 --> 00:35:57,804
But in a way that he does it.

288
00:35:57,804 --> 00:36:01,554
On the contrary, if you tell him in a way
that he becomes even worse than what it is,

289
00:36:01,554 --> 00:36:04,385
you have not loved that person at all.

290
00:36:04,385 --> 00:36:07,065
Allow everybody to grow.

291
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:21,294
There are many people in Sahaja Yoga who are
very, very good, excellent, no doubt.

292
00:36:21,294 --> 00:36:25,804
But also there are some people whom we can
call as very difficult; very!

293
00:36:25,804 --> 00:36:33,445
There’s sort of a crack in their head or
something, that part is missing sometimes.

294
00:36:33,445 --> 00:36:36,054
Some screws are loose I think.

295
00:36:36,054 --> 00:36:38,105
Sometimes they behave like clowns.

296
00:36:38,105 --> 00:36:40,185
And we have known some people.

297
00:36:40,185 --> 00:36:43,154
We just can’t help them.

298
00:36:43,154 --> 00:36:49,654
They could be very intelligent otherwise,
they could be very sharp otherwise, but in

299
00:36:49,654 --> 00:37:01,585
Sahaja Yoga they cannot come down to that
level where you can say: now the growth is

300
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:04,005
possible.

301
00:37:04,005 --> 00:37:08,894
Supposing the Mother Earth was very hot like
the Sun, there would have been no growth.

302
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:15,145
Or [if] it was cold like Moon, there would
have been no growth.

303
00:37:15,145 --> 00:37:24,054
It had to come to the centre where it had
both the things in proper proportions to grow.

304
00:37:24,054 --> 00:37:35,294
In the same way, a human being has to work
out that you keep a moderation and a balance,

305
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:43,485
and understand not to go to extremes of anything.

306
00:37:43,485 --> 00:37:50,215
That balance you learn when you love someone.

307
00:37:50,215 --> 00:37:57,005
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, we have to ask
some people to leave Sahaja Yoga.

308
00:37:57,005 --> 00:38:07,554
This is out of love for them, because once
they go out, they improve, I have seen, they

309
00:38:07,554 --> 00:38:11,784
tremendously improve.

310
00:38:11,784 --> 00:38:19,885
But when they are inside the Sahaj Yog community
they become a nuisance, and they want to be

311
00:38:19,885 --> 00:38:24,495
more nuisance because their ego plays the
part, maybe the conditioning plays the part,

312
00:38:24,495 --> 00:38:27,164
whatever it is, they want to be a nuisance.

313
00:38:27,164 --> 00:38:31,804
So we have to ask them that, “Please now,
depart for a while."

314
00:38:31,804 --> 00:38:37,784
Now if that nuisance value is lost in a person
then he has to be straightforward.

315
00:38:37,784 --> 00:38:50,535
He cannot be any more a nuisance and logically
it can appeal to a person, if you tell that

316
00:38:50,535 --> 00:38:56,554
person, that this is the reason why we want
you to be out.

317
00:38:56,554 --> 00:39:02,395
But they can be very disgustingly troublesome,
I know that.

318
00:39:02,395 --> 00:39:10,705
But you have to show complete patience and
complete understanding and you must talk like

319
00:39:10,705 --> 00:39:13,304
a person who loves.

320
00:39:13,304 --> 00:39:25,595
Love has such a power that nobody wants to
do something that will suggest that they don’t

321
00:39:25,595 --> 00:39:29,215
love; very powerful thing it is.

322
00:39:29,215 --> 00:39:35,445
It binds people in such a beautiful manner
that one wants to do something: for example

323
00:39:35,445 --> 00:39:38,264
you want to give me flowers, because you know
I love flowers.

324
00:39:38,264 --> 00:39:43,405
So you want to give me flower to suggest that,
“Mother we love you,” Just to suggest.

325
00:39:43,405 --> 00:39:51,014
I know you love me but you just want to, sort
of, reinforce it, the thought in me.

326
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:57,685
So you want to give me a flower to show your
love and expression of your inner feeling

327
00:39:57,685 --> 00:40:01,424
for me.

328
00:40:01,424 --> 00:40:06,264
So all these material things can be used to
express your love.

329
00:40:06,264 --> 00:40:13,735
They can be very easily expressed in such
a manner that another person knows what is

330
00:40:13,735 --> 00:40:14,735
love.

331
00:40:14,735 --> 00:40:19,225
But the whole power of Sahastrara is love.

332
00:40:19,225 --> 00:40:33,095
So, if you see that, this brain has to love;
brain has to love.

333
00:40:33,095 --> 00:40:41,585
After now verifying the powers of Sahaja Yoga,
through your brain and intelligence, if you

334
00:40:41,585 --> 00:40:48,164
reach a point where you understand that: No,
it’s no use analysing, synthesising, doing

335
00:40:48,164 --> 00:40:49,875
all these things.

336
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,255
It’s just love.

337
00:40:51,255 --> 00:40:53,095
It’s simple love.

338
00:40:53,095 --> 00:40:59,725
So the same Sahastrara which has been used
before, this brain, for analysing, for criticising,

339
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:06,255
for doing all kinds of nonsensical things,
now wants to love and enjoy the love.

340
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:12,784
And there is the culmination where the brain
just loves.

341
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:16,125
That is the situation one has to reach.

342
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,554
It just loves.

343
00:41:17,554 --> 00:41:20,664
It knows only love because it has seen the
power of love.

344
00:41:20,664 --> 00:41:26,245
You reach a certain logical conclusion, and
then you see the point.

345
00:41:26,245 --> 00:41:32,755
Like Adi Shankara wrote so many things like
Vivekachudamani, this, that, and all those

346
00:41:32,755 --> 00:41:35,625
treaties, and then he gives up, he said, “No,
nothing!”

347
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:44,235
He just writes the praise of the Mother – finished!

348
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:49,965
So once you reach that point, we can say now
you are in nirvikalpa because there is no

349
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:53,875
vikalpa, there is no doubt in your head; because
you love.

350
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:55,425
In love you don’t doubt, no question.

351
00:41:55,425 --> 00:41:57,145
Only when you think you doubt.

352
00:41:57,145 --> 00:42:03,845
But when you love you don’t doubt, you just
love, because you enjoy love.

353
00:42:03,845 --> 00:42:08,555
And that’s why love is joy and joy is love.

354
00:42:08,555 --> 00:42:14,365
So after so many days the Sahastrara has been
opened out.

355
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:22,085
We have to open out our Sahastrara again:
through our meditative processes, through

356
00:42:22,085 --> 00:42:24,895
understanding ourselves and others.

357
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:29,895
Maybe logically reaching that point: there’s
no way out now.

358
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:32,645
We have reached to the end of it now.

359
00:42:32,645 --> 00:42:34,565
The whole logic has ended up now.

360
00:42:34,565 --> 00:42:38,675
Jump in the ocean of love – finished!

361
00:42:38,675 --> 00:42:44,125
Once you jump into the ocean of love there’s
nothing to be done; just to be enjoyed – every

362
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:53,515
wave of it, every hue of it, every touch of
it.

363
00:42:53,515 --> 00:43:05,745
That is what one has to learn by reasoning
that Sahaja Yoga is nothing but is love.

364
00:43:07,365 --> 00:43:09,365
May God bless you all.
