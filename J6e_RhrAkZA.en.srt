00:00:03,955 --> 00:00:04,955
She wanted to meet you

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,140
She's got her Realization.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,220
Oh, I feel all of them are having vibrations in their hands

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,020
Yes

7
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,960
And the last one is Gunter

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,520
Hello

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,280
 

10
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:22,145
 

11
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:24,185
 

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,260
So now who has come from [inaudible] France?

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,620
Rome

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,260
 

15
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,260
 

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,340
Who else?

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,140

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,540

00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,520
From Rouen, there is a group of Yogis.

This time I could shake hands.

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:19,920
 

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,260
Shaking hands is good after Realization.

29
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,980
Not before that.

30
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,975
Et les autres de Rouen? Les autres Sahaja Yogis de Rouen? [What about the Sahaja Yogis from Rouen?]

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,945

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,300

00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,740
From France. He's coming from France.

00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,940

I did not hear from them Mother

166
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,160

168
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:30,760
24.

169
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Nobody has sent any letters here?

170
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:39,920
No, we've received one lettre from Gregoire and there is - in the letter

00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,940

179
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,000
Oh, I see.

180
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,820
There're some more packs here for informations.

Yes, yes.

182
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,040
It's complete and will be sent.

183
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
 

184
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,700
Now, luckily, you see, they got a nice place.

185
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,040
And of different prices so it will suit everyone.

186
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,740
Some people can stay in rooms,

187
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,780
some can stay in the tents

188
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,480
Then they have large rooms

189
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,180
Like that, it will suit every one and it's quite something out taste, you see,

190
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,200
it's quite good.

00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,340
And it is away from London. I don't know how many miles.

192
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,120

one hour's travelling and also from Brighton it is about

194
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,760
half an hour journey, something. It's a triangle.

195
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,640
And something, it's quite good they said.

196
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,460
Luckily they got it when I was there.

197
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,560
And they are very helpful, they are very nice

198
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,220
and they are willling to give you nice food.

199
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,540
But they have decided to have their own food, [inaudible] also, for two days.

200
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,640
Yessun [unsure] is doing it and you know Yessun is very [inaudible]

201
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,460
He's doing it very well and he'll make you very comfortable.

202
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,300
 

203
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Look at that now!

204
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,580
 

205
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,605
 

206
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,740
He's showing noses of every one. See!

207
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,220
You see, you used to do the same when you were a baby.

208
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,880
Did you do that?

209
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,320
To show noses like this.

210
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,400
Right?

211
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,640
Just look at that now.

212
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
 

213
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:03,805
 

214
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:06,915
 

215
00:10:08,445 --> 00:10:09,445
 

216
00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:16,905
The younger ones are interrested in animals, you see

217
00:10:16,905 --> 00:10:17,905
 

218
00:10:24,815 --> 00:10:25,815
 

219
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:29,385
 

220
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:32,695
 

221
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,060
Now he 'll pull your ears better

222
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,540
What are your exams now Robert?

223
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,020
Palmal???

224
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,120
What are your exams?

225
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,680
What are you [inaudible] lots of things?

226
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,740
What subject do you take?

227
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,280
I have to study by heart all the buildings of Europe.

228
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,780
Hum?

229
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,040
All the architecture of Europe.

230
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,720
Ah?

231
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,600
From fourteen hundred till seventeen hundred.

232
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,840
It's interesting!

233
00:11:09,675 --> 00:11:10,675
 

234
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,080
No

235
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,360
No, it's not mind. I tell you, it's not mind.

236
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,680
Because you read the styles, you know, repeated for years,

237
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,460
The same style [inaudible] school all over the world [inaudible]

238
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,460
Like in India [inaudible] you can

239
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,740
They got their spontaneous people.

240
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,220
They have not formed any styles.

241
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,540
So,

242
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,655
they cannot make it into a from or a style,

243
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,880
or you cannot say this period was a - there is little variation in everything.

244
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,620
It's rather intricate.

245
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,800
I've also a course about Indian art actually.

246
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,635
You have

247
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,680
But it's to study their architects

248
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,600
Hum?

249
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
 

250
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,040
What artists you have in Indian architecture?

251
00:11:58,585 --> 00:11:59,755
 

252
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:03,195
Tressano.

253
00:12:03,195 --> 00:12:04,195
Hum?

254
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,220
Trefandro, no?

255
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:06,900
What did you say?

256
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,900
I didn't study it yet, Mother.

257
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:14,520
But, you see, we have, I mean, I don't know how you will be studing it but

258
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,875
we had only, to begin with,

259
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,460
we got these Greek people coming in India, you see?

260
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,780
And they started teaching people how to-

261
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,920
They knew only how to hew rocks and make big, big temples and all that.

262
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,540
And then, these people came and started teaching us how to make

263
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,580
houses of big, large,

264
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,880
it's like palaces

265
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,320
We had palaces before also.

266
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,300
But they taught us but the best part of it, they taught us how to hew  the rock also.

267
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,900
And in that they wanted Buddha to look like a Greek, you see.

268
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,420
So, they gave him mustaches

269
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,660
and also gave him shoes, you see.

270
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,240
And the nose of Buddha is just like a Greek nose, you know, starting from here

271
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,195
straight down here, like that.

272
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,100
Not like an Indian one

273
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,700
And Buddha sitting with his shoes on, imagine, with a mustache

274
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,660
 

275
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
 

276
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,460
And wearing the same type of a dress

277
00:13:13,465 --> 00:13:16,165
you know that Greek cloth without any stitching,

278
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:17,300
what did you call that?

279
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,340
A toge.

280
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,220
Ah.

281
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,020
And the hairs' style, we call it "linger shigary" in Sanskrit.

282
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,480
And same type of hair style that

283
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,440
they wore at that time. They gave it to him,

284
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,540
that Buddha

285
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,140
 

286
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,395
But they had rapports from India

287
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,160
long, long time, thousand of years back.

288
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,780
Because, when I asked them: "Are you ready to call this bona saker?"

289
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,240
They said: "We had a rapport from India.

290
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,780
for long, long, time." Say,

291
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,600
They said about

292
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,860
six, seven thousands years back.

293
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,920
And I think it questions the time when Rama's children, both of them, Lav and Kush,

294
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,720
went to

295
00:14:00,475 --> 00:14:02,065
one went to China

296
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:07,000
and another went to the slave country

297
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,540
The "slave" word comes from "se-ga"

298
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,020
Lav was one of the name for a lamasya.

299
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,280
Slav.

300
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,720
"Se" means "with"

301
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,700
"Lav" was one day, one of the "Kashapas"  [unsure]

302
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,660
 

303
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,440
So that's why the Chineses are called as Kushan, you see?

304
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,780
They are called as Kushan.

305
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,040
Because he was Kush, imagine!

306
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,060
And this must be thousands of years back. And that was the source.

307
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,380
Even now, they say [inaudible].

308
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,720
It's close, there is a temple of Indulika (?) Devi, one of the Goddesses there.

309
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
Shilde  [unsure].

310
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,940
It's very interesting.

311
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,700
Alexander came much later.

312
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,060
 

313
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,520
He's happy with it.

314
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,360
They are the same children.

315
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
 

316
00:15:14,785 --> 00:15:15,785
 

317
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:27,245
 

318
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:28,705
 

319
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:30,185
 

320
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:36,655
 

321
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:40,365
 

322
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,460
A little one. Thank you.

323
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,900
There's a fragrance actually.

324
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,380
 

325
00:16:00,385 --> 00:16:01,385
 

326
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:12,465
 

327
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:17,935
 

328
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:26,760
They are all now going to America, Sahaja Yogis, those who are [?] they are all trying to go.

329
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,740
Some are going [?] and some are going [?]

330
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,900
some are going to [?] some to Los Angeles

331
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,800
and some to San Francisco.

332
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,380
We are all trying to see that they are there to  [?] the work out.

333
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,200
Let's see what happens.

334
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,160
 

335
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,980
 

336
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,800
That would be a very good idea.

337
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,280
 

338
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,900
Very good idea, very good idea.

339
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,660
You see, actually,

340
00:16:57,995 --> 00:16:58,995
 

341
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:02,365
 

342
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,520
You see, postering and all that has to be done,

343
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
apart from that,

344
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,900
 

345
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:11,805
[?]

346
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:14,575
[?]

347
00:17:15,105 --> 00:17:18,035
broadcasting from, I saw TV and everything

348
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,460
from this place, what you call [?]

349
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,360
Then, once it is done, then they say: "that thing will work out."

350
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,480
If that happens, then it will be better

351
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,800
that we can really manage everything. [?] also.

352
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,800
Because newspaper's people are extremely difficult.

353
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:49,935
Newspaper in New York especially.

354
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:53,895
Very funny ideas.

355
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,640
Mother?

356
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,380
Hugh.

357
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,020
Will it be possible to stay in some Sahaja Yogi's house if we go there?

358
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,200
Yes, I think so if you can arrange.

359
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,460
We should. We should be able to.

360
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,540
They are all working but we don't have so many.

361
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,000
Actually, there is another thig working out  [?], you see, Modi is going.

362
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,000
He's going to take one house and hire it.

363
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
 

364
00:18:29,005 --> 00:18:30,005
 

365
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:36,940
And which town would you prefer us to do, Mother? Which part of America you would prefer us to go?

366
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,280
Anywhere, I mean, anywhere.

367
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,060
But, because New York is the worst of all, so more people-

368
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,200
So, New York.

369
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,760
Catherine settled here.

370
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,200
She's so fed up now.

371
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,920
In one of her letter she writes: "if you come to me, and then we just tell them a little thing that they hear all truth

372
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,580
they get angry.

373
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,860
You tell them anything, you see, they have preconceived ideas, they'll say: "No, no, you can't get Realization like that.

374
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,215
How do you say?" All this, they have so much overread

375
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,560
and there have so many people in their heads, that it's impossible."

376
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,140
We have a good experience of that in Paris already, Mother.

377
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,660
Right.

378
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,480
Is it?

379
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,940
She said they are very clever.

380
00:19:20,185 --> 00:19:22,855
[Inaudible]

381
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:25,675
 

382
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,460
She said they are not yet exposed to truth at all.

383
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,800
For them it's like to do shopping, there are going from one place to another like that.

384
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,560
But, in other places it has worked, you see, so it should work in America also.

385
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,500
We have to approve the right type of people, that I don’t know what to do.

386
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,840
But once there is a good broadcast, I think, people will start thinking about it.

387
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,860
If they hear Me, they’ll start thinking about it.

388
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,280
I gave him some nice- did you write there what I said?

389
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,380
Yes Mother.

390
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:08,980
Yes

391
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,900
Can you do that?

392
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,180
I don’t have it with me, Mother.

393
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,000
No, no, no.

394
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,780
 

395
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,460
You should arrange something

396
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,400
for people to go there.

397
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,120
Aunty Christine has a house then that Herman has a house.

398
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,220
[inaudible] has houses.

399
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,600
And also you can take a house and hire it.

400
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,140
As Modi is going, he is taking a house on a rent.

401
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,700
Modi is a very dynamic person, no doubt.

402
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,040
But, how far he will be successful in America? You can’t say.

403
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,140
But his presence there might help a lot, I think.

404
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,140
Yes Mother.

405
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,340
It will help the Sahaja Yogis to keep Spirit-self.

406
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,920
Definitely.

407
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,240
Yes, definitely.

408
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,600
Apart from that, you see, there are a lot of Gujaratis and he thinks that he can bring them round.

409
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,980
How many Indians there are, I don’t know.

410
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,120
But he thinks so, that he might be able to speak to them and bring them round.

411
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,960
But lots of false gurus have left there,  [inaudible]

412
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,000
they have now gone to Los Angeles.

413
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,560
So the people are carrying on with this.

414
00:21:31,635 --> 00:21:34,485
Those gurus are dead now,

415
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:37,275
they are lost in- they are no more in Los Angeles,

416
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,380
but these people are still having their [inaudible].

417
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,520
They can't forget these gurus.

418
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,820
You see, for them, now it has just become prestigious.

419
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:52,755
what to do?

420
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,460
So forget a guru means a prestigious thing.

421
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
 

422
00:22:03,315 --> 00:22:04,435
 

423
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:10,845
 

424
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:17,600
Dany went there, I mean, they are all, Macha, Dany, then Christine, her husband

425
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,060
now working in New York.

426
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,900
 

427
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,800
Last time, we did a lot; working as much as possible.

428
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,020
But nobody used.

429
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,700
You see, when I go there, definitely people  come, no doubt.

430
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:44,160
Even in New York, we had a lot of them,  sometimes about [inaudible], sometimes unveiled

431
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,040
to two hundred people [inaudible]

432
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,400
Rosenwald, there were five hundred, six hundred people,

433
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,840
but they think it's a lot as they were telling me.

434
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,060
Hello!

435
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,400
Yes, yes!

436
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,940
 

437
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,880
 

438
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,000
Mother, some people have arrived from France, Christine.

439
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
Hello!

440
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,700
From Mulhouse.

441
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,620
From Mulhouse and some other girls.

442
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,420
I think the old people should go out and let the new people come in.

443
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,340
All right, Mother.

444
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,880
Mother, elder children from Paris?

445
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,620
Mother, you remember Jean-Yves?

446
00:23:24,975 --> 00:23:27,275
Yes, yes.

447
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:30,495
 

448
00:23:30,595 --> 00:23:31,595
 

449
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:33,325
 

450
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,585
 

451
00:23:50,015 --> 00:23:51,135
 

452
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
 

453
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,660
So the new people seem to be much more solid

454
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,160
 

455
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,500
Yes, Mother.

456
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 

457
00:24:07,455 --> 00:24:08,455
 

458
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,880
So how are you?

459
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,260
 

460
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,700
 

461
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,300
And there's a lot of now sunshine in France.

462
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,560
There's a lot of bright future for France.

463
00:24:27,585 --> 00:24:30,765
 

464
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:32,135
 

465
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
 

466
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:47,260
French people are taking to a lot of sad solutions because they thought they had no solution.

467
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,800
 

468
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:52,675
 

469
00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:01,640
Because they did not know that there is something very great awaiting above minds.

470
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:13,480
And they indulge into all these things very much.

471
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,580
But they must know that God has created this world

472
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,220
and that he’s going to look after you.

473
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,560
He’s going to bless us.

474
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,860
He’s going to give us all that is born of you and beautiful.

475
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,080
The time has come.

476
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:45,360
And it’s for you all now to decide that it is God’s work

477
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,000
and how much you must dedicate

478
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,040
 

479
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,580
 

480
00:25:55,545 --> 00:25:56,955
 

481
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,780
 

482
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:06,540
It’s going to work for your forefathers because there will be blessed as they have given you life

483
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,280
and for your progenesis.

484
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
 

485
00:26:11,865 --> 00:26:15,185
 

486
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:16,445
 

487
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:23,145
 

488
00:26:25,105 --> 00:26:26,105
 

489
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:29,195
 

490
00:26:29,705 --> 00:26:30,705
 

491
00:26:33,055 --> 00:26:34,055
 

492
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:35,275
 

493
00:26:36,015 --> 00:26:37,825
 

494
00:26:38,315 --> 00:26:41,415
 

495
00:26:41,415 --> 00:26:42,415
 

496
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,860
 

497
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,400
French language is small.

498
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
 

499
00:26:51,205 --> 00:26:52,205
 

500
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
French language is very short.

501
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,320
So, now it is your responsibility,

502
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,980
it is a very great responsibility.

503
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,800
The world is standing at a very grave position

504
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,580
 

505
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,700
 

506
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:32,660
because stupid people are using this world for a game

507
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,820
and to play with it.

508
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,840
And then to destroy it.

509
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,220
 

510
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,140
 

511
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,120
So, it is for you to know what is false, what is real.

512
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,300
 

513
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,100
And then you have to, after knowing it,

514
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,140
you have to master the art.

515
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,840
 

516
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,140
 

517
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,980
And then, you have to spread it to others.

518
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,020
 

519
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,940
It’s only you who can make them masters.

520
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,040
 

521
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,420
 

522
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,380
And I’m sure it will spread like fire.

523
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,620
 

524
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:28,975
 

525
00:28:30,205 --> 00:28:31,205
 

526
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,100
It’s for every place, every place, not only about France, it’s every place.

527
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,360
 

528
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,320
Robert seems to be very unhappy about Germans' case already.

529
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,540
But even, it should happen just trust Me,  I know.

530
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,320
 

531
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,160
 

532
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,660
We are gathering forces in Germany too.

533
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,480
You see, once the Germans take to Sahaja Yoga, then nobody can stop it.

534
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,020
 

535
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,580
 

536
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,020
They have still some funny ideas which will drop out by themselves.

537
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,695
 

538
00:29:24,695 --> 00:29:25,575
 

539
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,100
 

540
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:34,640
There are lots of Rajneesh disciples in Germany, lots.

541
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,760
 

542
00:29:36,095 --> 00:29:37,105
 

543
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,560
 

544
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,540
And now, he is in a mess himself you see.

545
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,020
He has to get out of America.

546
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,080
He can’t talk.

547
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,120
Because his voice is finished, he cannot talk

548
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:58,740
And they are trying to make out a case out of it.

549
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,500
But he cannot talk. So, they say he is not teaching.

550
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,440
A person who cannot talk, how can he be a teacher?

551
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,655
 

552
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:12,025
 

553
00:30:12,275 --> 00:30:13,275
 

554
00:30:13,275 --> 00:30:16,525
 

555
00:30:17,105 --> 00:30:20,175
 

556
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,780
 

557
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:27,920
So, they have to- I mean they have decided to throw him out.

558
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,680
 

559
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,620
And once he goes out in that way and he is absolutely exposed,

560
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,160
then it might be that the people will turn right.

561
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,900
 

562
00:30:41,485 --> 00:30:44,785
 

563
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,420
 

564
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:54,780
Of course, they can twist up many things by saying that

565
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,140
he had been tortured and he is Christ crucified.

566
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,860
 

567
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:03,995
 

568
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,520
 

569
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,835
Lots of things are working out.

570
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,240
Like this new disease that has come now, AIDS, in America.

571
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,300
 

572
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,080
 

573
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,940
I heard in England that ten thousands of people are suffering from that.

574
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,500
 

575
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,235
 

576
00:31:33,865 --> 00:31:36,575
 

577
00:31:36,575 --> 00:31:37,855
 

578
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,060
 

579
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,080
But, just imagine,

580
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,320
fifty years back, people were eating very [inaudible]

581
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,860
they probably suffered but nobody had cancer, nobody knew about it.

582
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,275
 

583
00:31:56,275 --> 00:31:59,055
 

584
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,925
 

585
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:04,420
All kind of funny diseases,

586
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,300
like when they give estrogen to a chicken.

587
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:08,800
 

588
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,820
Those who eat that chicken you get puberty at a very young age,  one year earlier.

589
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,220
 

590
00:32:17,325 --> 00:32:20,265
 

591
00:32:20,265 --> 00:32:23,225
 

592
00:32:23,225 --> 00:32:26,325
 

593
00:32:26,325 --> 00:32:29,240
 

594
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,080
And there's one boy, at 18 years of age,  I saw him,

595
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,620
he got breast and half body like man and half like woman.

596
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,595
 

597
00:32:40,595 --> 00:32:43,355
 

598
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,700
 

599
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,840
So this is so shocking.

600
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:54,120
So by saying: "What's wrong. We can do what we like"

601
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,380
 

602
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,520
all that is coming to an end now.

603
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,520
 

604
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,340
And Sahaja Yogis also should be very careful when they use all these medicines

605
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,660
as far as the- what you call- the chemical are concerned.

606
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,520
Not very strong medicines.

607
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,660
 

608
00:33:15,455 --> 00:33:18,255
 

609
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:21,455
 

610
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,700
 

611
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,560
Try to use simple things.

612
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,500
 

613
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,960
You don't really need much because you are all Realized souls.

614
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,895
 

615
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:42,840
If you know how to master art of Realization, you don't need so much drugs  [unsure].

616
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,035
 

617
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,040
 

618
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:56,140
But, I mean, in case you're getting some troubles also or something chemical, be careful what you use.

619
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,435
 

620
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,580
 

621
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:06,400
Even the toothpate and all little things that  if you use for day-to-day life, you have to be careful.

622
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,820
 

623
00:34:07,865 --> 00:34:10,765
 

624
00:34:11,105 --> 00:34:14,075
 

625
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,400
 

626
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,420
Actually, I'm trying to test may things just to see how it is reacting.

627
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,480
 

628
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
 

629
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,220
So that you people don't suffer with the after effects.

630
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,940
 

631
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,940
 

632
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:37,160
And so we will send you a circular to all of you here

633
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,560
to know what is to be used for soap, for this and that.

634
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,980
 

635
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,060
 

636
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:51,640
And also, I'm very happy that I could meet all the new people over here.

637
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,675
 

638
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,185
 

639
00:34:57,185 --> 00:34:59,955
 

640
00:35:00,195 --> 00:35:01,235
 

641
00:35:01,775 --> 00:35:02,775
 

642
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:05,385
Martine, Mother comes from Strasbourg.

643
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,820
Martine and that's her mother, Indu,

644
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,060
 

645
00:35:17,505 --> 00:35:18,905
Philippe, from Rouen.

646
00:35:21,515 --> 00:35:23,905
Patrick from Bordeaux.

647
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,280
Sylvie from Toulouse.

648
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,140
No, Mulhouse.

649
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,180
Sorry.

650
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,880
Then Alain,

651
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,520
from Mulhouse also.

652
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,540
 

653
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,060
She's taking care of them, Mother, Christine is taking care of them.

654
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,000
 

655
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,160
Jean-Pierre.

656
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,340
Bernadette.

657
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,260
Cécile.

658
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,060
Bernadette.

659
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,420
Mulhouse also.

660
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,540
So nice to see you all here.

661
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,180
Some more.

662
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,180
 

663
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,740
 

664
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,580
Nicole

665
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,240
 

666
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,620
Lausanne Mother.

667
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,520
And Joël, he has not come.

668
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,260
 

669
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,760
I would say that for those who have come for the first time should sit inside and the rest should go outside.

670
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,435
 

671
00:36:48,435 --> 00:36:49,815
 

672
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,915
 

673
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:00,685
 

674
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,280
 

675
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,460
Now, the task [unsure] should be understood.

676
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,460
When you'll become aware of it,

677
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,300
you'll be surprised that God has given you all the powers.

678
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,240
 

679
00:37:21,925 --> 00:37:23,095
 

680
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,800
 

681
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,860
So, try to understand Sahaja Yoga in its essence first.

682
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,420
 

683
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,560
And don't try to compete.

684
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,540
 

685
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,840
 

686
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,640
Because you can't understand through your mental capacities.

687
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,775
 

688
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,780
 

689
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:58,420
So, one has to reach that state of awareness in which you really can understand and grasp it.

690
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,520
 

691
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,360
It's something that is eternal.

692
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,335
 

693
00:38:04,335 --> 00:38:07,385
 

694
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,680
 

695
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,200
Because a new kind of a revolution is working on via Sahaja Yoga,

696
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,080
 

697
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,080
 

698
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,360
which is the truth, actually.

699
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,180
 

700
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:31,300
And the truth is such a great mirror

701
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,840
that all that has happened so far in history

702
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,840
can be seen clearly.

703
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,960
 

704
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,980
 

705
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,340
 

706
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,700
You will know who was right, who was wrong,

707
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,420
what perception was correct what was wrong.

708
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:59,720
Everything you will know absolutely separately as two compartments.

709
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,635
 

710
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:07,095
 

711
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,680
 

712
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,820
 

713
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:15,540
So, if you- if somebody tells you , this is not good for Sahaja Yoga, don't get upset.

714
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,880
 

715
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,335
 

716
00:39:19,335 --> 00:39:21,975
 

717
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,700
 

718
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,320
You have willpower because you are young.

719
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:35,620
You can accept anything. If you accept something, you can practice it in no time.

720
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,200
 

721
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,440
You are the leaders of the world.

722
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,515
 

723
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,520
 

724
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:55,360
And you can after [inaudible]

725
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:02,120
you have to humbly understand that God has created this universe

726
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,560
and he has given all his powers.

727
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,040
 

728
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,460
 

729
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:19,920
And that he's so All-pervading, that he looks after you at every point and every minute.

730
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,095
 

731
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,720
 

732
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,600
As a story, you discover all these things.

733
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,440
It's such a fantastic vision that amazes [inaudible].

734
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,015
 

735
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,540
 

736
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,600
There is one little thing, I'll tell you,  that happened then you can't  brain.

737
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,120
I was in Bedford. Do they know the story of Bedford?

738
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,120
No, Mother.

739
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:54,480
I was giving a lecture, in front of 5 or 6 hundreds of people, in the town of Bedford.

740
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,680
 

741
00:41:00,685 --> 00:41:01,685
 

742
00:41:02,135 --> 00:41:03,865
 

743
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:11,680
And then, and a boy felt down, about, at least ten, fifteen miles away from that place.

744
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,700
From a bridge, he felt down from a motorbike.

745
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,600
 

746
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,600
 

747
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,080
 

748
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,840
And he fainted.

749
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:33,900
So, people who saw him falling down, they sent for an ambulance.

750
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,960
And the ambulance came to bring him to the hospital.

751
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,880
 

752
00:41:39,885 --> 00:41:42,005
 

753
00:41:42,005 --> 00:41:44,300
 

754
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:48,420
So, they said: "How is it you're falling so low and you now talk?

755
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,560
what's-  how are you in that case? You're quite fine."

756
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,620
 

757
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,440
 

758
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:08,300
So he said: "Actually, I felt down and a lady in white, an Indian lady in white

759
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,860
came down off her car which was white

760
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:14,240
and she she touched me all over the body and I got cured.

761
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,520
Except, she left a little part down below, saying that: "You come to me then I 'll cure you."

762
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,680
 

763
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:24,025
 

764
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:26,935
 

765
00:42:26,935 --> 00:42:30,255
 

766
00:42:30,255 --> 00:42:33,045
 

767
00:42:33,045 --> 00:42:36,055
 

768
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,060
 

769
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:41,580
And the doctors, everybody was so surprised and they published it in a newspaper.

770
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,005
 

771
00:42:45,005 --> 00:42:46,860
 

772
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,240
And the second day, he has seen some of my photographs in the newspaper.

773
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,660
 

774
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,280
 

775
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,800
He went into- to people, to police and said: "This is the lady who saved me."

776
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,900
 

777
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:11,240
So the newspaper people telephoned to Gavin to find out about me.

778
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,140
 

779
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,580
 

780
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:26,780
And then Gavin said that: "You can find out from all these people that at that time, and even after that time, Mother was giving a speech in a hall."

781
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,200
Before and after.

782
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,280
 

783
00:43:31,285 --> 00:43:34,545
 

784
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:37,825
 

785
00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:40,960
 

786
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,760
And they could not explain they don't know about it.

787
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,260
 

788
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,620
But see the result of that was that the parents got frightened about it.

789
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,560
 

790
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,595
 

791
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,200
And the boy never came to see me.

792
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,060
And the people who were there also got frightened.

793
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:11,765
 

794
00:44:11,765 --> 00:44:14,265
 

795
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,840
 

796
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,480
Frightened, just frightened.

797
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:25,020
And they, you see, this fright has deviated them from divine life.

798
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,400
 

799
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,880
 

800
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,340
There's nothing to be frightened about it.

801
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,120
 

802
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,420
 

803
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:40,740
Because if the doors of heaven are opening we should enter into it,

804
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,020
we have been waiting for that.

805
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,295
 

806
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:52,480
Why should we be afraid or hesitating? Better get in!

807
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,565
 

808
00:44:56,565 --> 00:44:57,520
 

809
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,580
And God is saying: "Aye! [Come in!]"

810
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,760
 

811
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,280
So we have to enter it so that we enjoy, enjoy because this is what is promised,

812
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,560
and it's given to you and it's very simple.

813
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,360
 

814
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,860
Because God as not promised like politicians.

815
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,520
 

816
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,120
He gives the true promises.

817
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,280
 

818
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,460
And so, your duty now is to settle down.

819
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,460
 

820
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,060
 

821
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:44,440
Especially in the West there has been no idea about what spiritual life is.

822
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,755
 

823
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,760
 

824
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:56,360
Even the Christ' life was organized too much and you know what has happened to him.

825
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,320
 

826
00:45:59,325 --> 00:46:01,655
 

827
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,860
 

828
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,720
So, it's a different area where we are working.

829
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,240
 

830
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,520
 

831
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,900
But you are great, great people who are born here.

832
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,815
 

833
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,960
 

834
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,600
Because you have to emancipate this ignorant world.

835
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,515
 

836
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,060
 

837
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,700
So the responsibility is even much more.

838
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,940
 

839
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:37,020
Indian Sahaja Yogis don't have so much responsibility.

840
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,360
 

841
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,380
 

842
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:45,480
You, people, have the real responsibility and real task.

843
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,700
 

844
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,260
 

845
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:55,020
And as your friends have done it, you can  do it also.

846
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,780
 

847
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,300
 

848
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,600
I'm always with you.

849
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,320
Always.

850
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,780
And I love you very much.

851
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:13,140
Whatever you want, I'm very ready for giving anything that you ask.

852
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,480
 

853
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,940
 

854
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,720
Just you have to think of it

855
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,640
 

856
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,760
and I will be with you.

857
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:31,860
All the powers of God and all the angels are with you.

858
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:35,300
 

859
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,880
 

860
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,920
You must have faith in yourself

861
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,920
 

862
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,740
that all is going to work out.

863
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:46,340
 

864
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,880
 

865
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,180
May God bless you all.

866
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,300
Beautiful.

867
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,900
It's touching me a lot to see you after millions or years. [Unsure]

868
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,060
 

869
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,320
 

870
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,580
 

871
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,340
I've been waiting for you and you have been waiting for me.

872
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,440
 

873
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,040
 

874
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:28,660
It is such a meeting that you can just not communicate.

875
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,660
 

876
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,480
 

877
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,500
May God bless you all.

878
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:43,160
and I hope we have a very successful, very, very beautiful session in Paris.

879
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,620
 

880
00:48:46,745 --> 00:48:47,745
 

881
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,200
 

882
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,860
And a good puja on Saturday morning.

883
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,635
 

884
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,960
 

885
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,880
May God bless you.

886
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,120
 

887
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:16,175
