1
00:00:05,583 --> 00:00:10,208
Today we have gathered here

2
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:15,417
to do the Devi Puja.

3
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:25,333
This Puja was performed many a times

4
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:33,208
and the Devi was requested

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,709
by the Devas to save them

6
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:48,250
from the  tyranny of devilish people.

7
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:56,667
Today I feel the same way,

8
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:02,291
that we are now in the grip

9
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:09,500
of a funny situation; that

10
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:18,208
there are people who are themselves devils, I think,

11
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:24,083
--  and also (people who are) mesmerised by them --

12
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:33,208
who are trying to do something which they should never have done.

13
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:44,000
But they don't know that

14
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,583
there is a climax of everything.

15
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:53,542
And that point has arrived

16
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:59,583
where all the good people,

17
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:06,125
especially the Sahaja Yogis should put all their mind

18
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:12,333
to the destruction of these horrible

19
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,542
personalities like Mahishasura.

20
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:26,208
In those days, it was very simple

21
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:31,500
because devils came as devils

22
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:37,458
and you could see them, that they are devils,

23
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:44,125
and all their behaviour proved that they were devils.

24
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:49,333
Why they did it?  Why were they cruel?

25
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:56,083
Because so called 'human beings' as they are

26
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:02,208
-- they are not -- they are by nature devilish

27
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:08,417
and they want to do something by which they can destroy

28
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,041
human beings, and good human beings.

29
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:23,291
It is evident that the time has come

30
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,250
for them to be destroyed.

31
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:36,500
In no way I could be against Islam

32
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:41,250
and ever to criticise Mohammed Saab.

33
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:48,208
He was divine, no doubt, and tried to do divine work.

34
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:55,041
But out of that divine work these stupid people have come up

35
00:03:56,583 --> 00:04:01,375
who accept those devilish people.

36
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:11,166
You will be amazed to know that in Islam

37
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:17,333
there are seventy-four groups!

38
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:26,125
They say "We follow one religion" -- but they do not.

39
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,667
Out of these,

40
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:37,583
some of them are really evil people,

41
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:44,083
and they call themselves

42
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:49,000
by the name as Devbandhis because this is a place in India,

43
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:53,333
and also they are called as Wahabees.

44
00:04:56,083 --> 00:05:00,041
I have been knowing them since long

45
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:06,125
because in our household, in my father's household,

46
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:11,542
we had lots of Muslim people working as cooks,

47
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:17,166
as drivers, as other servants.

48
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:22,083
And these Wahabees are very interesting people

49
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:26,458
because they don't believe even in Mohammed Saab.

50
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:29,375
So if you tell them

51
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,458
that Mohammed Saab has said such-and-such a thing,

52
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:35,166
they say "No, we don't believe in Mohammed Saab".

53
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:39,375
"So, in whom do you believe?"  "We believe in Allah!"

54
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,125
"Have you met Allah?  Have you seen him,

55
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,667
that you are believing in Him?"

56
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,375
But in their whole behaviour

57
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:55,166
it was cruelty which was innately built,

58
00:05:56,625 --> 00:06:02,375
very cruel; and whenever my father saw that,

59
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,625
he asked them to get out.

60
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:11,333
Because (they) always had sinister

61
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:18,041
practices by which they used to treat others.

62
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:24,667
I never knew that it will come up to that stage.

63
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:30,208
And they are mostly they were from Afghanistan,

64
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:34,166
can you imagine, mostly.

65
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:38,625
Of course they tortured other Afghanis also;

66
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,125
and where-ever they went

67
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:47,583
they had a speciality that they could be very cruel.

68
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:55,125
Not all Afghanis, no, not at all, but some of them.

69
00:06:56,041 --> 00:07:00,041
And they came to India from Afghanistan

70
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:05,041
and we have different types of Afghanis.

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,458
Some were very loving, kind, helpful, very nice people.

72
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,667
And some of them were very cruel.

73
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,583
First we didn't understand what is this.

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,250
But because my father was a scholar and scholar of Islam,

75
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:35,375
he told us "These are not Islamic. They call themselves Wahabees

76
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,709
and they are not Islamic".  I can see that today, so clearly.

77
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:50,250
Not that in other

78
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:57,709
religions or in other groups there are not bad people.

79
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:04,291
But these Wahabees were

80
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:08,625
secretly working out different groups.

81
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:16,291
They are not many.  And that's what my father had told me

82
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:21,041
"One day they will become very explosive

83
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:27,667
and they might try to completely ruin the world".

84
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,166
At first I couldn't understand,

85
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,375
because, after all, they looked like human beings only.

86
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,500
But he says, he told me,

87
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,208
"They are absolutely camouflaged,

88
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:50,208
and once they start their cruelty

89
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,542
you will not know what to do."

90
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,500
We had one invader in our country

91
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:02,041
called as Mohammed Shah Dali

92
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,583
He was a very, very cruel man, very cruel,

93
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,291
and he used to even kill the Muslims

94
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:16,000
because his concept was

95
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:20,250
that you should not worship Mohammed Saab

96
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:28,291
because Mohammed Saab said that "I am not Divine".

97
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:33,333
I also used to say the same, to save from the stupid people.

98
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,625
For years I used to say "I am not Divine",

99
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:42,667
but when they felt My vibrations and all that, they believed.

100
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:47,125
But those who believed in Mohammed Saab

101
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,291
were never understood by these people.

102
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,500
Very, very cruel,

103
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,667
and because they don't even believe in Mohammed Saab

104
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:05,625
you cannot argue with them on any point; you cannot argue with them

105
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:09,041
what is written in the Koran

106
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,333
because you don't believe in Koran,

107
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,583
you don't believe in Mohammed Saab you believe in Allah.

108
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,500
God knows from where do they have connections!

109
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,542
But gradually it was surprising that

110
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,417
they could mesmerise --as we have

111
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:32,208
horrible gurus who come as gurus and they mesmerise.

112
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:37,583
You have seen them, people being mesmerised.

113
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:42,333
So many are being exposed and so many are going to be exposed.

114
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:48,333
But mostly they were people

115
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:51,333
who were interested in money,

116
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:57,542
in getting lots of money, somehow, in the name of religion.

117
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:06,667
But at that time, people didn't see their cruel methods

118
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,458
and their cruelties.

119
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:14,583
This cruelty started growing

120
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:19,375
and you know we have been to Nizamudhin aulia.

121
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:25,333
In that place only I discovered there's a Madharsa --

122
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,250
'Madharsa' means a 'school'.

123
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:34,375
And in that school they used to admit small children.

124
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:41,667
And it was so well planned that God doesn't know --

125
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,417
I mean I can't say,

126
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,667
that there were 120 Madharsas only in Delhi!

127
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:55,458
Now nobody knew what they are teaching there,

128
00:11:56,709 --> 00:12:01,417
what they are mesmerising, how they are doing this.

129
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:08,458
It so happened once I went to

130
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:14,041
this place, Nizamudhin,

131
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:19,583
and there I found people singing songs and all that.

132
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:27,667
And I found in them a real feeling for love.

133
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:31,291
They felt My love, very much, all of them,

134
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,375
and they started coming to Sahaja Yoga.

135
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,291
But I didn't know there was a Madharsa in that place.

136
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:46,000
I asked them "Why is it, here the vibrations,

137
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:49,250
Nizamudhin was an aulia (saint).

138
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:54,208
And how is that the place doesn't have good vibrations?"

139
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:58,291
In between I used to get very bad vibrations.

140
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,709
So they told me "Mother, there is a Madharsa".

141
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,542
Now look at the evil, how it works.

142
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:13,417
Normally, evil used to work like this, that it would go and

143
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:22,583
form some groups, some wars, and kill people.

144
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:37,208
They were few people, but they had

145
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:41,542
cruelty as their religion.

146
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:49,625
Which ever way they lived, they wanted to be cruel.

147
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:57,375
In those Madharsas only, they had people who used to

148
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,709
tell them how to be cruel, how to hate.

149
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:05,667
So 'education in hatred' started.

150
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,583
And that education of hatred

151
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:17,542
was very well woven through these Madharsas,

152
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,709
all over the world.

153
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:27,375
Now, as you know,

154
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,417
Pakistan and India were always fighting.

155
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:40,542
But this time Pakistanis realised

156
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:45,166
that 'If we fight with India in that way

157
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,166
we will be called as terrorists'.

158
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:56,208
So they said "No, we will have no terrorism in our country".

159
00:14:57,542 --> 00:15:01,166
But they are the ones stupidly --this new fellow

160
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:07,625
had sent about 65 scholars, ambassadors,

161
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:14,500
to Afghanistan to study in those Madharsas,

162
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,667
how to become cruel  can you imagine!

163
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,291
To teach hatred!

164
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,583
Of course there are many Muslims who are not;

165
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:38,166
but if you do not respect Mohammed Saab

166
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:42,083
and you are supposed to be a Muslim,

167
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,667
what will come out of you?

168
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:51,125
So, all these wrong ideas grew up

169
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:58,458
and Islam got divided

170
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,709
into many groups.

171
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:07,125
It's alright, but to have this kind of a group

172
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,458
that is against all humanity

173
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:15,083
was the most dangerous plan!

174
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:21,250
I don't know how many Muslims also knew about it.

175
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:31,458
They spread this Madharsa thing all over the world

176
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:38,417
and people coming out of that institution

177
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:43,041
became very, very cruel people.

178
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:48,333
The first cruelty was to the women.

179
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:53,291
Women were treated with such contempt,

180
00:16:55,208 --> 00:17:00,667
and absolutely no respect of any kind

181
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,500
was given to them.

182
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:12,458
This itself shows that there was no-one to control them.

183
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:21,333
It's not written in Koran, it's not described by Mohammed Saab.

184
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:28,166
He says "God is merciful;

185
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,458
He is peace-giving".

186
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:41,458
Whatever he did was absolutely divine, no doubt.

187
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:48,500
But some of these people, the way they took to satanic forces,

188
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:58,458
people started misunderstanding Islam.

189
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,166
'Islam' means 'to surrender'.

190
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,583
Those who are surrendered are you people.

191
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:13,000
Surrendered means those who have given up

192
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:17,458
all their lust, greed and all these enemies,

193
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:24,625
and are above normal people.

194
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:29,375
Another thing, it was very interesting

195
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:32,500
to note that Mohammed Saab had said

196
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:38,166
that "At the time of resurrection, you hands would

197
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:45,458
speak". That he clearly said.

198
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,500
Naturally, because it was written

199
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:56,583
in a language which was all poetic,

200
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:02,542
people can, if they want to, they can twist it.

201
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:11,500
But Mohammed Saab never, never could have said

202
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:24,125
It's very, very shocking that in these modern times

203
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:33,542
that people have taken to such

204
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,208
crooked ideas.

205
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:48,333
But for that, the reason is that

206
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,208
people also develop resistance for them.

207
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,500
Jews -- they developed a resistance for them.

208
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:13,041
This hatred is responsible,

209
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:18,083
and this hatred between both the sides,

210
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:25,041
I would say now, is that two different ...

211
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,583
it's very evident.

212
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:41,542
Now, in Sahaja Yoga,

213
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:47,709
you believe in complete

214
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:55,041
innocent, simple existence together.

215
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:05,166
And that people believe

216
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,500
that there is definitely different groups of people. ......

217
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:27,458
Now what is our duty?  What are we supposed to do?

218
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:34,250
First of all, we have to introspect.

219
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,041
Supposing you are a Hindu, born,

220
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,500
you should sit down and find out if you hate

221
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:47,333
anybody because he's a Muslim.

222
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,709
You can't hate!

223
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:55,208
Because somebody is a Muslim, you can't hate him.

224
00:21:56,291 --> 00:22:00,375
Because you are a Muslim, because you are surrendered,

225
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:06,583
so how can you hate anyone?

226
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:18,166
If you are surrendered, you are surrendered to the Divine,

227
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:23,709
and how can you then be against the Divine?

228
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:30,291
So these misleading thoughts

229
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:34,625
and ideas should be given up.

230
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:47,125
Supposing you are a Hindu --

231
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,375
so you have no business to hate anyone!

232
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,333
That is for definite!

233
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:04,625
Now the word 'Hindu' also comes from the River Sindhu

234
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:11,583
because Alexander couldn't say 'Sindhu' so he said 'Hindu'.

235
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:18,625
And on that point many people have built

236
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:27,291
this horrible hatred in India.

237
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:34,375
But cruelty was not their theme.

238
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:44,417
That was the saving point.  That they didn't want to torture people.

239
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,625
So this aptitude to torture or to hate people

240
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:58,166
is coming form other sources.

241
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:02,000
And the source is,

242
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:10,709
as you can see clearly, that they openly hate.

243
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:16,583
To hate is a very bad quality.

244
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:21,250
One of the most dangerous things is to hate.

245
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,333
And so you all must know ......

246
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:37,625
alright. Now we are having a ...

247
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:03,417
To me, it is very painful

248
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:09,208
to think that we human beings,

249
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,583
(that) we hate others,

250
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:20,375
when you know that love is such an overwhelming,

251
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:24,667
beautiful feeling.

252
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:32,583
But why then do you take to hatred?

253
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:42,417
Because people have

254
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:49,000
impressed you, they have told you lies,

255
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,500
that's why you hate.  What an achievement!

256
00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:00,625
First to be a human being, and then to be a person full of hatred!

257
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:05,417
Now what will be the next, I don't know!

258
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:12,166
It was alright in those days for the Goddess to kill.

259
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:21,583
The Goddess used to kill all such people  ...

260
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:37,583
It's a very sad feeling

261
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:42,709
that God has created human beings

262
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:50,625
from amoeba to this stage, and how can we hate someone --

263
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:58,208
and this is what has happened!

264
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:03,625
Now of course Sahaj is different.

265
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:09,166
The Sahajis know how to enjoy love.

266
00:27:12,709 --> 00:27:15,291
They like it.

267
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:19,625
They enjoy it. You can see that.

268
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:28,667
And if somehow, you people

269
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:32,667
could manage to remove this hatred --

270
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:43,500
somehow, somehow -- with your own will-power --

271
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:51,208
denying and defying all that is being told to human beings,

272
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:55,625
I am sure ....

273
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:06,417
It's a very difficult work

274
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:10,375
where those people who came

275
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:14,041
on this earth went through all kinds of

276
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:18,667
education, wanted

277
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:27,375
to improve the conditions, the relationships, friendships,

278
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:34,333
have fallen into the depths of hatred ...

279
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:56,000
My heart just weeps.

280
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:03,208
At what time I have come on this earth,

281
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:09,250
where I have to see human beings hating each other.

282
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:17,417
They talk of 'love' and 'hate'.

283
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,583
It's a very serious thing,

284
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:29,291
that you who are the children ...

285
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:35,333
they'll end up like this ...

286
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:53,542
I mean, I have experiences that if I tell you you'll be shocked.

287
00:29:55,250 --> 00:30:03,041
How people have fallen down to the depth of evil nature.

288
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:12,709
It's an understanding

289
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:21,041
we have, to have understanding

290
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:27,667
about ourselves: Do we hate somebody?

291
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,542
Do we get ideas that we shouldn't have, or do things? ...

292
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:40,709
Do you have such things in you?  Just find out!

293
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:45,542
Do you hate other people?

294
00:30:54,667 --> 00:31:02,083
The ideas are rotten, absolutely, for the human mind.

295
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:09,583
The ideas which are completely

296
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:15,166
like the animals' instinct,

297
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:21,417
are absolutely no good for human beings at all.

298
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:27,208
But that is what is happening, and it's coming forward ...

299
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:38,333
If you are poor, alright,

300
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:44,500
but by hating you don't become rich, no.

301
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,709
If you are in any difficulties,

302
00:31:55,542 --> 00:32:01,458
then your duty is to remove those difficulties,

303
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:04,709
but not to prosper on them.

304
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,041
All this has to finish.

305
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:17,166
It is very surprising that we are not bothered at all

306
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:20,333
as to what we are doing.

307
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:29,000
Yes, you have to have proper

308
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,458
sense of understanding:

309
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,542
where are we going?

310
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:50,291
If  you have misunderstanding about somebody,

311
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:53,333
better take it out, completely.

312
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,166
They try to trouble you, alright.

313
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:05,417
But don't have bad understanding about that person.

314
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:15,166
Very surprising that we never see those things,

315
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:22,000
how ugly they are, and how funny they are,

316
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,542
how they ruin our personality.

317
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:34,291
You may be able to correct some people ...

318
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:58,500
All our activities as Sahaja Yogis,

319
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:04,166
I never realised were so important!

320
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:09,166
We have to give so much time.

321
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:17,709
Not to bother about nonsensical, frivolous things,

322
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:23,542
but something serious that is within us or without,

323
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:26,709
that must be taken out..

324
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:38,166
If I ask you, 'How many people you hate?'

325
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:46,291
You may say '20 people' and ...

326
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:14,333
You see the whole atmosphere in all this

327
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:19,667
fills me with such remorse

328
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:27,083
that I just don't know what are we going to do, the Sahaja Yogis.

329
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:34,667
What are their plans?

330
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:41,125
Will you please look into yourself

331
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:49,166
and think what constructive work we are doing

332
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,125
and what destructive work we have been doing.

333
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,458
You need a big shock to understand this.

334
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:08,166
I like the way we have programmes and Pujas and all that,

335
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:11,583
but if you ask My Inner Being,

336
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:17,333
I know it is very, very unhappy, very sick.

337
00:36:19,709 --> 00:36:25,625
At this time, what you have to do as Sahaja Yogis ...

338
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:35,041
as Sahaja Yogis, minimum of minimum

339
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:38,041
you should put full attention.

340
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:46,458
And then you have to tell everybody ...

341
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:52,333
You see the trouble with Sahaja Yoga is

342
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:56,208
that you all start enjoying yourself,

343
00:36:57,458 --> 00:37:01,250
and then you don't see around what is happening.

344
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:08,041
Now I must tell you

345
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:16,041
I am now in the midst of war

346
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:20,375
between myth ...

347
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:31,000
Is it an area, is it a --

348
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:36,458
I don't know what should I say --is it (that)

349
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:42,417
within us there is still lurking

350
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:48,709
some kind of a weakness

351
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:57,250
that we do not try to fight our weakness ...

352
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:09,291
I would now request you all to meditate

353
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,333
on yourself,

354
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:23,041
and see for yourself what is wrong. ...

355
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:37,125
It's a big shock,

356
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:46,250
and to reduce this shock, what can Sahaja Yogis do?

357
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:57,166
What can they work it out to blast this horrible

358
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,208
ways of human life?

359
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:12,709
It's possible with the Power of Love --

360
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:16,583
you can manage!

361
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:21,709
But we must develop that power in our hearts.

362
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,166
Think of it!  It's a big lesson now for all of us,

363
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:34,458
to see for ourselves --

364
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,375
are we alright?  Or we go on hating others?

365
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:51,375
What is the function of our mind, is to hate or to love?

366
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:59,041
And this love, if it enlightens you,

367
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:04,166
you will be amazed, you will be such a big force for Me.

368
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,583
I cannot fight the whole thing alone.

369
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,333
I have to have people who really

370
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:23,291
develop their love -- and nothing else!

371
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:30,333
That is one of the challenges now for all of us,

372
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:35,041
for all the Sahaja Yogis all over the world.

373
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:44,709
It's not only the fight between believers and non-believers,

374
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:53,542
not only the fight between Sahaja Yogis and non-Sahaja Yogis,

375
00:40:57,083 --> 00:41:03,250
but this is a fight where we are all one

376
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,417
and we are going to fight it out.

377
00:41:08,709 --> 00:41:14,291
At every stage we have to be much more subtler.

378
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:28,375
It is very, very essential to see to the point today --

379
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:36,125
are we also part and parcel of that evil thing that is working out?

380
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:41,500
Or are we free from that,

381
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,500
and prepared to fight it?

382
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:56,000
It's a big fight and I hope it is conclusive!.

383
00:41:57,625 --> 00:42:03,417
After this there will be no more of

384
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:07,500
cruelties to human beings,

385
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:12,583
no more fights,

386
00:42:14,542 --> 00:42:20,625
because this is a fight between the rakshasas

387
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:27,583
and ourselves.  It is not 'ordinary'.

388
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:32,500
And this has to be explained,

389
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:37,458
also to those who are supportive of evil forces.

390
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Only thing, 'Mother how are we to know

391
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:49,667
who is against and who is not?'

392
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:56,125
You are knowledgeable; you are Sahaja Yogis,

393
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:04,291
you know who is on the wrong side.

394
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:10,208
I know Sahaja Yogis can save,

395
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:16,583
and can bring them to the right path of knowledge and love.

396
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:23,375
But -- be very careful with the propaganda

397
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:27,333
of evil that is going on.

398
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:35,250
I want to touch the deepest part of your heart,

399
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,709
which should reconcile ...

400
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:50,625
I am sure you all will understand

401
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:55,667
the magnitude of danger that awaits!

402
00:43:57,667 --> 00:44:02,583
Maybe there may not be any human beings left,

403
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:07,583
maybe there may not be any children left.

404
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:13,208
Because if this kind of thing is working out,

405
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:18,208
it is very difficult, very difficult  ...

406
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:35,667
My whole existence

407
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:42,542
gets shaky, gets shaken up.

408
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:48,458
You all should see in every

409
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:52,083
nook and corner of life:

410
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:58,709
Where is this talk going on?  Where are people talking of cruelty?

411
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:04,333
What's happening? ...

412
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:22,250
Whatever I think ...

413
00:45:28,458 --> 00:45:33,542
it's not one, it's not two, it's all of us.   ...

414
00:45:49,542 --> 00:45:56,166
The fight that I am having is of a very serious nature, no doubt.

415
00:45:57,208 --> 00:46:03,375
But if you all can fight collectively, how much

416
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:06,208
we can work it out! ...

417
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:24,208
My all efforts,

418
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:30,000
understandings, powers,

419
00:46:30,709 --> 00:46:34,166
everything is now in your hands,

420
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:40,333
and that's what you should be prepared for.

421
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:47,667
Not by just reading something or

422
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:52,500
talking about it, you have to build up within yourself

423
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:55,375
the power of love.

424
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:05,250
I am sure with the opening of the Sahasrara you will do.

425
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:11,333
But try to read something, to understand something,

426
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:14,333
with the Power of Love.

427
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:19,542
It's a very deep subject, and when you talk about it,

428
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:22,417
half-way I'm inside, half-way outside.

429
00:47:23,709 --> 00:47:27,333
But I have to tell you that you all develop this,

430
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:35,375
and only that (Power of Love) will form a very strong opposition

431
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:39,583
to these 'evil doers' as they call it. ...

432
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:54,333
My complete blessings are on you,

433
00:47:55,667 --> 00:48:01,250
and I want all of you to individually work it out.

434
00:48:02,542 --> 00:48:05,542
How many people you love, how many people ...

435
00:48:09,417 --> 00:48:11,542
This you have to find out.

436
00:48:22,542 --> 00:48:27,417
I hope you people have understood what I want you to do. ...

437
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:39,709
A new generation is coming up  ...

438
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:57,041
All of you, all of you, are in My Heart,

439
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:02,250
and I love you very much,

440
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:05,583
and I want you people

441
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:12,291
to come as soldiers to fight with Me.

442
00:49:17,709 --> 00:49:23,250
I am also told that there are some people who are forming groups --

443
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:25,625
extremely negative attitude!

444
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:30,125
At this time what we need is complete solidarity.

445
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:37,250
So all such people whom you see, tell them to behave themselves!

446
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:41,208
No use making them Sahaja Yogis.

447
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:54,125
I am sure -- it's really heartfelt -- desire of mine

448
00:49:55,667 --> 00:50:01,166
that you should become really soldiers of love and peace.

449
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:09,041
Because that is why you are here, you are born here for that.

450
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:13,208
So enjoy yourself.
