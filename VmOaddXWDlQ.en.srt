1
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:26,334
Last night was a night of complete darkness,

2
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:31,000
that they call it as amavasya;

3
00:00:31,634 --> 00:00:39,200
and just now only the first phase of the moon has started.

4
00:00:43,634 --> 00:00:49,234
Today we are here to celebrate

5
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:54,033
the day when the Sahastrara was opened out.

6
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:57,701
Also you have seen in the photograph.

7
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:03,167
It was actually a photograph of my brain,

8
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:07,767
which showed how the Sahastrara was opened out.

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,667
The light of the brain now could be photographed.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,334
It’s something great these modern times have done.

11
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:21,667
So the modern times have brought a lot of things

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,367
which can prove the existence of the Divine.

13
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:35,000
Also it can prove about me.

14
00:01:35,434 --> 00:01:38,501
It can convince you what I am.

15
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:45,334
This is very important because, in the modern times,

16
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:52,033
this advent has to be recognised, has to be fully recognised.

17
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:58,801
This is one of the conditions for all the Sahaja Yogis.

18
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,501
Now let’s see what’s happening  in the modern times, in the

19
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:06,434
brains of the people.

20
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,601
In the brains of the people today, if you see,

21
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:17,334
there is an attack on the Sahastrara.

22
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:20,434
There has been an attack since long

23
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:25,167
but in the modern times it’s the worst time

24
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:37,100
that they are trying to make the limbic area very insensitive.

25
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:49,400
Very depressive novels, very depressive thoughts

26
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:56,734
and very depressive music,

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,667
you can say, like Greek tragedy nonsense.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,167
All these things came from the medieval period

29
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:15,467
till, we should say, this new age has started.

30
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:23,167
That one itself was no good for our limbic area.

31
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:27,033
That made us very depressive.

32
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:38,033
We took to alcoholism to escape from the so-called miseries.

33
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:46,167
But then came this modern age

34
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:52,667
in which people became overactive -

35
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:56,167
over-activity started.

36
00:03:56,367 --> 00:04:02,234
With that the brain also became overactive.

37
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:05,734
In addition to the dullness before,

38
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:11,000
it’s gone to the other extreme of over-activity.

39
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:17,434
So to dull it again they took to drugs,

40
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:23,367
they took to very horrible music.

41
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,133
That’s how they made this limbic area very, very insensitive.

42
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:38,734
So a drug which was just a stimulus to begin with

43
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:44,167
was to be taken in greater quantity and

44
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:49,033
later on they had to take the drugs

45
00:04:49,234 --> 00:04:53,701
which were of a much more severe nature.

46
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,367
It went on like that and now we know that

47
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:04,133
this drug is the only way people think they can survive. Why?

48
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:08,267
Because of the tension [that] they talk of.

49
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:12,133
In the modern times we have something called ‘tensions’.

50
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:16,801
It was never there before. People never talked of their tensions.

51
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,133
Now every body says, “I’m in a tension!” “You give me a tension!”

52
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:27,667
What is this tension? It’s because of my advent.

53
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:35,567
The limbic area wants to know about me.

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,300
And the Kundalini also, as Sahaja Yoga is increasing,

55
00:05:42,734 --> 00:05:46,033
is trying to rise in people;

56
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:48,634
because you become the channels.

57
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:55,000
Wherever you go, you generate vibrations,

58
00:05:55,467 --> 00:06:03,501
and these vibrations give a challenge to the Kundalini,

59
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:09,267
or a message, and in various people it rises.

60
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:11,801
It may not rise up to the Sahastrara,

61
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:15,667
or it may even rise up to Sahastrara but it falls back,

62
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,200
because there’s no recognition.

63
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:21,634
So every time they do something

64
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,033
this Kundalini comes up and gives them a pressure,

65
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,267
because their Sahastrara is not open.

66
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:35,534
It’s a closed door. Because of the closed door

67
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:39,100
this gives them a kind of a pressure in the head,

68
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:44,100
which they don’t understand, and they call it as ‘tension’.

69
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:47,133
Actually the Kundalini is trying

70
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,734
to push it out, itself, but it cannot.

71
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,234
And those also who get their Realisation,

72
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:01,200
if they do not make their Sahastrara alright,

73
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:05,167
they go on getting into tensions.

74
00:07:06,534 --> 00:07:13,267
So, though Sahastrara has been opened out so many years back,

75
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:20,634
still we have some things to be done -

76
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:25,400
is to clear out our Sahastrara, first of all.

77
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,033
So first is the breaking of the Sahastrara,

78
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:35,601
then once it opened out,

79
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:40,033
the brahmarandhra opened out,

80
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:46,000
then we started feeling the grace,

81
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,601
and it moved onto our

82
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:58,734
Ida and Pingala – the grace not the Kundalini.

83
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:03,734
And the grace, which is chaitanya, all round,

84
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,200
soothed down our left and right sides

85
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:11,133
by which our chakras opened more,

86
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:17,400
and more threads of the Kundalini started piercing through.

87
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:23,734
So I always tell Sahaja Yogis that it’s important that you must meditate.

88
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:29,501
If your Sahastrara is alright, all your chakras will be alright

89
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,234
because, as you know, that the peethas,

90
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,567
or the controlling centers of all these chakras,

91
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:42,367
are in the brain around the limbic area.

92
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:46,801
So if your Sahastrara is clear

93
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,267
everything works out in a very different way.

94
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:55,367
How to keep the Sahastrara alright,

95
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:59,300
is the big problem always people ask me.

96
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:02,634
You know that I reside in the Sahastrara.

97
00:09:02,801 --> 00:09:10,734
I've incarnated on the lotus of one thousand petals.

98
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:15,200
That’s why I could break it also.

99
00:09:16,434 --> 00:09:20,367
As I am today, as you see me. Of course

100
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:23,601
they say, “Sahastrare Mahamaya”

101
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:29,801
So this is the illusion which is all the time there for you,

102
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:33,734
which is very elusive.

103
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,133
It had to be that way because

104
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:40,634
you could not have faced me otherwise

105
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,234
with all the lights coming out of me

106
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:50,067
or the way you saw yesterday Sahastrara – some sort of

107
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:57,234
abstract colours thrown on all sides and the lights thrown outside.

108
00:09:58,033 --> 00:10:01,000
Please don’t take photographs when I’m speaking, alright?

109
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,100
You can take later on. There’s no hurry about.

110
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:05,567
Just pay attention to My lecture.

111
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:09,667
Please, pay attention. It’s important.

112
00:10:10,701 --> 00:10:13,100
It is to be, this, told beforehand,

113
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:16,234
that nobody should take photographs during puja

114
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,801
because it is a very intense thing [that] one has to work it out.

115
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:26,133
Please, pay attention. Even if you don’t understand,

116
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,634
it has effect on you.

117
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:36,267
So I would request you to pay full attention to me when I am talking.

118
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:42,033
It works better.

119
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,133
Now this Sahastrara is to be looked after by you.

120
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:52,234
It’s the temple of your Mother.

121
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:55,234
When you say you put me in the heart,

122
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,300
actually you put me in the Sahastrara.

123
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:02,167
Because, as you know, the brahmarandhra here

124
00:11:02,434 --> 00:11:07,000
is the fontanel bone area, has got the peetha, the centre,

125
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:12,100
which controls the heart, which is the

126
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:20,300
seat of the Sadashiva or you can say of Shiva.

127
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,667
So when you put me in the heart actually you put me there.

128
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,300
So to raise it from heart to there,

129
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:32,701
or to bring it from there to the heart,

130
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:38,133
is the problem of two types of people.

131
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,634
Some people who are sensitive in their heart

132
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,734
– I would say in Europe we can say

133
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:52,200
Italians are very sensitive on their heart –

134
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:54,534
the first thing they do as soon as they see me

135
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:57,601
they put their hands to their heart.

136
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:07,567
And that is what it is, that, if you try to feel me in your heart,

137
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:11,200
to begin with, it’s much easier.

138
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:16,367
To feel me in your heart.

139
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,767
Now you might say, “How to do it?”

140
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:32,200
You have to love me as I love you.

141
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,267
You have to love each one of yourselves,

142
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:42,067
because you are all within me.

143
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:47,501
And you cannot teach someone how to love.

144
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,701
Love is within.

145
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:59,267
And love manifests if, just, you open your heart.

146
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:05,567
Now what stops it, we should examine that.

147
00:13:06,434 --> 00:13:09,767
Firstly, the conditioning.

148
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:16,534
In the West to express your love is regarded as sinful actually.

149
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:19,300
It takes them time to say, “I love you,”

150
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:22,267
but “I hate you!” even a child could go on saying,

151
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,367
“I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!”

152
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:32,400
But to hate someone is sinful. To anyone, to hate, is sinful.

153
00:13:33,234 --> 00:13:40,067
So to say that, “I hate you! I hate you!” is a sinful act.

154
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:49,734
So what one has to do is to say, [to] go on saying, “I love you."

155
00:13:53,467 --> 00:14:01,434
After all, you must love a person who is so dear to you.

156
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:10,667
Anyone who has done something good for you, you love that person.

157
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:17,801
But if the Adi Shakti Herself has given you the rebirth,

158
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:23,300
it should be the easiest thing to love.

159
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:31,000
And if She says that, “They are all within my body",

160
00:14:31,801 --> 00:14:36,133
so it should be even easier to love each other.

161
00:14:36,634 --> 00:14:44,634
So the whole cleansing of the Sahastrara is done through this love,

162
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:52,367
this love which is not conditioned,

163
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:59,167
which is not inhibited,

164
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:07,133
which doesn’t want any respite or doesn’t want any return – nirvaaj.

165
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:12,133
But the conditionings are too much.

166
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:17,167
First the problem of conditioning comes to you

167
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:25,000
when you think that, “This condition makes me hate someone,”

168
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:31,701
or, “I cannot love someone because this is the condition!”

169
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:36,133
But actually

170
00:15:36,534 --> 00:15:44,067
the conditioning itself is so absurd, if you see it one by one.

171
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:49,434
To make it simple, I would like you to understand

172
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:54,033
the conditioning part where

173
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,033
I read once an article, an interesting one,

174
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,100
“Who killed the romance?”

175
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:04,234
So he said “the hairdressers”.

176
00:16:04,434 --> 00:16:09,267
I was wondering how is he connecting romance with the hairdressers?

177
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:13,133
Because people used to go to a hairdresser

178
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,667
and one hairdressing was liked by a person.

179
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,300
So he would say that, “I love that hairdressing!”

180
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:27,300
Now supposing his fiancée, or his wife wore another

181
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:32,167
type of hairdressing, because everyday new things are coming,

182
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:36,501
then immediately the husband would say

183
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:41,267
“Oh I hate you because of your hairdressing!”

184
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:47,234
Because he loves one type of hair dress, that’s why he loves.

185
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,100
Otherwise if you have another hair dress you hate it!

186
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:52,334
“I don’t like it!”

187
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:58,167
To say that “I don’t like it” and “I like it”, itself, is a sign

188
00:16:58,534 --> 00:17:03,067
that the conditioning is too much.

189
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,100
You make a proper hair dress and you dress up properly

190
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:14,534
and you come out and then suddenly people say, ”Oh I hate it!”

191
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:20,567
Who are you? What right we have got to say that to anyone?

192
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:27,200
You are not a judge appointed by any law courts.

193
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:36,167
So why do we say, to hurt someone, to say “I hate it”?

194
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:39,501
On the contrary you must say that, “Alright,

195
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:43,634
I like this but you could do better."

196
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:48,534
That’s the sign of love where you want a person

197
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:52,267
to be dressed up in a way that is appealing.

198
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:00,100
But this is on a very, very baser level we see people.

199
00:18:00,734 --> 00:18:06,400
Then we go further to see a person: how intelligent he is,

200
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,100
how smart he is, how charismatic he is,

201
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:17,267
how charming – that’s another word which is very elusive.

202
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:23,601
These are also kind of conditionings of the mind -

203
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:27,767
that you think that a particular style of a person

204
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:36,567
is a loveable person, that you love that person.

205
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:40,133
It’s so much outside.

206
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,467
Or some people actually do not love

207
00:18:42,734 --> 00:18:45,267
but show they love because somebody has more money.

208
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:48,501
And the money, he’s not going to part with, no doubt,

209
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:52,567
but you love that person because he has more money,

210
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:57,601
or he has a better car or he’s better dressed, whatever it is.

211
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:10,367
So this kind of an idea one has also is a killer of love.

212
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:16,267
If love is killed, joy is lost, you cannot have joy without love.

213
00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:21,601
I say, joy and love, both are just the same.

214
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:30,000
Then it gets even subtler and subtler and subtler.

215
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:37,234
Then we start, say, loving our own children, that’s very common.

216
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:40,667
I mean, of course, also some people don’t even love their children,

217
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,033
I mean there are all kinds, you see.

218
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:51,067
But then they go on, “This is my child, this is my child, this is my child!”

219
00:19:57,801 --> 00:20:02,267
That again is the death of love.

220
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:07,267
As I told you before: the sap of the tree rises, goes to every fruit,

221
00:20:07,434 --> 00:20:11,200
goes to every leaf, goes to every part and comes back.

222
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:16,701
It’s not attached. If you are attached to one part or to one flower

223
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:19,567
because it is more beautiful

224
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:26,434
then the tree will die and the flower will also die.

225
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:31,701
So that’s the death of the love.

226
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:39,567
So you have to have love which doesn’t get entangled or attached.

227
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:44,067
Every time I tell like this they say, “How to do it?”

228
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:48,801
The love of the Spirit is of that kind.

229
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:56,000
Love of conditioned mind is different.

230
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,801
A conditioned mind can love

231
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:03,267
in a limited way because it is conditioned.

232
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:10,200
Then the greatest enemy of love is ego within us,

233
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:15,767
which is like a balloon on top of our head.

234
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:21,133
And this ego gives us a very big tension.

235
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:30,601
The conditioning of course, like they for example, they see a carpet.

236
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:35,534
Now it is, according to their conditioning, is not good.

237
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:39,634
So they say, “Oh what a carpet it is!” Or something.

238
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:46,100
This kind of conditioning of very low level.

239
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:50,167
And the higher level at the most, is that you love your own country,

240
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,434
so “My country is the best!”

241
00:21:52,634 --> 00:21:56,067
Whether it is killing people,

242
00:21:56,234 --> 00:21:59,501
whether it is destroying the world peace, it’s all right

243
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:02,133
because “I belong to a particular country which is the best!”

244
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,300
We can never criticise our country and countrymen.

245
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:11,200
It goes on subtler and subtler.

246
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:15,267
But on the intelligence side it is even worse!

247
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,434
Because intelligently if you have understood that something is good

248
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:22,367
then nobody can save you!

249
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,200
Because through your brain you have understood.

250
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,033
Actually it is very surprising: I was reading the book

251
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,267
written by Rabindranath Tagore

252
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:41,100
and an Englishman had given a very beautiful

253
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:48,133
preface to that, an introduction, and he said that

254
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:52,734
the creativity is killed in the West.

255
00:22:54,167 --> 00:23:00,133
So he asked a gentleman who was an Indian critic.

256
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:03,434
He said, “Don’t you criticise your poets?

257
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:06,133
You don’t have people who are critics?”

258
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:12,634
“Yes, yes we have, they criticise,” “So what do they criticise?”

259
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:19,067
“Oh, they can criticise that, this time there was no rain

260
00:23:19,234 --> 00:23:23,300
so we had problems and things." He said: “No, no, no, no!

261
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:28,100
We are thinking about the poet, do they criticise the poet,

262
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:31,567
do they criticise an artist?”

263
00:23:32,267 --> 00:23:35,067
So he says: “Is it meant for criticism?”

264
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:40,634
“It is created, whatever he felt

265
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:43,701
is created. But supposing he has put something

266
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:47,567
very vulgar then of course we don’t like it.

267
00:23:48,033 --> 00:23:53,067
But if it is created by a beautiful mind, it has to be beautiful."

268
00:23:53,234 --> 00:23:55,167
“Then you don’t criticise?”

269
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,334
He says, “No, because we cannot create like that.

270
00:23:58,534 --> 00:24:01,601
So what business have you got to criticise?”

271
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,400
This is how, ‘intelligently’, what we have done:

272
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:15,167
we have norms about everything, about art, about every creation.

273
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:17,567
We don’t like this carpet. Why?

274
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:22,167
Because it doesn’t appeal to our intellectual

275
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:25,167
understanding of the norms we have reached

276
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:29,634
and in that frame it doesn’t fit in so we don’t like it.

277
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:34,033
Can you even create one inch of that?

278
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:43,100
So this ego gives you an unauthorised action.

279
00:24:43,267 --> 00:24:47,000
It is unauthorised, anadhikar cheshta. Un-authorised.

280
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:51,434
You have no authority to criticise.

281
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,100
You can’t do anything,

282
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,033
so why should you criticise? Better appreciate and see for yourself

283
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,334
that you are not in authority, you are not worthy of it, to criticise.

284
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,067
If you are not worthy of it why should you criticise anything?

285
00:25:16,601 --> 00:25:21,667
And, otherwise also, you must know you are a slave of your ego.

286
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,033
Whatever you ego dictates and your intelligence,

287
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:31,167
so-called ‘intelligence’, brings you to a point, to have some norm.

288
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:35,634
And then it becomes a collective ego of a particular community,

289
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:41,334
of a particular country, of a particular ideology.

290
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:49,067
It’s collective. So then they say, “Oh we think this is no art!”

291
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:58,234
That is the reason we cannot have masters any more in art.

292
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:02,100
We can’t have Rembrandt, we can’t.

293
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,267
Poor Rembrandt must have himself suffered a lot.

294
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:10,567
You know Gauguin suffered a lot. All these artists suffered a lot.

295
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:13,033
Even Michelangelo suffered a lot.

296
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,367
Not only monetarily, not only monetarily,

297
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:19,801
but otherwise: criticise, criticise, criticise.

298
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:22,334
So I think people have given up.

299
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:26,000
I met an artist who had done lots of art work

300
00:26:26,267 --> 00:26:27,534
and I said, “Why don’t you show me?”

301
00:26:27,701 --> 00:26:29,634
He said, “No I don’t want to show you. It’s created for myself."

302
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:32,200
I said, “I would like to see!”

303
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:37,634
I saw, it was beautiful, very beautiful, I said, “Why don’t you show?”

304
00:26:37,801 --> 00:26:40,067
He said, “No use. People will just criticise.

305
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:41,767
I do it for my own pleasure.

306
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,400
They’ll just spoil the whole joy of my creation."

307
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:57,133
So one of the basic things we should avoid is to criticise others.

308
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,634
Better to criticise yourself.

309
00:27:00,801 --> 00:27:05,534
Criticise yourself, criticise your brothers and sisters,

310
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:08,767
criticise your country, criticise all the habits you have

311
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,701
and laugh at yourself, is the best way.

312
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:19,100
If you know how to laugh at yourself, then

313
00:27:19,601 --> 00:27:23,334
you will not object or will not stand in the way

314
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:27,300
of any creativity of another person.

315
00:27:29,434 --> 00:27:33,801
So with ego you become so unauthorised.

316
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:38,567
You can criticise anything. You think you have a right.

317
00:27:38,734 --> 00:27:41,467
Who has given you this right to criticise?

318
00:27:41,634 --> 00:27:44,801
Is the question one should ask to oneself.

319
00:27:46,234 --> 00:27:49,801
How can we criticise anyone?

320
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:59,000
As saints, as you are now, of course, you can make out

321
00:27:59,234 --> 00:28:03,267
who is caught up, who has given bad vibrations,

322
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:06,567
who has the problem. You know that.

323
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:11,801
You know it. It’s not conditioning.

324
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:15,133
It’s not just you are doing because there’s some ego,

325
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,801
but you are feeling it on you fingertips.

326
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:20,400
It’s an actual feeling within you.

327
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:24,167
It’s the bodha (knowledge), by which you know.

328
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:27,601
Then what should you do?

329
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:31,000
In your love, you have to tell the person,

330
00:28:31,234 --> 00:28:35,133
if possible, that, “This is wrong with you. Better be corrected!”

331
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,434
But in a way that he does it.

332
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:39,534
On the contrary, if you tell him in a way

333
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:41,801
that he becomes even worse than what it is,

334
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:44,567
you have not loved that person at all.

335
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:51,334
Allow everybody to grow.

336
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:58,000
There are many people in Sahaja Yoga

337
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:01,167
who are very, very good, excellent, no doubt.

338
00:29:01,334 --> 00:29:06,300
But also there are some people whom we can call as very difficult; very!

339
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,133
There’s sort of a crack in their head or something,

340
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,467
that part is missing sometimes.

341
00:29:13,634 --> 00:29:19,000
Some screws are loose I think. Sometimes they behave like clowns.

342
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:22,467
And we have known some people. We just can’t help them.

343
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:26,634
They could be very intelligent otherwise,

344
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:29,400
they could be very sharp otherwise,

345
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:34,400
but in Sahaja Yoga they cannot come down

346
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:43,267
to that level where you can say: now the growth is possible.

347
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:47,434
Supposing the Mother Earth was very hot like the Sun,

348
00:29:47,601 --> 00:29:49,634
there would have been no growth.

349
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:55,167
Or [if] it was cold like Moon, there would have been no growth.

350
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:59,801
It had to come to the centre where it had both the things

351
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,367
in proper proportions to grow.

352
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:10,601
In the same way, a human being has to work out

353
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:14,067
that you keep a moderation and a balance,

354
00:30:14,234 --> 00:30:20,133
and understand not to go to extremes of anything.

355
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,467
That balance you learn when you love someone.

356
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,601
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know,

357
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,601
we have to ask some people to leave Sahaja Yoga.

358
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:39,634
This is out of love for them,

359
00:30:40,067 --> 00:30:43,801
because once they go out, they improve, I have seen,

360
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:46,767
tremendously improve.

361
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:57,667
But when they are inside the Sahaj Yog community

362
00:30:58,033 --> 00:30:59,801
they become a nuisance, and they want to be

363
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:02,501
more nuisance because their ego plays the part,

364
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:04,200
maybe the conditioning plays the part,

365
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,801
whatever it is, they want to be a nuisance.

366
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:11,267
So we have to ask them that, “Please now, depart for a while."

367
00:31:11,634 --> 00:31:15,534
Now if that nuisance value is lost in a person

368
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:18,467
then he has to be straightforward.

369
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:25,067
He cannot be any more a nuisance and logically

370
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,234
it can appeal to a person, if you tell that person

371
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,567
that this is the reason why we want you to be out.

372
00:31:36,467 --> 00:31:41,434
But they can be very disgustingly troublesome, I know that.

373
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:45,767
But you have to show complete patience

374
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,334
and complete understanding

375
00:31:49,534 --> 00:31:54,000
and you must talk like a person who loves.

376
00:31:56,367 --> 00:32:03,434
Love has such a power that nobody wants to do something

377
00:32:03,767 --> 00:32:06,767
that will suggest that they don’t love;

378
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,334
very powerful thing it is.

379
00:32:09,501 --> 00:32:12,767
It binds people in such a beautiful manner

380
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:15,367
that one wants to do something: for example

381
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:18,601
you want to give me flowers, because you know I love flowers.

382
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:22,267
So you want to give me flower to suggest that, “Mother we love you”,

383
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:24,400
Just to suggest. I know you love me

384
00:32:24,601 --> 00:32:30,167
but you just want to, sort of, reinforce it, the thought in me.

385
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,534
So you want to give me a flower to show your love

386
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:38,801
and expression of your inner feeling for me.

387
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,767
So all these material things can be used to express your love.

388
00:32:46,234 --> 00:32:51,667
They can be very easily expressed in such a manner

389
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,534
that another person knows what is love.

390
00:32:55,067 --> 00:33:00,133
But the whole power of Sahastrara is love.

391
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:10,067
So, if you see that, this brain has to love;

392
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:17,200
brain has to love. After now verifying the powers of Sahaja Yoga,

393
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:20,367
through your brain and intelligence,

394
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:25,601
if you reach a point where you understand that: No

395
00:33:26,033 --> 00:33:29,634
it’s no use analysing, synthesising, doing all these things.

396
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,634
It’s just love. It’s simple love.

397
00:33:33,033 --> 00:33:36,734
So the same Sahastrara which has been used before,

398
00:33:37,067 --> 00:33:40,534
this brain, for analysing, for criticising,

399
00:33:40,734 --> 00:33:43,434
for doing all kinds of nonsensical things,

400
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:46,400
now wants to love and enjoy the love.

401
00:33:46,634 --> 00:33:53,067
And there is the culmination where the brain just loves.

402
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,367
That is the situation one has to reach. It just loves.

403
00:33:57,701 --> 00:34:01,200
It knows only love because it has seen the power of love.

404
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:07,167
You reach a certain logical conclusion, and then you see the point.

405
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:11,367
Like Adi Shankara wrote so many things like Vivekachudamani,

406
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:15,367
this, that, and all those treaties, and then he gives up, he said, “No, nothing!”

407
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:19,601
He just writes the praise of the Mother – finished!

408
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:27,000
So once you reach that point,

409
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:30,534
we can say now you are in nirvikalpa because there is no vikalpa,

410
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:33,067
there is no doubt in your head;

411
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:36,801
because you love. In love you don’t doubt, no question.

412
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:38,734
Only when you think you doubt.

413
00:34:39,067 --> 00:34:42,267
But when you love you don’t doubt, you just love, because

414
00:34:42,434 --> 00:34:48,734
you enjoy love. And that’s why love is joy and joy is love.

415
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:54,501
So after so many days the Sahastrara has been opened out.

416
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:58,033
We have to open out our Sahastrara again:

417
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:01,000
through our meditative processes,

418
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:04,267
through understanding ourselves and others.

419
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:08,434
Maybe logically reaching that point:

420
00:35:08,634 --> 00:35:12,601
there’s no way out now. We have reached to the end of it now.

421
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:14,300
The whole logic has ended up now.

422
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:17,801
Jump in the ocean of love – finished!

423
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:20,734
Once you jump into the ocean of love

424
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:26,067
there’s nothing to be done; just to be enjoyed – every wave of it,

425
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:32,467
every hue of it, every touch of it.

426
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,100
That is what one has to learn

427
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:46,634
by reasoning that Sahaja Yoga is nothing but is love.

428
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,434
May God bless you all.
