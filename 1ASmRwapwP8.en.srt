[INAUDIBLE]

110
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,960
Absolute Truth.

111
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,000
Now the Truth is that

112
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
there is an All-Pervading power of God's love

113
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,520
which does all the living work

114
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,100
in this Universe.

115
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:25,620
The second truth is that we are not this body, mind,

116
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:33,300
this intellect or this ego

117
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:42,820
or conditionings but we are the pure Spirit.

118
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:54,180
When the Kundalini rises through these six centers

119
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,400
it of course, integrates your being. That is, there's no quarrel

120
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:08,700
between your mind, your heart and your attention.

121
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:18,100
You become completely integrated and so empowered

122
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,940
that you can enjoy their integration.

123
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,280
When you become the Spirit, what happens to us -

124
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,660
to understand that we have to understand the nature of the Spirit.

125
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,420
Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty on our heart.

126
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,220
We are the reflectors. These reflectors start

127
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,780
working since we were stones, we can call them or matter, then living creatures,

128
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:12,280
till we reach a state when we are human-beings, the Spirit is expressed

129
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,540
in our heart, in the best way.

130
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:27,500
But it is still in a witness state watching us all the time what we are doing.

131
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:35,460
It doesn't come into our attention - He's just watching

132
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,760
but when the Kundalini rises and pierces through your fontanel bone area -

133
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,680
so this is the seat of the God Almighty

134
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,400
and the reflection of the Spirit is in your heart.

135
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:01,960
So first of all, it connects your brain with your heart, as a result

136
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:11,780
a kind of a pulsation - in Sanskrit it's called as 'Spanda' - starts flowing

137
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:19,400
on your Central Nervous System, which you can call it as cool vibrations.

138
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:24,280
Also it is co-related

139
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:30,340
with the All-Pervading Power which is

140
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,020
flowing within our being because of this connection.

141
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:57,780
The Spirit is the one that is the Absolute Truth.

142
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:06,440
Absolute Truth means there is no other Truth than that.

143
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,620
For example, if you have ten children and tie up their eyes

144
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:23,100
and ask them, "What is the matter with this gentleman?"

145
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,780
they will all raise the same finger. Supposing, there is this finger

146
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:37,260
or this finger, any finger. Like the other day,

147
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,900
somebody asked Me, "Mother, why they were they all asking, 'What is your relationship with your father?'"

148
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:52,900
because there is indication on this finger, on the right hand

149
00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:01,200
that there's something wrong with the fatherhood. Either you are not a good son or he's not a good father; It could be even the husband.

150
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,220
And you ask the gentleman, he'll be surprised that how do you know.

151
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:15,280
So the Truth, which is Absolute, comes to you on your finger-tips.

152
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,400
You immediately know what's wrong with the other person and what's wrong with you.

153
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:30,560
Now you don't talk the language like English or Hindi, Marathi,

154
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,020
Sanskrit but you speak the language of the centers. This is what happened

155
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:42,000
when the disciples of Christ were blessed by Holy Ghost and they got their realization,

156
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:51,060
that they started speaking the language of the centers. So you don't say that

157
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:01,720
this center of yours is bad because you have got ego -

158
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:08,580
you don't have to say that way. You just have to say that Agnya is not working alright.

159
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,720
Sahaja yogis would come and tell Me, "Mother, please solve my problem of Agnya." "What's the matter?"

160
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:23,280
"I can't bear it, it's a headache." So he doesn't see it as ego but he sees it as a

161
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:29,640
causal of it. The cause of his headache is his ego

162
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:37,140
and he sees it as Agnya chakra. So he comes and tells Me - actually if you see in short -

163
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,400
it is, he says, "I've got too much ego, please remove it Mother from my head."

164
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:52,160
So you reach that subtler state when you understand what is fundamentally, basically wrong with you

165
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:59,060
because these are the fundamentals on which our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being

166
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:07,740
rests or is nourished. So immediately you know basically what's wrong with you and you know yourself, nobody has to tell you.

167
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:17,000
Now supposing, somebody is very much conditioned so his chakra,

168
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:24,420
at the back side, goes off. Now, if you tell that person, "You are a conditioned person," he'll not like it

169
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:32,300
but he himself, after realization, will say, "Mother, please solve my problem of the back Agnya," means there's some conditioning -

170
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,400
could be coming from anything.

171
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,600
And you face yourself directly.

172
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:52,400
You don't have to, sort of, sit down and analyze yourself but you just see it clearly on your centers

173
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,700
what's wrong  with you and if you can relate one center,

174
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,020
another center, the combinations of these centers

175
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:07,780
and actually what is the matter with you, immediately you will know what's the problem is.

176
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:19,100
so you know the Absolute Truth. Now you have known from India many people have come as false

177
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:26,040
gurus and everybody tells Me about them; They are just here to make money. These are

178
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:35,780
quite a camouflage they have but still with realization you immediately know that he is a cheat

179
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:43,740
or he's a demon, demonic person - you have to just put your hands like this and you can feel it -

180
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:54,060
the vibrations which are not pulsations of tremor or anything but cool

181
00:21:54,300 --> 00:22:01,040
breeze like things that flow, suddenly becomes hot. Sometimes they might create a little blister also

182
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:08,480
for the time being because you become like a barometer and Absolute things you know.

183
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,580
Even if you have a painting, which is a copy of a real painting,

184
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:22,320
and people don't know. Only by putting hands towards it, immediately you'll know if it is of the real one or not.

185
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:30,340
Any fundamental question can be asked and you get the answer on your finger-tips and you know what is the truth.

186
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:40,320
So the your attention itself becomes enlightened. With this attention, which is enlightened,

187
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:49,920
you can feel the vibrations of another person, the chakras of another person.

188
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:59,180
But apart from that, second thing, that this enlightened attention is dynamic.

189
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,400
Sitting down here, if you put attention to something, it works.

190
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:16,360
It works. Of course you have to develop that state, that higher state of doubtless awareness.

191
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,180
Anywhere you put your attention, it works.

192
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,620
So the connection with the Divine is that

193
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:38,160
this attention, wherever you put it, like a remote control it works.

194
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:48,320
A person, who is a realized soul, is extremely compassionate

195
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:56,420
and extremely dynamic. Of course, you never feel your age,

196
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:03,440
you never get tired, you work very hard because all the time the energy is flowing.

197
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:12,600
You become an expert on understanding what is falsehood and what is truth.

198
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:20,440
The discrimination, the Divine discrimination is so acute and so penetrating

199
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,880
that it cannot find faults with it.

200
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:37,080
I know of a person, who came to Me after realization, I told you that, "Why don't you take to the interior decoration

201
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:46,000
of ships?" He said, "I don't know from one timber to another timber." I said, "Just start."

202
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:54,340
And he became very rich with that. He somehow or the other, he said, "I knew this was this timber, I knew this one was that timber."

203
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:03,700
So you just know, after a certain state that you reach, that this is this, this is this.

204
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:14,960
Because your attention is so pure and clear, you become extremely creative.

205
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:21,800
Many people, who have never spoken on the stage, have never said a sentence

206
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,720
on the stage, who had stage fear and all that, are great orators today.

207
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:36,520
Any walk of life you enter into, you are absolutely confident of yourself and you know you are properly guided.

208
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,980
And the nature of the Spirit is,

209
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:55,320
that it gives you an attention that doesn't fritter away; It don't look at things which are of no use.

210
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:02,620
But once you see something, the whole

211
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:11,080
picture is in your mind - like a photogenic picture. Whenever you want to think about it, you get the whole thing.

212
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:17,520
Even the folds of the clothes and everything, the face, everything comes to you absolutely clear.

213
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:23,460
The memory becomes so sharp, even at an old age, that people are surprised.

214
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,620
And you do not try to memorize too many things - it's just there.

215
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:40,820
One lady in America got realization - she had a shop - Indian lady. She said, "I meticulously knew every uh..

216
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:47,200
bit of my shop and I knew what has consignment has come, what has gone - everything.

217
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,660
I don't know anything now but I'm making big profits." I said, "That [UNCLEAR - SHOULD OR IT?]

218
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:00,140
Why should you break your neck with all this burden, just you should have the profit - finished."

219
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:07,720
And she was amazed how she's making so much money when she is not knowing all these things and she is living in complete joy.

220
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:15,480
So the another attribute of Spirit is that it is the source of joy.

221
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:22,320
Joy is not like happiness and unhappiness;

222
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:30,140
If your ego is pampered, then you feel happy. When it is not pampered, you feel unhappy.

223
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:35,040
Joy is a state where you just enjoy everything

224
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:45,540
because you are beyond thoughts. Just see this beautiful carpet - beyond thought.

225
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:54,240
The one, who has created this, has put all his joy in it in creation and that joy becomes so abstract and starts

226
00:27:54,540 --> 00:28:01,920
falling on your being and soothes you down. Such a person is extremely relaxed,

227
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:10,720
not agitated. He doesn't waste his energy in unnecessary things. As it is happening these days

228
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,940
people are become overactive, overanxious, stressed and all those things.

229
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:21,860
As a result of that people have now developed a horrible disease called as Yuppies disease.

230
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,680
In this disease your conscious mind absolutely gets tired and fagged out.

231
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,380
All the time watching the time, all the time running. Specially in America,

232
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,640
I told about this disease about ten years back and now it's there.

233
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:45,000
And I've seen those people they are carried just like reptiles like a big fish on the shoulder of people.

234
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,400
They think alright but they cannot lift their hand, they cannot lift their legs

235
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:57,180
if it is to be done consciously but unconsciously they may. What a disease!

236
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:06,520
So this over-alertness and too much of worry and these things, the norms of modern life are so

237
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,360
telling upon our nerves that our nerves themselves become

238
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:17,880
tired and ultimately the conscious mind becomes, becomes tired.

239
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:24,900
I've to tell you, that in sahaja yoga we have cured one Australian

240
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:32,300
of AIDS  - one, only one. I should say, we cured five but they all got lost; They couldn't get over their bad habits.

241
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:39,760
One we have cured. He's still living and kicking seven years but we don't want to say that we cure, it can be cured

242
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:45,760
with your Kundalini because if we start saying, all of them will pour down but they have no will to live

243
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,440
and they had no will-power to overcome that bad habit

244
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,920
because we tried it with people, they again went back to the same bad habits - they couldn't get out of it.

245
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:04,080
But it happens because the Spirit has the power to cure you also

246
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,600
when it is connected through this Kundalini to the Divine.

247
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,140
It cures you completely, you feel very healthy

248
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,560
and all the time you feel very fresh.

249
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,380
You do not run after things like -

250
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,960
manufacturer starts something - now today this dress, tomorrow that dress, today this

251
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,080
nothing of the kind. You don't run amuck, you have discretion.

252
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,340
You know what to wear, what to use; That's how you solve your ecological problem.

253
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:54,860
Because a new dimension also comes into your awareness, which we call as Collective Consciousness

254
00:30:55,340 --> 00:31:00,320
but also you become an universal being because Spirit is universal.

255
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:07,140
So you don't worry about yourself only - you worry about the whole Universe;

256
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:16,100
Worry in the sense that you want to do something about it. Immediately your attention will go to something that's happening now

257
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:22,380
and you'll try to think and pray that, "This should be alright," and it works out.

258
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,980
You definitely become a much wider personality.

259
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:33,300
It's not only limited to one little person but it is a universal thing.

260
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:40,580
A new religion, we can call, is enlightened into your valencies, which we call, as the pure innate

261
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:46,360
universal religion which encompasses all the principles of all the religions,

262
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:53,480
all the people of the world and you go beyond these wrong ideas of different

263
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,920
religions and races and this and that and that.

264
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:06,560
You just start feeling you are part and parcel of the whole. It's not, again, thinking, it's the feeling.

265
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:14,420
Thinking can be temporary but feeling is permanent and not emotional

266
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,480
but is the feeling on your Central Nervous System.

267
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:26,440
It's such a relationship of brotherhood and sisterhood develops because this is a Universal being

268
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:34,440
which is enlightening your whole life and you are completely changed. You are surprised at yourself.

269
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:44,040
Your temper, your greed, your lust - all these things absolutely drop out and you see

270
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:53,200
clearly, what is your need, what you need to be spiritually alright -

271
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,340
you seek your comfort of your Spirit.

272
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:05,020
You become extremely dynamic, extremely creative and extremely compassionate.

273
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,400
You will be surprised, when I went to Russia first,

274
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:19,220
there were 25 Germans who came rushing to Russia. You won't believe, if you see those German sahaja yogis

275
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:27,340
you won't believe they are from the same Gestapo or nothing. They are so gentle, the gentlest of all people, I think,

276
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,180
so gentle they are. So was amazed, I said, "How is it you are all here?"

277
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:40,180
He said, "Mother, are we not duty bound to rectify ourselves

278
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:48,000
of these people who have suffered on account of our forefathers?"

279
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:56,320
I went to Canada, I was surprised, there's Canadian told Me, Canadian sahaja yogis - very surprising,

280
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,720
"Mother, don't You think we have been plunderers?" I said, "Why?" "We came to Canada,

281
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:10,380
we plundered them, we have taken away their lands, we have killed all of them and now we are nicely settled down here as great people.

282
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,180
We are the worst. We are not only migrants but we are the worst. We are the plunderers.

283
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,900
We came in their land and plundered them."

284
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:31,080
This awakening, this awareness is very rare. I was so surprised that they should think that way that, "We have plundered

285
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:36,020
these people. We have no business to take away all their lands."

286
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:42,740
Said, "At least some part must be given to them as their own. They don't own any land while the whole thing belongs to them."

287
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:48,560
I was surprised at the Spanish in South America; They felt the same thing.

288
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,360
All of them feel the same way about it. They said, "What about the Spaniards who came here?

289
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:02,680
What they have done to America. To South America and to North America, they are all these Spaniards

290
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:09,960
and then others who came and plundered these people, killed them, finished them, took away all their land and now

291
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:17,460
these people have no place to go to." This awareness, I was so shocked.

292
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:24,940
How could they get this awareness into their head? This comes when you think that we have something to do

293
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:31,280
for these people who are downtrodden. Because of us they are downtrodden. We have to help them

294
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:38,640
to raise them at a higher level. So the attention goes to the poor, attention goes to the downtrodden,

295
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,760
the attention goes to the people who don't have and when attention goes it works out,

296
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,800
it definitely works out and their solutions come out.

297
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:57,880
After all, we cannot live with prosperity if there is poverty anywhere.

298
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:06,220
We can never live. There will be complications, there will be problems so we have to think about universal understanding

299
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,720
and that communism is not the, is the solution, neither capitalism but sahaja yoga.

300
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,880
In sahaja yoga you start feeling oneness with everyone

301
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,400
and if people who get realization,

302
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:27,740
they feel such oneness, such understanding, such love, such friendship, such help

303
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,920
I'm amazed at them. Such beautiful people they are!

304
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:42,380
I mean, it's alright, I don't take money, after all I come from a rich family; We have lots of money of our own

305
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,360
but what about these sahaja yogis who don't take a single pie from anyone, work so hard.

306
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,640
They have being going all round Australia and working it out and quietly -

307
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:59,880
it's not advertise, "We do not claim anything," - nothing. Very quietly they are working it out.

308
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:08,860
And this is something one has to realize that this new race has to come

309
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:15,600
or if you want to go on with what sort of a world we had then,

310
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,380
we might have a war, we might all get finished - anything is possible.

311
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:26,580
Because that is ignorance but when there is light, we start seeing

312
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,860
the whole relationship. Supposing, it all becomes dark and you all start running helter and skelter

313
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:42,720
you'll trample on other people, you'll jump on other people, you may not know what to do - that's what happens when the stampede take place.

314
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:50,040
So the quietitude inside, the balance inside,

315
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:58,040
is achieves it's enlightenment and that's what has to happen to all of us.

316
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:03,620
Is a very important thing that is happening all over the world.

317
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:11,700
I saw so many people walking in, people walking and I felt what is their direction,

318
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,140
what is the purpose of their life, where are they going?

319
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:25,720
We all have a purpose, we all have a meaning and we have all that glory and beauty within ourselves.

320
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:32,840
Now if it is free, if it is your own, why not express that Divinity

321
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:42,060
fully and manifest it? So, this is some of the aspects of

322
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:50,440
Spirit, I have told you. The aspect of this All-Pervading power

323
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,780
is tremendous and miraculous. If I tell you, You won't believe

324
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,780
but somehow it works out.

325
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,520
It works out, it knows how to work it out.

326
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:15,040
When you are in the Kingdom of God - it's not the Kingdom of Australia, India or England -

327
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,260
it's such an efficient government

328
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:25,300
that any problem you have, anything you have just solves in no time.

329
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:35,820
It is so blissful. You'll be amazed how everything works out,

330
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:44,560
how enemies become friends, how families become one, how children respect their parents

331
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:50,200
and parents love their children. All misunderstandings vanish.

332
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:59,060
And this new generation is really so special, I must say, that we all should aspire

333
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,020
to be there to enjoy. May God bless you!

334
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:16,520
[APPLAUSE]

335
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:27,200
No questions? Nobody has given questions in writing

336
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,640
so far? Yes.

337
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,280
You've given in writing?

338
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:49,420
- [UNCLEAR - ALL MY BRAIN?] there is fire - why?
- No, no it's not fire

339
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:56,680
When I meditate, I get a feeling as if I'm in flames.

340
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:02,960
- What's it?
- He says when he meditates

341
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:09,280
- he gets a sensation of being on fire, in flames.
- Oh, that's not. Then the meditation something wrong.

342
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:14,240
There's something wrong with your meditation definitely. It is just shown as your heart

343
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:21,300
and to show the warmth of the heart they have put the color - it's not fire. Just the warmth of the heart.

344
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:27,220
They have to show this color just to show this not; It's on the contrary extremely cooling.

345
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:33,920
In sahaja yoga, when you will meditate, heart is the first thing that cools down.

346
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:43,320
So the meditation you're doing is in a way not correct and you cannot do meditation - you have to be in meditation;.

347
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,220
That's the point is. So when the Kundalini rises, she creates

348
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:57,720
a state of thoughtless awareness. That is the state one has to achieve.

349
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:06,920
Then you are stationed in your present - not in the past or the future.

350
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:15,360
I think, you're not here yesterday I told about it but in any case, you come and see. Just now only, you will see that you will

351
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:23,380
have a very soothing feeling within yourself. So, there is no fire at all. It's a very

352
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,100
soothing flames, extremely soothing.

353
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:35,400
In the Bible it's written, "I will appear before you like tongues of flames."

354
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:40,620
Now, these tongues of flames, if you see, they are, they are flames,

355
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:47,280
look like flames but they are very soothing, cooling.

356
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,920
It's just the opposite what we know of fire.

357
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:11,960
How do You trigger the awakening of the Kundalini?

358
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:23,340
- How can You trigger the awakening of the Kundalini?
- That's what we are going to do now. Very good question! I'm happy to know.

359
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,500
- That's very good.
- There was one question, Shree Mother
- Annh?

360
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:36,480
- There was a question. There was a family with two children.
- Hmm
-  who cannot speak. I wonder what the problem was.

361
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:43,040
They have to come to the ashram then we'll try on them because there were a family in India also

362
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:48,940
whose children never spoke but they have started speaking now. They should come to our ashram - we'll work it out.

363
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:58,540
We can solve all this problem if you come to the collective and these things can be solved. It's not so difficult.

364
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:04,000
But depends on. If it is something from

365
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:11,340
the very childhood or  birth or something, then sometimes doesn't work out. It is worth trying. You see, like

366
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:15,720
any medicine you cannot guarantee hundred percent, you cannot say hundred percent

367
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,720
but most of the diseases are cured. Specially incurable diseases are cured, no doubt.

368
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:32,560
[INAUDIBLE]

369
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:41,360
[INAUDIBLE]

370
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:48,040
[INAUDIBLE]

371
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:01,360
When he is in meditation, Shree Mataji, he feels very thoughtlessly aware

372
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:07,080
- hmm
- but when he is at work and perhaps things are going too well,

373
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,980
then he loses this - he wonders why?

374
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:21,560
See, it is question of your connection being established fully

375
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:27,600
Supposing, this connection is not alright, you have to just establish it; That's the point.

376
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:34,060
With little assiduity you should establish this connection. Once it is established, then you will never go down.

377
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:43,000
That's the main thing that you should try to achieve the state of doubtless awareness.

378
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:50,300
Takes hardly [UNCLEAR]. Some people only in three, four sittings they do it. Some people take one month

379
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:57,460
but most of them get by one month - they are there. So one has to work it out.

380
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:20,280
- I'll see.
- He says, "Shree Mataji, I'm frightened to get close to people,

381
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:25,940
I'm frightened to see my own death. I have..."

382
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:34,860
- So I'll understand. That's why he's written it down, so we should not read. Now this can be solved, my child, alright? -

383
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,200
because this is the power of love.

384
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:46,600
Alright? This is nothing difficult, very simple.

385
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:52,980
It's due to some conditionings in your life, maybe. Yes?

386
00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:02,480
[INAUDIBLE] when they are restricted by dogma and [UNCLEAR]

387
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:08,940
[INAUDIBLE]

388
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:16,340
- How do you communicate with people who are bound by their dogma and belief?
- Who are?

389
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:23,280
Bound by dogma and belief. They are rigid in their beliefs.

390
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,680
See, love can melt anything - isn't it?

391
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:36,300
And there is a way. First you have to logically talk to them.

392
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:45,600
Divine logic is very convincing but if somebody is a stone, there is no need to break your head with the stone.

393
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:53,360
But logically you can explain and if they have dogmas

394
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:58,560
they will melt because you can ask them a simple question, "What did you get out of it?

395
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,400
What powers did you get out of it?"

396
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:09,860
A simple question should be asked and that's how the dogmas will fall.

397
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,240
But mostly it happens like this, I've seen, if there are

398
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:25,280
many friends and all family, everybody gets to sahaja yoga and they see the way they are,

399
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:32,300
then automatically they come. Mostly, dogmas are fashions - so it's a fashion

400
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:39,840
and these people who have dogmas are, people who do not seek Truth

401
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:47,620
but once they see also, sometimes they come but we cannot guarantee that everybody will be there.

402
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:56,160
According to John he just said 144 thousand - we have already crossed that limit; So I don't know.

403
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:01,680
how many will be there. It's a question of one's seeking

404
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:08,100
and also they have to deserve it; You should be worthy of it.

405
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:17,320
- Yes Madam? 
- [INAUDIBLE]

406
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:27,380
- Can sahaja yoga help someone with mental illness like Schizophrenia?
- Yes, it has helped many.

407
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:34,440
Schizophrenia is due to possessions which comes and goes. It has helped many people.

408
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:42,200
First the frequency starts enlarging and after some time you can get rid of it.

409
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:48,100
It has helped many people, I should say. Specially in America so many people are suffering from Schizophrenia -

410
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,340
it can be. Epilepsy, Schizophrenia - these two we have tried.

411
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,780
A [UNCLEAR - THREE?] questions here on meditation Shree Mataji.

412
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,200
- Is there any special position or place to meditate?
- No, nothing of the kind.

413
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:13,500
- How do you control the flow of thoughts as they keep flowing.
- Yes, that is what you don't have to do; Your Kundalini will do it.

414
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,340
Your Kundalini will create that situation for you. You don't have to do it.

415
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:28,280
And should I meditate on something? Should I meditate on something?

416
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:34,480
No, you don't have to meditate but best is that you have to come and see these people.

417
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:42,560
and they will tell you how to meditate. It's only minimum of five minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening. Not more than that.

418
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:50,420
It starts with five minutes but later on one can go on meditating for longer period; You start enjoying yourself.

419
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,560
[UNCLEAR - SEE THERE'S SOME?]

420
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:02,080
- How [UNCLEAR] Is there anything that you can [UNCLEAR]
- Yes

421
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:09,880
Yes it is curable. It is due to liver. It's a liver problem. Allergies are due to liver

422
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:16,060
but also it's triggering from the left side and so it can be cured; We have cured that.

423
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,960
It can be cured - alright? Yes.

424
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:39,180
Some people take more time and some people take less time but I've seen most of them get cured, most of them.

425
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:47,980
Seems to be a model of, of an intimate relationship with Supreme Intelligence.

426
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:55,620
You just mentioned possessions and things like that. Could You tell me more about that specifically?

427
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:05,880
He sees this as a immortal relationship with the Divine

428
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:12,040
You mentioned possessions, what did You mean by that?

429
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:19,820
Well that's another subject which I've not touched so far but we have on two sides, left side and right side, if you see.

430
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:26,300
The left side looks after our past and the right side looks after our future.

431
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:32,360
Left side is the power of our desire,

432
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:39,700
the right side is the power of our action. So when we start moving towards the left too much -

433
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:48,220
people are feeling sad and all the time crying and weeping and talking of their past and all sorts of

434
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:53,500
uh... depressions they get, then they start moving towards the left.

435
00:52:54,040 --> 00:53:01,000
On the left side is all your past, means your Subconscious - Subconscious of today

436
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:08,020
whatever has happened, subconscious of this month, of this year, then of this life

437
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,780
subconscious of previous life also, ultimately

438
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:19,400
there is the Collective Subconscious on the left hand side, where everything that is dead

439
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:26,320
since our creation, is stored up. If you enter into that area,

440
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:33,180
you might get possessed by viruses, so you get diseases which are caused by viruses

441
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:40,860
like cancer or you might get possessed and some people

442
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:47,920
can put - if you are a weak minded person also - can possess through mesmerism and things like that.

443
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:55,920
So this is the left side. The right side is where you start moving into future, very future

444
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:02,860
planning and all that, then you enter into Supra Conscious area and then into Collective Supra Conscious.

445
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:10,260
In that area you are possessed by people who are extremely ambitious, who died without fulfilling your ambitions

446
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:16,960
and they're making you very ambitious also and ultimately you become a recluse because you can't bear

447
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:25,820
so many personalities on top of one personality. So, in short I've told you but it's a very large subject.

448
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,140
So, Schizophrenia also is a kind of a possession

449
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:36,680
also all kind of mental problems are due to possessions which can be cured.

450
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:44,800
Only thing your attention has to be brought to the center and that is done by the Kundalini awakening.

451
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:50,900
Say, this is a sari of Mine like an attention and the Kundalini is coming up like that. So She pulls the sari

452
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:57,540
and when She pierces here, then the Divine light starts flowing

453
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:04,560
on all the sides of this attention. So only thing, if your attention is too much is on the left side,

454
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:11,860
you are in trouble or if too much on the right side, you become over-active,

455
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:19,520
very futuristic and you have other problems. Specially like liver problems you get, you get, what you call,

456
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,960
heart problems, you get asthma, also kidney problems

457
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:32,920
all these come from too much right sided behaviour, means very futuristic people get these troubles. Diabetes also comes to them.

458
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,480
A lady has a son who is nine years old

459
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:44,920
- who's had a skin disorder since he was a baby. Can Kundalini raising help that?
- What does he have?

460
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:50,340
- Just a skin disorder, Shree Mataji.
- Annh, what is it called?

461
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:59,080
Yeah, yeah. Yes, yes. This is alright, yes, this is alright.

462
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:06,040
We have some doctors luckily here, who are sahaja yogis. Very well-qualified doctors we have here,

463
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:10,100
who are sahaja yogis, you'll be surprised.

464
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:19,160
And thank God, in this country we can have alternate treatment. Of course, I mean, we don't give any medicines or anything so nobody can

465
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:22,800
charge us with anything but it works.

466
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:41,740
[UNCLEAR] it can't be real.

467
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:48,940
- What's he said?
- [UNCLEAR]
- It's a Christian, Shree Ma
- Annh?

468
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:56,860
- It is a Christian, Shree Mother.
- Annh? Are you a real Christian or just baptized by church?

469
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:06,360
A Christian must get his realization to understand Christ. How will you recognize Christ?

470
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:17,580
- [UNCLEAR]
- This Christianity has done no good to us, Sir.

471
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,480
[APPLAUSE]

472
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:28,220
Has done no good to us and if you belong to that, you can go ahead with it but if you want to have your realization, you can stay here.

473
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:35,360
If you are happy with Christians, you go. What about killing so many Azerbaijans - these Christians have done it.

474
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:43,640
Spaniards who went there, they were Christians only and the ones who ruled us for three hundred, were Christians. They were Christians

475
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:50,960
killing people? When did Christ teach you that? Christians are on the other side of Christ;

476
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,620
They have nothing to do with Christ - just talking big.

477
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:01,860
[APPLAUSE]

478
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:07,340
[APPLAUSE]

479
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:15,640
Hypnotism should never be encouraged. It is not alright. I've seen, all people who get into hypnosis

480
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:24,120
suffer quite a lot. There's no need to hypnotise. I just don't know why even the doctors should hypnotise people.

481
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:29,260
There's no need at all to hypnotise anyone.

482
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:38,780
Hunh

483
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:58,660
- How do I stay open to the way of God?
- Annh?
- How do I stay open to the way of God?

484
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:05,140
- Out of the way?
- No, in a way of God. How do I stay open to God.
- Unnh?

485
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:10,980
She's asking, "How do I stay open to the way to God?"

486
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:16,100
- [UNCLEAR]
- I think, through the raising of the Kundalini, Shree Mother.

487
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:21,960
You see, this is what I'm telling you that you have to have your .

488
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:31,680
Once you get your realization, then you are connected to God otherwise you are not connected. That's why, these people who

489
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:39,080
who say, "We are Christians, we are Muslims, we are this and that and that, " are no where - there's no religion there.

490
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:46,920
Once you get your realization, then you are in contact with this All-Pervading power.

491
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:58,560
Terrible things are happening. You must see what things are happening in Christian community;

492
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:06,040
It's terrible things. This is nothing. If you see in Canada there were, there was a school of some Bishops.

493
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:13,920
They abused the children regularly and now they are hundred arrest.

494
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:21,580
There are priests in Austria - it's a book on that - German language - who was,

495
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:29,140
who has confessed that most of the priests have keeps who are married women and they have children from them.

496
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:36,860
Can you imagine all these things happening in the name of Christ, who said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

497
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,220
How can they say they are Christians, I can't understand!

498
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:18,340
I just don't understand why they are behaving like this - I'm sorry.

499
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:28,660
But I love you very much - alright? You'll get all that love you never got. May God bless you!

500
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,700
[APPLAUSE]

501
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:38,520
Maybe they are, some of them are really demonic people, absolutely demonic.

502
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:46,460
In England, can you imagine, two children are killed by their parents. What is this child abuse nonsense going on? Can you,

503
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:51,880
I mean, impossible to understand for any body who is a human-being.

504
01:01:52,540 --> 01:02:00,260
How can you torture your children like this! Two children are killed by every week by the parents, who are legal children.

505
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:08,540
They have no patience for their children. That's the reason, I think, in India most of the children are born

506
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:15,120
and we are having a population problem. I just don't under... .

507
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:20,700
How could you do that to any child - anyone?

508
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:27,900
Thank God you are alive - alright? May God bless you!

509
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:35,700
- There's one here, Shreee Mataji
- Such cruelties! From where does it come  in this and mostly they are Christians!

510
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:44,220
And Christ has said, "Let the children come to me." If you have to go to the Kingdom of God, you have to become like children.

511
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:52,100
Where is that love that He talked about - just money-makers?

512
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:05,320
Alright, this part is of diet and exercises and all that;

513
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:11,220
We will tell you when you will come because according to the centers, we'll tell you.

514
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:17,940
Supposing you are a liver patient, you are right-sided, you have to take a diet. If you are left-sided, you have to take a diet.

515
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:24,520
But that we'll tell you when you come to us, very clearly and you will really enjoy your health.

516
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:35,020
Where is this dogma fellow is going? Come along.

517
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:41,740
Now don't ask any more questions. I think we have had enough, now people must be tired - alright?

518
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:50,960
What the effect of? I think, there's too many questions

519
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:59,620
- Only Sydney people are very questioning type, I think
- There's a young lass who's just saying that, "Is it true that the human

520
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:05,580
- being is entering a new phase in it's evolution to Spirituality."
- Of course, of course, you've seen the point

521
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:11,660
What she said is true that, "We are entering into a new evolutionary phase," - that's it.

522
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:19,360
[APPLAUSE] You have seen the point.

523
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:25,980
Let us see how many want to enter into it. Yeah.

524
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:34,660
Now, I think, see all these personal questions, all these questions can be very easily answered - everything

525
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:40,620
but as I told you, "I want to ask Me questions," because you are free to ask - it's complete freedom

526
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:48,160
but also you know, should know that I've been doing this kind of a job for the last

527
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:51,700
21 - 22 years, so I'm quite an expert Myself

528
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:58,540
and I know the style of questions and what they ask but the main thing is now

529
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:07,020
is that, it's a mental feat. What we have to have, our Kundalini awakening for that,

530
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,560
this mental feat is not necessary.

531
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:19,180
So, even if I answer your questions alright, there's no guarantee that your Kundalini will rise.

532
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:24,660
So, forget about all these questions and answers and everything - even My lecture you can forget, if you want to,

533
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:29,820
and just now we will have our session of realization.

534
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:47,080
So before we start, as I told yesterday, again

535
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:51,560
I have to tell you because some people are absolutely new today

536
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:59,400
that there are three conditions which you have to fulfill. The first condition is

537
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:07,300
that you have to be absolutely confident about yourself

538
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:15,440
that you will get your realization - absolutely confident. You shouldn't doubt yourself at all, whatever you might have done.

539
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:24,040
That's for sure. Be confident all of you that you will get your realization.

540
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:34,180
The second condition is that, please do not feel guilty at all at this point

541
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:38,580
for anything - please don't feel guilty.

542
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:47,440
Meaning, forget your past, you are here in the present and in My eyes and in the eyes of the Divine, you are not guilty.

543
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:56,640
See, after all, as I said yesterday, we are all human-beings and if we have done any mistakes, it's alright - we are not Gods.

544
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:02,540
So please don't feel guilty for anything, whatsoever.

545
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:08,300
When you feel guilty you catch on the center, on the left side, here,

546
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:16,240
which is a very risky thing. You don't know with that catching you get, what you call,

547
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:24,560
a disease called angina, you get also spondylitis,

548
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:28,500
also your organs might become lethargic.

549
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:38,500
So please don't feel guilty; It's a dangerous thing physically also.

550
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:45,500
We'll explain to you, later on, how it happens but just now please listen to Me. Don't feel guilty.

551
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:54,840
And thirdly, which is also a very simple condition, is that you have to forgive everyone

552
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:00,440
in general. Some people say, it's very difficult

553
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:07,860
but logically, whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything; You do anything? Nothing.

554
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,800
But when you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands.

555
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:19,360
You torture yourself while the person who has troubled you is very very happy and you are torturing on his behalf.

556
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:24,500
But the worst thing is that this center Agnya - this one is like this - crossed;

557
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:32,920
It won't open like this - it has to open otherwise the Kundalini won't pass through unless and until you forgive.

558
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:41,280
And you don't even have to think about them because it's sometimes very painful to even think about them.

559
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,260
Just have to say in your heart, "I forgive all of them."

560
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:53,180
You'll feel much lighter. Immediately you'll feel lighter. You just say, "I forgive all of them." Forget it, forget the past.

561
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:01,260
In short, you should be very pleasantly placed to yourself that you're human-beings, that you are seekers of Truth

562
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:05,820
and that you are going to enter into the Kingdom of God.

563
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:12,740
So you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself; In Sanskrit they say, "Prasannachitt."

564
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:21,540
that is going to help us very much. Now this Kundalini is the power of pure desire

565
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:30,200
so you must have pure desire within yourself that you want to have Self-realization - that's all.

566
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:36,420
If that desire is there, it will all work out.

567
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:51,960
But in any case, even if you get realization, you must remember this is the beginning

568
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:58,100
and you have to develop this sprouting into a tree.

569
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:06,200
For that, you don't have to pay anything. It can work out very easily but you have to come to the collective.

570
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:10,680
This is the only thing you have to do for your cleansing

571
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:18,820
for anything, you have to be just in the collective - it's so simple. You don't have to go to Himalayas, you don't have to stand on your feet, one foot

572
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:24,380
or on your head - nothing of the kind - you don't have to starve, sacrifice, suffer, nothing.

573
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:32,820
Only thing you have to take some time out to be in the collective and they will tell you what sort of meditation you require

574
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:39,580
as your problem may be - please do that. Next year I want, at least, all of you

575
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:46,860
to be grown up like very matured, beautiful, personalities of sahaja yoga -

576
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:57,300
absolutely knowledgeable. So, these are very simple, three conditions I have told you.

577
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,840
Now, you have to take out your shoes because this Mother Earth helps us a lot.

578
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:31,100
Both the feet have to be apart from each other because I told you left and right are two different powers.

579
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:43,100
One thing I must confess, that I cannot force Self-realization on you. You have to ask for it;

580
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:50,960
I respect your freedom. If you do not want to have it then you should leave the hall

581
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:58,600
but should not sit down here and watch other people - it's not civil. So those who want to have their Self-realization,

582
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:06,620
should be here,  those who do not want to have, should leave the hall; It will be very kind of them to do that

583
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:10,700
but those who want to have it, are very welcome

584
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:15,360
So now, please put your left hand towards Me, like this,

585
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:20,520
which means that you are desirous of having Self-realization.

586
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:35,220
Now, you have to put

587
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:45,460
your right hand on your heart because right hand is the power of action and in the heart resides the Spirit.

588
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:54,420
So, first we put our right hand on our heart. With this hand we are going to enrich

589
01:12:55,480 --> 01:13:02,180
our centers with our full Self-confidence

590
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:07,720
If you are the Spirit, you are

591
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:15,820
the guide, you become in that light the guide of your life

592
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:24,320
so you become the master. So now, take your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side

593
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,500
- you're only working on the left hand side.

594
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,300
Now, this center is for your mastery, is created by the great prophets

595
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:40,500
and great real masters in the ancient times, which is to be enlightened.

596
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:46,840
Then you take your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

597
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:53,540
is the center of pure knowledge.

598
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:59,220
Pure knowledge, is the knowledge of

599
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:04,400
the Divine laws and how to work them out.

600
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:14,140
Now, you move your right hand, in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side, again

601
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:20,520
and again you have to move your right hand on your heart.

602
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:30,920
Now in the corner of your left shoulder and neck

603
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:40,280
and turn your head to your right, as far as possible. I've already told you about this center

604
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,480
that if you feel guilty, this goes out of order

605
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:52,660
and it's, I think, today again, I feel, there is a lot of it here, so please,

606
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:57,500
forgive yourself and don't feel guilty.

607
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:07,220
Now, you have to take your right hand on top of your forehead in such a manner, that your fingers on one side

608
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:14,900
and thumb on the other side of the temple and put down your head slowly, as far as possible.

609
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:22,720
Here, you have to ask or you have to say

610
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:29,000
that you are forgiving everyone, in general.

611
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:36,820
Now, take back your right hand on the back side of your head - just now you don't have to say anything - later on

612
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:42,900
Now here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes

613
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:53,820
for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power.

614
01:15:54,300 --> 01:16:00,800
We'll do that later on, I'm just showing you now. Now, stretch your hand fully - right hand -

615
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:07,200
left hand on your lap comfortably. Now here,

616
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:15,100
is the seventh center, which you have to open out with your self-confidence

617
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:23,560
Stretch your palm fully, put it on top of the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood.

618
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:31,900
Now, put down your head. This is the actualisation of your baptism - is actualisation

619
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:37,480
Put down your head and now move your scalp.

620
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:46,840
With the fingers stretched out, you can have a good pressure; Please stretch out your fingers - this is very important - put down your head

621
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:55,300
and now you have to move your scalp, very slowly, seven times clockwise, seven times clockwise.

622
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:23,660
That's all we'll have to do, that's all.

623
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:34,180
Now you have to sit, not very uncomfortably but very comfortably, little straight

624
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:38,900
not bending too much and not bending forward to begin with.

625
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:45,280
You can take out your spectacles, if you want because in any case you have to close your eyes

626
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:50,520
so, better take out your spectacles and don't open your eyes till I tell you.

627
01:17:52,220 --> 01:18:00,220
I hope you have put your both feet apart from each other. No, please put your right hand on your heart

628
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:07,080
and now please close your eyes, not very tightly

629
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:12,720
just in a simple way as we sleep. Here now,

630
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:21,640
you can call Me Mother or you can call Me Shree Mataji, whatever you feel like.

631
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:28,160
You have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself;

632
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:37,440
three times, please ask, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

633
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,320
Ask this question three times, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

634
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:59,000
If you are the Spirit, you are your master, so now, please

635
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:06,940
take down your right hand, in the upper portion of the abdomen, on the left hand side and here you ask another question

636
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:16,780
"Mother, am I my own master," ask three times please,

637
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:20,900
"Mother, am I my own master?"

638
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:41,880
I've already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

639
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:47,960
So now, please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen

640
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:59,740
and press it hard and here you have to say six times because

641
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:06,600
this center has got six petals, so you have to say six times,

642
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:14,860
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge." Six times you have to ask

643
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:41,320
When you asked for pure knowledge, your Kundalini starts moving upward

644
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:47,380
so we have to nourish our upper centers with our full confidence.

645
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:56,540
So now, raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, press it

646
01:20:57,180 --> 01:21:01,260
and please here you say twelve times

647
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:11,100
with full confidence in yourself, "Mother, I am my own master."

648
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:21,220
Please say it with full confidence, "Mother, I am my own master."

649
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:40,580
So now, one has to understand

650
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:50,000
that the fundamental truth about you is, that you are not this body, not this mind,

651
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:57,160
not this ego, not this conditionings nor this intelligence

652
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:03,260
and not these emotions but you are the Pure Spirit.

653
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:10,460
So now, raise your right hand on to your heart

654
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:21,320
and here again with full confidence please say twelve times,

655
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:29,020
"Mother, I am the Pure Spirit." Please say it

656
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:34,400
with full confidence, twelve times,

657
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:40,300
"Mother, I am the Pure Spirit."

658
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:58,240
Now, raise your right hand on -

659
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:09,140
to say it, first, twelve times - you haven't said it

660
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:26,920
on to the corner of your neck and your shoulder

661
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:35,660
and turn your head to your right. Here you have to say sixteen times, with full confidence,

662
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:44,500
"Mother, I am not guilty at all. Mother, I am not guilty at all."

663
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:52,040
You have to know that this All-Pervading Power of God's love

664
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:58,920
is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of compassion

665
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:06,420
is the ocean of bliss but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness

666
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:14,580
and whatever mistakes you have committed can be easily dissolved by this ocean

667
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:21,620
of forgiveness. So please, forgive yourself and say with full confidence, sixteen times,

668
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:25,380
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

669
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:36,120
If you do not say it from your heart, this center won't open to allow the Kundalini to rise.

670
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:40,140
So have faith in Me and faith in yourself.

671
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:48,220
Now, take your right hand on top of your forehead across

672
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:52,380
with the fingers on one side and thumb on the other side

673
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:58,320
and now try to put your head down, as far as possible.

674
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:05,580
Here again, with full confidence, you have to say

675
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:14,540
from your heart, not how many times, from your heart - this is very important -

676
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:19,280
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

677
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:28,100
I've already told you, that if you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything but if you don't forgive now,

678
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:35,040
the Kundalini won't rise so please, forgive all of them without even thinking about them.

679
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:45,740
Now, take back your right hand

680
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:51,200
to the back side of your head and push back your head, as far as possible.

681
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:58,860
Here without feeling guilty,

682
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:06,460
without counting your mistakes - just for your satisfaction,

683
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:14,100
please say, "Oh, Divine power,

684
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:22,820
if I've done anything wrong, knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

685
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:30,120
Say it again from your heart, not how many times, "Oh Divine power,

686
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:38,660
if I have done anything wrong, knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

687
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:55,400
Now, now the last chakra is very important.

688
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Please stretch your hand and stretch your palm fully.

689
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:10,500
Please stretch your palm fully and put it on top of your fontanel bone area,

690
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:18,160
which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now, please stretch your fingers backwards.

691
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:26,220
Please stretch your fingers backwards, as much as you can - this is important - and now put down your head

692
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:32,500
as far as possible. Here again, I cannot

693
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:40,000
cross over your freedom because I respect it, so you have to ask for

694
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:44,320
your Self-realization - I cannot force on you.

695
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,300
So now, you move your scalp seven times, slowly,

696
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:57,280
clockwise, saying seven times, "Mother, please give me my Self-realization."

697
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:06,820
[SHREE MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

698
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:15,920
[SHREE MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

699
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:23,020
[SHREE MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

700
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:28,340
[SHREE MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

701
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:33,920
[SHREE MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

702
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:40,620
[SHREE MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

703
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:47,040
[SHREE MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

704
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:53,920
Now please take down your hands. Please open your eyes.

705
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:58,300
Put your hands towards Me like this

706
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:04,540
and watch Me without thinking. Watch Me without thinking.

707
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:19,780
Now please, put the right hand towards Me like this, put down your head

708
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:26,620
and see for yourself, if there is a cool or a warm or hot

709
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:33,540
air like waves, breeze is coming out of

710
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:39,600
your fontanel bone area. Now don't put your hand on top of your head

711
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:45,780
but away from it and see for yourself, if there is a cool breeze coming

712
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:53,020
or a warm breeze or some sort of a hot breeze is coming

713
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:57,500
out of your own head. Some people get it little far away.

714
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:08,040
Now, with the left hand, now you put it towards Me, like this. Now put down your

715
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:13,380
head again, please and see for yourself, if there is,

716
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:20,320
if there is, a cool or a warm or a hot

717
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:27,480
breeze coming like waves out of your own fontanel bone area.

718
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:36,720
Now again once with your right hand. Please

719
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:45,800
put down your head and see for yourself, if there is

720
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:52,720
cool, warm or hot breeze coming

721
01:30:53,140 --> 01:31:01,020
out of your fontanel bone area. If it is hot, means you have not forgiven

722
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:10,340
Please forgive, now please forgive everyone - you are not going to miss your Self-realization.

723
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:15,980
Alright.

724
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:25,340
Keep away from the head. If you keep on top, you won't feel. Now, please put both the hands towards the sky

725
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:29,480
and push back your head and here

726
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:45,360
you ask a question three times. One question you ask three times;

727
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:50,120
Anyone of these three questions which I tell you.

728
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:59,100
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" "Mother, is this the

729
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:07,540
All-Pervading Power of God's love?" or "Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya?"

730
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:14,160
Ask anyone of these questions three times.

731
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:26,780
Now, please put down your heads, put down your hands.

732
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:32,280
Now, put both the hands towards Me like this.

733
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:43,180
Those who have felt cool, warm or hot breeze out of their fontanel bone area

734
01:32:43,620 --> 01:32:50,520
or on their finger-tips or on their hands, please raise both your hands.

735
01:32:55,240 --> 01:33:00,600
Ahhh, you got it all of you! May God bless you!

736
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:07,540
May God... This is what you are feeling for the first time this All-Pervading power - first time.

737
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:14,260
First time you are feeling. You have never felt it before. I bow to you,

738
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:19,880
to all of you now, your saintly life has started but I again and again request you

739
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:28,960
that whenever I'm there, there are crowds and many people come in but there are very few who really try to become

740
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:35,180
what they have to become. Sahaja yoga cannot be a certificate - it's a becoming.

741
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:41,120
It's very important at this time of evolutionary phase that we are in,

742
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:44,600
is a great responsibility upon all of us,

743
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:50,240
to become the Spirit and transform the whole world.

744
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:57,100
and help the whole world to solve it's problems. May God bless you all!

745
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:04,380
[APPLAUSE]

746
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:09,640
[APPLAUSE]

747
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:24,920
Like yesterday, all those who have not felt, can come on this side but I'll take your leave, if you don't mind.

748
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:28,720
I've to do some cooking for sahaja yogis today.

749
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:39,120
When you leave the hall, there is a pamphlet here which tells you about the follow-up program here in the Town Hall

750
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:46,020
on Friday, the 6th of March 7:30pm, in the lower Town Hall - the Peace Hall.

751
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:52,880
It also has information on various centers around Sydney

752
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:57,700
so if you want more information or you want to proceed with what you received tonight,

753
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:02,800
there are many people, in many districts, who can give you a hand to do so.

754
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:08,220
So this you find at the entrance you came in.
