Public Program The Nabhi Chakra

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,360
New Delhi – India January 31, 1983

4
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:56,999
The music was very fine and elevating to all of you.

5
00:16:00,514 --> 00:16:03,837
The effect of music in Sahaja Yoga is tremendous,

6
00:16:04,803 --> 00:16:07,225
and if a Sahaja Yogi sings the song

7
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:15,327
it's so great that it acts like a mantra upon My being.

8
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:20,705
So I'm very thankful to Mrs. Venogopalan

9
00:16:21,926 --> 00:16:25,860
for singing such a beautiful song today. It stirred Me completely.

10
00:16:27,316 --> 00:16:33,594
Then Gavin Brown was very sweet. He's an Englishman, very gentle

11
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,928
and a very steady Sahaja Yogi.

12
00:16:37,282 --> 00:16:40,938
He's one of the first Western Sahaja Yogis

13
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,938
I met.

14
00:16:46,556 --> 00:16:52,116
Today I will tell you about the Nabhi Chakra which deals

15
00:16:52,365 --> 00:16:55,046
with this honesty of seeking.

16
00:16:58,156 --> 00:17:03,006
Nabhi Chakra is the center which controls

17
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:07,747
or manifests outside in the gross as

18
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:17,695
Solar Plexus. Nabhi Chakra has two sides: one is the left,

19
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:21,750
another the right, and one in the center.

20
00:17:24,437 --> 00:17:27,521
So on the left hand side is the Gruha Lakshmi,

21
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,557
on the right hand side is the Raja Lakshmi

22
00:17:30,602 --> 00:17:35,294
or Gaja Lakshmi and in the center is the Lakshmi

23
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:37,709
which ascends into Mahalakshmi.

24
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:55,923
When the seeking starts, a human being

25
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:00,247
first starts seeking food.

26
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:08,352
Food is very important for all the animals. If they have no food

27
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:19,771
then they cannot exist. So the seeking starts

28
00:18:20,602 --> 00:18:27,972
with food, and when the shelter is sought, they try to find the water.

29
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,114
So this center is made of water

30
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:52,677
and in this center resides the Deity of Shri Vishnu or Narayana;

31
00:18:58,023 --> 00:19:05,428
and His power, as I told you, is Lakshmi and then Mahalakshmi.

32
00:19:07,705 --> 00:19:09,705
You will find out in Sahaja Yoga

33
00:19:10,944 --> 00:19:17,944
that gradually you start developing one power and then the other.

34
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:23,817
Everyone who comes to Sahaja Yoga, if they are truthful

35
00:19:24,891 --> 00:19:29,007
and not involved with any wrong things,

36
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:34,657
then definitely they are helped in Lakshmi Tattwa,

37
00:19:34,997 --> 00:19:37,958
means their well-being is looked after.

38
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,465
As Krishna has said, "yogakshema vahaamya."

39
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,670
So He looks after the kshema part of it.

40
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,162
Everyone who has been to Sahaja Yoga

41
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,380
has been helped miraculously

42
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:54,937
also in the Lakshmi Tattwa, that means materially.

43
00:19:56,348 --> 00:19:58,308
In so many ways they are helped,

44
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,489
that one has to just see for themselves

45
00:20:00,953 --> 00:20:03,573
how these miracles take place.

46
00:20:04,485 --> 00:20:13,433
An example is of a villager who had a small little holding of land

47
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:20,486
and he was living hand to mouth every day.

48
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,645
When he came to Me, after some time I found

49
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:27,711
he would bring one garland,

50
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:30,155
big garland, for Me every evening.

51
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:33,812
And he was away in the village every day he would attend My program.

52
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:40,227
I was quite surprised that how could he afford it, and I asked him,

53
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:44,431
"How can you afford a garland for Me every day?

54
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:46,186
You shouldn't bring it, it's not proper."

55
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:49,975
So he said, "Mother, You know everything."

56
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,819
I said, "Why, what happened?"

57
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:57,893
He said, "I have a plot of land next to mine

58
00:20:57,952 --> 00:21:01,448
which we never used because it was absolutely a barren land -

59
00:21:01,576 --> 00:21:06,483
little bit, not much big land, but a small land, piece of land.

60
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:11,194
And after Realization I used to always go

61
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:14,909
walk over it bare feet to plough this little

62
00:21:15,203 --> 00:21:16,945
piece of land that I had.

63
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:22,387
After some time when I was coming here after that,

64
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,957
one gentleman came to see me and he said that

65
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,936
“This piece of land that you have is very precious.“

66
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,996
He said, “What's the problem?” He said that

67
00:21:33,134 --> 00:21:41,240
“I have a kiln of bricks, and I have seen that even

68
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:49,920
by chance – Sahaja - we mixed a little clay from this soil,

69
00:21:50,003 --> 00:21:54,793
from this part of the land that you have,

70
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:59,808
and we found that our bricks have become so good and so strong

71
00:22:00,408 --> 00:22:01,999
that we would like to purchase

72
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:06,664
this clay from you at the price of seers."

73
00:22:08,314 --> 00:22:10,929
And that's how he started getting money sufficient

74
00:22:10,986 --> 00:22:17,061
for him and he became much better off.

75
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:21,736
But in Sahaja Yoga one has to remember you don't go to extremes,

76
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:23,685
in any principle.

77
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:27,297
That is one thing people should know, that you don't go to extremes.

78
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:31,188
You don't become extremely rich.

79
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,645
I've seen those people who are extremely rich,

80
00:22:35,675 --> 00:22:37,789
when they come to Sahaja Yoga, they are a big headache,

81
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:41,465
very big headache. If they are sick,

82
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:44,235
if you cure them of their heart trouble,

83
00:22:45,773 --> 00:22:47,601
then they try to possess you.

84
00:22:48,355 --> 00:22:50,722
They will get all the heart patients, they will get

85
00:22:50,764 --> 00:22:52,375
all kinds of patients to you,

86
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:55,373
you go on tolerating it, they try to possess you.

87
00:22:55,651 --> 00:22:57,899
They immediately start talking about their cures

88
00:22:57,932 --> 00:23:00,448
to everyone, they publish in papers, this thing, that thing,

89
00:23:00,844 --> 00:23:04,593
it's impossible. And they just try to overpower you.

90
00:23:04,698 --> 00:23:05,788
Without any appointment

91
00:23:05,806 --> 00:23:08,766
they'll arrive and they would expect you to attend to them immediately,

92
00:23:08,786 --> 00:23:09,793
it's terrible.

93
00:23:13,606 --> 00:23:16,433
And then they’ll send all their relations for cure

94
00:23:17,891 --> 00:23:19,635
and you have to show all patience,

95
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,896
all their friends, they become like agents.

96
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:28,723
All their patients, all their relations, all their friends,

97
00:23:29,527 --> 00:23:32,981
they want to oblige them and spare

98
00:23:33,272 --> 00:23:36,210
no love, no affection, nothing further.

99
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:41,974
The Sahaja Yogis, if they try

100
00:23:42,224 --> 00:23:44,665
to say that “No, you shouldn't do like that and all that,"

101
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:46,182
they feel insulted.

102
00:23:48,322 --> 00:23:50,859
And they all try curing much faster

103
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,252
than anybody else does.

104
00:23:54,456 --> 00:23:55,517
They themselves are weak,

105
00:23:55,596 --> 00:23:57,031
they are sick people themselves,

106
00:23:57,518 --> 00:23:59,228
heart patient, this patient, that,

107
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:01,436
but if you tell them, “Don't cure,” they'll feel bad.

108
00:24:02,281 --> 00:24:03,194
If you don't tell them,

109
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,973
they'll get sick and you'll have another problem.

110
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,772
They never try to understand Sahaja Yoga in it's big way.

111
00:24:09,329 --> 00:24:16,602
They just want to see it according to their own way of ego

112
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:20,078
that they have accumulated with their money,

113
00:24:21,222 --> 00:24:24,310
and they never know how they go on hurting

114
00:24:24,762 --> 00:24:30,713
everyone by overpowering Me all the time.

115
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:35,208
It's very amazing, whenever I cure a rich man,

116
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:38,403
I've been wanting to run away from that person.

117
00:24:38,515 --> 00:24:41,812
I would never go to their house, I would not like to eat in their house.

118
00:24:41,975 --> 00:24:43,703
It's a very bad thing.

119
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:50,978
So too much of riches is also not okay

120
00:24:51,386 --> 00:24:54,402
because it gives you a tremendous

121
00:24:54,774 --> 00:24:56,536
ego that you don't see yourself,

122
00:24:56,539 --> 00:24:59,212
and anybody tries to say anything protect oneself,

123
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,993
then such a person feels insulted or humiliated.

124
00:25:03,742 --> 00:25:08,463
Not only that, but they try to hold Me and hold the whole thing

125
00:25:08,544 --> 00:25:13,082
according to their business ways which is impossible.

126
00:25:13,451 --> 00:25:14,927
See, they have to gain money,

127
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,441
they have another attitude because they are miserly.

128
00:25:18,556 --> 00:25:20,534
I don't have to earn money or anything.

129
00:25:20,856 --> 00:25:22,924
If I am doing anything, I’m, really,

130
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:25,043
in a way, I'm obliging. Isn't it?

131
00:25:26,184 --> 00:25:29,603
But they will force on Me all their rules and regulations, everything,

132
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:31,353
without having their own discipline.

133
00:25:32,104 --> 00:25:34,907
So very rich people in Sahaja Yoga

134
00:25:35,178 --> 00:25:39,469
so far have been extremely troublesome,

135
00:25:39,525 --> 00:25:42,892
I should say, to Me and to the whole organization.

136
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,990
They are very narrow-minded.

137
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:50,149
They cannot see the big vision that I have before Me.

138
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,280
Whatever little ideas they have about themselves and about their

139
00:25:55,446 --> 00:25:59,184
own thinking, reading, they will try to push onto Sahaja Yoga.

140
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,730
It's not My experience once, but many a times.

141
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:06,842
Then somehow or other it so happens that they drop out.

142
00:26:08,236 --> 00:26:12,186
So, too much richness gives you a tremendous ego, worse than

143
00:26:12,585 --> 00:26:15,198
even, I would say, a bulldog.

144
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:19,676
It’s impossible for a rich man to see

145
00:26:19,897 --> 00:26:24,377
that all these riches are outside him. They are not inside him.

146
00:26:25,306 --> 00:26:30,052
He has to be rich in heart to understand compassion.

147
00:26:30,161 --> 00:26:33,513
Compassion doesn't mean that you give alms to others,

148
00:26:33,698 --> 00:26:36,454
or if you give money to others, it's not that.

149
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,299
On the contrary, you just have beggars by doing that.

150
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,230
Compassion is that works,

151
00:26:46,435 --> 00:26:48,687
compassion is that flows,

152
00:26:50,112 --> 00:26:52,535
compassion is that manifests.

153
00:26:53,085 --> 00:26:56,817
It is not in compassion where you can make it materialize it,

154
00:26:56,846 --> 00:26:58,731
“All right, come along I'll give you a hundred rupees.”

155
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:03,750
On the contrary, giving somebody a hundred rupees is the worst thing.

156
00:27:05,212 --> 00:27:08,121
I have tried this with some Sahaja Yogis who were with Me.

157
00:27:08,813 --> 00:27:12,288
I tried to give them some money some time as they were very poor.

158
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:14,365
They became horrid.

159
00:27:17,024 --> 00:27:20,462
Some of them started drinking,

160
00:27:20,574 --> 00:27:22,943
some of them took to some other ways and they became

161
00:27:22,956 --> 00:27:25,542
sort of addicted to money. It was impossible.

162
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,592
And they tried to spoil as many Sahaj Yogis as they could.

163
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:36,029
So such people if they come, it's impossible to manage them.

164
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:40,542
They are not Sahaja Yogis because they are asahaja.

165
00:27:40,699 --> 00:27:44,249
They are still sticking to the idea that they have so much money,

166
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:48,816
that they are so rich and they can overpower everyone with money.

167
00:27:48,926 --> 00:27:50,926
Not Me, I'm sorry.

168
00:27:54,594 --> 00:28:01,998
But only thing I feel sorry for them that they cannot get to God.

169
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:08,592
There is no honesty of seeking in them, there is no honesty of seeking.

170
00:28:09,493 --> 00:28:12,621
The elite people whom I have addressed

171
00:28:12,637 --> 00:28:14,869
so many places like this, because

172
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:19,346
some people whom I have cured wanted Me to address the elite,

173
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:23,919
so-called. I think they are elated, to Me what they are.

174
00:28:24,018 --> 00:28:27,061
They don't want to be in Sahaja Yoga.

175
00:28:27,194 --> 00:28:29,543
They are already eliminated, I sometimes feel.

176
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,569
Thousands of them I've addressed, I've wasted My time with them.

177
00:28:33,726 --> 00:28:37,618
They are good for nothing, absolutely empty people.

178
00:28:41,185 --> 00:28:43,603
They are very happy because they have a few cars,

179
00:28:43,615 --> 00:28:45,615
or some houses or something like that.

180
00:28:46,526 --> 00:28:51,363
I too have all these things, I would say so-called riches.

181
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,691
I have always seen from My father's side

182
00:28:54,879 --> 00:28:56,686
and from My husband's side.

183
00:28:56,996 --> 00:29:00,818
I don't understand what is there to be proud of this emptiness.

184
00:29:01,046 --> 00:29:06,806
But human beings are such, a empty vessel makes a big sound,

185
00:29:07,449 --> 00:29:12,026
in the same way, an empty rich man makes a very big sound.

186
00:29:16,918 --> 00:29:21,126
Not that the very poor are also good,

187
00:29:21,774 --> 00:29:23,774
because those who are extremely poor

188
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:27,316
are busy with their food problems.

189
00:29:27,546 --> 00:29:30,752
They have little, little problems and their values are still have to

190
00:29:30,776 --> 00:29:32,097
come up to a point.

191
00:29:32,472 --> 00:29:35,876
It's only in the middle you can work out Sahaja Yoga better.

192
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,556
Those who are extremely rich and proud

193
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:42,581
cannot come to Sahaja Yoga easily.

194
00:29:42,758 --> 00:29:45,651
Those who are very poor also cannot come to Sahaja Yoga.

195
00:29:46,182 --> 00:29:52,489
But when this middle part of the river is enriched

196
00:29:52,676 --> 00:29:55,318
and starts flowing well, then it spreads on the sides

197
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:56,933
and then it can engulf.

198
00:29:57,134 --> 00:29:59,877
But you cannot  start it the other way round. I have tried.

199
00:30:00,187 --> 00:30:01,426
I have tried both ways

200
00:30:01,736 --> 00:30:03,088
and I have told you what happened.

201
00:30:03,214 --> 00:30:04,459
Whom I gave money,

202
00:30:05,065 --> 00:30:07,065
whom I tried to help through giving money

203
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:10,993
became wayward, useless, frivolous people,

204
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:17,009
got lost to Sahaja Yoga. And those whom I thought

205
00:30:17,027 --> 00:30:19,081
were moneyed and satisfied people

206
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:23,551
had another role to play is to possess Me all the time,

207
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:26,184
to use Me all the time whenever they wanted,

208
00:30:26,602 --> 00:30:30,124
for whatever purpose they wanted to use Me.

209
00:30:33,156 --> 00:30:37,261
And they must know, you cannot possess Me, you cannot possess Me,

210
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:40,510
but this kind of an ignorance

211
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,847
still in their minds is that they can possess God,

212
00:30:42,857 --> 00:30:44,017
they can possess everyone.

213
00:30:46,154 --> 00:30:52,269
For such people there are no reasons

214
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:55,331
to come to Sahaja Yoga, to be very frank.

215
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:58,112
And even if they come to Sahaja Yog

216
00:30:59,082 --> 00:31:03,390
they have to know that for Mother richness of heart,

217
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:05,949
understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

218
00:31:06,546 --> 00:31:10,702
humility, non-possessiveness are very important.

219
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:24,882
In this ascent of yours, money is not important at all.

220
00:31:25,994 --> 00:31:28,958
Even if you are poor or rich, you get your Realization.

221
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:34,532
For example, I went to Maharashtra, most of them are,

222
00:31:35,766 --> 00:31:38,663
I would say, very poor people

223
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:40,082
in the sense that

224
00:31:40,336 --> 00:31:43,343
they are not middle class at all. They are not educated,

225
00:31:44,006 --> 00:31:47,284
they are sometimes factory workers

226
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:52,606
or they have small holdings. Not very rich.

227
00:31:53,813 --> 00:31:56,987
But they are very good Sahaja Yogis, excellent Sahaja Yogis.

228
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,524
They have such beautiful eyes

229
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:04,544
and such beautiful feeling and such compassion

230
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:12,158
that Lakshmi Tattwa is absolutely balanced in them.

231
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:17,327
You know that Lakshmi is shown to be a lady,

232
00:32:18,231 --> 00:32:21,547
and lady who is a mother.

233
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:25,500
Mother doesn't care whether you are rich or poor.

234
00:32:26,286 --> 00:32:29,557
If her one son is rich and another is poor,

235
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:33,440
she'll pay more attention to the poor and ask the rich

236
00:32:33,563 --> 00:32:35,917
to give his money to the poor also.

237
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:39,983
She is not bothered. If somebody is in need,

238
00:32:40,173 --> 00:32:42,638
she will be the first to help the person who needs.

239
00:32:43,616 --> 00:32:47,302
Now this is a spiritual thing in the spiritual life.

240
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:50,292
The person who is a real seeker,

241
00:32:50,396 --> 00:32:54,354
who is a truthful seeker, the Mother will go out of the way

242
00:32:56,791 --> 00:33:00,679
to be with that person. And those who are not honest about it,

243
00:33:01,328 --> 00:33:03,882
Mother will try somehow or other cut them short.

244
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:14,842
The problem that lies with human beings is

245
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:17,899
that they do not know what they want.

246
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:21,859
They think they want first of all money.

247
00:33:22,885 --> 00:33:24,432
But those who have money,

248
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:26,127
they think they must have power.

249
00:33:26,363 --> 00:33:28,902
If they have too much money, they think that they must go into politics

250
00:33:29,328 --> 00:33:31,030
because they have had no power.

251
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:35,117
Then they fail in politics, or say they become too much in politics,

252
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:39,963
whatever it is, then they want love from their children

253
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,476
which they can't get, because they are too busy or something like that.

254
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:47,072
So they don't know what they want.

255
00:33:49,532 --> 00:33:52,991
Those who believe that by having money will be better off,

256
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:56,123
should listen to all these people who have come from affluent countries

257
00:33:56,152 --> 00:33:57,151
and they will tell you

258
00:33:57,414 --> 00:33:59,180
how things have gone wrong there,

259
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:01,701
how people are ruined, what's going wrong with them,

260
00:34:01,805 --> 00:34:04,365
absolutely they are in a bad shape.

261
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,762
You cannot call them human beings

262
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:12,311
because they are so cruel, they kill even their own children,

263
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:14,702
and that society tolerates such people.

264
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:17,456
In India if you hear somebody

265
00:34:17,697 --> 00:34:18,358
killing a child,

266
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:21,352
I have never heard so far in the sixty years of My life,

267
00:34:21,734 --> 00:34:25,833
but supposing you hear someone has killed his daughter or son,

268
00:34:26,013 --> 00:34:28,401
nobody will ever look at that person.

269
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:31,435
He will not be allowed in the society, nobody will even

270
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:36,423
give any girl in the marriage to

271
00:34:36,968 --> 00:34:40,740
his daughter or a son. He'll be absolutely barred from the society.

272
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:45,847
No one can think of such a relationship between children and parents.

273
00:34:46,946 --> 00:34:49,152
And then there are funny relationships also,

274
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,944
it's something so absurd,

275
00:34:51,184 --> 00:34:54,487
on both the sides on cruelty and on morality,

276
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:57,913
they are so absurd, it's impossible to understand.

277
00:34:58,669 --> 00:35:02,391
So money has given this ego and they say, “What's wrong?

278
00:35:03,952 --> 00:35:07,267
What’s wrong?” It's absolutely malignant attitude.

279
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:09,382
When you say, “What's wrong?” that means

280
00:35:09,756 --> 00:35:12,422
you do not want to keep your relationship with the whole.

281
00:35:14,435 --> 00:35:16,699
You do not want to keep your relationship

282
00:35:17,112 --> 00:35:24,678
with the Primordial One, the One who has you,

283
00:35:25,226 --> 00:35:29,304
everyone within Himself. You are part and parcel of the whole,

284
00:35:29,452 --> 00:35:31,126
and how can you say, “What's wrong?

285
00:35:31,235 --> 00:35:34,998
I do what I like.” You just become like a malignant cell.

286
00:35:37,518 --> 00:35:40,671
So at the Nabhi Chakra one has to know

287
00:35:41,135 --> 00:35:44,839
that one should not hanker after money too much.

288
00:35:46,135 --> 00:35:48,724
Now those who hanker too much after money,

289
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:56,855
may develop their right side better, they may have money, no doubt.

290
00:35:57,821 --> 00:36:02,210
But they miss their left side. Left side is Gruha Lakshmi,

291
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,416
they have no Gruha Lakshmi in their house.

292
00:36:05,721 --> 00:36:08,639
They are very hectic people, they run about,

293
00:36:08,726 --> 00:36:11,524
they run the rat race, they get heart attacks,

294
00:36:11,825 --> 00:36:15,109
if not heart attacks, they will get leukemia,

295
00:36:15,485 --> 00:36:19,775
they'll get diabetes, liver, all such things,

296
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:26,410
because their attention is on money and not on God.

297
00:36:26,982 --> 00:36:29,596
So either you are on the right or on the left.

298
00:36:33,452 --> 00:36:35,452
Those who are very emotional people,

299
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:39,419
extremely emotional, more worried about their family;

300
00:36:39,487 --> 00:36:41,446
for them family is everything,

301
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:44,262
the relations are everything, they are like that,

302
00:36:44,357 --> 00:36:46,801
they may not have so much of Lakshmi because they distribute

303
00:36:46,878 --> 00:36:52,715
all the Lakshmi. But still they are better people. But sometimes

304
00:36:53,205 --> 00:36:54,588
such people who sacrifice

305
00:36:54,636 --> 00:36:56,121
so much for others,

306
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:59,698
give up everything that they have, can become crazy

307
00:37:00,046 --> 00:37:03,524
because they’ll find people do not reciprocate,

308
00:37:03,946 --> 00:37:05,677
they do not return their love,

309
00:37:05,949 --> 00:37:07,965
they do not understand what they have done.

310
00:37:08,146 --> 00:37:11,563
So going to the extreme of helping others can cause

311
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:15,380
trouble to the person who does this job, and also trouble to people

312
00:37:15,544 --> 00:37:17,276
who have taken free money from him,

313
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:20,602
because if you distribute free money to people what will happen?

314
00:37:20,979 --> 00:37:24,648
I'll give you a simple example of America helping India.

315
00:37:26,885 --> 00:37:29,104
When Americans helped India,

316
00:37:29,252 --> 00:37:31,702
they thought they were doing a great favor to Indians,

317
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:34,584
which was a wrong thing. Because whatever they did

318
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:37,933
whatever they did was lost in the wilderness.

319
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:40,584
Nobody tried to maintain it, it was free.

320
00:37:43,084 --> 00:37:45,432
But by giving that they showed the contempt,

321
00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:51,398
and when they gave some wheat and rice to India

322
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,837
there was no grace about it, because

323
00:37:54,084 --> 00:37:56,747
then put some sort of a seed in it

324
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:59,913
which creted two horrible things in the villages.

325
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:02,727
One was called as congress grass

326
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:04,961
because it came from America.

327
00:38:05,604 --> 00:38:10,643
And another was called as a mad acacia.

328
00:38:11,465 --> 00:38:15,629
Babool, as we call it, mad babool. These trees

329
00:38:15,886 --> 00:38:17,957
have gown so much in the villages

330
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:19,784
that they don't know what to do with them.

331
00:38:20,024 --> 00:38:23,422
They have such big, big thorns that anyone who is stung by them

332
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:26,324
can even die. They are very poisonous

333
00:38:26,894 --> 00:38:28,407
and if the children get it,

334
00:38:28,459 --> 00:38:33,051
they get such poisonous problems that they cannot be cured.

335
00:38:33,332 --> 00:38:36,224
This is how American government has helped us.

336
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:39,992
Now who's going to tell them what you have done so ungraciously?

337
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:43,619
It was better to starve than to get any help from anyone.

338
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:49,099
Long time back I had said that it is better to starve in this country

339
00:38:49,847 --> 00:38:52,922
than to get any help from these wretched, horrible

340
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:56,429
Western countries who think no end of themselves.

341
00:38:57,407 --> 00:38:59,718
You just pamper their ego for nothing at all.

342
00:39:00,149 --> 00:39:03,130
What have they got? They have just plastic affluence.

343
00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:07,123
But this ego out of money makes them so stupid

344
00:39:08,168 --> 00:39:11,221
that they don't know what's happening in their own country.

345
00:39:11,612 --> 00:39:14,067
How their country’s going down in every way.

346
00:39:14,641 --> 00:39:17,203
How their people are going down. Either they are in

347
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,068
fear or they are abandoned.

348
00:39:20,022 --> 00:39:22,022
Otherwise they are communist

349
00:39:22,221 --> 00:39:25,398
or they are so-called capitalist

350
00:39:25,512 --> 00:39:27,061
where they are just abandoned.

351
00:39:27,808 --> 00:39:29,507
If you go and see that country,

352
00:39:29,996 --> 00:39:33,392
I mean you can't sit like this anywhere and talk in the outside,

353
00:39:33,444 --> 00:39:36,484
somebody might come and murder somebody.

354
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:38,887
If you walk in the dark you can be murdered.

355
00:39:38,983 --> 00:39:42,904
In America, so called advanced country of America, in New York City.

356
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:49,487
So this kind of riches we are trying to aspire, especially

357
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:52,975
people in Delhi are very anxious to aspire lot of money.

358
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:57,770
I don't know why Punjabis, Gujaratis

359
00:39:58,366 --> 00:40:00,289
and Maarwadis have taken to this.

360
00:40:00,436 --> 00:40:01,758
Maarwadis are another style.

361
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,389
How the Punjabis and the Gujaratis

362
00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:10,309
are trying to acquire the money.

363
00:40:11,757 --> 00:40:14,123
And when I see them abroad I

364
00:40:14,236 --> 00:40:17,043
just don't know if they are anywhere near India.

365
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:24,037
Horrid people they. They have no culture left in them that is Indian.

366
00:40:24,462 --> 00:40:26,160
They are absolutely outward.

367
00:40:27,715 --> 00:40:29,153
They think no end of themselves,

368
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:31,712
they think they have reached the heavens.

369
00:40:33,027 --> 00:40:35,260
Then if you see their Nabhi Chakra,

370
00:40:35,364 --> 00:40:38,614
you'll be amazed, all of them suffer from horrible livers,

371
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:43,242
high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attacks

372
00:40:43,684 --> 00:40:47,061
and they drink like fish, especially Sardargis.

373
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:51,867
I was surprised who are supposed to be in the name of God,

374
00:40:52,488 --> 00:40:54,563
they drink like fish.

375
00:40:56,226 --> 00:40:59,073
They are very particular about wearing a Puggadi and a Dhari,

376
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:00,703
but while drinking they don't mind.

377
00:41:01,248 --> 00:41:04,798
Every Sardargi you go to has a big bar in his house,

378
00:41:05,031 --> 00:41:06,192
where even a lord

379
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,586
does not have because it is regarded as very vulgar in England.

380
00:41:09,631 --> 00:41:12,607
Without learning any aesthetics of that country,

381
00:41:13,587 --> 00:41:17,644
they have become just like a agriculture there is no culture

382
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:23,469
is the fact,

383
00:41:24,363 --> 00:41:26,660
this is what money has done to them, they have

384
00:41:26,793 --> 00:41:28,290
no respect for themselves.

385
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:33,452
So this Lakshmi Tattwa is to be balanced. Same about these

386
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,515
Gujaratis who have gone.

387
00:41:35,757 --> 00:41:37,858
Another kind lives here, the Maarwadis.

388
00:41:37,931 --> 00:41:40,384
Less said the better about these horrible Maarwadis.

389
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:44,152
I don't think anyone of them will ever get Realization

390
00:41:44,325 --> 00:41:46,325
or a place in the Kingdom of God.

391
00:41:49,366 --> 00:41:50,829
They are blood suckers.

392
00:41:53,738 --> 00:41:56,786
They are not human beings. For money's sake, they'll

393
00:41:56,939 --> 00:42:01,611
suck the blood like juice, suck the blood, and now they had a nice time.

394
00:42:05,844 --> 00:42:10,625
This is not a world for you to seek money.

395
00:42:11,064 --> 00:42:13,211
You have come on this earth as a human being

396
00:42:13,256 --> 00:42:17,505
to seek God, to seek your Spirit, to be one with your Self,

397
00:42:17,816 --> 00:42:19,816
to be in that peaceful place

398
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:25,221
which is the Kingdom of God, which is the Kingdom of Heaven,

399
00:42:25,772 --> 00:42:28,694
and not to jump into a mire

400
00:42:28,874 --> 00:42:30,304
which looks very beautiful

401
00:42:32,067 --> 00:42:39,325
but is not really beautiful. It's agonizing, it's terrorizing.

402
00:42:39,441 --> 00:42:42,177
People can't sleep if they have too much money,

403
00:42:42,678 --> 00:42:44,578
because they don't know what to do with that.

404
00:42:44,608 --> 00:42:46,858
Here also all those who have got money,

405
00:42:47,267 --> 00:42:49,697
they don't know when the income tax will come on them.

406
00:42:51,146 --> 00:42:54,627
I have solved My income tax problem by having no income at all.

407
00:42:58,115 --> 00:42:59,812
I have no income, no income tax,

408
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:03,185
so I'm not worried about the Income Tax Commissioner.

409
00:43:03,776 --> 00:43:05,407
He cannot control Me.

410
00:43:07,689 --> 00:43:10,162
Best is not to have more income

411
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,487
that is to be taxed, otherwise you’ll have

412
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:13,924
to have another income tax

413
00:43:16,732 --> 00:43:18,847
lawyer that My brother is.

414
00:43:19,152 --> 00:43:23,182
I told him, “I don't need you at all, all My life, thank you very much.”

415
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:30,813
You get so absolutely free, on top of the world if you have no income.

416
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:40,653
Like if you want to solve your car problem, never learn driving.

417
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:46,953
Somebody drives you down or nothing, you can walk with your feet.

418
00:43:48,233 --> 00:43:50,922
The accumulation of all these nonsensical things

419
00:43:51,315 --> 00:43:54,147
have caused us all this tension, so-called:

420
00:43:56,396 --> 00:43:59,768
“How much we have to pay, what is the income tax,

421
00:44:00,091 --> 00:44:02,991
tomorrow the police is going to come in my house?”

422
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,289
If they come to Me I'll say, “All right,

423
00:44:05,483 --> 00:44:08,059
have everything that you can. Nothing there,

424
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:14,530
certain bills which I have not paid, that's all.” Just let them pay.

425
00:44:17,438 --> 00:44:20,213
One has to live with complete freedom in this world.

426
00:44:20,882 --> 00:44:24,653
And to achieve that freedom, one has to know that

427
00:44:24,752 --> 00:44:28,442
the priorities should be all right. If money is your priority,

428
00:44:28,618 --> 00:44:34,740
you have it. No, not Me. If you want to give Me money,

429
00:44:34,934 --> 00:44:37,974
“No Sir,” I won't at any cost.

430
00:44:38,216 --> 00:44:42,495
You can give Me flowers, this, that, all right, but no money at all.

431
00:44:44,354 --> 00:44:48,820
I don't want to know about money at all, it's a headache.

432
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:59,940
In the same way, we do not realize that having relationships -

433
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:05,553
brother, sister or son, this and that - is another big headache.

434
00:45:08,088 --> 00:45:10,222
That doesn't mean that you should start beating them,

435
00:45:11,025 --> 00:45:15,461
but people can sell their country for the sake of their children.

436
00:45:18,435 --> 00:45:22,085
It’s a very dangerous thing, horrible,

437
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:25,254
that kind of an attachment, the mamatva (ownership).

438
00:45:25,399 --> 00:45:27,399
This is my son, finished.

439
00:45:27,885 --> 00:45:30,696
If he's your son then you can murder anyone you feel like,

440
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:33,362
you can do what you like because he is your son.

441
00:45:33,408 --> 00:45:36,284
He is not somebody's son whom you are murdering?

442
00:45:38,514 --> 00:45:41,088
This mamatva that comes - “My husband.”

443
00:45:41,118 --> 00:45:42,362
Specially our Indian women.

444
00:45:43,636 --> 00:45:47,632
“My husband” immediately starts problem.

445
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:58,616
All this comes out of ignorance. Of course, love has to be there.

446
00:45:59,462 --> 00:46:01,462
But love never gives you attachment,

447
00:46:02,691 --> 00:46:10,729
because it is wise, it is wisdom. Supposing in a tree the sap of the tree

448
00:46:10,846 --> 00:46:15,745
goes and gets fixed in one fruit because it loves. “It's mine.”

449
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:19,076
Then what happens to the rest of the tree? It dies

450
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,002
and that fruit also dies.

451
00:46:25,255 --> 00:46:27,332
So this mamatva has to go out.

452
00:46:28,098 --> 00:46:29,993
But by telling it will not go,

453
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:34,234
by just advising it will not go.

454
00:46:34,306 --> 00:46:37,344
Even if you suffer, I have seen so many people coming to Me,

455
00:46:37,734 --> 00:46:41,043
“My own father deceived me.

456
00:46:41,624 --> 00:46:45,353
My own son deceived me.” I said, “Which one is your own?

457
00:46:45,953 --> 00:46:48,927
The one who deceived you is not your own.”

458
00:46:51,386 --> 00:46:52,841
“My husband.”

459
00:46:53,278 --> 00:46:56,416
There are some ladies who eat My head out of their husbands.

460
00:46:58,053 --> 00:47:02,795
“My husband did this, my husband did this, my husband did this.”

461
00:47:03,315 --> 00:47:06,073
Baba, why don't you hit him hard and finish with it?

462
00:47:09,347 --> 00:47:18,359
But it's so much accepted, this mamatva, this attachment.

463
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:25,359
Attachment to money, attachment to people, attachment to this

464
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:33,930
is nothing but a hook which hooks you to baser levels.

465
00:47:34,872 --> 00:47:44,045
You have to rise above, and then you really enjoy the beauty of richness.

466
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:48,889
As I told you the other day, I see all beautiful things.

467
00:47:48,921 --> 00:47:52,627
It's nice I don't possess them. See now these carpets are spread here.

468
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:56,466
If they were Mine, I should worry, “Oh God, now

469
00:47:56,852 --> 00:47:58,852
I hope they are not going to be spoilt.

470
00:47:59,567 --> 00:48:01,602
I hope nobody sits on them.

471
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:07,427
I hope they are insured, so nobody runs away with that.”

472
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:10,525
But when they don't belong to Me, I'm enjoying them better.

473
00:48:12,295 --> 00:48:14,734
Other people's things is a better idea.

474
00:48:16,389 --> 00:48:22,338
This myth carries us to such an extent of stupidity

475
00:48:24,219 --> 00:48:28,663
that sometimes I feel whether these human beings are human beings,

476
00:48:28,746 --> 00:48:33,495
or they are their possessions. Their Spirit is lost,

477
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,092
everything is lost, they're not bothered.

478
00:48:40,077 --> 00:48:44,629
But if their little position is lost, they weep and wail,

479
00:48:44,852 --> 00:48:48,845
as if they are dead, their forefathers are dead hundred times.

480
00:48:53,208 --> 00:48:57,246
But people like Me are just batchas, emperors.

481
00:48:57,739 --> 00:49:04,462
They are not bothered. To them comfort cannot capture,

482
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:09,326
they don’t need any comfort. If you have comfort

483
00:49:09,904 --> 00:49:12,988
it crawls upon you, it makes you a slave, too.

484
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:17,750
If you seek comfort you are in for enslavement,

485
00:49:18,276 --> 00:49:21,247
take it from Me. Any kind of comfort.

486
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:28,108
It's only human beings who can become really so crazy.

487
00:49:28,411 --> 00:49:32,507
No animal can become. There is another type of a comfort,

488
00:49:33,163 --> 00:49:38,550
is that a mental idea

489
00:49:38,759 --> 00:49:41,010
that everybody must appreciate,

490
00:49:41,261 --> 00:49:44,723
and that you should be able to overpower others.

491
00:49:44,977 --> 00:49:47,598
This also comes I think from Nabhi Chakra.

492
00:49:49,114 --> 00:49:50,754
Is a kind of a feeling

493
00:49:50,894 --> 00:49:53,473
that you should be able to overpower many people,

494
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:54,384
they should look at you.

495
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:58,200
These days in London there are women who are suffering from

496
00:49:58,309 --> 00:50:00,941
a funny disease called anorexia, where they just don't eat.

497
00:50:02,707 --> 00:50:06,408
Women just don't eat because they should be thin and skinny.

498
00:50:06,434 --> 00:50:09,107
For what? For what you should be thin and skinny?

499
00:50:10,436 --> 00:50:12,837
Because you look attractive, but for what?

500
00:50:15,843 --> 00:50:18,690
I don't think skinny people look attractive by any chance.

501
00:50:19,547 --> 00:50:22,572
Horrible they are. They create only pity

502
00:50:22,659 --> 00:50:26,418
and you feel you know repulsive about the whole stuff.

503
00:50:27,754 --> 00:50:32,817
Once a beauty queen came to see Me. I thought she was a T.B. patient.

504
00:50:36,332 --> 00:50:40,912
And I said, “You look all right but it seems you are a T.B. patient.”

505
00:50:40,987 --> 00:50:44,227
She said, “No Mother, I've got a beauty prize.” “Yes?

506
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:48,007
Who were the people? Doctors must have given it

507
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:49,863
because they want some patients there.”

508
00:50:51,609 --> 00:50:52,640
This is the trouble,

509
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:56,124
we go out of the way to trouble our Nabhi,

510
00:50:57,272 --> 00:50:59,562
not to eat your food, fasting.

511
00:51:00,472 --> 00:51:05,099
If you want to fast this life, next life you will not have any food.

512
00:51:05,465 --> 00:51:08,970
Thank you very much. No food.

513
00:51:09,597 --> 00:51:13,416
Fasting? All right, you’ll have a permanent fasting. What do you say?

514
00:51:14,006 --> 00:51:17,788
You don't have to do any fasting. Why do you want to fast?

515
00:51:18,361 --> 00:51:20,107
And even if you want to fast

516
00:51:20,406 --> 00:51:25,051
because you want to change the timing or maybe

517
00:51:25,345 --> 00:51:26,875
for your health's sake, it's all right.

518
00:51:27,123 --> 00:51:30,717
But why in the name of God you want to malign Me?

519
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:33,540
You have got everything to eat and you don’t want to eat.

520
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:36,448
Those who have got food to eat, they don’t want to eat.

521
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:40,967
Next life they become poor and then they blame the rich.

522
00:51:41,914 --> 00:51:44,439
But in last life you'd been wanted to fast,

523
00:51:46,252 --> 00:51:50,178
so this life you are not given any food, because you asked for it.

524
00:51:52,922 --> 00:51:56,159
And that is how also the Nabhi Chakra gets you twisted,

525
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,794
when you fast like mad.

526
00:51:58,651 --> 00:52:01,526
There is no need to fast in the name of God.

527
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,515
God has given you all the wealth, all the beauty,

528
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:11,021
all the love. Actually in Sahaja Yoga

529
00:52:11,092 --> 00:52:15,374
if you fast in My name, I think it's horrible

530
00:52:15,624 --> 00:52:18,926
because if you want to trouble your Mother

531
00:52:18,987 --> 00:52:20,836
or to make Her uneasy,

532
00:52:21,183 --> 00:52:22,699
or to take a revenge on Her,

533
00:52:23,124 --> 00:52:25,087
then you say, “Mother, I'm not going to eat my food.”

534
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:27,965
Then Mother is finished. That's the best way to conquer Her.

535
00:52:28,367 --> 00:52:30,566
To say, “Mother I'm not going to eat my food.”

536
00:52:31,298 --> 00:52:34,497
So this kind of a mad fasting

537
00:52:34,602 --> 00:52:38,649
is also very bad for your Nabhi and when you do that

538
00:52:38,744 --> 00:52:41,500
then you have a problem because you are invaded

539
00:52:41,737 --> 00:52:45,497
by your left-sided, what you call, beyond

540
00:52:48,608 --> 00:52:53,059
the Ida Nadi, you have the collective subconscious;

541
00:52:53,734 --> 00:52:55,734
and you are invaded by them.

542
00:52:57,384 --> 00:53:02,784
And you are in for trouble, physically, mentally, emotionally.

543
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:07,119
And mostly those people who fast are very hot tempered.

544
00:53:08,501 --> 00:53:11,340
The day they are fasting day is there, never go near them.

545
00:53:12,693 --> 00:53:15,039
Because they are already planning what they are going to eat.

546
00:53:19,631 --> 00:53:22,991
And in the morning they plan and they don't get it,

547
00:53:23,332 --> 00:53:25,557
so they are very angry for that part.

548
00:53:27,693 --> 00:53:30,779
All these asahaja things are not going to help you.

549
00:53:31,057 --> 00:53:32,561
You have to be normal people.

550
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:36,956
You don't have to put up into tension yourself for Sahaja Yoga, nothing.

551
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:42,201
Be normal. Be nice people. Don't torture yourself.

552
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:45,060
That is one point on the Nabhi on the left hand side

553
00:53:45,442 --> 00:53:48,329
and on the right hand side: don't get into indulgences.

554
00:53:50,047 --> 00:53:51,366
Don't pamper yourself.

555
00:53:52,051 --> 00:53:54,353
Both things are the same for Sahaja Yoga.

556
00:53:54,536 --> 00:53:57,985
Whether you starve or you overeat, is the same.

557
00:53:59,109 --> 00:54:02,635
There is no difference between the two, because

558
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:04,500
if you are not on the seat,

559
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,745
whether you are on the left

560
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:07,770
falling on the right, does it make any difference?

561
00:54:10,342 --> 00:54:13,298
So to be on the seat is to be

562
00:54:13,849 --> 00:54:16,276
in the blessings of Shri Lakshmi.

563
00:54:16,407 --> 00:54:20,185
And I have described to you how Shri Lakshmi is a lady

564
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:26,537
and in Her left hand She has got two lotuses and the right,

565
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:32,081
one lotus, and right hand another lotus on top, which shows a person

566
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:37,076
who is balancing. She’s balancing on a lotus.

567
00:54:37,654 --> 00:54:40,978
Imagine. She’s standing on a lotus. That means She is balancing.

568
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,697
And She’s balancing, She’s standing there

569
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:53,208
and She is holding two lotuses in Her hand showing

570
00:54:53,898 --> 00:54:56,747
that She’s like a lotus.

571
00:54:58,521 --> 00:55:02,641
A person who is a rich man, Lakshmi Pati,

572
00:55:03,314 --> 00:55:07,655
has to be like a lotus, warm, pink, warm.

573
00:55:08,368 --> 00:55:11,625
And even a horrible thing, like

574
00:55:18,912 --> 00:55:20,619
wasp-like thing.

575
00:55:20,841 --> 00:55:23,551
I don’t know what you call it in English, you don’t have that black thing.

576
00:55:24,053 --> 00:55:26,719
We have a very black wasp, you see,

577
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:32,074
which is hard, hard like nut and has angular thorny legs.

578
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:36,303
That black thing comes in

579
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:41,571
and is good for nothing, but it comes in

580
00:55:43,439 --> 00:55:46,545
for the residence, for the ashraya,

581
00:55:47,095 --> 00:55:50,110
the lotus keeps it

582
00:55:50,631 --> 00:55:55,269
on top of it’s corolla, which is a very, very soft thing, with all love.

583
00:55:55,566 --> 00:55:58,507
And in the night it closes down so that

584
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:01,556
the poor insect who is just like a nut

585
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:05,987
should not get any trouble from the outside weather.

586
00:56:07,003 --> 00:56:11,349
Like a mother who takes the child in the armchair,

587
00:56:12,726 --> 00:56:16,349
that love should be there for a Lakshmi Pati.

588
00:56:17,011 --> 00:56:19,723
How many are Lakshmi Pati’s like that? Have you seen any?

589
00:56:21,272 --> 00:56:25,690
If they see somebody who is coming with money propositions,

590
00:56:26,098 --> 00:56:27,728
then they may open their doors.

591
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:31,346
Otherwise, they have no love for anybody.

592
00:56:31,881 --> 00:56:37,038
For those who come for their ashrayas, for their help,

593
00:56:37,637 --> 00:56:41,699
they are not there. On the other side

594
00:56:42,003 --> 00:56:54,238
are the people who are so repulsive. They are not like lotus.

595
00:56:54,496 --> 00:56:58,510
There is no fragrance. They are such miserly people

596
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:05,590
that they stink of miserliness. While the lotus

597
00:57:06,655 --> 00:57:12,761
gives its fragrance through that mud, to that horrible thing

598
00:57:13,446 --> 00:57:18,389
that even the little worms which crawl upon

599
00:57:19,908 --> 00:57:26,599
those lotus petals smell of this beautiful fragrance.

600
00:57:28,331 --> 00:57:31,536
This is what it has to be. It has to give.

601
00:57:32,303 --> 00:57:35,117
It has to be beautiful. It has to be cozy.

602
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:36,971
It has to be welcoming.

603
00:57:38,843 --> 00:57:42,177
Then another hand is giving.

604
00:57:43,297 --> 00:57:45,954
The Lakshmi is always giving. She doesn’t receive;

605
00:57:46,209 --> 00:57:47,404
She just gives.

606
00:57:48,115 --> 00:57:49,987
If you are really a Lakshmi Pati

607
00:57:50,059 --> 00:57:52,005
you don’t want to have anything from anyone.

608
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:57,477
You don’t receive. If you are really rich, who can enrich you more?

609
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:03,734
What can you give to a person who is fully rich? There is no

610
00:58:04,194 --> 00:58:06,812
way of entering into it now it’s all up to the brim.

611
00:58:07,473 --> 00:58:09,689
He’s rich up to the brim. Then what do you give?

612
00:58:11,084 --> 00:58:12,058
You cannot give anything.

613
00:58:12,998 --> 00:58:15,632
But where you have to give means that he’s a beggar –

614
00:58:16,748 --> 00:58:17,636
he’s still a beggar.

615
00:58:20,045 --> 00:58:21,994
All of these so-called rich people

616
00:58:22,214 --> 00:58:23,810
who still are hankering money

617
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:25,707
are still beggars, they are not rich.

618
00:58:26,177 --> 00:58:29,164
They may think themselves. Empty vessels, but they are not rich

619
00:58:29,698 --> 00:58:31,802
because they are still expecting money.

620
00:58:37,459 --> 00:58:44,459
So, it is important that we should understand,

621
00:58:46,418 --> 00:58:48,099
the money is not the way.

622
00:58:48,377 --> 00:58:50,562
Money takes us away from dharma.

623
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:52,488
It takes us away from God.

624
00:58:52,521 --> 00:58:55,639
It takes us away from reality. It covers our eyes.

625
00:58:56,379 --> 00:58:57,363
We don’t think

626
00:58:58,056 --> 00:59:02,699
that we have to follow a path of righteousness and of virtue

627
00:59:03,436 --> 00:59:06,129
because we think we are rich, God is going to be afraid of us.

628
00:59:06,359 --> 00:59:08,710
We can even purchase Him and can

629
00:59:08,831 --> 00:59:10,483
manage Him by giving some bribes.

630
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:13,552
That’s not so.

631
00:59:15,209 --> 00:59:18,723
You must face yourself. You have to face yourself.

632
00:59:19,557 --> 00:59:24,187
That it’s not the money that’s going to give you that elation,

633
00:59:25,198 --> 00:59:33,974
that higher life, but it is the love of God,

634
00:59:34,306 --> 00:59:38,307
the honesty of seeking, honesty.

635
00:59:39,568 --> 00:59:44,306
That is the quality of this chakra is the Satya,

636
00:59:45,441 --> 00:59:47,950
Vishnu, is the Satya.

637
00:59:48,576 --> 00:59:51,292
He’s the Narayana. Narayana means Satya.

638
00:59:52,533 --> 00:59:54,863
So there cannot be Satya Narayan, isn’t it?

639
00:59:55,554 --> 00:59:58,307
Narayan is Satya, then how can there be Satya Narayan?

640
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:00,850
But we have many Satya Narayana Pujas.

641
01:00:02,164 --> 01:00:05,819
For all these Satya Narayanas, Sahaja Yogis are not supposed to go.

642
01:00:06,931 --> 01:00:09,188
They can only go to Narayana Puja

643
01:00:09,845 --> 01:00:13,660
because Satya Narayana is that path which is added to it

644
01:00:14,693 --> 01:00:17,359
for camouflaging, is meant for these

645
01:00:17,436 --> 01:00:21,618
horrible Brahmins who make you pay. For what?

646
01:00:25,003 --> 01:00:29,126
Sahaja Yogis are not allowed to go to Satya Narayana Puja.

647
01:00:29,434 --> 01:00:34,506
They can have Narayana Puja. And what is Narayana ultimately becomes?

648
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:43,167
In the Nabhi Chakra Narayana existed since He was created by the Devi.

649
01:00:45,082 --> 01:00:46,557
And It looks after

650
01:00:48,595 --> 01:00:52,138
the seeking, the nourishing of the seeking like a father,

651
01:00:53,117 --> 01:00:57,764
and then It incarnates again and then It incarnates again

652
01:00:57,836 --> 01:01:01,762
to help our seeking to a higher position and a higher position

653
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:10,287
till it reaches a point where you start seeking God Almighty.

654
01:01:11,107 --> 01:01:16,067
Then you jump into the Shakti of Mahalakshmi.

655
01:01:16,505 --> 01:01:20,743
Then you are in the hands of Mahalakshmi Shakti.

656
01:01:21,241 --> 01:01:25,481
Means Lakshmi evolves into Mahalakshmi principle.

657
01:01:29,365 --> 01:01:36,365
Now this Mahalakshmi principle resides in the central path of Sushumna.

658
01:01:37,826 --> 01:01:47,131
And this central path of Sushumna is to be established fully

659
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:50,191
and awakened when the Kundalini rises.

660
01:01:50,972 --> 01:01:52,972
When the Kundalini does not rise,

661
01:01:53,225 --> 01:01:56,413
this path is kept absolutely black.

662
01:01:58,787 --> 01:02:04,509
It is absolutely black, there is nothing in it except for the deities

663
01:02:05,442 --> 01:02:08,574
who are lying without any light.

664
01:02:10,433 --> 01:02:15,068
When the Kundalini rises, then only these deities get awakened

665
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:19,327
and when they get awakened this Sushumna path,

666
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:25,573
this central path of Mahalakshmi starts acting

667
01:02:27,281 --> 01:02:32,069
as the balancing power, to begin with at the Nabhi chakra.

668
01:02:33,336 --> 01:02:38,853
So Nabhi Chakra is surrounded by ten Gurus, the Prophets

669
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:41,139
who give you the balance,

670
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:45,310
who come on this earth again and again to give you balance in life.

671
01:02:46,183 --> 01:02:49,001
They tell you, “don’t do this, don’t do that.”

672
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:53,451
But we don’t listen, we don’t accept it. We may say

673
01:02:53,585 --> 01:02:56,130
that we follow such guru, such guru. Like,

674
01:02:56,241 --> 01:02:59,576
you know Muslims are. They say, “We follow Mohammed Sahib.”

675
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:01,876
Now if Mohammed Sahib has said

676
01:03:02,121 --> 01:03:05,744
anything it is that don’t drink, is the thing he said.

677
01:03:06,226 --> 01:03:09,006
But I’ve yet to come across a Muslim who doesn’t drink.

678
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:12,186
They may not drink in Riyad because they’ll be killed there.

679
01:03:12,983 --> 01:03:14,889
But if they come to London, they drink.

680
01:03:14,911 --> 01:03:16,209
Actually, when My husband

681
01:03:16,728 --> 01:03:18,477
went to Saudi Arabia they said,

682
01:03:18,519 --> 01:03:20,494
“You are the only Muslim we have ever come across.”

683
01:03:21,808 --> 01:03:27,181
It’s true. Whatever is said to them, they do just the opposite of that.

684
01:03:27,812 --> 01:03:30,639
At that time there were no cigarettes, no tobaccos,

685
01:03:30,755 --> 01:03:31,943
so He didn’t say about that

686
01:03:32,037 --> 01:03:33,191
so they have found a loophole.

687
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:37,011
Muslims smoke, doesn’t matter, because Mohammed Sahib never said.

688
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,276
Mohammed Sahib had to take another birth

689
01:03:40,302 --> 01:03:42,698
to come as Guru Nanaka to tell them, “Oh, God.

690
01:03:43,706 --> 01:03:48,778
Now you are smoking this horrible thing has come, now you don’t smoke.”

691
01:03:50,196 --> 01:03:55,189
But who will accept that Nanaka and Mohammed Sahib were the same people?

692
01:03:55,750 --> 01:04:02,750
No difference. Same thing it was. We can prove it in Sahaja Yoga.

693
01:04:04,498 --> 01:04:09,201
We can prove it, how important it is that we should know

694
01:04:09,574 --> 01:04:11,115
that they were all the same,

695
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:13,913
and that they stood for the same thing,

696
01:04:14,277 --> 01:04:15,657
but at a period.

697
01:04:15,738 --> 01:04:18,251
Now today you have got ganja,

698
01:04:18,377 --> 01:04:20,955
I don’t know the names also of all these things what you

699
01:04:21,104 --> 01:04:21,798
drink and smoke,

700
01:04:21,847 --> 01:04:22,752
God knows what.

701
01:04:23,441 --> 01:04:25,132
Human beings are really clever

702
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,915
to get everything that can destroy you. It's like,

703
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:30,717
call a bull, “come and hit me.” It's like that. If there’s

704
01:04:30,726 --> 01:04:33,164
not a bull then you’ll like ask a buffalo, “come and hit me.”

705
01:04:33,223 --> 01:04:35,181
Now there's no buffalo, all right,

706
01:04:35,306 --> 01:04:38,685
you ask an elephant, “come and stampede me.” It's like that.

707
01:04:38,906 --> 01:04:40,318
Human beings are so stupid.

708
01:04:40,891 --> 01:04:42,335
So now supposing, I say

709
01:04:42,356 --> 01:04:43,896
if I write down a list of

710
01:04:43,919 --> 01:04:46,582
all the thing you drink and smoke, I don't know how many things

711
01:04:46,608 --> 01:04:47,700
 there are in this world,

712
01:04:48,035 --> 01:04:50,624
then you'll find out the third thing when I die,

713
01:04:50,715 --> 01:04:54,337
that “Mataji didn't say this one.” So we should do it.

714
01:04:55,452 --> 01:05:00,591
Very intelligent. All the time destroying your central path,

715
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:04,561
and nicely managing through that.

716
01:05:05,005 --> 01:05:07,877
Is this the way are you going to go to God by any chance?

717
01:05:09,334 --> 01:05:11,170
Is this the way are you following

718
01:05:11,443 --> 01:05:14,016
the great incarnations who came on this earth?

719
01:05:17,347 --> 01:05:20,882
So the balancing comes through Nabhi

720
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:28,474
and Nabhi looks after you and teaches you how to behave.

721
01:05:29,049 --> 01:05:33,282
For example, now your left Nabhi is Gruha Lakshmi.

722
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,065
Gruha Lakshmi is the Deity of the household.

723
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:40,333
But if you have too much outward type,

724
01:05:40,739 --> 01:05:41,896
you're running a madness.

725
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:45,499
So early in the morning you get up, read the newspapers.

726
01:05:45,687 --> 01:05:47,082
Is against Sahaja Yoga again.

727
01:05:47,574 --> 01:05:50,021
Not to read newspapers in the morning time.

728
01:05:50,161 --> 01:05:51,690
You can read it in the night,

729
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:56,131
but not in the morning. Because if you read it in the morning,

730
01:05:56,846 --> 01:05:57,793
you'll get upset.

731
01:05:58,968 --> 01:06:00,679
And poor this spleen has to

732
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:03,550
pour in more red blood corpuscles

733
01:06:03,794 --> 01:06:05,587
and it becomes mad and fails you.

734
01:06:07,036 --> 01:06:09,357
On the contrary, in the morning talk to your wife,

735
01:06:09,613 --> 01:06:10,705
talk to your children,

736
01:06:10,803 --> 01:06:12,690
look after your Gruha Lakshmi Tattwa.

737
01:06:12,748 --> 01:06:14,931
The wife also has to be a Gruha Lakshmi as I told you.

738
01:06:16,704 --> 01:06:19,545
Then you have your food properly.

739
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:23,549
Sit down and eat properly. But no,

740
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:26,609
just after that, upsetting that Nabhi,

741
01:06:26,788 --> 01:06:28,219
you jump into your car,

742
01:06:28,596 --> 01:06:31,296
taking your breakfast in your hand, eating on the way,

743
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:34,482
honking at people, getting angry with them,

744
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:38,674
the wife is calling, “Come along you have your breakfast!”

745
01:06:38,701 --> 01:06:42,590
Nothing doing. You are on your way on a special work,

746
01:06:43,021 --> 01:06:46,999
you end up with leukemia at least, minimum of minimum,

747
01:06:47,113 --> 01:06:48,838
if not with heart attack.

748
01:06:50,991 --> 01:06:55,217
Leukemia comes from left Nabhi, when your Gruha Lakshmi is ruined.

749
01:06:59,217 --> 01:07:01,898
The Deity of Gruha Lakshmi is Fatimabai,

750
01:07:02,011 --> 01:07:03,462
the daughter of Mohammed Sahib,

751
01:07:06,884 --> 01:07:13,884
while the daughter of the sister

752
01:07:14,876 --> 01:07:21,840
of Nanak Sahib is on the left Vishuddhi. You'll see that.

753
01:07:23,212 --> 01:07:29,882
Nanaki. Now this aspect of life we never think about.

754
01:07:30,049 --> 01:07:33,342
When you get leukemia, then you'll come to Mother, “please cure me.”

755
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:34,408
And if you are rich,

756
01:07:34,496 --> 01:07:37,001
you will see to it that I cure that person.

757
01:07:37,027 --> 01:07:38,990
If I don't cure you will sit on My head.

758
01:07:39,877 --> 01:07:43,550
You'll be in ten times on My head unless and until I cure your leukemia.

759
01:07:43,605 --> 01:07:46,962
But if I tell you, “My son, you take it easy,

760
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:50,480
life is not for getting wretchedness out of you.

761
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:53,860
What have you gained out of all this running about?

762
01:07:54,179 --> 01:07:54,819
Nothing.

763
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,978
But this horrible left Nabhi

764
01:07:57,087 --> 01:08:00,286
by which you are suffering, your family people are suffering.

765
01:08:00,339 --> 01:08:01,714
Only person who has gained

766
01:08:01,962 --> 01:08:05,316
is the doctor or the doctors or the hospitals.”

767
01:08:07,687 --> 01:08:08,815
They won't listen.

768
01:08:10,765 --> 01:08:14,927
And you know leukemia is such a fast developing disease of cancer

769
01:08:15,158 --> 01:08:18,508
that one can pass out within one month,

770
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:20,382
doctors will tell you,

771
01:08:20,562 --> 01:08:22,688
at the most you'll live for one month, that's all. They'll

772
01:08:22,815 --> 01:08:25,205
take all the money to give this certificate, very nicely.

773
01:08:26,591 --> 01:08:28,179
But why have that?

774
01:08:28,447 --> 01:08:30,447
Be patient with yourself.

775
01:08:30,681 --> 01:08:34,130
Be kind to your Nabhi, look after your Gruha Lakshmi.

776
01:08:36,171 --> 01:08:38,563
All kinds of diseases of the stomach

777
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:42,498
come from this imbalance this way or that way.

778
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:45,811
All these great gurus came on this earth

779
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:48,873
to give us balance, to teach us balance and tell us,

780
01:08:49,282 --> 01:08:53,453
“Don't do this and don't do that.” All the Ten Commandments.

781
01:08:54,305 --> 01:08:59,579
But to us these Ten Commandment have no meaning.

782
01:09:01,786 --> 01:09:05,006
Now I’ll touch a point which is very important today

783
01:09:05,613 --> 01:09:07,470
for you people to understand

784
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:11,132
about non-vegetarianism and vegetarianism.

785
01:09:11,281 --> 01:09:13,530
Because this subject I wanted to handle,

786
01:09:13,886 --> 01:09:15,513
because if they are vegetarians they

787
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:16,812
can’t bear to see

788
01:09:16,916 --> 01:09:19,500
that Mother says it doesn't matter if you are a non-vegetarian,

789
01:09:20,747 --> 01:09:24,682
because it doesn’t go against your awareness. It does not.

790
01:09:24,756 --> 01:09:29,162
But drinking does. Drinking does go against your awareness.

791
01:09:29,848 --> 01:09:36,134
But not eating meat or not eating meat. But one has to understand.

792
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:41,793
Now somebody told Me that in Gita it is written that those who eat meat

793
01:09:43,224 --> 01:09:50,150
are Tamo Gunis. I am surprised at Gita itself.

794
01:09:50,247 --> 01:09:54,136
Because Shri Krishna Himself in the very beginning,

795
01:09:54,755 --> 01:10:00,185
has told Arjuna that you should go all out to kill all these people,

796
01:10:00,611 --> 01:10:04,777
even your relations, kill, actually kill human beings.

797
01:10:05,122 --> 01:10:08,344
Your relations and your guru also is to be killed,

798
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:10,743
because I have already killed.

799
01:10:11,376 --> 01:10:15,151
Nothing is going to be killed by you because they are already killed.

800
01:10:17,302 --> 01:10:20,795
And He gives so many explanations that it should not be done,

801
01:10:21,487 --> 01:10:24,924
but He said, “No, I tell you, you have to go and kill.

802
01:10:25,124 --> 01:10:27,092
Surrender yourself to Me and I'll take care of them.”

803
01:10:27,479 --> 01:10:30,937
So how did He preach this, I just don’t understand, in Gita.

804
01:10:31,417 --> 01:10:33,486
Now this seems to be a new introduction

805
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:36,927
that the people who eat (meat) are Tamo Gunis. They are not,

806
01:10:37,844 --> 01:10:39,987
they are never. They are Rajo Gunis.

807
01:10:41,045 --> 01:10:44,089
If you eat meat you become Rajo Gunis not Tamo Gunis.

808
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:48,566
Tamo Gunis are the people who eat carbohydrates, we have seen it

809
01:10:48,649 --> 01:10:51,361
in Sahaja Yoga. We have two types of diseases,

810
01:10:51,404 --> 01:10:56,143
one is lethargic organs and one is active organs.

811
01:10:57,742 --> 01:11:04,739
So those who are lethargic having too much carbohydrates

812
01:11:05,743 --> 01:11:09,575
and those who are overactive are having too much proteins in them.

813
01:11:11,261 --> 01:11:15,270
I mean if you take proteins, in the science, scientifically,

814
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:19,363
will you become lethargic? I mean ask any doctor.

815
01:11:20,586 --> 01:11:21,866
And then the doctor says Gita

816
01:11:21,879 --> 01:11:24,037
is all humbug because it doesn't understand

817
01:11:24,182 --> 01:11:25,184
what it is saying.

818
01:11:25,822 --> 01:11:28,497
And while you say like this that “We must follow Gita.”

819
01:11:29,672 --> 01:11:31,805
I think somebody has gone wrong there

820
01:11:31,834 --> 01:11:33,468
and has written something wrong in Gita

821
01:11:33,476 --> 01:11:36,344
as they have written in Bible, they have written in every book.

822
01:11:36,861 --> 01:11:38,395
I'll tell you what they have written wrong in

823
01:11:38,414 --> 01:11:40,414
Bible later on when it comes to Christ.

824
01:11:41,486 --> 01:11:45,835
I think just some people have put it there for oppose.

825
01:11:46,029 --> 01:11:48,029
If you eat too much meat you get Raj Gunis

826
01:11:48,666 --> 01:11:51,575
and Raj Gunis become as I have told you right-sided people,

827
01:11:51,586 --> 01:11:52,773
become very aggressive

828
01:11:53,326 --> 01:11:56,047
and they become ahamkaris and they can harm.

829
01:11:57,272 --> 01:12:00,480
But the people who just eat grass can become

830
01:12:00,547 --> 01:12:03,409
lethargic, absolutely lethargic.

831
01:12:03,814 --> 01:12:06,262
They will have lethargic heart if not active one,

832
01:12:06,293 --> 01:12:07,575
they will also get heart attack.

833
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:12,114
They will have lethargic intestines by which they will get

834
01:12:12,156 --> 01:12:14,650
tremendous all the time passing out of the stools,

835
01:12:14,685 --> 01:12:16,590
they'll never be able to digest any food,

836
01:12:16,838 --> 01:12:17,906
they'll be very weak people.

837
01:12:19,026 --> 01:12:22,812
So those people who have a lethargic heart or a lethargic

838
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:33,617
liver or lethargic intestines should take to proteins.

839
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:36,301
I'm not saying meats, but proteins.

840
01:12:36,801 --> 01:12:39,167
But a vegetarian doesn't take so much proteins.

841
01:12:39,201 --> 01:12:41,879
It's easier to take meat, there's no harm.

842
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:46,775
But those who are active people should take

843
01:12:46,855 --> 01:12:49,389
more to vegetables. It’s sensible.

844
01:12:50,848 --> 01:12:54,646
Guru Nanaka ate all the meats, was he a bad man?

845
01:12:55,148 --> 01:13:00,719
These Maarwadis who are supposed to be absolutely abstaining

846
01:13:00,769 --> 01:13:03,651
from even from lahasoon (garlic) and pyaj (onion).

847
01:13:04,244 --> 01:13:07,835
Was He worse than them by any chance?

848
01:13:08,581 --> 01:13:10,581
What about Buddha, Himself? He ate meat

849
01:13:10,789 --> 01:13:14,000
because He died of eating raw meat, Himself.

850
01:13:15,069 --> 01:13:17,166
Only thing you should not eat the meat

851
01:13:17,514 --> 01:13:19,498
of animals which are bigger than you,

852
01:13:19,526 --> 01:13:21,842
and not of a cow which is an Indian cow.

853
01:13:22,703 --> 01:13:23,728
Specially Indian cow.

854
01:13:24,177 --> 01:13:26,058
Also bigger cows are not good

855
01:13:26,081 --> 01:13:28,081
because they give you a problem on the teeth.

856
01:13:32,978 --> 01:13:37,747
But smaller animals, even with Jainism

857
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:46,526
they said that you must save the bullocks, the cows,

858
01:13:47,077 --> 01:13:50,965
and you must save other animals,

859
01:13:51,386 --> 01:13:53,975
but they never said you must save goats

860
01:13:53,989 --> 01:13:55,497
and you must save chickens.

861
01:13:56,122 --> 01:13:59,759
Because Mahavira knew we cannot give Realization to chickens.

862
01:14:01,029 --> 01:14:04,022
What is the use of saving chickens and mosquitoes

863
01:14:04,712 --> 01:14:07,045
and also bugs?

864
01:14:08,834 --> 01:14:10,834
Of course they are doing like that.

865
01:14:11,214 --> 01:14:13,582
Some Jain people save bugs and

866
01:14:13,638 --> 01:14:19,234
put it on a human being, and they take the blood of those

867
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,880
human beings and they are paid for it.

868
01:14:22,854 --> 01:14:24,428
It's absurd but they do it.

869
01:14:24,644 --> 01:14:26,874
For them bugs are more important than human beings.

870
01:14:27,871 --> 01:14:31,112
Billions and billions of bugs cannot make a human being.

871
01:14:33,671 --> 01:14:36,478
All these absurd ideas we have in this country.

872
01:14:37,295 --> 01:14:41,442
So when I say you are not to be a vegetarian

873
01:14:41,487 --> 01:14:44,465
or non-vegetarian, you have to see what you need and eat that.

874
01:14:44,843 --> 01:14:48,643
But all the time your attention is in food itself is wrong.

875
01:14:51,102 --> 01:14:55,017
So there is no good in you people

876
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:59,487
getting into these problems of vegetarianism and non-vegetarianism.

877
01:14:59,847 --> 01:15:02,581
Of course in the Western countries people should take

878
01:15:03,025 --> 01:15:08,524
to vegetarian food, not absolutely, but more than what they have,

879
01:15:08,764 --> 01:15:12,098
while the people who are in India who are vegetarians

880
01:15:12,138 --> 01:15:14,240
will have to later on take to meat. Otherwise

881
01:15:14,282 --> 01:15:15,986
they will have lethargic heart.

882
01:15:16,195 --> 01:15:18,599
I’ll cure them once again they will have problem,

883
01:15:18,703 --> 01:15:22,350
then they will have to go for a by-pass. Save money there?

884
01:15:23,244 --> 01:15:27,074
You cannot. You will have lethargic intestines,

885
01:15:28,244 --> 01:15:33,508
then you will have lethargic liver. You will have all kinds of

886
01:15:35,518 --> 01:15:38,879
cirrhosis, or maybe on the hand you might get

887
01:15:38,998 --> 01:15:44,010
all kinds of rashes and things like that, allergies,

888
01:15:45,288 --> 01:15:50,549
all these problems will come. And then ultimately such people

889
01:15:50,763 --> 01:15:54,434
look so peaceful because you see, they are like cabbages.

890
01:15:54,996 --> 01:15:59,519
Yes. If somebody is like a cabbage

891
01:16:00,443 --> 01:16:02,272
then how do you give him Realization?

892
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:05,294
You can't give Realization to cabbages can you?

893
01:16:06,966 --> 01:16:09,829
We have to have here chivalrous people,

894
01:16:09,976 --> 01:16:11,746
brave people, warriors.

895
01:16:12,418 --> 01:16:16,357
You have to fight the evil forces, and what can

896
01:16:16,571 --> 01:16:22,256
these people who are cabbages going to do for it?

897
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:31,880
One has to understand yatharth, the reality

898
01:16:31,933 --> 01:16:36,631
and not put your conception. Because you are born in a Jain family

899
01:16:37,528 --> 01:16:46,311
and that's why you want everybody to eat grass, is wrong , is wrong.

900
01:16:46,554 --> 01:16:50,826
The one who has to eat protein must eat protein.

901
01:16:52,053 --> 01:16:54,510
Now what is the food for Sattvic people?

902
01:16:57,029 --> 01:17:02,365
That one should eat. You can’t live with it. So what I eat? Channa.

903
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:10,017
Can you live with channa? Is protein. Channa, or you can eat meat.

904
01:17:10,485 --> 01:17:14,637
But not very heavy meats, lean meats and ghee,

905
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:27,688
and what I eat the most is honey.

906
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:35,757
That's My food. Honey I eat, you know that, honey I drink.

907
01:17:37,866 --> 01:17:41,591
That's. But you can't live with that can you?

908
01:17:42,685 --> 01:17:45,412
So you have to eat little carbohydrates. Doesn't matter,

909
01:17:45,992 --> 01:17:48,810
but you balance yourself in Nabhi Chakra

910
01:17:51,993 --> 01:17:55,568
But there should be no attention on food at all.

911
01:17:56,554 --> 01:17:58,140
Actually if you ask Me what I ate

912
01:17:58,154 --> 01:17:59,798
in the morning, I won't be able to tell you.

913
01:17:59,834 --> 01:18:03,204
Really I'm very bad at it because I have no attention on it.

914
01:18:03,706 --> 01:18:06,590
Whatever one gets, eat it, and you don't feel like eating, don't eat.

915
01:18:07,208 --> 01:18:13,329
What's so important is to enjoy every moment of your life.

916
01:18:14,563 --> 01:18:17,366
If a person is finicky about food, specially Indians are,

917
01:18:17,787 --> 01:18:19,591
is very dangerous for Nabhi Chakra.

918
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:23,744
Because those who are mad after food

919
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:25,723
and about Nabhi Chakra

920
01:18:28,085 --> 01:18:30,462
are extremely hot-tempered, I think and...

921
01:18:30,938 --> 01:18:33,181
I don’t know what the word in English is but in

922
01:18:33,194 --> 01:18:34,949
Hindi we call it chichode,

923
01:18:39,243 --> 01:18:43,710
irritable, irritable, and these chichode

924
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,649
will make their wives’ lives miserable.

925
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:50,702
They will come and tell, “In that house I ate very good curry nuts.”

926
01:18:51,921 --> 01:18:54,635
So that poor lady is running after the curry nuts.

927
01:18:54,673 --> 01:18:57,138
We Indians are so much food-minded.

928
01:18:58,090 --> 01:19:00,633
You can't imagine, they won't believe we are supposed to be

929
01:19:00,656 --> 01:19:01,446
starving people.

930
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:04,319
But we are so food-minded

931
01:19:04,946 --> 01:19:07,278
that once there was for these Bengalis,

932
01:19:07,317 --> 01:19:09,913
supposed to be Mukha Bengalis, I must tell you about them.

933
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:12,975
They had raw fish, raw fish which they get it

934
01:19:12,982 --> 01:19:14,155
from the Central India

935
01:19:14,587 --> 01:19:17,084
and people couldn't get fish so they were starving.

936
01:19:17,777 --> 01:19:19,732
So Bombay people very graciously sent

937
01:19:19,931 --> 01:19:22,635
one shipload, because I know that, I was part of it,

938
01:19:23,494 --> 01:19:28,014
to them as a gracious act that let the Bengalis eat the fish.

939
01:19:28,145 --> 01:19:31,058
They said, “What? We are not going to eat sea fish,

940
01:19:31,597 --> 01:19:33,111
we are Bangladeshis.”

941
01:19:34,136 --> 01:19:36,745
Threw all the fishes in the sea.

942
01:19:36,784 --> 01:19:39,587
It all become sardana (rotten) and it was thrown into the sea.

943
01:19:39,947 --> 01:19:42,557
Can you imagine? Nobody will believe in the West,

944
01:19:42,571 --> 01:19:44,834
this is how we are fasting and

945
01:19:44,878 --> 01:19:47,634
that is how we are poor people.

946
01:19:47,734 --> 01:19:52,316
Can poor people afford to throw away one shipload of fish

947
01:19:52,616 --> 01:19:55,716
in the sea because they want raw fish?

948
01:19:57,807 --> 01:20:04,035
We are so food-minded that our Nabhis are always like this.

949
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:06,930
And our women are to be blamed because

950
01:20:06,942 --> 01:20:09,933
they know to control their husbands, they are spoilt them.

951
01:20:15,197 --> 01:20:17,596
The job of a woman is to be a Gruha Lakshmi.

952
01:20:18,216 --> 01:20:21,429
To have ideals before the family,

953
01:20:21,974 --> 01:20:24,200
ideals before a husband,

954
01:20:24,277 --> 01:20:26,277
ideals before the children.

955
01:20:26,778 --> 01:20:28,522
The house should be ideal,

956
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:31,942
should be a warm house where everybody's welcome.

957
01:20:32,506 --> 01:20:35,814
The wife’s job is to keep her Nabhi all right,

958
01:20:35,916 --> 01:20:39,213
the Nabhi of the children all right and the Nabhi of the husband

959
01:20:39,272 --> 01:20:41,597
and Nabhi of all the people who come to her house.

960
01:20:43,254 --> 01:20:45,612
She has to lead a life of auspiciousness,

961
01:20:46,244 --> 01:20:52,608
of kindliness, of religious nature. She has to be a soft-natured woman.

962
01:20:55,596 --> 01:20:59,334
But this is all missing, only thing she is worried with,

963
01:20:59,483 --> 01:21:04,495
how to please the husbands. Because that's one of the big jobs for her.

964
01:21:06,386 --> 01:21:08,458
So to keep our Nabhi all right

965
01:21:08,603 --> 01:21:10,603
we have to understand as Sahaja Yogis

966
01:21:11,457 --> 01:21:15,327
that we have not to pay so much attention to food.

967
01:21:17,521 --> 01:21:20,253
That doesn't mean you eat all dirty food.

968
01:21:21,183 --> 01:21:24,254
But it definitely means that when you eat your food,

969
01:21:24,394 --> 01:21:26,394
you must see the vibrations of the food.

970
01:21:27,447 --> 01:21:29,666
You must always give vibrations to the food.

971
01:21:30,147 --> 01:21:32,147
Eat the food which is vibrated.

972
01:21:33,126 --> 01:21:35,294
Certain foods, now supposing if

973
01:21:35,315 --> 01:21:39,578
I have to go and eat in any one of these big five star hotels,

974
01:21:40,190 --> 01:21:41,422
next moment I vomit,

975
01:21:41,589 --> 01:21:44,669
I always vomit. If somebody invites Me in a hotel,

976
01:21:45,478 --> 01:21:47,998
I start thinking, ‘Baba, now what an ordeal.’

977
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:50,842
Because it is not cooked with love.

978
01:21:53,061 --> 01:21:55,608
That's what it says [Marathi],

979
01:21:57,611 --> 01:22:00,781
“He likes the little berries of Shabari.”

980
01:22:02,024 --> 01:22:08,074
[ Marathi]

981
01:22:12,713 --> 01:22:16,753
Was does that mean?  That means the love

982
01:22:17,387 --> 01:22:21,415
that is expressed in that food

983
01:22:22,387 --> 01:22:24,387
is what we should care for,

984
01:22:29,521 --> 01:22:34,315
and not for the lavishness, not for the show of it

985
01:22:34,456 --> 01:22:37,637
and not at all for your own taste,

986
01:22:38,051 --> 01:22:40,201
but the taste of food should be

987
01:22:40,398 --> 01:22:44,634
that it should carry love. Let your tongue feel the love.

988
01:22:49,541 --> 01:22:51,053
That is the best taste,

989
01:22:51,393 --> 01:22:54,695
and whatever is cooked with love always tastes very well.

990
01:22:59,275 --> 01:23:00,697
So when you cook,

991
01:23:01,562 --> 01:23:05,421
cook with love. When you eat, eat with love.

992
01:23:06,391 --> 01:23:10,363
With kind words to the person who has cooked with love

993
01:23:11,882 --> 01:23:18,361
and above all, count your blessings, count your blessings,

994
01:23:20,503 --> 01:23:25,003
and think of others who may not have had food today.

995
01:23:26,466 --> 01:23:28,225
This is the Lakshmi Tattwa, is

996
01:23:28,595 --> 01:23:30,885
where the hand is like this, where it gives

997
01:23:31,251 --> 01:23:37,006
and there's a hand where it gives protection to people who need money.

998
01:23:37,481 --> 01:23:39,109
But not in a way we do it,

999
01:23:40,043 --> 01:23:42,768
the way Americans do or Russians do it. We do the way

1000
01:23:43,424 --> 01:23:44,609
Lakshmi does,

1001
01:23:45,054 --> 01:23:48,107
that this protection does not get out of hand.

1002
01:23:48,257 --> 01:23:50,596
You give it without telling anyone.

1003
01:23:50,617 --> 01:23:52,435
Just because you have to give you give,

1004
01:23:53,144 --> 01:23:54,592
and actually you do that.

1005
01:23:55,073 --> 01:23:58,638
If you have given, as My father said, one rupee to someone,

1006
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:01,638
run away from that person as soon as possible

1007
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:05,230
with the speed of one mile, he said.

1008
01:24:05,454 --> 01:24:06,855
But if you have given

1009
01:24:07,488 --> 01:24:11,365
five rupees, run away from him at the speed of 500 miles.

1010
01:24:13,586 --> 01:24:14,750
It's very practical.

1011
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:17,935
That is how we have to give.

1012
01:24:18,306 --> 01:24:20,018
This is the Lakshmi Tattwa,

1013
01:24:20,561 --> 01:24:23,323
is the Nabhi Chakra about which I have told you.

1014
01:24:24,021 --> 01:24:27,086
It's a very important Chakra,

1015
01:24:27,711 --> 01:24:33,802
because today you are here because in your Chakra,

1016
01:24:33,889 --> 01:24:36,327
Mahalakshmi Tattwa was awakened

1017
01:24:36,845 --> 01:24:42,215
because you wanted to seek God. Because you wanted to come to God.

1018
01:24:42,841 --> 01:24:45,421
You have not come here for money.

1019
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:50,916
You have not come here for anything else but God.

1020
01:24:51,054 --> 01:24:53,054
Your seeking is in God.

1021
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:55,662
You want to know the truth about God

1022
01:24:55,918 --> 01:24:57,918
and you want to have God.

1023
01:24:58,299 --> 01:25:00,938
You don't want to put your ideas on to this,

1024
01:25:01,024 --> 01:25:04,741
but you want to see how Mother wants

1025
01:25:04,931 --> 01:25:07,147
us to receive the blessings of God.

1026
01:25:07,988 --> 01:25:14,487
So become that as we seek the love of God, the grace of God.

1027
01:25:16,144 --> 01:25:21,573
The Lakshmi has to be gracious and the Mahalakshmi

1028
01:25:21,817 --> 01:25:27,674
is the One who is the gracious lady, is the graciousness in you.

1029
01:25:28,145 --> 01:25:32,654
The grace that must come evolved into your personality.

1030
01:25:33,138 --> 01:25:36,123
Within that grace he feels the hankering of the Father.

1031
01:25:36,997 --> 01:25:42,129
The Father, the Narayana. He wants to have His blessings,

1032
01:25:42,552 --> 01:25:44,922
and that is how the first, the truth,

1033
01:25:45,242 --> 01:25:47,561
the seeking of the truth rises in you,

1034
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:51,832
and that is how the honesty of seeking is blessed

1035
01:25:52,721 --> 01:25:54,246
when the Kundalini rises.

1036
01:25:54,359 --> 01:25:57,998
She first gives you - first thing that you get

1037
01:25:58,442 --> 01:26:03,052
is the truth, by enlightening your brain.

1038
01:26:03,551 --> 01:26:05,551
When I will tell you about Sahasrara

1039
01:26:06,284 --> 01:26:13,284
and about Agnya, I will tell you how this brain becomes

1040
01:26:14,872 --> 01:26:17,642
a receptor of the ultimate truth,

1041
01:26:18,777 --> 01:26:22,304
how truth is spread, you start

1042
01:26:22,503 --> 01:26:25,974
receiving the knowledge of absolute truth.

1043
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:28,765
How this brain when enlightened

1044
01:26:29,258 --> 01:26:37,637
gives you the power to know what is truth and what is not truth,

1045
01:26:38,219 --> 01:26:41,395
and there are no alternatives.

1046
01:26:43,447 --> 01:26:45,101
This I'll tell you later on

1047
01:26:45,319 --> 01:26:48,656
when the Kundalini I'll describe at the brain level.

1048
01:26:49,109 --> 01:26:53,672
But for today I think Nabhi Chakra is very important.

1049
01:26:54,252 --> 01:26:56,906
For all of us, for India specially,

1050
01:26:56,932 --> 01:26:58,783
our Nabhi Chakra is very important,

1051
01:27:00,405 --> 01:27:03,331
that we should know that God Almighty,

1052
01:27:03,943 --> 01:27:07,464
the Narayana, the Vishnu,

1053
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:12,715
is the One who gives the kshema after Yoga.

1054
01:27:12,761 --> 01:27:15,888
He says, “Yoga Kshema Mahatmyam,” He gives the kshema.

1055
01:27:17,074 --> 01:27:19,684
And we are sinning against the God

1056
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:24,240
when we don't believe that honest and

1057
01:27:24,255 --> 01:27:27,976
righteous and virtuous life will give us the kshema

1058
01:27:28,095 --> 01:27:30,095
as promised by God Almighty.

1059
01:27:30,514 --> 01:27:34,553
You are sinning against our Father, while in the West

1060
01:27:34,804 --> 01:27:37,038
they are sinning against the Mother

1061
01:27:37,534 --> 01:27:39,098
on the left hand side,

1062
01:27:39,214 --> 01:27:43,581
because they have forgotten that immoral life

1063
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:46,811
is an insult to the Mother Power of God.

1064
01:27:48,184 --> 01:27:50,326
So both things are important,

1065
01:27:50,737 --> 01:27:54,031
whether in the West or East, is important

1066
01:27:54,605 --> 01:27:59,064
that we should not sin against the Father and sin against the Mother.

1067
01:28:00,923 --> 01:28:03,906
I hope I've tried to tell you everything

1068
01:28:04,187 --> 01:28:06,432
in such a way that you do not feel hurt.

1069
01:28:06,786 --> 01:28:09,365
Because all of you come from different, different

1070
01:28:09,965 --> 01:28:12,744
types of lives; different, different conceptions;

1071
01:28:13,173 --> 01:28:17,539
different, different gurus, and you can get confused about it.

1072
01:28:18,033 --> 01:28:20,857
So, in Sahaja Yoga you should

1073
01:28:20,890 --> 01:28:23,282
allow this to work out.

1074
01:28:23,662 --> 01:28:27,457
Allow the light to come in and don't get confused, don't get upset.

1075
01:28:27,957 --> 01:28:30,065
Here you are to seek God

1076
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:33,281
and not to sit on what you have known so far,

1077
01:28:33,349 --> 01:28:36,546
or which you have heard so far, or whatever you have followed.

1078
01:28:36,753 --> 01:28:40,895
Because that has not given you anything whatsoever.

1079
01:28:41,434 --> 01:28:46,324
Like one of My disciples who's a big officer

1080
01:28:47,602 --> 01:28:49,766
and one day he told Me, “Mother,

1081
01:28:49,842 --> 01:28:51,762
I don't know about Gita,

1082
01:28:51,751 --> 01:28:54,527
I don't know about Ramana, Krishna, anyone.

1083
01:28:55,054 --> 01:28:59,469
I know You, because You are the One who has given me Realization.”

1084
01:29:02,115 --> 01:29:05,599
Of course after knowing Me you will know all of them.

1085
01:29:06,002 --> 01:29:08,002
But it is better you know Me now, because

1086
01:29:08,277 --> 01:29:11,059
Those are no more here. It is I Who is sitting here,

1087
01:29:11,367 --> 01:29:12,946
so better know Me first,

1088
01:29:13,384 --> 01:29:15,384
and then you will know Them better

1089
01:29:15,574 --> 01:29:17,924
than what you have known Them before.

1090
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:20,803
So let us compromise in this point:

1091
01:29:21,003 --> 01:29:24,274
that try to understand it through Sahaja Yoga.

1092
01:29:24,334 --> 01:29:27,793
Everything can be proved. Whatever I have said is absolute truth,

1093
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:30,045
nothing but the truth.

1094
01:29:30,852 --> 01:29:35,667
But you allow yourself not to be bound by any

1095
01:29:35,761 --> 01:29:38,239
previous ideas and previous conceptions.

1096
01:29:38,395 --> 01:29:41,636
But let it be open mind to see what I've said,

1097
01:29:41,729 --> 01:29:45,089
it's just a hypothesis, let it become a law.

1098
01:29:45,290 --> 01:29:48,752
When you see it yourself, when it becomes in your heart,

1099
01:29:48,846 --> 01:29:52,040
on the vibrations, when you see and judge what I've said,

1100
01:29:52,145 --> 01:29:59,872
you'll be amazed that Nabhi Chakra which you feel on these fingers,

1101
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:02,312
even the children can tell you.

1102
01:30:03,496 --> 01:30:06,884
May God bless you all. Thank you very much.

1103
01:30:09,298 --> 01:30:13,613
Tomorrow I'll tell you about other chakra called

1104
01:30:13,743 --> 01:30:17,784
the Chakra of the Devi, Herself .

1105
01:30:23,178 --> 01:30:26,329
If there are any questions, I've told you, you better write it down.

1106
01:30:26,398 --> 01:30:28,040
It's always worked out very well.

1107
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:32,477
I think now we should go in for meditation and try

1108
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:34,940
to get your Realization.

1109
01:30:45,777 --> 01:30:52,777


1110
01:31:03,691 --> 01:31:06,443
Will you please put your hands towards Me,

1111
01:31:08,514 --> 01:31:11,198
like this, just in humble way.

1112
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:16,034
Because you have not known so far, and you will know it

1113
01:31:16,746 --> 01:31:21,136
when you will know it: So you put your hands towards Me like this

1114
01:31:22,153 --> 01:31:23,661
and as I've told you these are

1115
01:31:23,702 --> 01:31:26,369
five chakras, sixth and seventh chakra is here is on our hands.

1116
01:31:26,913 --> 01:31:28,414
Five chakras, sixth and seventh.

1117
01:31:31,804 --> 01:31:33,075
I must tell you today I met

1118
01:31:33,157 --> 01:31:35,157
some Kashmiri Muslims, that's a good idea.

1119
01:31:35,863 --> 01:31:39,101
Suddenly they did feel for Me something. I don't know how.

1120
01:31:39,812 --> 01:31:41,812
And they said, “Are You the Mother?”

1121
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:44,461
I said, “Yes, I am.” They came to Me

1122
01:31:45,296 --> 01:31:48,471
and then said that “You must tell us about Ruh, about Ruh,

1123
01:31:49,353 --> 01:31:51,295
about spiritual life, about Spirit.”

1124
01:31:52,574 --> 01:31:53,534
They came to Me. I said,

1125
01:31:53,556 --> 01:31:55,162
“All right, you put your hands towards Me like this.”

1126
01:31:55,726 --> 01:31:58,902
They put their hands towards Me and they felt the cool breeze.

1127
01:31:59,442 --> 01:32:02,077
And they said, “This is what it is. Mohammed has said

1128
01:32:02,343 --> 01:32:05,705
that your hands will speak. This is it. That's the truth.”

1129
01:32:07,149 --> 01:32:08,758
I said, “Yes,

1130
01:32:11,731 --> 01:32:13,731
when you have your second birth,

1131
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:16,450
you’ll be rid of all the nonsense of

1132
01:32:16,796 --> 01:32:20,275
these so-called religions which are separating you.

1133
01:32:21,235 --> 01:32:23,421
They were never meant to be separated,

1134
01:32:23,695 --> 01:32:27,192
they were meant to integrate you. But you have done it, doesn't matter.

1135
01:32:27,736 --> 01:32:32,274
Now by God's grace Sahaja Yoga has come, you'll have second birth.

1136
01:32:32,833 --> 01:32:35,220
So all the things that are attached to your birth

1137
01:32:35,696 --> 01:32:41,690
will be finished and you’ll be a new person having a new life in which

1138
01:32:42,045 --> 01:32:46,332
you forget all that is attacking you,

1139
01:32:46,507 --> 01:32:49,649
is attached to you, which is dragging you,

1140
01:32:49,813 --> 01:32:54,608
which is making you think, think, think but not ascend.”

1141
01:32:56,370 --> 01:33:00,673
I'm very happy, these simple Muslims who met Me, they were in a shop

1142
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:04,670
selling something, and they were so sweet and so beautiful.

1143
01:33:08,028 --> 01:33:10,457
They didn't say that “You are not Mohammed.” Nothing of the kind.

1144
01:33:10,513 --> 01:33:12,365
They said, “This is what Mohammed has said,

1145
01:33:12,634 --> 01:33:15,001
that “At the time of the Resurrection, your hands will speak,”

1146
01:33:16,461 --> 01:33:19,951
and what are these people fighting for?”

1147
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:26,982
You see. This is what it is.

1148
01:33:28,766 --> 01:33:30,589
May God bless you all!

1149
01:33:35,650 --> 01:33:39,884
Let us have now both the hands towards Me and close your eyes

1150
01:33:40,038 --> 01:33:42,038
just close your eyes.

1151
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,339
[Shri Mataji gives Realization.]
