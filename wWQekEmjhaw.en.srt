1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:11,530
Woman : … which is the point of evolution 
for all of us and it gives great pleasure

2
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:18,120
to Sahaja Yogis to see so many other people 
coming along to get their Realisation. Because

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:25,300
the experience, once you achieve it makes 
you collectively conscious and puts you in

4
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:32,899
touch in a very real way with the vibrations 
of other people and with your own vibrations

5
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:40,940
of course so that you are able to feel the 
exact condition of your subtle body, and your

6
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:50,350
Spirit, and your chakras, which are these 
colored circles here (that) represent the

7
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:58,460
subtle transformers of energy that are placed 
within us along our sympathetic nervous system.

8
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:09,930
And in the center there, between the yellow 
and blue lines, the area in which the Kundalini

9
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:17,750
energy rises when it’s awaken by the presence 
of another being who already has that awakened

10
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:25,170
within him. And [UNCLEAR] meeting the vibrations 
that are the same as the universal Kundalini

11
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,140
energy.

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:37,330
Kundalini in Christian terms is called the 
Holy Spirit, and it’s the same energy that

13
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:44,320
is described in the New Testament as a “cool 
wind”. In Indians Scriptures it is described

14
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:52,320
as the “Chaitanya”, as “cool vibrations”, 
and in Muslim’s scripture it is called the

15
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:59,000
“Ruh”, and also described as cool vibrations. 
And these cool vibrations that you feel once

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:13,030
you receive the awakening, the vibrations 
of absolute Truth, once you develop this awareness,

17
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:21,879
you are able to ask any absolute question. 
And by holding your hands out you can ask

18
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:30,540
; if you’re () you can ask the existence 
of God. And rather you get a cool or warm

19
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:38,840
vibration you can tell whether what you are 
asking about is true or not true. You do need

20
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,830
to rely of your intellect anymore to try to 
work out things, because that’s a limited

21
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:54,020
sphere of activity. But actually, when you 
get your realisation, you go beyond mere thinking,

22
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,800
into the unlimited, into the divine area.

23
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:12,340
I think it’s a relief to be with people 
who are seeking their Spirit, who do have

24
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:24,360
the desire to know the Divine, and to understand 
those things that, in this society, have almost

25
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:36,110
become [to boo/taboo] subjects. There is so 
much emphasis around this, upbringing on material

26
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:42,650
success and competition, doing better than 
everybody else and achieving things, that

27
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:49,459
the subtles things that are much more important 
get pushed completely into the background.

28
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:56,620
And sometimes we feel, as if we quite at a 
step with everything because we know there’s

29
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,790
an uneasy feeling that there is something 
wrong with the world at the moment, but we

30
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:07,420
can’t put it right ourselves. And it’s 
quite distressing.

31
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:16,970
In my experience once I actually received 
my realisation from Mother two years ago,

32
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:24,810
in Melbourne, at a program like this, I couldn’t 
believe it. That it did actually … That

33
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,630
I had found what I was looking for without 
even quite knowing what it was that I was

34
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:37,150
looking for. And it’s because at first you 
try to understand with your intellect and

35
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:45,030
it doesn’t seems to even make sense. A lot 
of people, their self esteem have been so

36
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:53,250
damaged by their seeking that it’s hard 
to believe that you, yourself, can have this

37
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:58,190
quality within you that is just waiting to 
be awaken.

38
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:11,540
So perhaps before Mataji arrives, it can be 
good if we can all sit quietly, and don’t

39
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:19,199
try to do anything, if you’ve been in the 
habit of doing particular types of meditation

40
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,280
or techniques, just try to put it aside and 
try to have a completely opened mind about

41
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,600
this experience because it is different, although 
the terms may seems familiar to you from readings

42
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,560
and teachings that you’ve had. It’s best 
to sort of try to approach it like a child

43
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,180
with complete openness and freshness. There’s 
nothing frightening about the experience,

44
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:56,540
because it is in fact a gift of God to us, 
and God is compassion and love. And the vibrations

45
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:03,050
that you feel when the Kundalini is awakened 
are those vibrations that come from that Being.

46
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:09,639
And there is nothing to be afraid of although 
some books do say that Kundalini awakening

47
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:16,020
can be dangerous and so on, the people who 
have written that have experienced something

48
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:26,889
quite different. But the actual experience 
should give you peace and joy which is absolute.

49
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:35,290
So if you can just try, just be at peace now 
and quite and then (633) the frame of mind

50
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:44,270
and enjoy the experience when Mother comes. 
Thank you.

51
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:51,639
A man (to Shri mataji)

52
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,660
Shri Mataji (to the man)

53
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:02,759
The man (to the audience) : Again ladies and 
gentlemen, it gives me a great pleasure especially

54
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:11,280
to the [The man stops as Shri Mataji receive 
a bouquet]

55
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:20,880
Shri Mataji : Thank you very much.

56
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,270
The man : Especially for the people who come 
for the first time, there are many who couldn’t

57
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:32,550
come either last evening or today to the workshop, 
to all of you, welcome. Shri Mataji is here,

58
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:39,509
for the first time in Perth to grant Self 
Realisation, not just on a one-to-one basis

59
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:47,580
but to as many people as desired from their 
heart. Many got it last night, some came to

60
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:54,710
the workshop today and experienced something 
more. All of you have to get it because this

61
00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:02,580
is the time where the grace of God is overflowing 
and all of the true seekers of ages have to

62
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:10,050
get Self Realisation. It’s the reward of 
their seeking, it’s the blessing of their

63
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:16,259
past births and all the seeking of God over 
the ages.

64
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:21,639
We’ve all probably been a christian, we’ve 
all been a jew, we’ve all been a muslim.

65
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:30,770
We’ve been worshippers of God the Father 
and God the Mother, at many, many, times in

66
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:38,349
history. And so now the times has come where 
we can get that final step in our evolution

67
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:49,730
which is just to be triggered by an enlightened 
being. And once you get it you can develop

68
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,610
to that point when you become totally one 
with God.

69
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:59,730
This is the real yoga. Yoga as you know means 
“union”, “oneness with God”. It’s

70
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:08,570
not exercises it’s not discipline, it’s 
the actualisation of Self Realisation. And

71
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:14,750
so, without further introduction by me, it 
gives me again a great pleasure, ladies and

72
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:30,630
gentlemen, to introduce to you Her Holiness 
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

73
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:55,779
Shri Mataji : To all the seekers of Truth 
and Joy I bow. It was really nice this morning

74
00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:05,020
to meet some earnest seekers come down to 
the place where I live and to get their ultimate

75
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:16,190
: what they are seeking. We have to know that 
God has created us with a purpose. He has

76
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:26,709
worked for so many years, He hamade us human 
beings with such care and love, there has

77
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:34,480
to be a purpose behind it. We also know that 
we have not yet found our purpose and that’s

78
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:45,769
why we are seeking. If we understand that, 
then one must know that something has to happen.

79
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:55,320
God has to save His creation, and His greatest 
creation is a human being. So this what he

80
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:03,570
has done with all the creation that He tried 
to evolve, and that’s how human beings are

81
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,610
created. 
The only thing was a human being was given

82
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:16,160
freedom to choose between the right and the 
wrong for life. It so happened that human

83
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:23,670
being in their error, naiveness, I should 
say, and ignorance, did lots of mistakes.

84
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:32,260
Doesn’t matter, even if they have done, 
they have come to right conclusion. And that

85
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:37,670
right conclusion as I told you yesterday sums 
up like this : that ‘whatever is going to

86
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:46,700
happen to us, further than this, it has to 
be spontaneous. It’s a living process that

87
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:52,800
made us human being nothing dead— living 
process that has to work it out, that it has

88
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:00,550
to be spontaneous, we can not work it out. 
Secondly, that you can not pay for it, or

89
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:07,490
you can not maneuver it. And thirdly that 
you can not put in any effort, it has to be

90
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:13,529
effortless. If it is has to be the most [UNCLEAR 
1210], is has to be effortless.

91
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:22,860
So that’s how we reach certain conclusions, 
that Self-Realisation, if it is epitome of

92
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:31,050
our evolution, it has to be absolutely freely 
given, and has to happen in a very spontaneous

93
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,360
way.

94
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:40,339
Yesterday I explained to you in short all 
the various type of ideas people have about

95
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:48,839
Self-Realisation, and what we have to expect 
about Self-Realisation. We had another enquiry

96
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:57,690
this morning about Kundalini, that gentleman 
asked me a question saying that he read a

97
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:05,630
book saying that Kundalini business is very 
difficult,it comes upto a point and also not

98
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,579
beyond a point and all sorts of stories.

99
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:18,260
I have to tell you that that’s not true. 
Kundalini is your own Mother. You have your

100
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:25,180
individual Mother. And She is waiting all 
the time all these years just to give you

101
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:31,480
your second birth. She never harms you, She 
never troubles you, She doesn’t do anything

102
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:38,360
of that kind …. I don’t know the people 
who do not know how to do the thing or who

103
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:45,010
have no authority, must be doing all these 
kind of tricks, and must be suffering from

104
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,089
Kundalini awakening.

105
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:53,540
I know of one gentleman, who in Kashmir said 
that he’s got Kundalini awakening and he

106
00:13:53,540 --> 00:14:03,790
had tremendous eat and he had tremendous burning 
and all sort of things. And that it’s a

107
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,279
very dangerous thing. He has written a book 
on that, sort of a … I’m forgetting the

108
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:15,170
name of the book. Now this gentleman himself 
is leading a very horrible life ; of that,

109
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:22,620
I’ve been able to find out. He had all sort 
of relation, he is leading a sort of ridiculous

110
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:29,639
life, not suitable for any saint. If such 
a man has to have Kundalini awakening, I can’t

111
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:36,820
understand how can Kundalini come to him but, 
must be some sort of God’s anger on him

112
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:43,050
that he has felt some kind of feeling within 
Him maybe. Or maybe he has been to somebody

113
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:54,360
who is a wrong type of a person who has awakened 
the Kundalini without any authority and maybe

114
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,160
that time the first Deity as I told you … (To 
Sahaja Yogis) Is it there ? The chart is not

115
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:07,389
there. Ha here. (To the audience) The first 
Deity as I told you, did not like it and got

116
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:12,100
angry and the whole sympathetic nervous system 
on the left hand side and on the right hand

117
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:20,019
side got angry. And when that happen the person 
may develop lots of heat and lots of blisters,

118
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:27,779
I have seen a person getting a blisters all 
over all around his neck.

119
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:42,610
At the very outset I must tell you that heat 
is the sign of violent action. Say for example

120
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:50,350
if you heat the helium gas, the molecules 
of the helium gas start going all round, they

121
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:59,279
are very volatile. They start moving in a 
way that you feel that two armies are fighting,

122
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,519
then you find that en armies are fighting 
then you find that all of them are fighting

123
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,699
with each other. But if you cool it down, 
their action is very collective, they move

124
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:15,760
in a smooth manner in a very collective manner. 
So one can see that when we are heated up

125
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:25,260
also, you see a man is very hot tempered. 
(Which) Means he is a very angry person, and

126
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:32,250
he can not carry on with others, he has no 
patience. But when a person is cool, he is

127
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,620
collected, we say ‘he is a nice person’.

128
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:41,699
In the same way if you feel heat from your 
Kundalini, then be sure that something is

129
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:46,910
wrong that is resisting you. Even while giving 
Realisation in the beginning you do feel little

130
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:54,389
heat because the heat of the body has to go 
out. But today I’m going to tell you particularly

131
00:16:54,389 --> 00:17:02,790
more about the chakras and not about the general 
things that I told you last time. In any case

132
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:07,169
you can get the book, and come to our centers 
and clarify it more and more. But as much

133
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:16,539
as possible today I will try to tell you about 
the chakras : how we spoil them, and what

134
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:25,889
are the effect of these subtle chakras which 
look after our gross plexuses within our body.

135
00:17:25,889 --> 00:17:30,239
17:30 Please be sitted.

136
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:46,330
Now the first chakra as I told you is called 
as the Mooladhara chakra. [Microphone arrangement

137
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:54,429
17:45] Now this i the first center which is 
a subtle center within us. And this plexus

138
00:17:54,429 --> 00:18:04,019
is manifesting about in as your called the 
pelvic plexus. The pelvic plexus is responsible

139
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:11,220
for all our excretions. Whether you like it 
or not it is there, it is present within us

140
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:28,259
and it looks after our excretory functions. 
It is important to see that this chakra is

141
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:36,879
placed under the Kundalini. So when the kundalini 
rises ; the Kundalini is the power within

142
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:46,989
you, the pure power of desire : the desire 
that you want to become one with the Divine.

143
00:18:46,989 --> 00:18:57,840
It lies below. This chakra lies below, it’s 
a very important point, that this chakra does

144
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:06,129
not play any part in the ascent of the Kundalini 
because Kundalini doesn’t pierce through

145
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:14,269
it. On the contrary if this chakra is pure, 
the information about somebody that wants

146
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:23,720
to raise your Kundalini can be easily communicated 
through this this chakra but it does not play

147
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:31,830
any part in our evolution. That means sex 
does not play play part in our evolution.

148
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:40,830
Animal know what sex is, human beings know 
what sex is. Sex is a part very natural within

149
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:49,629
us and for our ascent, the sex does not play 
any part. At the time when the Kundalini rises

150
00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:59,299
; the Kundalini who is the Mother of the deity 
in this center, this Kundalini is the Virgin.

151
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:06,359
So He is looking after the protocol of the 
Virgin. And this Kundalini when She has to

152
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:16,419
rises, if you have by any chance () with this 
chakra, then it takes time for Kundalini to

153
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:24,409
rises because this center has to give permission, 
or you say the sanction that it’s alright

154
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:30,179
then the Kundalini can rises. This is the 
sustaining force, or it’s the center of

155
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:31,299
the Kundalini itself.

156
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:41,659
Now the word Mooladhara means ‘the one who 
is the support of … ’ (to Herself) ‘Moola’

157
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:51,940
is … ‘Moola’ is … (to the audience) 
‘… of the root’. The root is the Kundalini

158
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,200
and it resides is that area which is called 
as Mooladhara while the center is down. And

159
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:02,979
the center is called as ‘Mooladhara Chakra’. 
that’s how you have these two things separated.

160
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:11,419
Now it is important, because it is the sustenance, 
it looks after the protocol of your Kundalini.

161
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:18,450
So anybody who says that you can ascend through 
sex, please be sure you are mislead by that.

162
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:24,119
I do not want to mislead you, I want you to 
have your Self Realisation because you are

163
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:31,039
people who are seekers, not today, you’ve 
been seekers of ages. And no use running after

164
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,729
something because it appeals you on weaknesses 
or because it supports some sort of a thing

165
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:39,019
which you heard before like Freud.

166
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:46,840
What Freud has said is absolutely wrong. Because 
what he has achieved today, you can see clearly

167
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:53,499
that all the societies in the west are finished. 
This is thank to the unholy trinity, and one

168
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:59,149
of them is mister Freud. When I said this 
in Austria people were very happy because

169
00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:03,820
they were feeling guilty for this Freu whom 
they supported always and what he has done

170
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:10,099
: he’s played a mess with everybody’s 
live, he just knew one side of life. Which

171
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:15,849
start from the sex and goes up. That’s only 
the desire. That’s only the desire power

172
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:20,210
but he didn’t know the other side. When 
he talked that you should not be conditioned

173
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:25,129
at all, he did not know that if you did not 
conditioned yourself, then there is another

174
00:22:25,129 --> 00:22:31,149
side which is much more dangerous, and that 
is the side of ego.

175
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:40,820
This is what exactly Hitler did. He used his 
ego, and with this ego like so many such people

176
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:47,109
who are taking ‘there is nothing like conditioning,what’s 
wrong, what’s wrong ?’ and what they achieved

177
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:54,099
is nothing but a very bumptious,, useless 
ego which can not see the Truth. Anybody who

178
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:59,950
that ego, they run after it. They say 
this is your name – big name they give you

179
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:08,859
– or just do this, you look like this, you 
wear this ; you get quite satisfied with this.

180
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:13,739
You have to be honest, if you are not honest 
to it, how will you get your Realisation.

181
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:18,989
You have to be honest to get your Realisation, 
you have to be a human being first and last.

182
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:25,229
if you are not a human being you are just 
trying to do something which is so outside.

183
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:32,349
If you are doing something outside, you can 
not get it inside, you has to happen inside.

184
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:41,489
I feel concerned because you people are realised 
person if you take to reality but if you don’t

185
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:46,070
take to it, what’s going to happen to you 
? Because you are seekers, you are not like

186
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,789
mundane ordinary people, who are not seeking, 
who are just seeking money or possession or

187
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:55,450
thing. You are special people, you are people 
of God who have to become prophets, and you

188
00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:01,779
must have powers to make others prophets as 
William Blake has said about hundreds years

189
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:08,549
back. You are that type of people, and you 
should not waste your energy believe in things

190
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:15,309
which is not true. Because you see the Kundalini 
is placed above that point which we call as

191
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:15,899
sex.

192
00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:22,039
We are not sex points to reduce ourselves 
to sex points is the minimum ; I mean the

193
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:28,629
more degrading things that can happen to human 
beings. We are the highest type of creation

194
00:24:28,629 --> 00:24:35,710
God. Sex, everybody has, even earthworms have, 
any sort of nonsense ahs sex. What so Great

195
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:41,840
about sex ? There is so much we talk about 
sex as if we are impotent people. There is

196
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,849
nothing is sex that can give you your Realisation. 
Of course, you have to lead a sanity … (Shri

197
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:53,759
Mataji correct Herself) You have to understand 
a life of sanity and lead a life of understanding

198
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:54,599
about sex.

199
00:24:54,599 --> 00:25:01,249
Sahaja Yoga is never against sex, we believe 
in sensible marriages, bringing up children

200
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:06,609
who are really realised souls to be born on 
this Earth, that is the thing that we have

201
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:11,979
to achieve. So many great people who want 
to be born. But the people who are going to

202
00:25:11,979 --> 00:25:16,359
give them birth are 
lost into nonsensical things,they are just

203
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:23,669
lost. They have no idea as to the whole, what 
() what role they have to play into it, Just

204
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:28,769
they get lost into their individual understanding 
of a thing. It is not that, you have. You

205
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:33,509
have to understand it’s a very cosmic thing 
that’s happening, and thousands and thousands

206
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:38,840
and thousands of people have to get their 
Realisation, that’s the main thing. If you

207
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:45,929
don’t get your Realisation, I must say all 
the [] of desire of yours is lost forever.

208
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:51,109
So don’t fix your mind into something that 
somebody has screwed into your head because

209
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:58,649
thousands are running after it. Maybe that 
reality can not have thousands, maybe… Millions

210
00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:04,649
we can’t have, I know that. Reality is not 
easy to accept. Never people accepted reality

211
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:05,309
so far.

212
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:10,200
When Christ came in, how they behaved, when 
Buddha came in, how they behaved ? Nobody

213
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,330
does that way. You see, it’s like a horde 
that’s walking towards it, it’s not a

214
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:21,169
shoal of fishes walking towards it, it’s 
not a big mob walking towards it, it’s every

215
00:26:21,169 --> 00:26:27,139
person that has to receive the Realisation. 
And you have to pay full attention to it.

216
00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:32,309
You have to respect yourself and know that 
you are a seeker and as a seeker you all must

217
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:37,700
get your Realisation otherwise you have no 
meaning no purpose nothing. And if you join

218
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:44,690
any purpose let pursue I would say : I’ve 
told with all earnestness and with all my

219
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:51,889
love. But if you don’t want to understand 
it, nobody can force you Realisation. So please

220
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:57,590
understand that first thing is to get your 
Realisation. If you can’t get your Realisation,

221
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,979
then you have lost the biggest chance of your 
life.

222
00:27:00,979 --> 00:27:05,929
You all have to become your Spirit, your Self, 
and this (Shri Mataji shows the subtle system

223
00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:11,999
chart) is the great instrument God have placed 
within you. And it is the greatest knowledge

224
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:18,269
of the roots. Of the roots within us. And 
this knowledge, you have to understand first

225
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:23,609
of all, you need not accepted it, but you 
should not deny. With opened mind, listen

226
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:29,749
to me as what happens and how these chakras 
are within us and how they react and how we

227
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:30,629
falter. 2730

228
00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:36,369
So one of the first things I have to tell 
you that sex plays no part in Kundalini ascent

229
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:42,059
as far as its piercing is concerned, it means 
it doesn’t have to pass through that. Whatever

230
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:48,679
is the Truth I have to tell you. You may not 
like it but I have to tell you. I am not here

231
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:53,690
to seek votes or to have elections or to collect 
money out of you, I don’t want to buy Rolls

232
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:58,389
Royces, nothing of the kind. I just here to 
give you what you have, what is your own.

233
00:27:58,389 --> 00:28:04,320
I am just here to give you that : what is 
your own, what your own property. So it does

234
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,869
not matter also if you don’t like it for 
the time being, but ultimately you’ll like

235
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:12,159
because you will know Mother has told us the 
Truth.

236
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:18,369
Now the Swadisthana chakra, the second chakra 
within us, is also very important. This Swadisthana

237
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:25,099
chakra plays a very very important part in 
our lives (when) in the modern times specially.

238
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:32,369
Because this is the center we use for planning, 
thinking, for all our futuristic life. As

239
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:40,529
well as doing all sort of physical work. This 
center is the one that crete balances as well

240
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:47,029
as imbalances. If you use this center in the 
wrong way you create an imbalance within you,

241
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:52,869
of a very very serious nature. This center 
for example, Swadhisthana looks after your

242
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:59,489
aortic plexus in the gross. Aortic plexus 
doctors know what it is, but this center is

243
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:05,729
placed in the … longeta, inside the spinal 
cord.

244
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:15,489
Now with this center we think about the future, 
or we can think about the past, we put in

245
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:21,219
physical work also with this center. So it 
move to the right as well as to the left,

246
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:25,529
it is dangling in the air, it’s the only 
center which moves on both the sides in such

247
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:33,679
a big periphery, all round and it can also 
retract and can go further within. Now when

248
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,729
we have an imbalance in this, we really do 
not realise that we are leading an imbalanced

249
00:29:39,729 --> 00:29:43,769
life ‘til we get into a serious trouble.

250
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:51,989
This center has got to look after your liver, 
your kidney, your spleen, your pancreas, and

251
00:29:51,989 --> 00:30:01,739
your uterus. Plus it has a very important 
work that, when you think too much, the brain’s

252
00:30:01,739 --> 00:30:06,489
cells are used up, to replace the brain’s 
cells from the fat cells from the stomach,

253
00:30:06,489 --> 00:30:12,399
it transforms the fat cells for the use of 
the brain. And this is a very important work

254
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:21,009
it has to do. – (to a yogi on stage) Can 
you put on this one please ? – Now when

255
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:29,839
this chakra works more for thinking or planning 
this, that, it neglects its other work which

256
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:38,019
is also equally important like liver, and 
your pancreas, and your kidneys, your spleen.

257
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:42,979
And thus we develop diseases of liver, of 
all these organs.

258
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:50,279
All of this liver troubles come to us because 
of its overactivity, also it can come to us

259
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:58,749
because of inactivity of the liver. It can 
come to us from both the types of liver. Now

260
00:30:58,749 --> 00:31:05,779
if you have an active liver, a very active 
liver, you develop a funny diseases called

261
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:14,070
biliousness : your attention is always unhappy 
and you feel like vomiting all the time you

262
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:20,059
are irritable and you have a temperament that 
you don’t feel the peace within yourself.

263
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:25,580
This is that, that means your attention is 
absolutely disturbed because the liver it

264
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:31,690
the one that really sustain your attention. 
So when your liver is out, your attention

265
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,379
is funny you don’t know what to do with 
your attention and all the time it’s terrible

266
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:45,789
and you feel very nervous and agitated and 
anxious. And then, doctors do not know at

267
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:54,489
this stage I think, it’s liver which is 
bad. So what they do is to use something to

268
00:31:54,489 --> 00:32:00,690
find out about liver, what’s wrong with 
the liver but when they try to do that, it’s

269
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:07,419
not so easy to find out, till you find the 
patient is lying just at the deathbed with

270
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:12,729
a sirose and then they certify “Now you 
are going to die”. But in Sahaja Yoga, if

271
00:32:12,729 --> 00:32:18,309
you have a liver (problem), at the very outset, 
you can make it out, that you have liver (problem)

272
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:23,679
because as you know on the fingers, it can 
be felt where the liver is, and if you see

273
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,139
that if this center of Swadhisthana chakra 
is catching (Shri Mataji shows the right hand

274
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:29,959
thumb) with this center of Nabhi chakra (She 
shows her middle finger) then it means you

275
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:37,450
have bad liver. And this liver is a very serious 
thing because it makes a personality absolutely

276
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:42,320
useless for any communication after sometimes.

277
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:50,109
Another thing is the neglect of other center 
, let say your spleen. This a very serious

278
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:55,429
thing because if you are very hectic by temperament, 
and if you are all the time thinking of future

279
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:59,479
”I have to go, “I have to attend the office”, 
“I have to do this, I have to do that”

280
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:07,469
(at) that time, this center, as we call it 
the ‘left Nabhi center’, gets excited.

281
00:33:07,469 --> 00:33:15,419
And it hasn’t got, we should say, it has 
got that ‘attention’ that it requires,

282
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:21,499
so it becomes very hectic itself. It goes 
into an emergency. All the time attending

283
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:27,499
to an emergency, it is producing more and 
more red blood corpses and you become absolutely

284
00:33:27,499 --> 00:33:31,229
hectic. For example first thing in the morning 
people read the newspaper. First shock comes

285
00:33:31,229 --> 00:33:35,700
to them from the newspapers : “Somebody 
died”, “Something happened”, “Some

286
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:41,339
horrible things happened” ; naturally the 
poor spleen goes into action and it starts

287
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:45,779
producing red blood corpses. (At) That you 
start having your breakfast for example, so

288
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:50,879
also additional emergency, then you are suddenly 
rushing out. On the way you see lots of this

289
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:55,019
traffic and you have to catch up with the 
time and all that. All this modern life makes

290
00:33:55,019 --> 00:34:01,999
you that hectic, nervous, hasty we can say 
and a speedy person.

291
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:09,399
This spleen ; actually the speedometer is 
your spleen, so poor spleen goes into a bizarre

292
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:16,460
state. It can not control your speed, and 
it tries to keep the speed with you, your

293
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:23,970
hectic nature and it becomes hectic itself. 
And then a disease which we call as leukemia,

294
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:29,419
blood cancer can develop. Blood cancer is 
the result of this kind of temperament and

295
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:30,329
nature.

296
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:36,210
There are many children who get blood cancer. 
I’ve seen many children suffering from blood

297
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:41,510
cancer. And these children get it from those 
parents who are like this, ‘hectic ways’,

298
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:46,299
who are anxious “we must go to the office”, 
“we must do this”, “We must get that”

299
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:52,079
; so many things at the same time. Such people 
get this trouble called leukemia and (which)

300
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:57,740
is absolutely curable through Sahaja Yoga. 
It is absolutely curable through Sahaja Yoga.

301
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:04,539
It’s not difficult to cure leukemia, but 
you have to continue with the practice of

302
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:10,150
Sahaja Yoga so that you absolutely get cured, 
and that you can cure the leukemia of other

303
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,240
people.

304
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,630
Another thing that can happen to you is the 
kidney trouble. You see the kidney becomes

305
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:22,589
overactive. The activity in the kidney too 
much create a problem within us which we call

306
00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:27,839
as hypertension. By which we get high blood 
pressures and things like that. People always

307
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,010
say “I suffer from high blood pressure.” 
Doctor Warren himself when he came to Me,

308
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:37,869
was a patient of high blood pressure and many 
other problems. But after Sahaja Yoga you

309
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:41,019
settle down, you find you strike the balance.

310
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:46,539
You strike the balance because you don’t 
think so much. The thinking that goes on like

311
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:52,140
mad stops. If you want to think you can think. 
If you don’t want to think, you don’t

312
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:58,240
think, you can stop it and sleep, but if you 
want to think, you can think. When I met a

313
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,000
doctor, in Geneva he said : “Cut my throat, 
do want you like, but stop this thinking”.

314
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,900
You see it’s so disgusting for some people, 
because even if I don’t what to think this

315
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:12,309
brain goes on “chuk chuk chuk chuk” like 
that troubling me so much. But it is because

316
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:17,789
of this center which has got out of its balance, 
and it doesn’t know how to control, and

317
00:36:17,789 --> 00:36:26,079
that’s why these things happen. Then also 
women who think too much can become (…) They

318
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,869
may not produce any children. It’s possible 
that they can become barren women because

319
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:37,180
there is no nourishment to that uterus and 
maybe they can develop troubles of the uterus.

320
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:44,269
All this troubles come from this over thinking, 
futuristic attitude, speediness in life. One

321
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:46,210
of them is diabetes

322
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:53,289
Now diabetes will not occur to any ordinary 
farmer who doesn’t think so much. But it

323
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:58,640
will always happen to a man who is thinking 
about a big plan, of how to project himself,

324
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,769
his business plan or his other plans, all 
such people get diabetes. The reason is he

325
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:10,720
think so much that there is no attention left 
to that poor pancreas, the pancreas gets seek,

326
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,869
and that’s how we get this disease of diabetes 
which supposed to be incurable, not by Sahaja

327
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:22,260
Yoga. In sahaja Yoga, diabetes is absolutely 
curable. Jaundice and all these diseases of

328
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,200
the liver are also absolutely curable in Sahaja 
Yoga.

329
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:31,019
By giving the balance to the people you can 
achieve a lot, because this is what all the

330
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:39,099
prophets told us : that we should lead a life 
of moderation, not to go to extremes. If you

331
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:46,079
go to extremes, then you are not dharmic, 
(which) means you are not sustaining yourself

332
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:54,140
properly. These are ten valences within us, 
in the human beings. In the carbon, there

333
00:37:54,140 --> 00:38:01,470
are four valences as you know. In every element 
there are eight valances, and these valences

334
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:08,329
become ten valences in the human beings. Now 
these are the ten dharmas as they call it,

335
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:15,000
or the ten kind of sustenance or ten kind 
of behaviour we have got to look after. If

336
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,240
you do not keep that balance of these ten 
things, then we go off the balance. Like Buddha

337
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,930
has told you that “you have to keep to the 
central path of ascent” that what exactly

338
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:31,160
it is, that we have to keep to the central 
path of ascent if we can not keep to the central

339
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:36,750
path of ascent then we suffer from, first 
of all, the physical problems.

340
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:43,190
First of all we suffer from the physical problems 
then we suffer also from mental problem because

341
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:48,539
we go into an imbalance. Now when this chakra 
moves to the left side, we get into mental

342
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:56,160
problems. Because when it goes to the left 
side what happens is that we start using things

343
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:03,289
[like] for our emotional behaviour and emotional 
expressions and to much of it. As a result

344
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:10,779
of that, what happens to us (is) that we become 
possessed by another force that resides beyond

345
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:16,130
this center. And beyond this center resides 
the collective subconscious.

346
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:21,529
This collective subconscious is a very dangerous 
area where people should not enter. Any person

347
00:39:21,529 --> 00:39:26,910
who says “I’m very devoted, I’m very 
dedicated, I must do this” without getting

348
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:33,769
connection with the God, if you do all these 
things, your whole attention can be ruined.

349
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:38,970
For example supposing there is a telephone 
and you are not connected and you are using

350
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:43,380
the telephone very fast then what will happen 
is that the telephone will go out of order,

351
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:50,250
and you will have no connection. In the same 
way who earnestly try to do something without

352
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:55,480
having connection with God, move to the left 
side which is called as the collective subconscious

353
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:03,400
area. And this is a very dangerous area within 
us. From there many things, which the doctors

354
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:10,410
call as ‘protein 58’, but we call them 
as dead souls, are attacking. Doctors call

355
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:17,200
it as protein 58 because they don’t know 
what they are. They this protein comes from

356
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:25,309
areas which are unknown but existed within 
us since the day of creation. That means it

357
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:32,640
is collective subconscious. And these protein, 
52 — 58 they have tried to even photograph

358
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:42,660
it and they that when they attack us, then 
only cancer is triggered. But the … of the

359
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,890
cancer is created by our extreme behaviour.

360
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:52,589
How cancer is created, we should try to understand. 
For example the left side and the right side,

361
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:57,640
as I told you there are two powers left and 
right side powers which we work out. For example

362
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:03,609
the emotional on the left, and on the right 
hand side, we have a power which we call as

363
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:10,670
‘the power of action’ where your physical 
and your mental efforts are expressed. Now

364
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:16,119
when we go to the extreme of these, then what 
happens the connection between the left and

365
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:23,599
right breaks, just breaks. And when it breaks 
you start getting the power on its own, because

366
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:30,220
it breaks the connection with the whole. So 
it is very arbitrary, it is not coordinated,

367
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:35,339
it doesn’t cooperate with the whole body, 
it just starts growing by itself. And then

368
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:40,049
one cell becomes big or a cell in the nose 
start becoming big and starts covering the

369
00:41:40,049 --> 00:41:49,039
whole face. There’s no relationship between 
the different organs and different parts of

370
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:56,880
the face, it just starts growing, overpowering 
other cells, and that’s how we call it a

371
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,890
malignant growth or a malignant cell. Now 
when you go on like that what happens : it

372
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:09,180
breaks ; and the Deity, the One which controls 
it, the One which is inside it, just slips

373
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:16,009
off. At that time, the best thing would bo 
to awaken that Deity. If you awaken the Deity,

374
00:42:16,009 --> 00:42:21,599
the whole thing comes back and that’s how 
we can cure the cancer of people. It’s true

375
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,670
Sahaja Yoga can cure cancer ; I’ve been 
telling this for the last, I don’t know,

376
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:30,819
the last twelve years or so : “It’s only 
through Sahaja Yoga, cancer will be cured”.

377
00:42:30,819 --> 00:42:36,710
Now we have many doctors that are doing cancer 
research and all that. We have one Dr. [Shrivardhar

378
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:42,210
CHECK SPELLING – 42:30], who is doing a 
research now on cancer, and he has accepted

379
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:47,500
this, it is only Sahaja Yoga (that) will cure 
cancer, otherwise nothing can cure it. Because

380
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:53,359
when human beings go to the extreme to the 
right or to the left, they do this to themselves

381
00:42:53,359 --> 00:43:00,039
and they are vulnerable to be triggered by 
some sort of a protein, which enters into

382
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:05,220
your being and triggers this cancer. That’s 
why doctors they can remove your ear, they

383
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:09,480
can remove your nose, they can remove this, 
they can remove that but they can’t remove

384
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:15,089
the base of cancer and the base of cancer 
is the center, the subtle center., And to

385
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:22,579
attack that subtle center, one has to become 
a subtle person. Doctors have to become self

386
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:23,819
realised so that they can attack

387
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:30,829
In Sahaja Yoga we have many Doctors. Some 
are russians, some are english, some are indians

388
00:43:30,829 --> 00:43:35,910
and they are all working it out together. 
Maybe that we may be able to publish a book

389
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:42,279
on ‘How to cure cancer with Sahaja Yoga’ 
or ‘How we have cured cancer with Sahaja

390
00:43:42,279 --> 00:43:49,890
Yoga’. But the main thing is that we are 
not here to cure people, not to give cure

391
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:54,750
to everyone every dicomentaria [SPELLING UNSURE 
43:50] as we call it, but we are here to give

392
00:43:54,750 --> 00:44:04,069
you realisation. God’s interest is in people 
who are seeking God, who are God’s people,

393
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:09,210
He’s not interested in devils. Supposing 
tomorrow, Hitler gets cancer, God won’t

394
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:16,769
be interested in curing him. So God’s interest 
is in people who are seeking Him and those

395
00:44:16,769 --> 00:44:22,829
who get enlightenment, and after their enlightenment 
they can give light to others. God doesn’t

396
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:27,200
bother about people who are just wasteful, 
who are good for nothing. He has to look after

397
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:34,420
the people who really will take up the cause 
of God and do His work after getting cured.

398
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:39,119
Now we had a patient, today, this morning, 
who came to us, who went to some horrible

399
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:47,480
guru, and paid a lot of money to get epilepsy 
and then a brain cancer. Now with Sahaja Yoga

400
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:52,079
he is very much cure. He is walking about 
; of course doctors had given up hope, that

401
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:58,589
‘prepare for his death’ in your Perth, 
we have got a case here. He’s now completely

402
00:44:58,589 --> 00:45:05,119
cured, he talks well, he walks well and everything 
is going on well with him, but for this, he

403
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:11,839
had to come to Sahaja Yoga. God is not going 
to fall at your feet : ‘O, please listen

404
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:17,069
to Me, you are very sick and you must get 
well, and this should happen’, God is not

405
00:45:17,069 --> 00:45:22,039
interested, you have to have to be interested 
in Him that is one thing, ‘You have to be

406
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:26,200
interested’. (Lets) Say your prime minister, 
if you want to meet him, he’s not going

407
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:30,119
to come and say ‘Alright, come and see me, 
I want to meet you, please come’. You have

408
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:34,200
to [want him /UNSURE], he’s just a prime 
minister. But this (the One) I’m talking

409
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,589
about is the prime minister of all the prime 
ministers, the highest of all. So you have

410
00:45:38,589 --> 00:45:43,400
to be interested about God, you have to get 
to Him, you have to ask for it otherwise,

411
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,759
He’s not going to fall at your feet, that’s 
important to understand.

412
00:45:46,759 --> 00:45:52,480
Now this center, which I’ve told you about 
(was) ”Swadhisthana”. Now the next center

413
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:58,119
is the center of Nabhi. They have already 
explain to you what is Nabhi Chakra, but you

414
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:03,670
should what diseases are called by a bad Nabhi 
Chakra. First it is on the left hand side

415
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:09,630
and right and side. There are two types of 
people : left Nabhi and right Nabhi. The people

416
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:14,119
who suffer from right Nabhi are the people 
who have got all the problems of the liver.

417
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:25,140
There was a gentleman who was writing as thesis 
on alcohol. ‘What is the chemical reaction

418
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:34,119
on liver when we take alcohol ?’. And through 
Sahaja Yoga only he realised what happened

419
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:41,809
actually to this (liver). That water as you 
know is ‘H2O’, H ion are on both the sides

420
00:46:41,809 --> 00:46:46,000
and ‘O’ is here is bound by that (Shri 
Mataji joins Her hands before Her like a roof

421
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,440
showing O at the top H on both sides) “H2O” 
: there are two ‘H’ and one ‘O’. Now

422
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:53,430
when you start taking water, it (the molecule) 
keeps normal like that (Shri Mataji has Her

423
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,200
hands joined in one line, the middle fingers 
touch each others) when the blood and the

424
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:00,769
water comes in contact with the liver. The 
liver has the function to take away all the

425
00:47:00,769 --> 00:47:07,410
poison in the body as heat, it absorbs the 
heat and then transfers it as biles and it

426
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:14,299
goes out of your system. But if you take (let’s) 
say alcohol and all these things in a very

427
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:18,720
strong way, not in moderation and it’s too 
much, its ‘H’ (of the water molecule)

428
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,309
goes down like this (Shri Mataji now shows 
Her hands like a high roof, the hand are close

429
00:47:21,309 --> 00:47:24,380
to one and other but only the fingertips are 
in contact) and when it goes near the liver,

430
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:29,529
(the) liver can not suck in the heat, it can 
not suck in the heat. That’s how, the heat

431
00:47:29,529 --> 00:47:35,249
is accumulated, the liver goes on malfunctioning, 
and you’ll always have the trouble of the

432
00:47:35,249 --> 00:47:38,029
liver. Now supposing you in Sahaja Yoga, then 
the H starts moving like that (Shri Mataji

433
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:41,160
turns Her hands in the opposite direction, 
all Her fingertips are pointed towards Herself)

434
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,779
and all that is heat within you is passed 
into the liver.

435
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:48,789
You’ll be amazed when you will be doing 
Sahaja Yoga just now, we’ll be raising the

436
00:47:48,789 --> 00:47:54,029
Kundalini, in the beginning, lot of heat will 
be coming out of your head before you start

437
00:47:54,029 --> 00:47:58,759
feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. 
First, the heat from the liver will be pouring

438
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:02,359
out, and you’ll feel very relieved when 
it’s poured out. And then you will start

439
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:07,259
feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost 
in your hands which is the all pervading power

440
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:12,430
of God as I told you and first time after 
realisation, you can feel that cool breeze

441
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:14,049
within you.

442
00:48:14,049 --> 00:48:21,460
Now this chakra gets spoiled on the subtle 
when you are very money oriented. If you are

443
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:26,249
very money oriented person, and you are always 
thinking about money, how to get money like

444
00:48:26,249 --> 00:48:31,259
mad, it’s a rat race for money then this 
center goes out. And when this center goes

445
00:48:31,259 --> 00:48:37,529
out, the person suffer from many troubles, 
not from money troubles maybe, but other troubles

446
00:48:37,529 --> 00:48:43,650
like he’s emotionally dried out, he becomes 
an unemotional person. He becomes a person

447
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:51,749
who has no feeling for anyone. You must have 
heard about the Great [decoids UNSURE] in

448
00:48:51,749 --> 00:48:57,769
India, there is a lady, who was a [decoid 
/ UNSURE], a small little lady of four feet

449
00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:02,930
height, and she was a person (who) was devoid 
of any emotions, she could kill anybody, she

450
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:08,660
could do anything as long as she got the money. 
I mean the whole emotional side is completely

451
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:13,559
blocked of such a person, who thinks too much 
of money all the time, and gradually he becomes

452
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:22,569
very materialistic. And a person who is materialistic 
neglects his heart all the time, he neglects

453
00:49:22,569 --> 00:49:28,680
his emotions, his worried more about the carpets, 
more about this more about that than the emotions

454
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:33,859
of the people than the feelings of the people. 
This kind of imbalance can come when your

455
00:49:33,859 --> 00:49:40,200
Nabhi chakra goes out of order and you start 
putting all your attention to money.

456
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:46,119
Now it’s more surprising the countries which 
are affluent have more money orientation than

457
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:51,990
the people who are not. It’s very surprising. 
(Let’s) Say for example in an indian village,

458
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:56,390
a person may not have so many things as you 
people have, but if you go to him, he’ll

459
00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:01,730
be very happy, whatever he has, he would like 
to serve you, his food, anything that he has.

460
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:07,190
We would not like to see that you have not 
taken your food or your milk or something

461
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:13,819
[UNCLEAR] He’ll feel so obliged that ‘you 
go and to serve you him’ with that joy and

462
00:50:13,819 --> 00:50:20,049
that love that he has. He would like to express 
his love. Now people misunderstand. I’ve

463
00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:24,069
seen people which are affluent misunderstand, 
they think it’s a slavishness, it is not.

464
00:50:24,069 --> 00:50:29,660
It is that they find joy in emotional life, 
in expressing their joy. To them it doesn’t

465
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:33,269
matter, if he has to starve for the day, doesn’t 
matter. If he has given you food, He feel

466
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:39,249
that’s his satisfaction ‘O God, he’s 
eating at my place, so sweet of him’. There

467
00:50:39,249 --> 00:50:44,529
is no slavishness, but it’s a kind of expression 
of that love. But in the west I found that

468
00:50:44,529 --> 00:50:48,829
people say that if you do that to somebody 
then people misunderstand, they think you

469
00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:53,339
are a weak person “That’s a sign of your 
weakness”. I mean I was amazed, how can

470
00:50:53,339 --> 00:50:54,230
it be ?

471
00:50:54,230 --> 00:51:01,049
I live in an area that is supposed to be [poor 
…/…] very very rich people live there,

472
00:51:01,049 --> 00:51:09,069
very rich people. Once it was snowing, snowing 
very heavily in that area. We were shifting

473
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:14,999
that very same day so I went round, there 
is a square where we leave, so I went around

474
00:51:14,999 --> 00:51:21,869
the square, and I deposited some things. I 
saw a lady standing outside with a little

475
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:25,700
baby in a pram, and (then) another lady had 
opened her door a little bit and talking to

476
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:31,700
her there and the little baby was in the pram, 
and it was snowing. Can you imagine, and this

477
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,690
lady was talking. I came back after half an 
hour and this lady was still talking like

478
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:41,960
this she wouldn’t open the door. And they 
are extremely rich people. I can’t understand,

479
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:48,369
how can a person with a little baby is in 
the pram. They hate children there. I’ve

480
00:51:48,369 --> 00:51:54,749
seen in that area, the people just hate their 
children, they beat them so badly. I’m amazed,

481
00:51:54,749 --> 00:51:58,609
they give them to the servants and the servants 
look after the children. In England you’ll

482
00:51:58,609 --> 00:52:04,440
be amazed that two children are killed by 
their parents every week. First I used to

483
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:09,809
think it is England, but it is not so it only 
in London this is happening. Can you believe

484
00:52:09,809 --> 00:52:14,359
a thing like that ? I mean in India I can’t 
think of one woman doing that. So emotionally

485
00:52:14,359 --> 00:52:19,279
they are very strong people, but they lack 
(of) other things which you have which is

486
00:52:19,279 --> 00:52:24,779
to be combine with east and west has to be 
brought to a balance. It should be about “emotional

487
00:52:24,779 --> 00:52:28,359
life”, that you want to have more children 
and more children. That’s why more children

488
00:52:28,359 --> 00:52:32,599
are born in that country (India) : they like 
to have more children apart from that, they

489
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:36,059
are the only people that look after their 
children so well, so all children want to

490
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:40,089
be born there also. They would not like be 
born in those places where the mothers are

491
00:52:40,089 --> 00:52:45,380
very ‘hotty’ and angry for only a carpet 
being spoilt or something if the children

492
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:49,559
[UNCLEAR]. Naturally they would like to be 
born with parents which natural, which are

493
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:54,390
sweet to them, and that must be one of the 
reasons, why we are suffering from overpopulation.

494
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:59,859
While in Germany it is minus, in London it 
is minus, you go to Norway, it is minus, (if)

495
00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:05,309
it is Sweden it is minus. On top of that people 
are committing suicides, they are competing

496
00:53:05,309 --> 00:53:12,119
among themselves : “Who is [UNCLEAR] ?”. For 
example if you go to … First I heard that

497
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:15,970
it is Sweden where people were committing 
suicide more but now Switzerland has taken

498
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:23,299
over and they have doubled to number of people 
that are committing suicides, I can’t understand.

499
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:27,279
I heard about three girls from Cambridge, 
which came from Switzerland and they came

500
00:53:27,279 --> 00:53:32,599
to me and their vibration were like [of] dead 
people, absolutely numb. I was shocked, these

501
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:37,410
young girls between let’s say sixteen or 
twenty, something like that : why should they

502
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:43,349
not have that feeling of exuberance, that 
joy within them bubbling with life, such young

503
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:48,630
girls. And I ask them ‘You come and see 
me in the house’, I mean I was really surprised.

504
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:53,230
When they came to see me I asked them ‘What 
are you doing ?’ they say ‘Mother to tell

505
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:58,220
you the truth we are just planning how to 
commit suicide’. Can you believe it ? It’s

506
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:05,220
such a tragic thing ! Young girls just planning 
how to commit suicide but I said ‘WHY ? What

507
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:09,460
is so much ?’ (they said) ‘Nobody gives 
us love, nobody loves us’ there is no love.

508
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:14,249
‘We’ve got money, we’ve got everything, 
we are daughters of rich families, but there

509
00:54:14,249 --> 00:54:19,480
is no love, and that’s how we want to commit 
suicide.’ Just imagine. This is what is

510
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:25,349
happening when one goes too much into materialism. 
Matter can never give us joy, take it from

511
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:31,809
Me. It is also an economic science that the 
material things can not give you satisfaction

512
00:54:31,809 --> 00:54:36,249
in general. They can give you a particular 
thing then you buy now you buy this, alright

513
00:54:36,249 --> 00:54:40,150
then you want to buy that, then you want to 
buy something else. But in general they are

514
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:45,720
not satiable, that means “matter can not 
give joy”. … I do not say that you can

515
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:50,489
not use the matter. You can use the matter 
for your purpose also when you know how to

516
00:54:50,489 --> 00:54:55,869
give it to others. That the joy of matter 
is in giving. Perhaps we have missed the point,

517
00:54:55,869 --> 00:55:01,160
but after Sahaja Yoga you will know that the 
joy of matter is only felt when you see the

518
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:09,049
beauty of matter and when you see what it 
is to give to others. To give to others. It’s

519
00:55:09,049 --> 00:55:13,940
not for yourself that you can’t ever enjoy 
but only by giving (to) others, you enjoy

520
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:14,519
the matter.

521
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:20,069
Alright, that’s going to a very subtle point, 
but that is what happens to you. That you

522
00:55:20,069 --> 00:55:26,980
become extremely generous, and as a result 
of that you enjoy the bliss and happiness

523
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:32,839
and your own generosity within yourself. I’m 
supposed to be extremely generous and sometimes

524
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:36,869
Sahaja Yogis are quite worried about Me that 
by the time I return I’ll be finishing with

525
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:40,829
all my saris and nothing will be left out 
of that, they are telling Me all the time

526
00:55:40,829 --> 00:55:46,339
‘Mother be careful, You are extremely generous’. 
But I enjoy My generosity, I do not enjoy

527
00:55:46,339 --> 00:55:50,359
these possessions so called (more) than My 
generosity because if have a possession it’s

528
00:55:50,359 --> 00:55:53,989
a headache, you have to go to the insurance, 
you have to worry that if you should be kept

529
00:55:53,989 --> 00:55:57,759
alright. It’s better to give it to somebody 
else and seen on other people than to have

530
00:55:57,759 --> 00:56:01,380
your own. If you own it, it’s a headache 
to you but if you give it to others it’s

531
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:05,450
nice. You enjoy it alright, you enjoy this 
hall very well without owning it, if you have

532
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:07,130
to own it, it would have been a headache for 
you to go up there (Shri Mataji looks at the

533
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:12,029
roof of the hall) and look after everything, 
isn’t ? It’s better not to own it, let

534
00:56:12,029 --> 00:56:15,730
others have the headache, and let’s have 
the enjoyment. That’s what is the policy

535
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:18,730
in Sahaja Yoga (which) you try adopt.

536
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:24,589
So now we have another center which is very 
important, it’s the center of ‘heart’,

537
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:30,799
“center heart” we called it. It’s the 
center of the Mother of the Universe. In sanskrit

538
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:35,880
she is called as “Jagadamba”. She is the 
One who stays there and gives you the sense

539
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:41,619
of security. She looks after the saints who 
are trying to go out of this green thing (Shri

540
00:56:41,619 --> 00:56:43,920
Mataji speaks about the Void around the Nabhi) 
we call it as the ‘ocean of illusions’.

541
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:49,019
She protects them, She gives them all the 
help, all the guidance and tries to pull them

542
00:56:49,019 --> 00:56:56,170
out of the illusion, and this is the way She 
kills all the devils and the demons who are

543
00:56:56,170 --> 00:57:03,239
like fake gurus who try to put down the seekers 
into the illusion more. She the One who is

544
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:09,569
the remover of illusions and this incarnates 
again and again on this earth to help the

545
00:57:09,569 --> 00:57:19,730
seekers to get out of the ‘ocean of illusion’. 
But when this center as in childhood, it starts

546
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:27,460
pulsating first. The sternum bone creates 
lots of antibodies and these are actually

547
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:33,489
the soldiers of the Mother, and they go and 
get distributed in the whole body. When you

548
00:57:33,489 --> 00:57:38,460
see something coming up on you, you get a 
fear, and you get a palpitation in here (at

549
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:46,400
the chest level). The rhythm of these palpitations 
informs the antibodies to be alert, to fight

550
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:51,769
the person who is trying to attack. And that’s 
why it is important to understand that this

551
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:58,269
center builds up your sense of security. If 
this center is disturbed, your sense of security

552
00:57:58,269 --> 00:57:59,789
can be disturbed.

553
00:57:59,789 --> 00:58:06,589
Now the disease of this center is mainly breast 
cancer. When a woman is insecure in her life,

554
00:58:06,589 --> 00:58:12,499
feels insecure, then she develops this trouble. 
When she is insecure as a mother, she gets

555
00:58:12,499 --> 00:58:17,480
this trouble of breast cancer. Now doctors 
won’t believe it, but I have cured many

556
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:26,619
breast cancers and that can easily be cured 
by awakening this special power of the motherhood

557
00:58:26,619 --> 00:58:34,460
within you, you just become self confident, 
and the diseases, completely cured, eradicated,

558
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:38,109
without going into any operation or anything 
like that.

559
00:58:38,109 --> 00:58:41,440
There are two other centers you see (at the 
center heart level), the one on the right

560
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,989
right is of your own Father, on the right 
is of your own Mother ; or we can say it of

561
00:58:46,989 --> 00:58:52,259
fatherhood and of motherhood. If you are having 
a bad father or if your father has been not

562
00:58:52,259 --> 00:58:58,569
nice to you, this center suffers. If this 
center suffers then you get the disease called

563
00:58:58,569 --> 00:59:05,210
asthma. Asthma can only be cured if you tell 
the person who is a Sahaja Yogi, about ‘your

564
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:10,170
father, where the problem is, if the father 
has died, he suddenly died, if you are missing

565
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:16,130
him, or if there is a problem with your own 
child’ anything like that : the quality

566
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:22,660
of fatherhood is [UNCLEAR 59:17] by that. 
The left side is is the mother’s thing,

567
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:27,960
if the mother is not being very kind to the 
child, the child can be erated and could be

568
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:34,109
very volcanic and temperamental. Very temperamental 
he becomes. If he [had] not see his mother,

569
00:59:34,109 --> 00:59:41,380
or the mother has been a very unkind person 
then such a person can be absolutely insecure

570
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:48,259
all the time and could be all the time demanding 
attention from others and would be very very

571
00:59:48,259 --> 00:59:53,609
aggressive on that point. So this is what 
it is, one has to understand, that these two

572
00:59:53,609 --> 00:59:55,680
centers within us are important.

573
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:00,519
After Sahaja Yoga, you start understanding 
your parents even if they have been very nasty

574
01:00:00,519 --> 01:00:05,829
to you, you try to forgive them and they also 
come round very well and good relations are

575
01:00:05,829 --> 01:00:10,980
established with parents. Because you are 
seekers, sometimes the parents don’t understand

576
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:15,390
you : because they have no seeking, that’s 
the [age/H 1:00:14] which may not understand

577
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:21,489
your seeking. But when they see this transformation 
coming into you, then you completely change,

578
01:00:21,489 --> 01:00:27,660
you are completely changed. I’ll give you 
an example of a swiss Sahaja Yogi who came

579
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:34,049
to Me, he has written a very big book on Sahaja 
Yoga called ‘Advent’. This boy had a father

580
01:00:34,049 --> 01:00:39,839
who was leading a life away from the family, 
give a the mother, he used to have some sort

581
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:46,779
of a relationship and he never had any good 
relations with his children. But when this

582
01:00:46,779 --> 01:00:53,730
boy came to Sahaja Yoga and his younger brother 
and his sister, he was amazed how they were

583
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:58,079
transformed, their ideas were transformed, 
they were leading such a nice life, very sain

584
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:04,720
life, and that they were looking after him 
also, and they were doing whatever is possible

585
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:10,180
just to make him happy. And this amazed him, 
not like the other children who just like

586
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:16,730
to all the time say sharp things to the father 
and all that. Now one of the Sahaja Yoginis

587
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:23,339
met him in a hotel somewhere. And another 
person started speaking about Sahaja Yoga

588
01:01:23,339 --> 01:01:29,499
and he said “I wish I was born at a time 
where Sahaja Yoga had started because I would

589
01:01:29,499 --> 01:01:35,069
not have wasted my life like that”. So the 
parents start seeing that ’How my children

590
01:01:35,069 --> 01:01:40,410
are changing’ and then they take to it, 
your style of life, betterment of everything.

591
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:47,309
Now the last chakra, I can not tell you perhaps 
today, is the Vishuddhi Chakra, which you

592
01:01:47,309 --> 01:01:49,569
read in the book, because already there is 
(Shri Mataji probably means “it has been”)

593
01:01:49,569 --> 01:01:53,930
a lot of time, we have to have realisation. 
But this is very important chakra because

594
01:01:53,930 --> 01:02:04,369
this gives you collectivity. It’s the center 
by which we know the whole, “Akbar”. They

595
01:02:04,369 --> 01:02:09,989
say “Allah uh Akbar”. It’s the great 
primordial Being, and we are part and parcels

596
01:02:09,989 --> 01:02:16,700
of that, so you feel the collectivity within 
you through this center. Those who spoil this

597
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:21,690
center ; you spoil it by mantras, you can 
spoil it by talking too much, you may spoil

598
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:28,109
it by not talking at all and sorts of things, 
and this reflects in sixteen sub plexuses,

599
01:02:28,109 --> 01:02:35,680
aorthical sub plexuses which has got to look 
after you nose, eyes, throat, neck, the muscles

600
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:41,239
of the eyes, and your forehead also. It’s 
a very important center within us which gives

601
01:02:41,239 --> 01:02:42,609
us collectivity.

602
01:02:42,609 --> 01:02:46,150
The sixth center which here (Shri Mataji shows 
the middle of Her forehead) is the center

603
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:52,599
of agnya chakra. Agnya Chakra is very important 
because at this center, Lord Jesus Christ

604
01:02:52,599 --> 01:02:58,410
came in. He is the embodiment of that innocence 
‘Shri Ganesha’, He came on this earth

605
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:04,369
incarnated and He came with a special purpose. 
He came with the purpose to cross through

606
01:03:04,369 --> 01:03:12,440
that point which was very much join together 
because when we have the desire too strong

607
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:18,229
and to act on it too strong, these two forces 
combine together, in such a way that there

608
01:03:18,229 --> 01:03:24,749
is no gap in between. So He came to go through 
that gap, to go through that cross that’s

609
01:03:24,749 --> 01:03:30,779
why His crucifixion has a big message. He 
came through our awareness to go through that

610
01:03:30,779 --> 01:03:38,940
position which is very subtles because He 
was Himself the subtlest of subtle. He was

611
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:49,229
the One who was the Omkara he was the One 
the was the “logos”, as you call it, the

612
01:03:49,229 --> 01:03:53,890
“vibrations” as you see, He was that. 
And because His body was also made of that,

613
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:58,739
He could get he resurrection. So the christianity 
has the message of resurrection, and this

614
01:03:58,739 --> 01:04:04,829
is the time of resurrection. Because he is 
at the gate there (in the middle of the forehead),

615
01:04:04,829 --> 01:04:09,729
we have to pass through that gate. But when 
you pass through that gate what happens is

616
01:04:09,729 --> 01:04:14,170
that the Kundalini awakens Jesus Christ. When 
Jesus Christ is awakened both these institutions

617
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:20,680
of ego and superego are sucked in. When they 
are sucked in, you find that this place in

618
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:28,430
your head becomes opened out. When this place 
becomes opened out, you find that this Kundalini

619
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:33,410
also starts pulsating, and afterwards you 
find Her coming out of your head and giving

620
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:39,229
you a cool breeze, and that’s how you achieve 
your Self Realisation. So that’s how it

621
01:04:39,229 --> 01:04:39,509
happens.

622
01:04:39,509 --> 01:04:45,019
And the seventh chakra I think, when you come 
to the program of these centers (hall to meditate)

623
01:04:45,019 --> 01:04:50,210
and all that, they’ll explain to you is 
(the) seventh chakra and how it is integrated

624
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:55,440
of whole the six chakras, And the seventh 
one which the heart here (on top of the head),

625
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,450
which is the Spirit. In the heart reside the 
Spirit and the nature of the Spirit, yesterday

626
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:07,599
I tried to tell you in short. That’s what 
you have to be ‘Sat’, ‘Chit’, ‘Ananda’

627
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:16,910
: ‘Truth, Attention and Joy’. Your Attention 
gets enlighten, you get the absolute Truth

628
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:22,630
and you become the Joy. This should happen 
to all of you. I hope in this short time I’ve

629
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:27,759
been able to explain to you the subtle side 
of these chakras as well as of the gross.

630
01:05:27,759 --> 01:05:32,390
But the subject is so great, that you will 
be amazed that least from London they have

631
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:37,089
done at least thousand tapes here, which you 
can listen to them on various aspects and

632
01:05:37,089 --> 01:05:43,369
dimensions of life and enjoy your realisation 
like the bird after coming out of the egg,

633
01:05:43,369 --> 01:05:51,309
enjoy all the dimensions of beauty and the 
glory. May God bless you.

634
01:05:51,309 --> 01:05:53,519
If you have any questions please ask.

635
01:05:53,519 --> 01:06:01,849
There is one more thing somebody who was curing, 
you see. Someone through so called spiritual

636
01:06:01,849 --> 01:06:06,910
hand, He’s not God’s hands. As I told 
you this is coming from the left or the right

637
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:13,200
side, it’s not God’s help. Because if 
God’s power starts working in you, It transforms

638
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:18,039
you also. If it does not transform you, you 
are just like a radio, the music … but if

639
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:25,369
it is transforming you completely, then it 
is God’s work otherwise it is the work of

640
01:06:25,369 --> 01:06:29,009
those spirits who are just trying to play 
some tricks. They are busy bodies so they

641
01:06:29,009 --> 01:06:33,180
just try to help you but don’t go near them, 
they are horrid. They’ll remove one disease

642
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:37,229
and you will have another one.

643
01:06:37,229 --> 01:06:56,989
The Yogi on the scene : Any questions ?

644
01:06:56,989 --> 01:07:14,119
Shri Mataji (to him) : You can stand there.

645
01:07:14,119 --> 01:07:22,680
The Yogi : Any questions ?

646
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:30,440
A man from the audience :

647
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:35,170
Shri Mataji : He’s a realised soul, so I 
can hear him clearly. (To the man) It’s

648
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:41,319
true. What you say is true also ; that the 
centers we have, as you see are seven centers,

649
01:07:41,319 --> 01:07:48,170
then we have moon and sun : nine centers, 
and they are three above us. They are called

650
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:53,940
… I don’t know if I should confuse you, 
but they are called as Ardha Bindhu, Bindhu

651
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:57,910
and Valaya. These are three centers above 
realisation. These you have to achieve in

652
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:05,880
your Realisation later on. Now we have twelve 
of these, and these twelve things make for

653
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:19,599
the gross body of a human being through astrology. 
But we have in India a method which is called

654
01:08:19,599 --> 01:08:25,210
as Krishna Murti Partathi where we can talk 
above the spiritual side of these centers.

655
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:31,259
We have a very nice thing developed in India, 
very nice.

656
01:08:31,259 --> 01:08:38,779
Now when these fake gurus came in, their birth 
days were taken into account, and immediately

657
01:08:38,779 --> 01:08:45,239
this astrology cast their horoscope and say 
that ‘they are all fake, they are rakshasas,

658
01:08:45,239 --> 01:08:50,049
they are this they are that’, and they change 
all of them, their birthdates and everything.

659
01:08:50,049 --> 01:08:57,109
It’s really remarkable how they change their 
birthdate first, and then they say “we don’t

660
01:08:57,109 --> 01:09:04,650
remember, this, that” and all sorts of things. 
But you should see, they have published a

661
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:10,779
very authentic magazine which is dealing from 
() astrology, horoscope and all that. It’s

662
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:17,440
amazing how they have predicted all the things 
perhaps and Perth, they’ve been saying that

663
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:23,819
I’ll be touching Australia, australians 
would be the great Sahaja Yogis, surprising.

664
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:31,130
The Yogi : He also asked ‘Are there chakras 
on this Earth, and does Australia has a chakra

665
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:31,630
?’

666
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:37,750
Shri Mataji : It is ! Australia is the Mooladhara 
itself, it’s the biggest chakra that you

667
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:43,739
could think of. (It) Is the Mooladhara itself, 
it’s the first chakra. If you see, Perth

668
01:09:43,739 --> 01:09:49,270
is all red everywhere, if you see it’s a 
… > You have got in the center of Australia,

669
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:53,009
Shri Ganesha sitting down. (To the yogi) What 
do you call that ?

670
01:09:53,009 --> 01:09:53,869
The Yogi : Ayers Rock

671
01:09:53,869 --> 01:09:56,409
Shri Mataji : Yes, And you can see his trunk 
also, red like that. It’s the Mooladhara

672
01:09:56,409 --> 01:10:03,449
itself, it’s one of the biggest centers 
in Sahaja Yoga.

673
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:11,190
The Yogi : And interestingly enough, it is 
exactly, the same longitude… sorry,latitude

674
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:18,330
of the birthplace of Shri Mataji> Precisely 
the same latitude of the birthplace as Shri

675
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:23,920
Mataji in India. As it is one the tropic of 
Cancer, so it in the tropic of Capricorn.

676
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:29,650
Shri Mataji : Yes, Australia is very important 
from Sahaja Yoga point of view. Very important.

677
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:36,349
You see your basic quality is Innocence imagine 
! According to Sahaja Yoga, Australia stands

678
01:10:36,349 --> 01:10:41,780
for Innocence. (A woman wanted to ask a question) 
Just a minute, let Me finish. And this Innocence

679
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:49,800
is your basic quality. According to Sahaja 
Yoga, Europe is the liver, and Lodon is the

680
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:54,580
Heart. India is the Kundalini.

681
01:10:54,580 --> 01:11:06,460
The woman from the audience , the yogi repeat 
the question to Shri Mataji : Can you give

682
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:10,900
the translation of the Nabhi ?

683
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:17,460
Shri Mataji : Nabhi means ‘navel’, alright 
? It’s ‘navel’. I went to Athens and

684
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:23,900
they told me ‘This is the navel of the Universe’. 
I was telling them that Europe was the Navel.

685
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:28,760
And there I went, they said in Delphi, they 
said ‘this mont represents the navel of

686
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:35,300
the Earth’. So I tried to feel the vibrations, 
it was. But I turned down and say ‘Why these

687
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:38,710
vibrations are coming ?’ and there it was 
Shri ganesha sitting there, like an elephant,

688
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:43,380
a little elephant. So I asked the translator 
I said ‘What is this ?’, she said ‘a

689
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:47,000
little elephant sitting down there’ can 
you imagine ? The Mother Earth has created

690
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:51,320
it. This is all created through Mother Earth 
which is said in the Bible that ‘Thou shalt

691
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,929
not produce or reproduce something that is 
created by the Mother Earth’. And what is

692
01:11:54,929 --> 01:12:01,110
that ? That we call as Swayambhu ‘the one 
which is created by Mother Earth’. And this

693
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:09,530
is one of them, you have Shri Ganesha created 
in the center of Australia.

694
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:35,290
The woman from the audience , the yogi repeat 
the question to Shri Mataji : When you do

695
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:41,170
Your Yoga concentration, as she calls it, 
do you concentrate on the Void as well as

696
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:41,750
the Nabhi.

697
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:48,889
Shri Mataji : No, no not at all. Not to concentrate 
on your Nabhi or anywhere. Concentration part

698
01:12:48,889 --> 01:12:54,440
doesn’t take much part in Sahaja Yoga. First 
you allow your attention to be absolutely

699
01:12:54,440 --> 01:13:00,010
free, alright ? Then the Kundalini rises. 
She rises and comes out of your ‘Brahmarandra’

700
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:05,570
as we call it. In case your attention is very 
rumbly, we say that ‘pay attention here

701
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:09,650
a little bit’ but there is no need at all, 
the Kundalini comes up and She’ll breaks

702
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:14,060
through. You have to leave your attention 
a little loose, not to bother about it. But

703
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:19,000
later on what happens supposing, you have 
a Nabhi problem as you were saying, in the

704
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:25,369
Solar Plexus you have a problem. The Kundalini 
will go back and hit there, and your attention

705
01:13:25,369 --> 01:13:26,110
will be drawn automatically.

706
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:31,619
You don’t have to pay attention it, you’ll 
be drawn. Then by your attention you can raise

707
01:13:31,619 --> 01:13:38,280
the Kundalini. So you don’t have to concentrate 
anywhere just like that. Like if you are driving,

708
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:42,639
then you just have to concentrate on driving 
it self. But if you concentrate on any point

709
01:13:42,639 --> 01:13:50,670
you are finished. So you must know where you 
are and where you have to move. Before Realisation

710
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:55,929
there is no question s of concentration, it 
just spoils you completely.

711
01:13:55,929 --> 01:14:01,560
Another woman : Shri Mataji, is Realisation 
synonymous with ‘enlightenment’ ?

712
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:04,690
Shri Mataji : Yes of course.

713
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:07,199
The same woman : So ….

714
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:13,480
Shri Mataji : You see, it means you have to 
be enlightened. It also means ‘Atma Sakshatkar’,

715
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:21,619
it also means to be the ‘Piir’ (twice 
born). In Lao Tse, he says ‘Tao’, you

716
01:14:21,619 --> 01:14:31,440
have to become “that”. That’s so many 
things. Everybody had says, it’s “that”.

717
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:37,280
(To a man in the audience) Yes ?

718
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:50,199
The man : one occasion several years ago.

719
01:14:50,199 --> 01:15:16,619
The yogi : He went up on the night of a full 
moon, he was absolutely frightened and shaking

720
01:15:16,619 --> 01:15:18,580
(Shri Mataji asked) on Ganesha ? (The Yogi 
confims)

721
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:27,550
The man : It’s like being confronted by 
Eternity (the Yogi repeats to Shri Mataji)

722
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:35,900
Shri Mataji : My child you have been to all 
horrible gurus, you see. So naturally, Ganesh

723
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:40,949
was trying to frighten you there. He frightens, 
not only that, He is the One who gives you

724
01:15:40,949 --> 01:15:46,000
these horrible experiences of heat, these 
blisters and He is the One who gets angry

725
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,770
because He doesn’t like the way people are. 
You see, He is the One who gets upset. Kundalini

726
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:57,590
is ther He looks after Her protocol but He 
can not understand why people are doing wrong

727
01:15:57,590 --> 01:16:01,510
things … because He is Wisdom, He is the 
embodiment of Wisdom and if you have done

728
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:06,510
something unwise, He gets angry with you. 
(Shri Mataji laughs) that must be the reason.

729
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:12,250
You have seen people come to Me (they) also 
shake on the beginning a little, but it doesn’t

730
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:12,739
matter.

731
01:16:12,739 --> 01:16:14,320
The Yogi : Any other questions ?

732
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:21,429
Shri Mataji (pointing at someone in the audience) 
: Are you alright now ? Good. Good now. (The

733
01:16:21,429 --> 01:16:23,880
person answers) It doesn’t matter it’s 
so good.

734
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:35,790
The Yogi (repeats the question of a woman 
from the audience to Shri Mataji) : Can she

735
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:38,619
be healed, she had a stroke some years ago 
?

736
01:16:38,619 --> 01:16:39,699
Shri Mataji : Yes, of course.

737
01:16:39,699 --> 01:16:53,889
The yogi to the woman : Have you got paralysis 
? (the woman answers, then then Yogi to Shri

738
01:16:53,889 --> 01:16:58,770
Mataji) Partial paralysis.

739
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:14,380
Shri Mataji (to the woman) : That’s nothing, 
that can be healed no doubt.

740
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:32,420
The Yogi (repeats the question of another 
woman from the audience to Shri Mataji) : She

741
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:37,389
can understand about the enlightenment, but 
she can not understand about the emanations

742
01:17:37,389 --> 01:17:39,349
probably she means Your powers.

743
01:17:39,349 --> 01:17:44,090
Shri Mataji : You will understand that, alright 
? Gradually. Everything you can’t understand

744
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:48,989
in one days can you ? You will understand 
everything. You don’t worry about it, You

745
01:17:48,989 --> 01:17:54,869
just worry about yourself. I didn’t say 
anything about Myself, have I said ? I’ve

746
01:17:54,869 --> 01:18:00,080
never said anything. I’ve been very humble. 
I’ve never said anything, I dare not. Because

747
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:07,300
it is not wise, I’ve learnt it. [UNCLEAR 
1:18:04] who said it had a bad time. If you

748
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:12,380
say something about yourself, suddenly the 
ego will just punch at you. It’s very bad.

749
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:16,610
I’ve never said a word about Myself. So 
you don’t try to understand Me just now,

750
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:21,449
first try to understand yourself alright ? Then 
you understand Me.

751
01:18:21,449 --> 01:18:26,909
The Yogi : Any other questions otherwise we 
will have the experience of Self Realisation

752
01:18:26,909 --> 01:18:32,610
? This is what Mother’s come for. Really, 
a lecture is not the important part, the experience

753
01:18:32,610 --> 01:18:38,880
of Self Realisation is it. We’ll swift the 
fans off and you’ll feel it for yourself.

754
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:39,560
Any other questions ?

755
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:51,639
The Yogi (repeating a question to Shri Mataji) 
: If they are your devotees, do you look after

756
01:18:51,639 --> 01:18:51,730
them ?

757
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:58,980
Shri Mataji (laughing) : If I look after them 
? Ask them, you’d better ask them, if I’ve

758
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:02,659
looked after them or not ?

759
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:09,119
The Yogi : I think it’s obvious. Insofar, 
as all of us have been physically well, our

760
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:16,150
nervous, mental, psychological problems have 
been healed. If we are endangered by an accident,

761
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:23,360
if there is any particular problem which we 
want to solve within our own lives or within

762
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:32,000
our relationship, we put that at the attention 
or our Almighty God, and by doing so, we find

763
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:40,869
that it gets solved. We’ve got all sort 
of little methods by which work things out,

764
01:19:40,869 --> 01:19:45,469
we showed you some of them today. In working 
out how the chakra are cleared, you can learn

765
01:19:45,469 --> 01:19:52,949
all of these things at the center, there are 
certain aspect which you won’t fully understand

766
01:19:52,949 --> 01:19:58,580
unless you actually achieve the awakening 
of the Kundalini, but as you grow in it, you’ll

767
01:19:58,580 --> 01:20:02,790
understand how eventually the blessings of 
God actually descend upon you in a tremendous

768
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:10,079
way. Your well being is cared for, your health 
is cared for, your psychological problems

769
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:15,659
are solved. You become a complete and whole 
person and this is the very beautiful part.

770
01:20:15,659 --> 01:20:22,119
When this lady asked is enlightenment is synonymous 
with Self Realisation, the answer is “yes”,

771
01:20:22,119 --> 01:20:27,480
but it’s a growth process : you touch it, 
or maybe you go more than that it the beginning.

772
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:34,150
And from that touching of self realisation, 
you grow from that point to a complete Realised

773
01:20:34,150 --> 01:20:40,000
Being. But you are an enlightened Being because 
you start this final journey in your spiritual

774
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,750
evolution. We’ve had a human evolution this 
far, now we’ve reached our spiritual evolution.

775
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:51,530
And the road is very very rapid now because 
in this lifetime, we can achieve the state

776
01:20:51,530 --> 01:20:57,050
of full Realisation. Just by these techniques. 
Very simple techniques that will be shown

777
01:20:57,050 --> 01:20:59,090
to you by the devotees of Shri Mataji.

778
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:06,699
Shri Mataji : But I must confess one thing 
to you people. Your guru was very allergic

779
01:21:06,699 --> 01:21:11,400
to flowers and things. I’m very allergic 
to these dress, absolutely, because this is

780
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:18,070
not your style. These are to be worn by people 
who lead an absolute celibate life, and it

781
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:23,739
meant for people who are not householders. 
And another if you read … Valmiki in the

782
01:21:23,739 --> 01:21:28,710
Ramayana, I don;t know if people read that 
or not where Shri Sita said that a sanyasi

783
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:33,790
has nothing to do with householders at all, 
if he’s a real sanyasi, he should stay out

784
01:21:33,790 --> 01:21:42,880
of the city, out of the village only for …and 
he used to be given one day [] and finished

785
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:49,190
because you know what happened with Her, Ravana 
came with this dress, and that’s how I’m

786
01:21:49,190 --> 01:21:54,270
very allergic to this dress because it’s 
not true. It’s not true. Have you renounced

787
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:54,960
to whole world ? You have not.

788
01:21:54,960 --> 01:22:00,599
So not go into thing kind of a thing, you 
have to be normal people, you have to be living

789
01:22:00,599 --> 01:22:04,969
normally, accepting what you are. And not 
announcing something which you are not. You

790
01:22:04,969 --> 01:22:10,349
see, this is what the gurus do, they give 
you a dress and . So if you want to have Sahaja

791
01:22:10,349 --> 01:22:14,550
Yoga ; of course today I hope I’ll give 
Realisation ; but afterwards you give up all

792
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:18,770
this nonsense, you become normal people. You 
have to be absolutely normal. Nothing abnormal

793
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:23,889
about it, recluses, funny type, no. We have 
to get the whole world out of there to [] We

794
01:22:23,889 --> 01:22:29,239
can’t just do it for ourselves, individual 
some sort of a nonsense, no. We have to be

795
01:22:29,239 --> 01:22:34,619
responsible for the whole world. We have to 
be absolutely normal people, behaving in a

796
01:22:34,619 --> 01:22:39,260
normal way, not to get an abnormal way. Alright, 
so I am very allergic to these dress, I just

797
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:43,409
tell you. I hope I give you Realisation, because 
you are seekers, I can see that. All of you

798
01:22:43,409 --> 01:22:47,710
you are seekers, you should get your realisation. 
But I’m absolutely allergic to this, because

799
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:52,869
their gurus is allergic to flowers. Imagine, 
God is so fond of flowers, I can’t do without

800
01:22:52,869 --> 01:23:01,749
flowers. I can not understand how can any 
saintly man be allergic to flowers.
