1
00:00:00,195 --> 00:00:04,075
Sant Eknath comes from Pratishthana.

2
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:08,435
Pratishthana is called as Paithan.

3
00:00:09,695 --> 00:00:14,395
And he is the one, who has written this "Jogava",

4
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:16,855
means the Yoga

5
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:25,635
and at that time he sang this in a very village language

6
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:29,955
and it is sung by so many people all over the Maharastra.

7
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:34,555
You can imagine that this song was written so many years back .

8
00:00:34,555 --> 00:00:39,455
Now they have converted into a kind of a –

9
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:42,835
I mean for Sahaja Yoga

10
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:46,875
but it is a very -

11
00:00:48,555 --> 00:00:54,075
and actually, it is precisely described - what they wanted at that time.

12
00:00:54,795 --> 00:00:58,735
[Marathi]

13
00:00:58,735 --> 00:01:01,115
Now, in the beginning he says,

14
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:05,275
the Goddess of Maharasthra was called as "Baya".

15
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:08,795
You will be amazed, in my childhood my name was Baya.

16
00:01:08,795 --> 00:01:10,795
They used to call me in my family as Baya.

17
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:20,835
So, he is saying that, "I will ask Mother to give me the Yoga".

18
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:26,095
In the villages, this is said "Jog awa"

19
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:30,135
Again, he says, "aicha Jogawa"

20
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:33,615
means the "jogowa" from the Goddess Baya

21
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:35,615
and he is asking the "jogowa".

22
00:01:37,435 --> 00:01:40,355
Now '"Anadi nirguni"

23
00:01:40,355 --> 00:01:43,875
the one which is primordial,

24
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,335
"Adi" beyond guna,

25
00:01:46,735 --> 00:01:50,881
is the one which is without any gunas

26
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:54,915
has manifested as "Bhawani" on this earth.

27
00:01:57,235 --> 00:02:01,595
And She has come to kill this Mahishasura.

28
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,975
Also, she has come,

29
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:08,475
"Prividh. Tapanzi Karavaya Zharani"

30
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:10,475
[Marathi]

31
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:12,475
Five types of-

32
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:14,475
[Marathi]

33
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:17,355
Pains. Only devils.

34
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:19,355
Heating pains.

35
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:22,315
Three types of heating pains

36
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:31,835
"And now She is going to come for our 'Nirvana" that time he had said.

37
00:02:32,575 --> 00:02:38,355
He says that, "What I will I do when she will come for my Nirvana?"

38
00:02:39,095 --> 00:02:44,035
"This 'dvaita' I have got." Means I am thinking about myself separated from God.

39
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:47,615
'Dvaita' is that you think this world is separate from God.

40
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:51,475
"When we think that this is that way that
we are all one with God,

41
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:54,655
then I will remove this dvaita

42
00:02:54,655 --> 00:02:59,575
and I will put a garland in her- I'll put a garland to her

43
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:10,115
and in my hand I will take the flag of enlightened knowledge."

44
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:14,955
It’s already described in this.

45
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:30,055
"And without any discrimination about cast or religion or anything,

46
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:33,335
I will go visit her".

47
00:03:35,535 --> 00:03:38,215
"Then what I will do?

48
00:03:38,215 --> 00:03:44,155
For nine days I will do nine types of Bhakti of this Goddess.

49
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:56,135
And then I will give up all other asking or anything

50
00:03:56,475 --> 00:04:01,835
and I will ask for a son who is knowledge."

51
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:07,774
"Then what will I do?" You see, the lady's singing, he sings like a lady.

52
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:14,835
So, he says, "This world is full of ego". The 'dambha' is false pride.

53
00:04:16,115 --> 00:04:20,894
"So, I will give up that kind of a bad son".

54
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:23,615
It's a bad son.

55
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:27,535
"And what will I do in the paradi?"

56
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:30,595
It’s the place in which you carry flowers for the God.

57
00:04:30,955 --> 00:04:34,415
"So, in that paradi [basket], I will put

58
00:04:34,755 --> 00:04:39,055
complete enlightened knowledge.

59
00:04:43,295 --> 00:04:47,755
And all the "Asha manishanchya", means all the desires

60
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,755
and all the aspirations

61
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:55,555
"I will finish them.

62
00:04:55,555 --> 00:04:58,835
[Marathi]

63
00:05:00,335 --> 00:05:02,335
Break them.

64
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,015
"Completely break them".

65
00:05:04,195 --> 00:05:06,855
"Mano vikara karin. kurvandi".

66
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:10,315
And all my "mano vikaras", you see all the mind

67
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:12,315
which is so much conditioned

68
00:05:13,255 --> 00:05:18,715
[Marathi]

69
00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:21,995
"So, I 'll take it out and slappe it."

70
00:05:25,355 --> 00:05:29,135
"Amrut rasachi bharin mi duradi"

71
00:05:29,135 --> 00:05:33,415


72
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:35,415
'Duradi' is a basket

73
00:05:36,515 --> 00:05:40,015
"Basket I will be filling with the

74
00:05:40,015 --> 00:05:45,355
'Amrut rasa" that is the ambrosia.

75
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:49,855
"Ata sazani". She is telling her friend,

76
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:53,515
, "O my friend, now I have become completely detached,

77
00:05:53,515 --> 00:05:55,515
‘nihsang’,

78
00:05:55,515 --> 00:06:01,495
and my husband who was a doubtful, who was a doubt,

79
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,495
my husband who was a doubt,

80
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:08,655
I have given up living with that husband of mine",

81
00:06:08,655 --> 00:06:11,875
means the doubt has disappeared from me.

82
00:06:11,995 --> 00:06:16,535
And she says that,

83
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:22,635
"The Kama and Krodha these are two 'mang"

84
00:06:22,635 --> 00:06:27,935
is the one, scheduled caste people who burn the bodies.

85
00:06:27,935 --> 00:06:29,575
"And I have given them up

86
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:35,295
and what have I done? I’ve made my

87
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,295
[Marathi]

88
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:41,115
channel and opened out my tunnel.

89
00:06:41,115 --> 00:06:44,115
that is of Sushumna, you see now.

90
00:06:45,475 --> 00:06:51,555
"Such a Yoga I have asked and kept it with me.

91
00:06:52,255 --> 00:06:57,375
And when I got it, I went to the great door

92
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:03,615
and I thanked the God Almighty

93
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:10,575
and I have now come out of this life and death problems".

94
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:16,155
At that time, he wrote all this and today you are getting all the results.

95
00:07:16,155 --> 00:07:22,035
Just that, so clearly and the lady singing this.

96
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:27,095


97
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:40,815


98
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:44,075


99
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:46,075


100
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:48,755
Take some vow,

101
00:07:49,895 --> 00:07:55,215
something about yourself and about others.

102
00:07:55,215 --> 00:07:57,215


103
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:04,975
We have to remember one great thing,

104
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:07,835
that we are Yogis now,

105
00:08:08,815 --> 00:08:11,615
that too we are Sahaja Yogis.

106
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:18,835
And as Sahaja Yogis, we have to be 'par excellence'

107
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:26,014
in our behaviour, in our temperament,

108
00:08:26,014 --> 00:08:30,894
in our dealing with others, in tackling any situation

109
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:35,934
or getting any solution out of some problems

110
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:38,975
You have to be balancing.

111
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:45,895
Now some of you find that you have very good brain,

112
00:08:45,895 --> 00:08:51,675
I mean intelligent; but you lack in your heart.

113
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:57,195
Some of you have got very large heart, but you lack in your brains.

114
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:01,595
So, the balance must be brought.

115
00:09:03,735 --> 00:09:08,715
But the greatest knowledge, greatest of all the greatest knowledge is

116
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,435
to know that God is love.

117
00:09:14,895 --> 00:09:19,595
He is love and if you cannot even love a Sahaja Yogi,

118
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:24,215
then also you must know that there is something very wrong with you,

119
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,215
which must go out.

120
00:09:28,175 --> 00:09:30,835
The love has to be there.

121
00:09:31,715 --> 00:09:34,835
And this love is what we call as 'Nirvajya'

122
00:09:34,895 --> 00:09:37,775
means there is no interest on you, just the capital,

123
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:42,795
meaning you love each other in such a manner

124
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:49,855
that you just give and don't expect anything.

125
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:55,815
Just give and enjoyment of giving is the highest.

126
00:09:56,135 --> 00:09:58,355
I tell you from my experience.

127
00:09:58,355 --> 00:10:03,235
To me the greatest joy is when I can give Realisation,

128
00:10:07,415 --> 00:10:10,835
Second one is when I can give away things.

129
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:16,935
Or the third one could be that I can give it to others.

130
00:10:17,735 --> 00:10:23,195
So now, as you are not the people who are sitting at the receiving end,

131
00:10:23,895 --> 00:10:26,435
but at the giving end

132
00:10:26,435 --> 00:10:30,435
you must know what you have given to others.

133
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:33,575
On the contrary, even now, if you just give your tempers,

134
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:38,095
you show your greed and all kinds of things

135
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,515
that does not behoove a Sahaja Yogi,

136
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:47,054
then you have to know there's something
still left behind.

137
00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:52,815
Or else if you are so particular about small things like clothes

138
00:10:53,535 --> 00:10:56,275
like food, like comforts

139
00:10:56,415 --> 00:11:00,655
then know that there is something is missing, the personality is not full.

140
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:06,915
And also remember one sentence always,

141
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:12,255
"Ask a question to yourself: have I fulfilled my destiny?".

142
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,615


143
00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:18,055
This is one question you should ask,

144
00:11:18,055 --> 00:11:21,035
"Have I fulfilled my destiny?"

145
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:24,335
And that will clarify the situation for you

146
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:26,335
because now you are a guru of your own,

147
00:11:26,415 --> 00:11:28,415
you know you understand.

148
00:11:28,495 --> 00:11:32,255
You know so much about Sahaja Yoga mentally.

149
00:11:32,255 --> 00:11:34,995
But when it penetrates into your being

150
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:39,455
and the whole knowledge becomes a part and parcel of your being

151
00:11:39,455 --> 00:11:42,814
then it's a very different thing.

152
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:53,055
The whole attitude about facing anything is very different for a Realised soul

153
00:11:54,455 --> 00:11:59,635
Like me, I would say, if I see a problem,

154
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:03,455
immediately I go into meditation, immediately,

155
00:12:07,695 --> 00:12:09,635
and the problem is solved.

156
00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:11,635
Because that’s my power.

157
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:16,575
In the same way if you see a problem and
if you go into meditation

158
00:12:16,575 --> 00:12:19,875
the problem will be solved by me.

159
00:12:20,715 --> 00:12:24,555
That means in meditation you surrender to me, then it’s my job.

160
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:34,655
But if you start solving it mentally or orally, you will fall into traps.

161
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:38,494
The best thing is any such problem that
bothers you,

162
00:12:38,495 --> 00:12:40,955
you should just go into meditation,

163
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:46,135
don't have to even pray just go into meditation with that problem

164
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,835
and you will come out victorious.

165
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:52,815
What today you have been asking me for the victory,

166
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:57,355
I have to tell you that you are very safe in the fort

167
00:12:57,355 --> 00:13:00,375
of your meditative state.

168
00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:04,655
And when you are in meditation only you can grow.

169
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:07,775
You cannot grow otherwise.

170
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:11,655
It's like the sunshine for any tree

171
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:16,175
So, you have to be in meditation, in Nirvichara.

172
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:19,315
You don’t have to oppose anybody, you don’t have to aggress anybody,

173
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:21,795
you don’t have to say anything.

174
00:13:22,575 --> 00:13:27,335
Specially for other Sahaja Yogis, you don’t have to worry.

175
00:13:27,615 --> 00:13:32,155
Anybody whom you find to be funny,

176
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:34,155
just go into meditation.

177
00:13:35,935 --> 00:13:41,215
And you will be amazed how things will change, that is your power

178
00:13:41,215 --> 00:13:45,375
How many people have got Realisation in this world?

179
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,255
Very few.

180
00:13:47,255 --> 00:13:51,315
They are growing up, all right, they are working it out.

181
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:55,155
But what is lacking in them is the Meditative Force.

182
00:13:55,695 --> 00:13:57,555
The best way is to surrender.

183
00:13:57,555 --> 00:13:59,555
And the surrendering is easier,

184
00:13:59,635 --> 00:14:02,975
you just put me in your heart all the time

185
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,975
the simplest way.

186
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:11,755
Then you cannot live without it

187
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:14,635
You cannot exist without it.

188
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:20,655
You feel completely lost. It’s a kind of a very detached love.

189
00:14:20,655 --> 00:14:25,895
You just feel absolutely rested, blissful, and content.

190
00:14:25,895 --> 00:14:27,934
Then  you don't want anything,

191
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,054
you don't need anything.

192
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:34,515
That is the state one has to establish.

193
00:14:34,515 --> 00:14:38,455
It’s so easy for you because I am in person here.

194
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:42,155
Only problem that is there, as I told you, in Sahaja Yoga,

195
00:14:42,155 --> 00:14:45,075
that you have to recognize me to begin with.

196
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:49,375
But to recognize me is rather difficult ecause I am a Mahamaya.

197
00:14:50,695 --> 00:15:00,035
And so normally you might come into that mess created by the Mahamaya.

198
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:05,215
But as I told you, the other day, that you could not have faced me in my

199
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,555
other forms

200
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:10,215
Imagine a person with a sword in the hand sitting on a lion!

201
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,695
You could not have faced it. So, I had to be Mahamaya.

202
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:17,215
And this is what it is, that in this form,

203
00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:20,254
you can come close to me,  you can talk to me

204
00:15:20,255 --> 00:15:22,495
you can tell me your problems,

205
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:28,295
you can also take my advice, if you want.

206
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,835
So, this counselling can be done better.

207
00:15:30,835 --> 00:15:32,655
I could decode everything to you.

208
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:36,495
I could tell everything about it.

209
00:15:36,495 --> 00:15:43,395
But to know that you are sitting before Mahamaya,

210
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:48,255
itself is very helpful.

211
00:15:49,595 --> 00:15:55,095
So, don't get lost into the garb of Mahamaya.

212
00:15:57,135 --> 00:16:02,395
In your protocol, in your understanding, in everything

213
00:16:02,915 --> 00:16:07,035
you have to remember that we should not make mistakes

214
00:16:08,075 --> 00:16:13,375
or we should try to surrender, to be surrendered.

215
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:18,015
Automatically you will learn everything automatically.

216
00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:22,254
There's nothing to be taught to you.

217
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:27,374
That state is such - like a tree when it comes to its full bloom

218
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,935
it gives flowers.

219
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:32,175
And the flower comes to its own maturity,

220
00:16:32,175 --> 00:16:33,955
it gives fruits.

221
00:16:33,955 --> 00:16:37,055
That is how you are built in, that is how you grow.

222
00:16:37,055 --> 00:16:39,235
When that happens,

223
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:42,895
you yourself feel your own growth and enjoy it

224
00:16:42,895 --> 00:16:45,315
and just live happily with it.

225
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:52,555
So, ultimately my destiny is one that I should make you all very happy and joyous.

226
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:54,155
That's my destiny.

227
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:56,815
That is why all this struggle is going on.

228
00:16:56,995 --> 00:17:00,435
I hope I fulfilled my destiny and your destiny too.

229
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:02,575
May God bless you.
