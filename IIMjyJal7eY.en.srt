1
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,800
Today is a very great day I must say,

2
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:53,680
to celebrate Sahasrara, the puja of Sahasrara.

3
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:02,040
It’s a very unique thing that has happened,

4
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,240
that your Sahasraras were opened out.

5
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,240
There were some very few people in this whole world;

6
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,760
there were some Sufis, there were some saints,

7
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:23,360
some other people also in China and all.

8
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,680
But very few, very few got their Sahasrara opened out.

9
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:38,080
So whatever they said or written was never understood

10
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,080
by the people.

11
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,960
They actually tortured them, they crucified them

12
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,040
and did all kinds of horrible things,

13
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:56,080
because they couldn’t bear somebody getting this realization.

14
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,720
So it’s a very great day

15
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:05,560
because collectively this Sahasrara has been opened.

16
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,280
Every one of you have got it.

17
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,960
Also all over the world you have many people

18
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,280
who have got their Sahasraras open.

19
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,000
Of course we need many more, for them to understand

20
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:33,280
what is this great event of such a collective opening of Sahasrara.

21
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,640
Some have grown very much

22
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,200
after getting their realization, very much.

23
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,240
They have understood Sahaja Yoga very well

24
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,760
and they have developed their depth

25
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,640
and their consciousness

26
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:56,160
is really a great awareness of oneness with the Divine.

27
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,800
To be one with the Divine is the greatest blessing for human beings.

28
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,960
So far they were human beings at a lower level of existence,

29
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,480
and they had all the problems of that level,

30
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,999
is that jealousies, hatred-

31
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,080
all kinds of problems that are today of fighting,

32
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,800
of troubling others,

33
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,480
destroying others and not loving others.

34
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,520
All these problems existed because

35
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,480
their Sahasrara was not opened.

36
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,920
So our main problem is

37
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,880
to open the Sahasrara of the people all over the world-

38
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,920
which is very simple, which you can all do it,

39
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,640
and it will work better if you do it collectively.

40
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,120
If you are collective you can work it out very well.

41
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,200
Like that in Sahaja Yoga so many people have come

42
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,360
whose Sahasrara was completely opened,

43
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,880
and they felt their depth.

44
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,600
Firstly, you must feel your depth.

45
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,600
If you don’t feel your depth

46
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,360
and you are not one with your personality which is so deep,

47
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,520
then you cannot enjoy the Self-Realization.

48
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,960
First of all you should understand yourself.

49
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,240
If you don't understand yourself,

50
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,760
how can you understand other people?

51
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,360
You cannot.

52
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,040
So first this Sahasrara should be opened out fully.

53
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,400
“Fully” means complete oneness with the Divine.

54
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,360
That is not difficult.

55
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,520
Only you have to meditate little bit

56
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,800
and then it will work out.

57
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,440
It has worked out in many people

58
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,680
I am very happy to see, and meet such people in Sahaja Yoga

59
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,880
who have achieved such a lot of collectivity

60
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,160
and also the awareness of a realized soul.

61
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,720
So what is the awareness of a realized soul?

62
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,120
That is what we have to understand today

63
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,560
it’s a very important day, as I said.

64
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,760
The awareness is such that you should now know

65
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:34,520
what is happening in this world, and how you can help it.

66
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,480
How can you help people to get to this awareness?

67
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:45,800
Unless you have this full, full knowledge about yourself,

68
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,520
complete strength about yourself

69
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,320
and the confidence, you cannot do it.

70
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,480
Sahasrara Day is to be celebrated

71
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:01,400
just to strengthen your bond with the Divine,

72
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,680
so that your consciousness becomes absolutely enlightened,

73
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,200
and you see the right point in everything.

74
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,120
It has been in so many countries I have seen,

75
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,360
people have taken to it very, very fast.

76
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,560
Surprising, in Africa which is

77
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,440
not supposed to be very developed country

78
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,560
it's good because thousands have got realization.

79
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,840
Those who are developed

80
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,999
have gone beyond the point of ascent, I think.

81
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,240
That must be the point, they have to come back

82
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,120
from that developed state to this state from where they can rise.

83
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,680
And so the people who have, though got realization

84
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,720
are not ascending so fast as the people

85
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:58,840
who are not yet so much advanced and modernized.

86
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,640
Still it has worked, it has worked in so many people,

87
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,999
and so many have got this ascent very well.

88
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,760
But I would say that when you are meditating,

89
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:20,760
also outside you should develop a state of witness.

90
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,880
You should try to find out what is the matter,

91
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,920
what's wrong with you, what's wrong with others,

92
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,040
and how you can help it.

93
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,960
Only with your vibrations

94
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,240
you can correct so many things in your country,

95
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,680
in your family, everywhere.

96
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,640
And as you see now how Sahaja Yoga is growing,

97
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,680
that there’s such a need

98
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,760
and such a desire to get Self-Realization.

99
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,600
But only thing, your approach should be full of love

100
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,520
and full of understanding.

101
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,600
They are coming from the darkness of ignorance

102
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:04,520
and they have to go into the illumined nature of the Divine

103
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,360
which is, can be very bright for them.

104
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:14,000
So slowly, slowly if you develop this passionate kindness,

105
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,720
love for them,

106
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,600
I’m sure you can do much more to raise them.

107
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,760
No use getting angry with them, because they are so ignorant,

108
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,560
they don’t know what they are doing, you see.

109
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,800
As Christ has said that “They don’t know what they are doing.”

110
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,920
So what you have to do is to make them understand

111
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,360
whatever they are doing,

112
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,400
whatever they are understanding is still poor,

113
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,040
it’s not so much yet expanded as it could have been

114
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,480
if they were realized souls.

115
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,280
Even after realization I find people have a problem.

116
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,800
They still have the problem of the past life which is finished,

117
00:21:56,999 --> 00:22:00,320
it’s dead, but they still carry on with that

118
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,640
and the consciousness, so much of illumination also

119
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,999
doesn’t show what’s wrong with them.

120
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,760
For example, take the case of ego.

121
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,200
Ego is so developed.

122
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,240
In the Western countries where they are so developed,

123
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,280
ego has also developed,

124
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,280
and they have to find out what’s wrong with them.

125
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:28,120
This ego comes from certain consciousness

126
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,999
that you have been something great,

127
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,360
you are this, you are that,

128
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,680
your parents have been great maybe, your property is great

129
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,400
or maybe you are occupying very big position, or anything.

130
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,999
It can come from anything,

131
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,280
and this consciousness is against your awareness

132
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,600
because it’s not true.

133
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:57,000
You are not anything being molded by these outside things,

134
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:04,880
but you are molded by your own awareness within yourself.

135
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,999
This awareness has to grow.

136
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,920
From where? – is to understand

137
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,600
how do we get this ego, from what point.

138
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,240
Yesterday I felt there were lots of people

139
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,680
who were having a lot of right side on them.

140
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,920
This right side is of no help.

141
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,600
It will create problems for you, sickness for you,

142
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,640
and also no use having right-sided Sahaja yogis.

143
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,840
So the main thing is to understand the power of love.

144
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,480
Power of love is the highest and the greatest,

145
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,840
and if you can manage somehow or other to give up your anger,

146
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,920
give up your greed and also your ego

147
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,920
if you can do that, you can be in Sahasrara.

148
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,999
Now just see the sport of ego.

149
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,360
It stops your ascent further.

150
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,999
At ego only people get lost,

151
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,080
because at ego only they move to the left or to the right

152
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,480
and they can go to the too much of right side,

153
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,400
or can go up to the left side.

154
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:19,520
They can go to any extreme of these two.

155
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,400
So first of all we have to correct our ego.

156
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,240
For this ego, what should we do?

157
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,280
For this ego we should watch ourselves and laugh at ourselves.

158
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,360
What ego do we have, of what?

159
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,280
We are human beings, now have become divine.

160
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,440
And with divine within us, with this light within us

161
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,160
we have to understand that we are a part and parcel of the Divine,

162
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,880
just a drop in the ocean of love.

163
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,880
If you can reduce your ego,

164
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,960
if you can bring it to the actual sense of your being,

165
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,560
then it will work out better.

166
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,920
I find it in the West, this ego is very strong – very, very strong.

167
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,040
And whatever they do wrong they think is correct,

168
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,200
because ego can support you in every way.

169
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,480
While on the contrary those people who are developing,

170
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,760
the countries who are not yet developed,

171
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,760
there the people, problem is not of ego but of superego.

172
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,680
That can be corrected.

173
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,400
But ego is your own enemy created by you.

174
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,440
So you have to fight it,

175
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,080
and see for yourself from where it is coming.

176
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,800
It might be country-wise, it might be family-wise,

177
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,760
it can be from anywhere.

178
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,080
So first of all we must watch out for the ego,

179
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,880
if it is Sahasrara we have to enter into.

180
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,440
When I was looking out for a collective happening

181
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,040
of Sahasrara opening,

182
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,040
I found it was the ego of people which was keeping Me down.

183
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,640
I had to fight the ego of people.

184
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,920
Because I am a woman of a very simple habits,

185
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,560
no pride, nothing, so people used to suppress Me,

186
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,040
say all kinds of things to Me.

187
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,080
But I understood them because they had ego problem.

188
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,360
And once this ego evolves and tries to dominate,

189
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,880
we can have Hitlers in this country,

190
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,000
we can have all these horrible people all over the world.

191
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,920
So the first thing you should understand:

192
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,840
those who have ego, we should not ever subdue to them.

193
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,560
Of course you shouldn’t start fighting,

194
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,960
but you have faith in yourself that you are people

195
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,200
who have got Self-Realization.

196
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,800
You are much more powerful than they are.

197
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,520
My powers only work out when you are realized souls,

198
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,760
you’ll be surprised. They work out many things

199
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,960
which may not work out with people with ego.

200
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,800
Like the other day I heard from Africa

201
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:12,160
that people become invisible suddenly.

202
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,160
There was coup d’état and the President is Sahaja yogi,

203
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,200
he became invisible, nobody could find him.

204
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,880
Because they are very much surrendered,

205
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:32,320
they are so much surrendered that they get advantage of My powers.

206
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,600
You all should use My powers also, of protection.

207
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,800
This protection power is very, very strong,

208
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:45,920
specially for people who are very much in Sahaja Yoga,

209
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,360
who are very much there.

210
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,480
So you must have first of all complete faith in yourself

211
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,160
that you are Sahaja yogis – but not the ego.

212
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,440
“Sahaja yogis” means you cannot have ego.

213
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,160
This ego business has come from various sources, you know that,

214
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,280
but it has to be cleansed out.

215
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,920
Like when the river flows all kinds of dirt, filth flows into it,

216
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,480
but when it meets the sea it becomes the sea.

217
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,320
In the same way you have to become that.

218
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,400
To become the sea, what you have to do

219
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,080
is to forget all these tributaries

220
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,840
which were coming into you,

221
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,720
and all these wrong ideas which came to you.

222
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,160
It can be from any source.

223
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,600
I do not know how to name them because

224
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,280
there’s a big list of these sources.

225
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,400
People are mad sometimes with this ego.

226
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,880
So main thing is how to watch and witness your ego-

227
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,680
how it works, how it spoils your temperament,

228
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,960
how it spoils your relationships,

229
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,040
how it makes you stupid.

230
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,120
Ego is, first thing it does is to make you very stupid,

231
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,440
and you start behaving in such a manner

232
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,999
that people start thinking that

233
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,520
Oh, you are the great, stupidest person ever living.”

234
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,560
But it is of no help

235
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,920
because if they believe that you are a stupid person,

236
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,400
what will happen?

237
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,120
On the contrary if you have the wisdom,

238
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,480
if you have that peace,

239
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,720
if you have that special temperament

240
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,520
of enjoying everything in life

241
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,680
and also the collective temperament,

242
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,600
it will work out. They will be impressed,

243
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:35,520
because in that light they can see their own stupidity,

244
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,400
own falsehood, everything,

245
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,080
and they will realize that what they think is not true.

246
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,560
“This gentleman is much deeper than me.

247
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,560
What he has got, I haven’t got it.”

248
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,320
This is the main thing for all of us.

249
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,880
In Sahaja Yoga we have people who are leaders.

250
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,840
That doesn’t mean they become really leaders,

251
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,400
but that means that they have a greater depth.

252
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,560
If they don’t have, they get out.

253
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,720
If they have the depth then they are leaders,

254
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,560
in the sense others see them

255
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:16,360
and really enjoy, really enjoy their being there.

256
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,040
So, in everything you can see for yourself,

257
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,680
specially, I would say, for the leaders

258
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:28,600
because people see them and they are the ideals for them.

259
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,680
For Me, they say that “Mother is after all Mother,

260
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,520
what can we achieve from Her?”

261
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,120
But from the leaders they learn a lesson,

262
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:43,320
and they understand that this is wrong and this is not proper.

263
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,800
First of all you should be model, models of Sahaja Yoga.

264
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,680
And that is what I have been always telling you

265
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,480
that get rid of your ego.

266
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,520
It’s the worst thing, because first of all it brings anger.

267
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,840
You think you are something great

268
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,880
and you can do this, you can do that

269
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,440
because you are a Sahaja yogi- it´s not true.

270
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,680
On the contrary you become extremely humble, extremely humble,

271
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,600
and you do right things.

272
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,600
You do not become any more, any more, arrogant

273
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,520
and also full of anger.

274
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,160
Anger departs from you completely, completely.

275
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,840
It gives you a balance, it gives you wisdom

276
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,920
by which you see what is your job, why are you on this earth,

277
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,400
why this energy has come to you,

278
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,120
why you are a divine personality.

279
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,720
It’s a very, very great responsibility.

280
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:43,080
You don’t have to look after yourself, no.

281
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,960
The Divine will look after you, absolutely.

282
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,440
It will protect you, it will look after you,

283
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,200
it will do whatever is needed for you.

284
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:58,160
But in case, in case you have this ego,

285
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,360
you shut out yourself from the reality, from the truth,

286
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,440
and you become very hot-tempered and arrogant personality.

287
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,320
This has to go away.

288
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:15,520
Sahaja yogis are saints- not saints but they are more than saints

289
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,560
because they can express themselves better.

290
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,240
They have powers in them which they can utilize,

291
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,240
which they can show to other people that you are so powerful,

292
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,640
that you can manage things much better than what you think.

293
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,800
For example, say there’s a problem

294
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,600
and the whole world is upset about it.

295
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,200
Only thing if you know how to witness it, it will disappear,

296
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,680
it will disappear in the whole world.

297
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,520
It cannot remain there.

298
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,880
So nowadays the world is full of turmoil as you see,

299
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,800
full of nonsensical people coming up,

300
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,760
full of quarrelsome people, dominating people are overpowering.

301
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,120
At this time if you just see this in the witness state,

302
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,720
this will disappear.

303
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,400
Because very powerful you are, very powerful,

304
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,360
but you must know first of all

305
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,320
that you must have the equipment to use the power.

306
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,320
If you have that equipment within you, you can do it.

307
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,800
But with your ego you cannot.

308
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,760
Ego is the greatest hurdle for your ascent.

309
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,120
You see that ego is at a place

310
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:37,000
where you have to just cross to go to Sahasrara.

311
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,360
And to break Sahasrara is very easy otherwise,

312
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,760
but if there is ego you are already lost in that ego.

313
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,880
So against all this one has to understand that, watch yourself.

314
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,680
Is he egoistical? What does it think about itself?

315
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,880
Ego is very limited, it makes you limited,

316
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,160
and you don’t see the purpose of your life.

317
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,680
Why have you become a realized soul? You don’t understand.

318
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,640
You just are involved in your own affairs,

319
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,520
in your family, in your children,

320
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,360
in your something like that, very low.

321
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:24,320
But if you have - if you have - an egoless temperament

322
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,400
then you are very effective, the whole power works.

323
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,640
What I’ve seen, the power of Sahasrara is so great.

324
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,400
In some people it has worked wonders,

325
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,280
they have worked it well, greatly.

326
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,320
But because of ego, so many people are still not of that level

327
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,880
that we can say they are Sahaja yogis.

328
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,080
Now as it is I am here to tell you about it.

329
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,400
And in those days when these saints came in,

330
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,360
nobody was there to guide them, to tell them anything.

331
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,560
On the contrary they were so much destroyed by the surroundings,

332
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,640
and people never understood why they don’t have any ego,

333
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,680
why they are so humble,

334
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,920
so they misused. But now you have powers.

335
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,280
You must know how to use your powers.

336
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,320
But that should not give you by any chance

337
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,880
any ego that you have powers.

338
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,240
On the contrary, you should be humble.

339
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,280
You have power to be humble,

340
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,160
and if you can be humble and understand

341
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,240
that these people are not yet realized souls,

342
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,000
they’re at a lower level.

343
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,800
Still their ego is catching them and they’re at a lower level,

344
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,360
they have to come up.

345
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,600
When you understand that, then you will have not only pity

346
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,999
but also understanding about them,

347
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,960
and a kind of a help will come to you from the Divine

348
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
that will solve your problems.

349
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:52,040
I find most of you have problems of very low level sometimes.

350
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:52,840
And then I am surprised,

351
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,999
why are you bothered about these problems?

352
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,680
You see, you are so powerful.

353
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,600
So in Sahasrara you must know what powers are there.

354
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,400
There are one thousand powers,

355
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,440
one thousand powers within you which are being enlightened.

356
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,160
If you can understand that,

357
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,960
then you will understand that what’s the use of having ego,

358
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,440
because you have such a lot of powers within you

359
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,480
which you have not utilized.

360
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,560
We should use, but with the, because of ego you cannot.

361
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,440
With love you can.

362
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,360
With love you can manage, and you can do a lot.

363
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,040
So I would request all of you today to take a vow

364
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,680
that “We’ll have no more chances for our egos.

365
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,080
We’ll give it up.

366
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,080
We’ll give up our ego.” Because there’s no sense

367
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,400
that’s an obstruction between us.

368
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,560
When the Sahasrara wants to work

369
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,600
it cannot because of ego obstruction,

370
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,560
so better not have ego of anything.

371
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,240
You may be a good singer,

372
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,360
you may be anything in life, may be some big man

373
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,640
or anything what is so-called, has no meaning.

374
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,040
What we need today are people who are egoless

375
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,960
and who have powers completely flowing in them.

376
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,040
With the opening of Sahasrara all these powers should flow.

377
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,200
If the Sahasrara is fully opened,

378
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,400
all these powers of love should flow.

379
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,320
You’ll be amazed,

380
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,160
I mean, wherever I go people just fall in love with Me.

381
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,320
I don’t know why, I don’t do anything to them,

382
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,040
but just they feel My love.

383
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,800
That’s what it should be, that people should feel your love

384
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:36,760
and they should know that you are a lovable person.

385
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,920
This is the thing you are made as special people,

386
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,960
very special for this whole world’s emancipation.

387
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,920
That’s your job, and not otherwise just collecting money

388
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,720
and doing all kinds of nonsensical things.

389
00:37:50,999 --> 00:37:54,040
You are for here very, very sensible job

390
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,160
which is to raise the kundalini of people

391
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,960
and make them aware of their greatness.

392
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,320
Human beings are not created only to war and fight,

393
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,240
not created here to play politics and do all dirty tricks.

394
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,520
Here, they are not made here

395
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,800
to lead a life which is very, I would say, filthy and dirty,

396
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:20,480
but in this world we are here

397
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,080
to do such a great job of God who has created us.

398
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,240
So this is possible if you are aware

399
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,040
that your Sahasraras are being opened out,

400
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:36,200
and that in this Sahasrara resides the purity,

401
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,400
not all these small little things about which you are worried.

402
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,760
Some people try to take advantage of Sahaja Yoga,

403
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,720
thinking that – oh, they can do better,

404
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,440
they can have help of others - nothing of the kind.

405
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,960
You can be helped by yourself, you don’t need any help.

406
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,840
On the contrary you have to help others.

407
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,880
There is no need to expect any help from anyone. .

408
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,200
Look at Me, I am an ordinary housewife otherwise,

409
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,160
but how it has worked all over the world.

410
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,640
By what? By just the power of love.

411
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,999
Only trouble is that I can use My power of love,

412
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,200
but you don’t know how to use. That's the only problem.

413
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,440
If you want to use your power of love,

414
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,240
in meditation you can develop that power of love.

415
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,840
With that you can capture people, with that you can understand.

416
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,400
Their problems are that they are not Sahaja yogis,

417
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:38,240
they are not the people who are having all the blessings

418
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,240
or the connection with the Divine.

419
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,880
Imagine, you are connected with Divine.

420
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,520
And Divine is such a great thing

421
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,800
which has created this whole universe,

422
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:51,480
created you, and have done all the great jobs.

423
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,560
So what are you?

424
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,480
You are a part and parcel of that divine Power,

425
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,240
so why not we use our divine Power fully within us

426
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,600
with love and with understanding

427
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,600
so that you develop this wisdom within you.

428
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,160
This is what is to be told to yourself,

429
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,240
that “We are realized souls.”

430
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,800
This one is something, a personality special, very much special.

431
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,360
In this world there were very few people who are realized souls,

432
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,999
but now we have so many, I can see them.

433
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,720
But still if it’s lacking in … some problems are there

434
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,160
because of our ego.

435
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,960
One should not have ego of anything. Everything is perishable,

436
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,920
what is not perishable is divine love,

437
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,640
what is not perishable is divine personality.

438
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,280
All the time you see the saints and all that,

439
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,480
though they are dead, people remember them.

440
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,160
All their poetry is remembered.

441
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,800
Though they could not do much of Sahasrara work,

442
00:40:51,999 --> 00:40:54,240
they couldn’t give realization to people,

443
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,680
still because of their personality they are still respected.

444
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,400
And people know that

445
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,720
these people have been doing marvelous things,

446
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,240
miraculous things.

447
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,480
In the same way you can see your own miracles,

448
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,120
and you can see for yourself what you are capable of,

449
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,240
because now you are connected with the Divine.

450
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,920
This is one fact you should know.

451
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,760
Whenever there is danger, whenever there is problem

452
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,320
you will say you’ll be saved.

453
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,160
Many have been saved out of you, no doubt,

454
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,880
but that is not sufficient. You are saved for what?

455
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,320
What is the value of your life, why are you living?

456
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,160
What is the matter, why God has saved you, given you all this?

457
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,760
Because there’s so much to be done for this world.

458
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,360
You are the, I should say soldiers of truth, soldier of goodness,

459
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,480
and all that is to be done with great courage and understanding

460
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,840
about yourself.

461
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,840
So what you have to do is to have self-knowledge.

462
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,800
You have to know about yourself.

463
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,720
You must have self-knowledge, what you are.

464
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,160
If that you don’t have,

465
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,120
what’s the use of opening the Sahasrara?

466
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,280
Self-knowledge is, doesn’t give you any pride, nothing,

467
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,640
but gives you the duty what you have to do,

468
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,800
what you have to work out.

469
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:18,080
It’s not only just for you, that Sahaja Yoga,

470
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,520
but you are for the whole world – please try to understand.

471
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,360
Sometimes we think Sahaja Yoga is there for our betterment,

472
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,320
for our good health, this, that. It’s not so.

473
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:33,840
It is for the betterment of others.

474
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,560
Your powers are there which you are not utilizing.

475
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,920
You are still busy- I get letters saying that

476
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,560
“this is wrong with us, this is wrong with that..”

477
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,840
I mean, why can’t you correct yourself?

478
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,999
If you can’t correct yourself, how can you correct others?

479
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,440
That’s what it is.

480
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,880
I would say, I can see

481
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,680
that there’s an understanding going into your understanding

482
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,480
that you are great and you’re not ordinary people.

483
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,480
And this has to be practiced and to be used in a manner

484
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:12,240
that will show that you are Sahaja yogis.

485
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,000
You are no less than any, any Sufi or

486
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,880
any realized soul or any saint, no less.

487
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,600
But you have powers which they didn’t have,

488
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,560
of which they were not conscious, while you have these powers.

489
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,040
Try to understand what powers you have.

490
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,760
But by understanding that,

491
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,280
you should not have pride about it or in a way,

492
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,840
but that’s your job, you have to do it. You are there,

493
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:43,040
and you’ll enjoy it because it is not with ego, but egoless work.

494
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,240
If you can manage that much, it will be very good.

495
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,480
Now ego has come down very much, I must say, very much.

496
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,960
I hear from people that ego has come down.

497
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,360
But sometimes they are still quite funny

498
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,480
and fighting, and this and that.

499
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,920
But despite all that, I must say in this,

500
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:06,040
whatever work has been done on these years,

501
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,160
people have worked it out among themselves.

502
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,320
So you have to watch yourself

503
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,560
and see for yourself what ego you have,

504
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,120
what, why should you be egoistical?

505
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,200
Some of the people have ego of their country,

506
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,000
some of the people – I mean it’s all mythical.

507
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,960
It’s all mythical. What is there, you could have been born anywhere.

508
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,600
So you are born in a particular country, you have that ego.

509
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,160
And it is something, I must say, one has to be ashamed of;

510
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:40,120
because your country whatever it is, is not doing very well,

511
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,120
it’s not spiritually equipped,

512
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,040
so why should you be so proud of your country?

513
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,600
When you will work it out

514
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,800
and they will become spiritually equipped,

515
00:44:48,999 --> 00:44:52,040
then of course you can have pride in your country,

516
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,440
but I see not that happening. And so you have to work it out.

517
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,560
And I am also happy to see

518
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,960
that so much of Sahaja Yoga is now spread out everywhere.

519
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,800
It’s spreading very fast.

520
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:07,360
In countries where I never expected, it’s spreading out.

521
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,320
So there are people everywhere in the world who want to have it.

522
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,480
They want to have their realization,

523
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,960
and they want to know what is beyond this human life.

524
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,400
They don’t want to waste their life anymore as human beings;

525
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,840
but as super-human beings I should call them, as Sahaja yogis.

526
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:32,960
So our ego has to be seen, is to be watched in witness state,

527
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,200
how it works

528
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,600
and how it tries to dissuade us

529
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,040
from the right path of movement.

530
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,999
One has to be only careful on that point,

531
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,880
because that’s the last center which has to be opened out.

532
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,800
Once it is completely open, you are one with the Divine

533
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,600
and your all problems will be solved,

534
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,320
because these problems are so frivolous and has no meaning.

535
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,200
They’ll go away in no time, as long

536
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,800
as you work it out, your Sahasrara.

537
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,760
It’s very nice that today is a very special day

538
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:18,000
with all these three stars are coming together,

539
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,080
and it’s special blessing.

540
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:29,080
If your powers increase, all these people who are very bad,

541
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,920
who are trying to capture the society

542
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,640
with their political nonsense and all that,

543
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,080
they all will disappear.

544
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,040
They have no powers, they’ll all disappear.

545
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,720
So, first of all your egoless nature will help,

546
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,440
will help everyone.

547
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,720
May God bless you all.
