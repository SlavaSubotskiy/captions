1
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,720
Today I want to talk to you about children

2
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,200
because yesterday we talked about the Mooladhara.

3
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,040
Now why we are not so collective

4
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,160
as we should have been much more collective.

5
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,640
There has been conditioning on us

6
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,760
from our early childhood, if you see.

7
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,480
In the western life, we are shut in our houses.

8
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,200
We don't have relationships with others.

9
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,320
We are kept extremely protected in childhood.

10
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:15,720
I think the parents have the fear in this country that we'll lose our children

11
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,520
because they get lost. After they start getting their [dough/roles?]

12
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,440
most of the children leave their parents and go away.

13
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,520
Parents are left high and dry.

14
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,560
They feel that our children will leave us at the slightest pretext.

15
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,200
So they teach them not to talk to anyone, to be away from everyone

16
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,480
and cuddle their own children all the time, look after their own children

17
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,200
and they can't see a child talking to another lady.

18
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,000
They feel jealous. And they feel that the child will be lost

19
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,040
because they think that they cannot give adequate love.

20
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,200
If anybody can give love to their child they feel that that child will be lost.

21
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,800
And the child also becomes such a individualistic child

22
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,440
that it takes life into a very particular type of a person

23
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,560
and then after some time

24
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,520
that person starts overpowering that child

25
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,840
and the parents leave the child.

26
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,840
It's a very sick society in that way.

27
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,880
As far as the children are concerned, it's a sick society.

28
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,520
It doesn't know how to bring up their children.

29
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,000
Just the opposite is in India, just the opposite.

30
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,200
I think that's one of the reasons why Indians

31
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,680
become collective very fast. It's that in childhood,

32
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,160
when we are little children or people have children,

33
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,440
it is regarded bad manners to take your own child

34
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,000
in the presence of others, absolutely bad manners.

35
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,360
Say now, I have my daughter and when we are going to my in-laws

36
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,880
we couldn't take the child in my lap, you see,

37
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,560
except for [unclear length or so which] I was nursing the baby

38
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,320
so they have to say that, "Now, you better nurse."

39
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,680
I would never demand that, "Give me the child. I'll take her." Never.

40
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,040
It's regarded bad manners. And now I see why it was done.

41
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,200
It was bad manners to take the child

42
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,880
in the presence of others in your lap,

43
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,040
to say, "This is my child." It was regarded as something very rude

44
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,720
and ill-mannered and as if we are not from good families

45
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,720
and we don't know how to behave before others.

46
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,680
And even to say that, "This is my child," was not permitted.

47
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,080
We'd say that, "This is your child," to introduce your child.

48
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,320
It's something surprising, now I am realizing it,

49
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,560
why it was so in that society of ours we are not supposed to say that,

50
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,440
"This is my own child." We should go anywhere and say,

51
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,760
"That's your child." Even the house, we would not say,

52
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,000
"This is my house," to anyone. "Will you come to your house, please?"

53
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:29,000
The whole -- you see the cultural background gives us that collectivity.

54
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,880
Now I have told before also why people are so sex-oriented

55
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,440
and mainly they are so sensitive to touch another person.

56
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,320
Anybody who touches them, they get a funny feeling. The reason is

57
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,040
other sensations are not developed within you.

58
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,880
That is also because you always cuddle your own child.

59
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,040
Child only knows the mother or the father.

60
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,720
All the time, the child is with you.

61
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,600
As a result of that, what happens, the child never feels

62
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,520
the other sublime relationships with others.

63
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:07,760
Anybody who is the other is an identity which is something different

64
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,640
and when you grow up when you suddenly touch somebody

65
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,880
then you cannot feel the sublime things.

66
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,360
When you are innocent, when you are a child --

67
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,040
I mean we never slept with our parents.

68
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,040
I mean, it's a very common thing in India

69
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,200
that now supposing if I am in the house,

70
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,320
my daughters will give their children to sleep with Me

71
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,280
or with my husband, with brothers.

72
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,800
If my brothers are there or their brothers are there

73
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,360
then they would give their children to sleep with them,

74
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,080
not with themselves.

75
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,040
The psychological reason was that perhaps they understood it,

76
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,000
because it's a very traditional country, so they understood it,

77
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,880
that the psychological reason behind this was

78
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,440
that the child gets used to another man, another woman

79
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,440
and at that sublime situation, at that sublime consciousness,

80
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,880
when they are innocent.

81
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
So the relationship of innocence is developed.

82
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,160
Nobody feels anything funny if somebody touches you or does anything.

83
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,320
This is the reason if you see a man touches a little boy,

84
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,520
he gets funny sensation, the boy gets a funny sensation.

85
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,160
It's absurd because you must believe in the principle of collectivity.

86
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,320
Now I have seen that, that people cuddle their children

87
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,720
too much in this country. And that's a very wrong thing to do,

88
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,360
all the time carry the child on your lap, carry the child on your this thing.

89
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,040
It's too much. If you overdo it, you'll find

90
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,760
the same children will hate you.

91
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,520
Because in childhood they develop a sensation

92
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,480
that they are overdoing the things you see and it cannot express it.

93
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,200
Allow the child to play as much as he likes,

94
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,640
take the child whenever it is necessary.

95
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,520
Let others take the child, not you.

96
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,600
We have such a big community of Sahaja Yogis here.

97
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,440
What I find that the mothers are carrying the child all the time

98
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,880
or the father is carrying the child. No, give it to other people.

99
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,040
Let the children be with other people,

100
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,440
sleep with other people,

101
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,760
enjoy others' love and don't have fears.

102
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:21,280
They'll love you much more. And that's how I think

103
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,760
we first of all built in a kind of a stigma,

104
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,000
a kind of a funny feeling that develops later on

105
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,800
into these perverted relationships, that they feel

106
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,440
that to be with another person is something wrong.

107
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,600
All these things can be given to children in a very easy way

108
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,280
if you try it in childhood.

109
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,800
Another thing is that I find like

110
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,600
in my husband's office I was surprised,

111
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,320
everybody is called by name like this and that ..

112
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,320
a deputy or CP is called Tom.

113
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,200
Even the driver, we call him a Tom.

114
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,080
But, you see, we are very particular.

115
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,800
I mean, my husband especially is very particular.

116
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,200
He'll never call his driver by his name,

117
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,520
"Mr," so they dare not misbehave.

118
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,320
The relationship must be established in childhood.

119
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,280
Like I have seen people calling him Gavin,

120
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,640
little children calling him Gavin. I mean, we will never call like that.

121
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,080
Or even if you have see my grandchildren they will say,

122
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,320
"Gavin Uncle," at the most.

123
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,560
It comes to more formal relationship, they'll say, "Mr Ram."

124
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,760
They won't call, "Gavin." That's not done! Aunty, uncle

125
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,320
? a relationship has to be established.

126
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,040
It's not only your father and mother are important

127
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,280
but you snatch your children, I have seen, from others.

128
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,680
You want to hold on to your children and just grab them all the time.

129
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,080
That's why they run away from you. Overdoing it.

130
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,440
There's no need. Children are very independent.

131
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,200
They can look after themselves. They can manage themselves,

132
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,200
and just to keep them pleased, you take them to shops,

133
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:07,440
make them buy things, get things and then they get used to it.

134
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:15,160
You must know that child is very intelligent

135
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,680
and you have to bend the child's mind

136
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,040
according to your own understanding of collectivity.

137
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,720
And if you do not do that, they'll become like all other children

138
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,600
who are just vagabonds. I see them.

139
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,040
As I told you, once I was coming from Oxtead?

140
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,040
and there were some children about from eight to nine years of age,

141
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,800
not very big. They were from some public school ? had no discipline.

142
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,600
They entered into my compartment ? it was a first class compartment ?

143
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,480
and they had some sort of sharp things with them,

144
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,320
some knives maybe, or some razors.

145
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,840
they started rip opening all the seats for nothing at all

146
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,000
and they didn't do anything to Me, of course,

147
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,880
and I was quite worried. I said, "Why are you doing this?"

148
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,840
So they said, "Shut up."

149
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,880
So I got up, went to another compartment, and I said ?

150
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,840
there are some two boys who are traveling with them.

151
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,320
They were smoking, sitting down nicely on the other side.

152
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,680
So I went and told them these boys are doing like this.

153
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,840
So they came back. They slapped them nicely, slapped them,

154
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,360
hit them, just they didn't even cry, nothing of the kind.

155
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,000
They pushed them back into their places and then next station

156
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,080
came the station master came and he was saying now what to do now.

157
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,080
You must learn to discipline your children from now.

158
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,160
Why can't they sit in the program quietly?

159
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,800
What's the problem with them?

160
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,880
From the very beginning they must be made to feel the vibrations.

161
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,360
They must be made to sit with other people.

162
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,440
It's because they find that their parents are their own; the rest are not.

163
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,320
That's how racialism also develops because they think

164
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,440
that other people who are not fair are not [unclear: all right].

165
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:09,480
All kinds of these scorpion type of temperaments,

166
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,520
the snake-like temperaments, the secretive temperaments develop

167
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,040
when you start keeping them exclusively to yourselves.

168
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,440
On the contrary, if you allow them to be open,

169
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,320
talking to everyone,

170
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,040
opening their hearts to everyone.

171
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,640
Even the people who are grown up shudder

172
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,880
from touching another's child, I have seen.

173
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,440
They'll ask ten times, "Should I take the child?"

174
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,880
What's the harm? I mean, even if they go to anybody's house,

175
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,520
they'll just pick up the child.

176
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,320
And now they say its for protection of disease and all that.

177
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,200
But on the contrary, children develop more immunity.

178
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,440
Over-protected children are very dangerously placed

179
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,080
because they have no immunity for anything.

180
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,080
Imagine in that country we have all kinds of parasites living,

181
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,800
all kinds of parasites. Still we exist better,

182
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,160
because we have immunity to so many things.

183
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,840
And that's how you people become very weak, health-wise.

184
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:18,680
Imagine! I went to Australia and we had three, four Indian boys there.

185
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,280
They came to help Me with the kitchen,

186
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,160
lifting all the big things here and there.

187
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,440
So I asked one of them, I said,

188
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,320
"Why not ask these boys to do something?"

189
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,600
They said, "They are only nice to look at, Mother,

190
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,480
but they have no strength. They have no strength."

191
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,760
I have seen that. And it happens more in countries like England

192
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,800
where it's such a bad climate you keep your children inside.

193
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,440
They don't go out. You all the time shut your children.

194
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,000
They become selfish.

195
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,520
They become very mean and very short-sighted.

196
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,320
Open them up. Now you have a community.

197
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,160
You have a trustworthy community.

198
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,720
When you don't, then one person will just,

199
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,440
a dominating person will come up, catch hold of your child

200
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,720
and use that child, blackmail you for the child, do all kinds of things.

201
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,440
But if you just allow the child to play about with everyone,

202
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,040
just allow, diseases will disappear.

203
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:21,360
You'll be surprised. Also supposing you have a problem

204
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,000
say even with the back Agnya, if others

205
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,720
are handling, it disappears.

206
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,360
Because somebody has better vibrations, the bhoots leave you.

207
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
But if you just all the time hold,

208
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,440
you are a person suffering from a back Agnya yourself.

209
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,800
You are holding on to the child yourself; the child has to suffer.

210
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,320
We actually send our children to other people

211
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,480
in their early childhood, trusting them and they love the children

212
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,840
because here people don't believe that you can love the children.

213
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,440
So here we have to trust others with our children

214
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,680
and that's the reason I feel the children become so exclusive,

215
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,640
they stick on to you; they cannot go to anyone.

216
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,040
But you see in India when you go ? I don't know if you have visited any homes or not ?

217
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,360
the children will be the first to receive you.

218
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,600
They'll say, "All right, sit down."

219
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,760
Then they offer you something if there's somebody is not in the house.

220
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,680
They will look after you and they will know everything about you,

221
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,080
what you said, what you asked for, what you wanted,

222
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,560
everything so sweetly. Everything is on the record.

223
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,040
And they have made it for every uncle, for every aunty,

224
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,200
and they remember all those things all their life.

225
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,440
I met such children whom I had looked after in my childhood,

226
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,680
in their childhood I would say,

227
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,200
and they remembered all that I told them,

228
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,040
the stories I told them and how I looked after them and every little,

229
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,440
little things they remembered, and so sweet to know

230
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,320
that they know all those things still!

231
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,160
One of them is now working in the World Bank.

232
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,440
She got a big job in the World Bank.

233
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,600
She came down the other day and she just started crying

234
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,040
like a little baby in my lap, you see.

235
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,440
So I said, "What's the matter?"

236
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,440
She said "Aunty ji," quite grown up, "I remember all those days," you see,

237
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,440
and so fond of Me, you see, that she once went to a shop

238
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,200
and she saw a sari which I used to wear the same type of sari,

239
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,080
yellow colored. She said, "That's my aunty's sari,"

240
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,160
and she went and bought that sari. She said, "That's my auntie's sari."

241
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,520
Quite grown up.

242
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,600
All this little, little things children remember,

243
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,000
all the sublime things all the noble things,

244
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,840
all the things that are very pure.

245
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,000
But you don't expose them.

246
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,200
You just overpower your children, too much of it.

247
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,720
And also then the children try to attract your attention

248
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,440
all the time because they are used to it.

249
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,840
They'll ask ten questions,they'll talk too much,

250
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,440
they will say things, and you will be tired.

251
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,600
I know that. When I was coming by train I had a lady traveling with me.

252
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,880
She was, her name was Clive's wife or something.

253
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,000
She was traveling with Me and her son.

254
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,840
And, poor thing, she couldn't talk to Me

255
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,320
because she had to tell stories to him and then this to him

256
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,720
and she wouldn't leave. I said, "You just neglect him.

257
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,600
Just neglect for a while

258
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,160
and the child is better."

259
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,200
And the same advice I gave to Barbara. Her son is very good.

260
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,040
He went to a motel with Warren when he was there.

261
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,440
He went to every person. He went and asked everyone.

262
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,520
He went around the whole hall and looked at everyone.

263
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,600
But in India children do that. They are worried about everyone.

264
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,360
They will go and see their vibrations.

265
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,040
This exclusiveness and overpowering,

266
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,520
you really hate your mothers

267
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,000
and hate your fathers when you grow up if they are very over-possessive.

268
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,160
This is possessiveness and a fear that we'll lose the child.

269
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,880
Actually, you will really lose if you have this kind of a fear

270
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,040
if and you overpower your children.

271
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,160
That's what I have seen that children

272
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,040
who would like to be in the program no,

273
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,440
all the ladies are standing outside as punishments.

274
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:12,000
Why? Make them sit. They'll be all right. They'll sit quietly.

275
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,720
They won't make any noises.

276
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,320
But this overpowering attention to your child,

277
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,440
and I have also heard that in the ashrams,

278
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,440
the ladies who have children don't do any work.

279
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,440
They just don't do any work. They are looking after the children,

280
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,440
finish, and the rest of the work in the ashram is done by somebody else.

281
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,560
To produce a child, you don't take much.

282
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,680
There is nothing great that you have produced the child first of all.

283
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,440
They are Sahaja Yogis and they are in My trust, not in yours,

284
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:51,440
and don't spoil them. No mother should sit with the child in the house

285
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,480
or in the rooms, whatever may be the case.

286
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,560
Allow the child to play with others, sit in the drawing room.

287
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,040
But they will take the child, sit in the room,

288
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,760
feed the child, look after them.

289
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,200
They have only one work, is to look after the child, finished.

290
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,760
It's like an emotional blackmail, I think,

291
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,320
that you just take the child to yourself and sit down there

292
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,720
and say that, "Oh! I am looking after the child

293
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,440
so the relatives say: "Oh! all right, she's a mother."

294
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,320
I have so many children here.

295
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,320
This motherhood should not give you such a funny idea

296
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,160
that you have become so great

297
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,720
that you should sit down and do nothing else.

298
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,440
My family, I have eleven brothers and sisters.

299
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,600
And My mother, I think, was a President of a congress in Nagpur

300
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:55,440
of Madhya Pradesh. She went to jail five times

301
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,320
and a very correct woman. She wouldn't tolerate any nonsense

302
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,200
from her children, and that's another thing

303
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,440
that if the child does anything to someone ?

304
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,840
I have heard that children are very indisciplined, they hit others,

305
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,560
they pull the hair, they say all kinds of funny things ?

306
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,280
and parents never correct them, just adore them,

307
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,560
and when the children grow up they just kick out their children, the parents,

308
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,640
we have seen this happening.

309
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,440
Because they are realized souls. They won't like this kind of nonsense.

310
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,680
So be careful of that. Yesterday I talked to you about Mooladhara.

311
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,720
Let the children have a healthy, trustworthy Mooladhara.

312
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,200
Let them meet other people, be friendly with other,

313
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,680
play with everyone, go round everywhere, allow them.

314
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,160
But otherwise they are very negligent about their children.

315
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,200
What do they do? They don't even massage their children;

316
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,320
they don't even clean their children.

317
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,560
They don't keep their clothes clean. They don't give them baths regularly.

318
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,080
They don't give them proper food to eat.

319
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,040
This is one point we have to see that our children

320
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,840
should be made collective and very strong in their Mooladhara

321
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,320
from early childhood.

322
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,440
And I have seen parents coming and telling me,

323
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,040
"We don't know why, why our child left us like this, you see,

324
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
when he grew up. He was all right childhood."

325
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:34,560
This is the reason. They get bored with you, to be very frank.

326
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:47,080
That's the only answer. "Suddenly, you see, my son left me, suddenly.

327
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,880
Why? He was all right till yesterday.

328
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,440
He must have been and has now run away from this place."

329
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,800
So they must have their own friends and they must go round

330
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,440
and it's really, comparatively if you see your children

331
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,840
have no wisdom of their own because the parents are so overpowering,

332
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,520
they don't allow children to grow in proper way,

333
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,080
to understand anybody else.

334
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,200
I just don't understand what has happened to us,

335
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,680
why are we going wrong with our children so much?

336
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,800
Now the another point one has to see about ashrams

337
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,040
which I need not have said before but now I must tell you

338
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,320
that we have to be responsible. That is also there.

339
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,160
From childhood, if you don't have sense of responsibility,

340
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,840
you can never develop into one. Like electricity bills

341
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,000
goes up like hell. People never put off their lights.

342
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,040
I mean, there is a switch

343
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,320
which is to be put on and also to be put off.

344
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,360
It's not only for putting on.

345
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,000
Small things like gas or electricity thing,

346
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,600
if once they are in the ashram they don't bother. It's your ashram.

347
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:14,000
Then food, the amount of food that is thrown away

348
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:24,160
is something surprising. No value for food, no understanding

349
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,080
how to organize because there is no Gruha-lakshmi,

350
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,360
there is no house wife's qualities

351
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,480
because they are sitting with the child now, not doing anything else.

352
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,800
Supposing you had your own house, then you'd be shopping,

353
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,560
you would be cooking, you would be looking after your child,

354
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,320
you would be cleaning your house, cleaning the utensils,

355
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,760
doing everything yourself. But in the ashram they think,

356
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,640
"Now we have a baby so we are in charge of the baby.

357
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,480
Let's look after them and sit down."

358
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,560
I would love to play with babies all the time

359
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,360
and have nothing to do with you. So can I do that?

360
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,560
Can I do that? I cannot.

361
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,720
In the same way we must understand.

362
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,880
Now we should not waste food.

363
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,280
There are many people in this world who are starving.

364
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,440
And we have no business to waste food at all.

365
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,280
I mean on this, you would be surprised

366
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,800
that even the richest of richest people in India

367
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,440
would not leave anything in the plate, richest of richest.

368
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,320
And Gandhiji, in his ashram we were, even Maulana Azad,

369
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,720
Jawahar lal Nehru had to clean their own plates.

370
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,800
So they should not take more. If they take more

371
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,080
they should not leave anything in such a manner that others cannot eat.

372
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,760
Waste of food and waste of electricity,

373
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:07,200
waste of other energies, without understanding it means money.

374
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,720
That's why you never have money.

375
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,040
There should be a proper organizing

376
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,080
as to what you are going to cook, what you are going to have,

377
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,680
how much is going to be used. Nothing should be wasted.

378
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:27,040
I have seen this tendency. I have seen this tendency Myself ? very common.

379
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,440
They have no respect of food, no respect of food.

380
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,080
That's why children also don't have any respect for food.

381
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,480
Before food is served, we must sit with the idea

382
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,600
that, "Now we are going to have food." It is a yagya.

383
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And that you have to eat that food with some prayer,

384
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,680
bless that food, thank God that you have got the food.

385
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:04,440
This is the Lord's prayer and then the satisfaction comes in better

386
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,600
and you get a sense that, "No, we should not waste our money

387
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,040
on food like this."

388
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,800
There are so many other things one has to know about children

389
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,160
that we must know about their vibrations.

390
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,040
We should be alert about their vibrations.

391
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,800
Try to find out what's wrong with them. What do they do?

392
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,440
Now, for example you find that a child is misbehaving.

393
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,560
Don't go on all the time with him. Call the child.

394
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,640
Once make the child sit down and talk to the child that,

395
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,200
"You shouldn't do like this.

396
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,840
When you are with your mother, pay attention to her."

397
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,680
It is you who is going to mould these new children

398
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,840
who have been given to you specially

399
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,640
because you are Sahaja Yogis and not to ruin their lives.

400
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,440
You know some children have become mad

401
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,800
with this kind of a thing, like Dutta who was here.

402
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,040
And everybody made you see she herself was so careless,

403
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,440
so careless that you can't imagine

404
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,040
when I heard about her carelessness

405
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,640
and the filth with which she looked after the child,

406
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,480
I was amazed how Linda could do that.

407
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,800
And you should not be another Linda

408
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,640
who spoiled her child's health, mind everything.

409
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,160
If you have a clean place and a proper place,

410
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,440
children would love it to be there.

411
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,800
But no mother should sit with the child in the room.

412
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,640
That is allowed [a law?]

413
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,840
in the drawing room you can sit with your child.

414
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,280
And in the room when the child is sleeping the child should be taken.

415
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,000
Otherwise keep the child in the drawing room.

416
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,440
You'll see the child will become happier because it is natural to be collective.

417
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,680
It is natural for a child to mix up with others,

418
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,360
to talk to others, to know about -- it's natural.

419
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,840
Innocence is like that.

420
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,760
Innocence wants to know the whole world.

421
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,720
That's the time if you don't allow the child to move

422
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,200
then he becomes perverted, he has problems.

423
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:18,360
So give them a better life, better situation, better education,

424
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,760
better discipline because you are equipped.

425
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,360
Don't give them what you had.

426
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,840
This is the real love; otherwise it is possessiveness.

427
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,680
I wanted to talk about this because yesterday I talked to you

428
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,520
about Mooladhara and I have been seeing and noticing

429
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,000
what's happening to your children

430
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,440
and I find the amount of discipline they have is coming from you,

431
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,800
how far you are disciplined.

432
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,320
And by doing this you play to their hands.

433
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,560
They know that they can curve you the way you like.

434
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,000
They know that you are depending on them.

435
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,560
You can't exist without them, they have this idea.

436
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,280
So they don't listen to you.

437
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,640
But if they know that they will lose the love if they don't behave,

438
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,040
they will be all right. They are very intelligent.

439
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,760
So you must play your cards all right and see

440
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,200
that your children brought to proper line of understanding

441
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,640
because they are different children,

442
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,800
special children given to you as a trust.

443
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,760
They are not your children. They are my children.

444
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,760
So too much of handling and hugging and this and that is not necessary.

445
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,840
I mean, sometimes you break their bones the way you do.

446
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:38,440
It's too much. Try this on others' children,

447
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,880
less on your own children.

448
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,520
Try to keep your children out and love other children.

449
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,320
I don't know what kind of psychology people read but it's a simple,

450
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,440
straightforward thing. We must understand that we are Sahaja Yogis.

451
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,320
The children have to be collectivity;

452
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,800
otherwise I have to again break my head again with them

453
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,640
for being collective.They should be naturally collective.

454
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,040
I think today's speech must be written down

455
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,480
and sent to all the centers. It's important.

456
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,200
I find this all over in the western state.

457
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,440
If they have a child then they, I tell you suddenly

458
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,680
they become more than an emperor

459
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,480
and the wife becomes more than an emperess herself,

460
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,080
not only empress but more than an empress.

461
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,200
Why, I have told you kings and queens never see their children

462
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,040
at all. I mean, that's another extreme.

463
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:15,680
Those who came from the previous meeting, please rise your hand

464
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,280
All rigth, only one.

465
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,560
I mean from the public meeting. Only one. All rigth she is all rigth.

466
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,360
Now, you see, for the people who are coming  for the first time,

467
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,720
we don't allow them, you see, to attend this --

468
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,000
what you call the puja of your Guru ?

469
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,480
because they don't understand so well, why it is done,

470
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,200
why it has to be done, how it helps you and they start analyzing.

471
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,200
But if you could sit without analyzing,

472
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,800
as you have got your transformation,

473
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,840
all your deities within,

474
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,600
you will be strengthened and you'll feel better.

475
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,320
You don't have to do anything whatsoever.

476
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:23,160
You have to just be quiet and just see it with understanding,

477
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,440
all right?

478
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:29,880
So that you don't get into analysis because you don't understand it.

479
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,440
If you try to analyze it, you'll be in trouble.

480
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,680
But if you just sit and feel the vibrations,

481
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,040
and feel the flow of the vibrations, you'll be helped, all right?

482
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,560
Now the first thing is yesterday we talked about the Mooladhara Chakra

483
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,320
and so today is Ganesha. It's not necessary to do too much of it

484
00:39:53,720 --> 00:40:00,280
but we could just say about the Mooladhara Chakra in English

485
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:07,800
and then just to pour water on My feet, that's all.

486
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,080
And then, I will vibrate these things for you

487
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,280
as we have done before and the second one

488
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:26,760
when we do the chanting of the Shakti, the energy of Kundalini.

489
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,000
So these things only we'll do today,

490
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,880
and I am sure yesterday the experiment

491
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,840
must have helped you very much to clear out your heads

492
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,160
and it has helped you to sleep well I am sure.

493
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,760
All right, and also today be attentive in the sense

494
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,480
that as you have been always in thoughtless awareness,

495
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,440
don't think about it. Just don't think about it.

496
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,040
Just keep your mind at thoughtless awareness position

497
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,440
and it will work out much faster.

498
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,200
Because you are at such a level, you are at such a level

499
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:10,296
that it's easy now to communicate through vibrations.

500
00:41:10,504 --> 00:41:13,837
Otherwise it was difficult before and it's much easier.
