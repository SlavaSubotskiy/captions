Sahasrara Puja Cabella Ligure, Italy
6th May 6, 2001

2
00:00:02,423 --> 00:00:06,757
Today I bow to all the Sahaja yogis

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:09,340
who have found the truth.

4
00:00:14,757 --> 00:00:19,882
There has been from ages

5
00:00:20,757 --> 00:00:23,465
the seeking for the truth.

6
00:00:24,298 --> 00:00:28,465
And when people discovered

7
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:34,924
that there’s no other way but to surrender

8
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:40,924
to the Divine that you can find the truth,

9
00:00:42,798 --> 00:00:46,632
they did not know how to do it,  how to work it out.

10
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:53,465
There have been seekers all over the world.

11
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:59,590
I went to Turkey and I was amazed  there have been lots of Sufis,

12
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:03,340
but their disciples were not realized souls,

13
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,924
because the Sufis also did not know how they got their realization.

14
00:01:09,465 --> 00:01:13,590
Such darkness existed around

15
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:17,340
people who were seeking.

16
00:01:17,673 --> 00:01:20,256
All over the world I find,

17
00:01:20,506 --> 00:01:23,673
when I was a little girl,

18
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:29,924
that they are completely ignorant about

19
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,381
how to find the truth.

20
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,298
So many were lost in all kinds of so-called

21
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:43,924
religions and rituals.

22
00:01:44,632 --> 00:01:47,506
All kinds of rituals they used to do;

23
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:52,215
morning till evening, some sort of a ritual they would do.

24
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:56,882
Whether they were Hindus, Christians, Muslims,

25
00:01:57,548 --> 00:02:00,548
they all believed that by doing all  these rituals

26
00:02:01,256 --> 00:02:05,215
you’ll achieve something, that you will know the truth,

27
00:02:05,673 --> 00:02:08,340
that you will get your Self-realization.

28
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,298
All such seekers went to wrong people

29
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:19,590
and to wrong directions,

30
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:23,673
because they were really seeking from their heart.

31
00:02:24,757 --> 00:02:27,465
So they were very misleading,

32
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:32,673
misleading and they were misled

33
00:02:33,798 --> 00:02:40,840
into such horrible black areas

34
00:02:41,924 --> 00:02:44,298
that they did not know what they were seeking,

35
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:47,632
what they are supposed to seek, what they have to have.

36
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:53,840
It has been prophesized

37
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:59,506
that when Kali Yuga will come,

38
00:03:00,632 --> 00:03:02,924
people will find themselves.

39
00:03:04,423 --> 00:03:09,298
There’s a story about Nala and Kali,

40
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:18,798
who had taken away the wife,

41
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,506
Damayanti, of Nala.

42
00:03:23,506 --> 00:03:29,757
So once Nala caught hold of him,

43
00:03:31,256 --> 00:03:33,798
and he said that “Now I’m going to kill you,

44
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:37,256
because you are a very mischievous man

45
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:39,715
and you have done such a harm to me.”

46
00:03:41,924 --> 00:03:45,465
So the Kali said,

47
00:03:46,381 --> 00:03:47,506
“You can kill me,

48
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:50,465
but before that you should know what is my importance,

49
00:03:51,256 --> 00:03:55,632
what is my mahatva. And the my importance is

50
00:03:55,757 --> 00:04:00,256
that when my time will come”

51
00:04:00,715 --> 00:04:03,423
–when Kali Yuga will come –

52
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:07,840
“then all those people who are seeking the truth

53
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:15,882
in the jungles, in the hills and dales,

54
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:23,381
in the Himalayas will become ordinary householders,

55
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,340
they’ll be householders. They won’t be sanyasis going about,

56
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:34,715
they’ll be householders, and they will find the truth.”

57
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,256
This has been prophesized long time back,

58
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,465
and also there’s a book about it, a book;

59
00:04:43,632 --> 00:04:47,632
as you must have read in the book which says

60
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,590
that the time has come for people  to know themselves.

61
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:57,632
Every religion has said one thing,

62
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,381
that you must know yourself.

63
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,924
Islam says the same, Buddha says the same,

64
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:11,465
Christians say the same, Hindus say the same.

65
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:20,673
So till then they go on doing all kinds of acrobats,

66
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:27,256
but they realize that “we haven’t found the truth.”

67
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:34,590
So it came to My lot;

68
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:39,548
from My childhood I knew I had to do it.

69
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,548
But when I saw the human beings,

70
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:47,715
how much in darkness they were about themselves,

71
00:05:48,798 --> 00:05:53,757
how aggressive and how sinful they were,

72
00:05:54,924 --> 00:05:59,632
all their style was so cruel

73
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,840
that it was unbelievable.

74
00:06:04,423 --> 00:06:07,632
That was the time also I saw Hitler coming up,

75
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:15,340
and our country also was in complete bondage.

76
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,715
So the first thing was to make our country free,

77
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:31,506
was very important. And that’s why I took a very, very active role

78
00:06:32,548 --> 00:06:37,506
in the movement that was for the freedom of our country;

79
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:41,423
same with My father and mother.

80
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:50,632
But when we got the freedom somehow, after some time we got lost.

81
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:56,590
People started taking to all kinds of modern things

82
00:06:56,924 --> 00:07:01,423
which were wrong, which were so-called entertaining.

83
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:08,673
With all that, I found all over the world

84
00:07:09,673 --> 00:07:13,798
there was a big seeking force,

85
00:07:15,256 --> 00:07:18,340
and some false people took full advantage of it.

86
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:23,506
They went out, made lots and lots of money,

87
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:26,882
and with their falsehood they cursed them,

88
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:28,924
I don’t know what they did to them.

89
00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:31,924
So many seekers were lost like that.

90
00:07:33,256 --> 00:07:37,465
Despite that I went to America, and I was shocked

91
00:07:37,882 --> 00:07:40,256
how the things were going on there.

92
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:44,840
But I couldn’t help it because they were so

93
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:49,632
mentally  ill-equipped,

94
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:54,340
they could not understand what they have to have,

95
00:07:54,715 --> 00:07:57,715
and you can't pay for the truth.

96
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:06,340
Then it happened that I had started it after

97
00:08:06,673 --> 00:08:12,298
the Sahasrara was broken. And you know the story

98
00:08:12,757 --> 00:08:14,882
how I broke the Sahasrara,

99
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:23,381
and how from one person I started giving realization.

100
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:26,924
But from America I got very disappointed.

101
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:31,590
I was thinking, “How will it grow? How will it work out?”

102
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:38,798
We had about twenty-five people who were realized souls by then

103
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:46,465
in India,  but they realized what they have got by realization.

104
00:08:47,423 --> 00:08:51,924
They realized that they have become very good people,

105
00:08:53,423 --> 00:08:55,840
they have given up all bad habits;

106
00:08:56,715 --> 00:09:00,506
and they were wanting to worship Me.

107
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,465
I said, “No, no, don’t worship Me

108
00:09:04,882 --> 00:09:08,882
because people will not understand.”

109
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:11,673
But they one day forced Me.

110
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:15,298
So on our terrace of the house they came

111
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:17,465
and worshipped Me,  because

112
00:09:18,215 --> 00:09:20,757
somebody had told them, “This is the Goddess.”

113
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,798
So what had happened was after the program

114
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:31,840
one maidservant came up who was possessed.

115
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:35,715
And she came and she started calling Me

116
00:09:36,256 --> 00:09:38,757
by the name of “Goddess.”

117
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:42,215
So people said, “What are you saying?”

118
00:09:42,632 --> 00:09:45,423
She was a woman, but talking like a man.

119
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:48,757
So she said, “I’m telling you the truth.

120
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,548
She is the Goddess who has come to save us.”

121
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:57,924
Her language was not that of a maidservant

122
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:04,298
but of a very well-educated brahmin,

123
00:10:04,882 --> 00:10:08,715
who would say all Adi Shankaracharya’s stotras.

124
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:13,673
It was very surprising. So they asked her several questions

125
00:10:14,256 --> 00:10:15,840
and then she just fainted.

126
00:10:16,673 --> 00:10:19,715
So I told them, “Just don’t listen to her, it’s no use.”

127
00:10:20,423 --> 00:10:21,632
But they would not agree,

128
00:10:21,757 --> 00:10:23,882
and they said, “Mother, we have to worship You.”

129
00:10:24,882 --> 00:10:27,757
So somehow I agreed to that,

130
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:33,590
and they got hold of seven brahmins to do that.

131
00:10:34,548 --> 00:10:41,256
They were afraid because to do that puja it’s very dangerous

132
00:10:41,757 --> 00:10:45,256
and it could harm you, if it is not the truth.

133
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:48,506
But on the contrary when they were doing  the puja

134
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:49,924
they got their realization.

135
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:53,632
And they just said, “Now, this is the truth.

136
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:57,215
” They felt the cool breeze in their hand,

137
00:10:57,506 --> 00:11:01,340
all the symptoms told about a realized soul started.

138
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:08,256
But I didn’t want to say everything at that time,

139
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:10,423
because

140
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:14,798
there were many others who were saying, “I am this, I am that,”

141
00:11:15,506 --> 00:11:19,548
so I didn’t want to sort of expose it altogether.

142
00:11:19,798 --> 00:11:22,465
But gradually I found that

143
00:11:22,924 --> 00:11:26,715
people got attracted and they used to come to My program,

144
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:30,715
and then the Sahaja Yoga started spreading

145
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:36,590
allover in a very interesting manner.

146
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,840
So this Sahasrara

147
00:11:41,465 --> 00:11:45,548
Day, or we can call the day when the Sahasrara was opened out,

148
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,423
is a very important.

149
00:11:49,298 --> 00:11:54,340
It’s very subtle. We just know about the kundalini,

150
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:57,590
that she’s coiled up in three-and-a-half

151
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,298
and she’s lying in the triangular bone

152
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:03,715
known as sacrum.

153
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,715
But we don’t know what she works, how she works,

154
00:12:07,924 --> 00:12:09,840
or what happens to us.

155
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:15,715
She rises in six centers

156
00:12:16,632 --> 00:12:21,590
and breaks the seventh center, I should say breaks the sixth center

157
00:12:22,465 --> 00:12:26,757
because Ganesha’s center doesn’t play any role

158
00:12:26,924 --> 00:12:33,423
so when she breaks the sixth center which is the Sahasrara,

159
00:12:34,632 --> 00:12:39,882
then she connects you to the all-pervading Power of divine love.

160
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:50,298
But what is this divine love?

161
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:53,340
What does this do?

162
00:12:54,340 --> 00:13:01,423
It is the energy of the Mother,

163
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,423
we can say it is the energy of Adi Shakti

164
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:13,632
which is all over, works through vibrations.

165
00:13:14,798 --> 00:13:16,840
But what are these vibrations?

166
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:22,715
It’s a very subtle energy that

167
00:13:22,924 --> 00:13:26,256
starts flowing through your Sahasrara.

168
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,840
All the thousand petals of the Sahasrara

169
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:33,882
get slowly enlightened

170
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:37,340
and it starts flowing throughout your body,

171
00:13:38,673 --> 00:13:43,882
throughout your hands, feet, throughout your body.

172
00:13:45,381 --> 00:13:48,340
And the more you are,

173
00:13:49,924 --> 00:13:53,340
I mean your attention is on the Sahasrara,

174
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:55,924
the more it works faster.

175
00:13:57,548 --> 00:13:59,757
Now in the science I’ve read

176
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:04,548
that they have discovered an energy called, they call it …

177
00:14:06,924 --> 00:14:12,506
I don’t know how it – ask the scientists that!

178
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:19,548
What energy?

179
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,715
quantum hah,  quantum energy.

180
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,256
Quantum, I don’t know why they call it quantum,

181
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:29,715
because “quantum” means four.

182
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:34,757
” So it might be meaning the energy of Ganesha maybe,

183
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:38,256
I don’t know. Because scientists are blind people,

184
00:14:38,423 --> 00:14:40,256
I don’t know what they call what!

185
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:43,423
So they are saying there’s a quantum energy.

186
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,924
Now this quantum energy

187
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:51,256
according to them flows in a very subtle manner,

188
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:56,882
and it is normally not visible but it has light.

189
00:14:57,757 --> 00:15:02,924
You have seen that in so many of photographs of Mine

190
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,256
there’s light of all kind.

191
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:09,298
This energy moves in a light,

192
00:15:09,882 --> 00:15:13,798
so this is the quantum energy, I think – again I am not very sure,

193
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:16,465
because scientists are, I’ve always found them

194
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:18,256
just a little bit vague.

195
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:21,381
But this quantum energy they’re talking about

196
00:15:21,548 --> 00:15:24,423
is something like  the spiritual energy

197
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,632
or the energy of love,

198
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:31,506
which flows around. And this quantum energy,

199
00:15:32,924 --> 00:15:37,882
they do not know what it does but they have seen it has got light.

200
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,215
They call it “quantum” because according to them

201
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:43,757
it flows in bundles,

202
00:15:44,256 --> 00:15:47,340
and every bundle is a “quanta” according to them.

203
00:15:48,632 --> 00:15:53,924
Now this energy when it flows, as you have seen yourself, it works.

204
00:15:54,715 --> 00:15:58,298
It works in every direction, in every dimension.

205
00:15:58,798 --> 00:16:00,924
For example it works physically.

206
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:04,757
Supposing you have some physical ailment,

207
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,548
you have seen many people get cured in My presence,

208
00:16:08,882 --> 00:16:12,340
just in My presence – I need not do anything to them.

209
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:17,465
Or also as soon as I see somebody, I know what he’s suffering from.

210
00:16:18,256 --> 00:16:22,924
That’s also, I must say, My connection with the Divine;

211
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:27,798
and that tells Me what’s wrong with what person

212
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,423
and what should be done, and it can be cured in no time.

213
00:16:33,215 --> 00:16:36,298
Because that also comes to Me just like that. I mean,

214
00:16:36,465 --> 00:16:39,632
I don’t ask any questions,  I don’t try to find out,

215
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,340
I do not analyze, but it just says, “Do like this”

216
00:16:43,715 --> 00:16:47,924
or it also doesn’t say, it just does.

217
00:16:48,423 --> 00:16:51,381
It just works automatically.

218
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,798
It is very difficult to explain how this energy works.

219
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:58,882
But all of you who have got realization

220
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,381
can also work out your own energies.

221
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:08,506
How? By releasing it, by feeling it,

222
00:17:09,715 --> 00:17:15,924
by giving it to others, by experimenting.

223
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,882
Of course, Sahaja Yoga has spread because of you only.

224
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,632
You are the people who have brought people to Sahaja Yoga.

225
00:17:26,298 --> 00:17:30,882
But that’s not the end of it. We have to save this world.

226
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:35,256
For that at least I feel forty percent

227
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:37,381
of people should get their realization.

228
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,423
Whatever may be their nationality,

229
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:43,757
whatever may be their education, anything,

230
00:17:44,757 --> 00:17:52,632
they are to be given Self-realization. In our Indian

231
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,340
scriptures it’s clearly written, “Without Atmasakshatkar

232
00:17:59,506 --> 00:18:03,506
your life is useless.” But what is Atmasakshatkar,

233
00:18:03,673 --> 00:18:07,840
is the knowledge about yourself. How can you have that knowledge

234
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:13,215
unless and until you become one with this all-pervading Power?

235
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:18,757
So it was a very great thing, I felt, that this Sahasrara

236
00:18:18,924 --> 00:18:23,340
I could open in 1970.

237
00:18:24,632 --> 00:18:28,423
I realized I was overwhelmed

238
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:32,340
because I knew this is the only trouble,

239
00:18:32,548 --> 00:18:35,548
it is the only obstacle human beings are having:

240
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:40,423
because their Sahasraras are not open, that’s why they are

241
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,715
going in the darkness, that’s why they are having wars,

242
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:49,715
that’s why they are having all kinds of problems.

243
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:52,590
But if their Sahasrara opens

244
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,632
and if they become one with the divine Power,

245
00:18:56,673 --> 00:18:59,256
all their problems would be solved,

246
00:18:59,715 --> 00:19:02,381
every type of problem will be solved

247
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:04,548
and they’ll be very happy people.

248
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:08,924
I realized it and I was very happy, I was over-joyous.

249
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:12,673
But nobody understood Me.

250
00:19:13,256 --> 00:19:17,340
I don’t know, they thought I must be talking something nonsensical.

251
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:19,882
Nobody understood it what it is,

252
00:19:20,423 --> 00:19:24,590
because even in the shastras it’s not written

253
00:19:26,924 --> 00:19:29,590
about kundalini so clearly.

254
00:19:29,924 --> 00:19:33,757
Only one great saint called Gyaneshwara

255
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:38,632
wrote it in his book in the sixth chapter, about the kundalini.

256
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:43,298
It’s not so clear, only he said that with the kundalini

257
00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:45,840
you can get your awakening.

258
00:19:46,298 --> 00:19:48,882
Also you sing that song always I’ve heard,

259
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:53,590
which says that “Oh Kundalini Mother, please be awakened!”

260
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:58,381
But nobody knows that what this kundalini is

261
00:19:58,548 --> 00:20:00,924
and why are you singing that song.

262
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:05,298
It was all in our country people used to sing in the village

263
00:20:06,256 --> 00:20:10,882
so clearly, but nobody understood the meaning of it.

264
00:20:11,423 --> 00:20:15,632
Just they used to sing as a, some sort of a bhajan or could be

265
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,548
some sort of a music concert.

266
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:21,590
But nobody knew what it was talking about.

267
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:24,548
It was such a misunderstanding about everything.

268
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:29,798
And all these poets also who have written

269
00:20:30,423 --> 00:20:35,632
clearly about awakening, about realization,

270
00:20:36,256 --> 00:20:39,340
everything was just in the books.

271
00:20:39,715 --> 00:20:43,215
They would read one line of the book, then stop there.

272
00:20:43,465 --> 00:20:45,673
Another person would start the another line,

273
00:20:45,882 --> 00:20:48,298
then he stops at another line, point;

274
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:50,381
like that they were just reading.

275
00:20:50,632 --> 00:20:54,340
Same thing about all the scriptures.

276
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,590
There was big misunderstanding created

277
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:04,423
and was used for the purpose of their own self-interest.

278
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:08,590
That is how we couldn’t get people

279
00:21:08,757 --> 00:21:11,423
who understood what was Self-realization.

280
00:21:12,381 --> 00:21:14,256
It was just for some money

281
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:18,590
or for some certain type of a position to get,

282
00:21:18,882 --> 00:21:25,590
people started big, big organizations,

283
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,840
very big religious organizations

284
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,757
I don’t know what to call them –

285
00:21:33,256 --> 00:21:35,798
but none of them were realized souls.

286
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,924
For example, there was a great saint called Viditama

287
00:21:41,757 --> 00:21:48,673
who went to China, and he started a religion called Zen.

288
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,590
Zen means dhyana.

289
00:21:51,882 --> 00:21:56,715
And he wanted to put Zen

290
00:21:57,256 --> 00:22:01,215
in such a manner  that people become thoughtless

291
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,548
He made a big tank

292
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:11,298
full of sand with patterns and put some stones,

293
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,423
and he had said that “You sit on the edge of this pond

294
00:22:17,924 --> 00:22:22,548
and just see, but don’t think.”

295
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,924
People didn’t understand what it was.

296
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,673
Normally anybody would go there and say,

297
00:22:27,757 --> 00:22:32,798
“Oh, this looks like some ships in the sea,” or all kinds of things.

298
00:22:33,381 --> 00:22:35,798
But nobody tried for thoughtless awareness.

299
00:22:37,632 --> 00:22:41,548
And I told some of them that this is for thoughtless awareness,

300
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:44,298
but they couldn’t understand.

301
00:22:45,548 --> 00:22:49,798
Then we have also in Japan, Tao.

302
00:22:51,506 --> 00:22:54,924
He talked about the all-pervading Power which was Tao,

303
00:22:55,882 --> 00:22:58,924
and Lao-Tze was the one who did.

304
00:22:59,548 --> 00:23:03,590
He had described saints: how the saints are,

305
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,924
how they behave, how they talk,

306
00:23:07,673 --> 00:23:11,381
what is their mannerism, everything.

307
00:23:11,715 --> 00:23:14,882
But how you become a saint, nobody said.

308
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,423
I think throughout there has been no description

309
00:23:19,673 --> 00:23:25,256
how to make a person into a saintly personality.

310
00:23:46,757 --> 00:23:49,548
So also in the twelfth century

311
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:55,632
Gyaneshwara was in the twelfth century

312
00:23:56,256 --> 00:23:59,882
he talked about it and he said about it in his book, everything.

313
00:24:00,757 --> 00:24:03,590
Because it was a kind of a

314
00:24:03,924 --> 00:24:07,924
style that a guru should have only one disciple,

315
00:24:08,757 --> 00:24:12,798
who should give to one disciple realization, not to many.

316
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:17,381
I don’t know why, what made them such a law or a rule.

317
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:22,381
And then it started in the twelfth century, there were many saints

318
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:29,215
who sang the praise of realization.

319
00:24:30,506 --> 00:24:33,715
And all of them thought that these rituals are no good,

320
00:24:33,924 --> 00:24:36,673
so they discarded rituals and this.

321
00:24:37,298 --> 00:24:40,798
But what was the thing that had to happen, nobody knew.

322
00:24:42,256 --> 00:24:45,757
I have read all their lives,

323
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:50,298
I’ve read afterwards also many saints who were there,

324
00:24:51,673 --> 00:24:56,381
but it seems nobody knew how to raise the kundalini.

325
00:24:57,423 --> 00:24:59,465
This was the basic problem,

326
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:01,924
they didn’t know how to raise the kundalini;

327
00:25:02,882 --> 00:25:05,673
while I think they didn’t have that power,

328
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:08,632
or maybe they had no knowledge.

329
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,340
They talked about kundalini, all right,

330
00:25:11,632 --> 00:25:14,924
but they did not know how to raise the kundalini.

331
00:25:16,673 --> 00:25:21,215
This is a very special power of spirituality.

332
00:25:21,882 --> 00:25:24,465
None of them have been able

333
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,757
to say or tell you how to raise the kundalini.

334
00:25:28,381 --> 00:25:31,215
Now you all have got this power,

335
00:25:31,548 --> 00:25:33,548
which is such a rare thing.

336
00:25:33,757 --> 00:25:35,673
All of you have got it,

337
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,340
I don’t see anybody who doesn’t have that power

338
00:25:39,673 --> 00:25:42,506
to raise the kundalini. You may not;

339
00:25:42,757 --> 00:25:45,381
you may be contented with yourself,

340
00:25:45,465 --> 00:25:47,548
but that’s not a very good thing.

341
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,381
If you have got your Sahasrara opened out

342
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,506
and if you know how to raise the kundalini,

343
00:25:55,715 --> 00:25:58,715
you must go all out to give realization to people.

344
00:26:00,632 --> 00:26:05,590
Nothing is going to benefit people more than Self-realization.

345
00:26:06,423 --> 00:26:10,381
No use doing other charities, giving money, giving this

346
00:26:10,632 --> 00:26:14,882
is of no use. Best thing is to go all out

347
00:26:15,423 --> 00:26:17,882
to see people who want their realization,

348
00:26:18,465 --> 00:26:20,465
and to give them realization.

349
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,506
I was very happy to see

350
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,924
that they have started working it out on the gypsies.

351
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,757
I’ve a special feeling for gypsies.

352
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:34,340
For no fault of theirs, they are leading a very miserable life.

353
00:26:34,715 --> 00:26:37,924
And how the gypsies got the realization!

354
00:26:38,882 --> 00:26:43,465
You can see that you can give it to anyone

355
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,632
who wants to have it. One thing is there you cannot force on anyone.

356
00:26:49,757 --> 00:26:52,548
If they have a desire,

357
00:26:52,757 --> 00:26:55,340
they can get Self-realization.

358
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:59,590
So this day, I have to just say now so many years have passed,

359
00:26:59,882 --> 00:27:03,381
I have worked quite hard, day and night,

360
00:27:04,298 --> 00:27:06,757
and My only desire was

361
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:12,298
that you people should take  it seriously and work it out.

362
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,757
Don’t keep your realization to yourself.

363
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:18,465
As many as people you can give realization,

364
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,632
the greatest obligation will be on Me

365
00:27:23,381 --> 00:27:27,340
and on God Almighty. Only thing is you should try

366
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,840
to give realizations to others.

367
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,590
You will never make a mistake,

368
00:27:32,757 --> 00:27:35,882
you can never make a mistake because the kundalini knows.

369
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:39,506
She knows you, she knows you are realized soul.

370
00:27:39,673 --> 00:27:41,215
She’llrespect you.

371
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:44,548
Even if you make mistakes she’ll correct it

372
00:27:44,757 --> 00:27:47,840
and she’ll help you, in every way.

373
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,506
I’m just a, I should say a housewife

374
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:58,632
who had no support from anyone.

375
00:27:59,715 --> 00:28:03,590
But I was sure that it’s My job to find out

376
00:28:04,423 --> 00:28:06,381
how to break the Sahasrara.

377
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,298
Whatever way it is – outside doesn’t matter –

378
00:28:10,673 --> 00:28:16,590
My job it was to find out the breaking of Sahasrara, which I did.

379
00:28:16,924 --> 00:28:21,256
Now you also know that, so this is your job.

380
00:28:21,506 --> 00:28:23,423
And the scientists now will be coming around

381
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,256
you to ask you questions,

382
00:28:25,506 --> 00:28:28,632
because they don’t know what they are talking about is

383
00:28:28,882 --> 00:28:30,924
what we are already doing.

384
00:28:31,548 --> 00:28:36,506
So you are so powerful, all of you. But how many of you are really

385
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,924
doing this work, is the point.

386
00:28:39,757 --> 00:28:42,757
Today is a very important day. I want to tell you

387
00:28:43,632 --> 00:28:47,882
that you have to strengthen My hands.

388
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:52,256
They say the Goddess has one thousand hands,

389
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:56,673
but even the one thousand hands are now asking

390
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:00,590
that you come along with your two hands and work it out.

391
00:29:01,256 --> 00:29:03,381
It’s very important what you have to do.

392
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:09,840
All kinds of problems in this world, they come because of ignorance

393
00:29:10,757 --> 00:29:13,715
take it politics, take it any, any problem.

394
00:29:14,423 --> 00:29:16,506
And how it is solved is also,

395
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:21,882
is your power with the Divine.

396
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:25,256
I’ll give you one simple example.

397
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,590
That day the Turkish people came

398
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:31,423
and were begging of Me, “Mother,

399
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,423
You must come. You should not postpone,”

400
00:29:33,632 --> 00:29:36,715
and this passport, My passport was a problem.  I said,

401
00:29:37,465 --> 00:29:39,840
“The passport is not ready, how will I come?”

402
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,798
But then I thought, “Why not? We’ll have the passport also done.”

403
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:45,924
So passport was ready.

404
00:29:46,757 --> 00:29:49,757
And they wanted Me to go to Turkey because they said,

405
00:29:49,924 --> 00:29:51,798
“The financial condition has gone down very much,

406
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:54,840
the economy has gone down absolutely, we are ruined.”

407
00:29:55,924 --> 00:29:59,256
I went there, I didn’t do anything about it;

408
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,548
within two days they announced

409
00:30:03,882 --> 00:30:06,924
ten billion dollar help from the World Bank.

410
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:11,673
Now I didn’t talk to World Bank, I had nothing to do with them,

411
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,798
I don’t know.

412
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,673
Then I said, “No, maybe you see, they are helping because

413
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,632
you people are in such trouble.

414
00:30:19,757 --> 00:30:21,548
” They said, “But so many countries are,

415
00:30:21,757 --> 00:30:23,840
why have they helped us only?”

416
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:26,465
I said, “That’s the point!”

417
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:29,673
So now I was surprised, in Turkey

418
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,423
there are only ladies mostly who are leaders, mostly,

419
00:30:34,215 --> 00:30:36,465
and they have done such a big job.

420
00:30:36,632 --> 00:30:40,757
Now I want to see what you people are doing in your country.

421
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:45,423
You may say that “In my country the people are hopelessly bad.”

422
00:30:45,632 --> 00:30:47,757
Maybe, I don’t say no.

423
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:51,882
But still there are places, there are pockets

424
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,715
where you can go and talk to them, tell them,

425
00:30:55,882 --> 00:30:58,506
specially the media you must handle.

426
00:30:59,632 --> 00:31:05,632
It is something you have to do, and find out why you can’t do it.

427
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:10,423
Like Me: I was not supported by anybody,

428
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,924
not helped by anybody,

429
00:31:12,423 --> 00:31:15,798
and how I have managed to break the Sahasrara –

430
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,798
you can also break the Sahasraras of others.

431
00:31:19,757 --> 00:31:22,924
It’s not difficult, because My vision is

432
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,798
that this world

433
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,924
at least should have forty percent people who are realized souls

434
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:34,840
and who are practicing Sahaja Yoga,

435
00:31:35,673 --> 00:31:38,715
who are giving realization to people

436
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:42,340
and trying to change the people.

437
00:31:43,381 --> 00:31:46,256
Anybody who can go and tell, anybody.

438
00:31:46,673 --> 00:31:48,882
There’s no need to discriminate

439
00:31:49,298 --> 00:31:51,381
or to find out, or sit down with their

440
00:31:51,632 --> 00:31:54,632
I mean people take sometimes the

441
00:31:54,924 --> 00:32:00,423
copy of their education and this; that's not needed.

442
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,798
Whosoever it is.

443
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:07,715
I’m not saying give it to dogs or to animals,

444
00:32:08,298 --> 00:32:12,924
but to human beings. They may be anything;

445
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:17,423
they may be English or they could be Germans,

446
00:32:17,715 --> 00:32:24,256
they could be Italians anywhere.

447
00:32:24,882 --> 00:32:26,798
I am told also some people

448
00:32:26,924 --> 00:32:29,715
are doing lots of seminars and working very hard

449
00:32:30,465 --> 00:32:33,340
on all levels, and it is working out.

450
00:32:33,715 --> 00:32:36,548
Among Muslims also we have started working,

451
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:39,381
and even in India it has worked.

452
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:42,840
You don’t know, people have not lost all their heads,

453
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,840
so it can work out.

454
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,882
Don’t be very much disappointed and upset about it;

455
00:32:49,757 --> 00:32:53,506
gradually it will improve. I think the greatest enemy

456
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:58,465
of our Self-realization is the drinking.

457
00:32:59,548 --> 00:33:03,298
Drinking, if people take to drinking they become such slaves,

458
00:33:03,757 --> 00:33:06,632
they don’t – their brains are not all right.

459
00:33:07,506 --> 00:33:11,840
So I think the Sahasrara also must be spoilt with drinking.

460
00:33:12,465 --> 00:33:14,882
So drinking I think is the worst enemy.

461
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:18,465
And if you could find anybody drinking,

462
00:33:18,673 --> 00:33:21,590
if you could help that man to give up drinking itself,

463
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,882
it will work out.  Of course we have other enemies also,

464
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:30,757
like false gurus are there. Also we have other enemies

465
00:33:31,256 --> 00:33:37,840
who are having some sort of religious manipulations,

466
00:33:38,381 --> 00:33:40,256
but that’s not so important.

467
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,673
If you can get hold of people who are drinking,

468
00:33:44,673 --> 00:33:49,340
I tell you it will change. And they will now understand

469
00:33:49,715 --> 00:33:52,465
that what they have been doing so far, drinking,

470
00:33:52,673 --> 00:33:55,381
running away – now they’ll come

471
00:33:55,548 --> 00:33:58,256
to the fields and they’ll work out Sahaja Yoga.

472
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,548
So you are like very gentle soldiers of love,

473
00:34:04,715 --> 00:34:06,715
and that’s what you have to spread

474
00:34:07,465 --> 00:34:11,423
and talk to others, give them that joy that you have.

475
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:16,840
Not be satisfied if you have got it only, or few of you have it.

476
00:34:17,548 --> 00:34:20,381
You have to spread it very fast, and you can do it.

477
00:34:20,632 --> 00:34:24,632
Because it doesn’t require money, it doesn’t require any show;

478
00:34:24,924 --> 00:34:28,381
it is just inside, it works, it’s already there.

479
00:34:28,715 --> 00:34:32,256
It’s present there, everybody has it. I knew all that,

480
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:35,673
of course I knew it; but now you also know it.

481
00:34:35,882 --> 00:34:39,465
So you should work it out, and work it out in the manner

482
00:34:39,798 --> 00:34:44,924
that I am sure one day this world will be a changed place.

483
00:34:45,757 --> 00:34:47,632
Thank you very much.
