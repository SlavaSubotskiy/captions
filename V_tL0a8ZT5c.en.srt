1
00:09:14,163 --> 00:09:21,386
After seeing this love,

2
00:09:21,587 --> 00:09:25,097
my heart is filled.

3
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,813
And I am thinking

4
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:42,710
that love is such a big power

5
00:09:43,434 --> 00:09:48,128
by which so many people are attracted

6
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:51,375
and become happy.

7
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:57,339
This is such a surprising thing.

8
00:09:57,843 --> 00:09:59,723
In this Kali Yuga,

9
00:09:59,914 --> 00:10:05,898
no one would have seen this greatness of love.

10
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:16,976
I think that after seeing this,

11
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:23,355
all of you should learn to increase your love.

12
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:33,026
And this thing is very easy.

13
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,662
And you can do it in this way-

14
00:10:35,863 --> 00:10:41,522
by meditating morning and evening,

15
00:10:42,462 --> 00:10:48,670
then the bad thoughts in your mind

16
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:55,828
which cause jealousy and anger

17
00:10:56,536 --> 00:11:00,773
and you get hurt by small things,

18
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:04,417
all such thoughts will end.

19
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:10,783
And after that what’s left

20
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:14,674
its Nirmal prem.

21
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:17,613
With this love

22
00:11:17,814 --> 00:11:21,367
you can give the whole world

23
00:11:22,402 --> 00:11:25,553
a new life.

24
00:11:34,637 --> 00:11:38,717
I have told them in Hindi language

25
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:42,317
that love, you can see one person's love

26
00:11:42,557 --> 00:11:45,997
manifested in so many eyes here.

27
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:48,917
And when I saw the enthusiasm

28
00:11:49,197 --> 00:11:56,237
also My heart got filled with great love, greater love.

29
00:11:57,797 --> 00:12:03,237
So one can see how powerful is this love.

30
00:12:03,637 --> 00:12:10,757
All kinds of bad feelings, negative thinking

31
00:12:11,317 --> 00:12:16,317
and also self-destructive elements

32
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:22,037
can be corrected and controlled very simply in Sahaja Yoga,

33
00:12:22,277 --> 00:12:29,437
if you with sincere heart meditate morning and evening, twice.

34
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:33,437
That time you shouldn't see your watches, of course,

35
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:38,237
but enjoy, enjoy your meditation.

36
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:42,357
That will give you such a strength to love others,

37
00:12:42,557 --> 00:12:44,557
to forgive others;

38
00:12:45,077 --> 00:12:49,517
instead of you feeling bad for small, small things,

39
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:54,037
you feeling irritated

40
00:12:54,317 --> 00:13:00,277
because you think your self-respect is challenged,

41
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:04,037
or else sometimes

42
00:13:04,277 --> 00:13:09,637
we become aggressive towards some people,

43
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:15,797
very aggressive, for no fault of theirs.

44
00:13:16,357 --> 00:13:21,957
Best thing is to see the vibrations of another person.

45
00:13:22,357 --> 00:13:27,717
If the vibrations are bad, no use fighting,

46
00:13:28,077 --> 00:13:32,477
it will create more confusions.

47
00:13:33,597 --> 00:13:36,677
A person who has very bad vibrations,

48
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:42,717
you can't fight with that person, you cannot control that person.

49
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:48,477
Or a person who is too much of self-importance,

50
00:13:48,877 --> 00:13:54,157
you should not try to pacify him

51
00:13:54,477 --> 00:14:01,237
or sort of try to negotiate with him,

52
00:14:01,437 --> 00:14:07,317
or also sometimes people try to pamper his vanity.

53
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:11,477
By doing that you are spoiling him more.

54
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:15,797
So the best thing is to show your love

55
00:14:16,077 --> 00:14:21,877
in very sweet and different manner.

56
00:14:22,397 --> 00:14:26,437
I'll give you an example which I've given many a times,

57
00:14:26,717 --> 00:14:30,197
that I went to see this Gagangarh Maharaj

58
00:14:30,477 --> 00:14:33,477
who was living on a very high mountain,

59
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:38,117
and there was no way of going by car or anything, and I had to walk.

60
00:14:38,317 --> 00:14:41,797
So everybody said, "Mother, why should You go there after all?"

61
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:44,117
I said, "You see the vibrations.

62
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:49,077
Good vibrations coming, all right? That's why I'm going."

63
00:14:49,277 --> 00:14:53,037
But he had told many people about Me, and he said that

64
00:14:53,237 --> 00:14:57,277
"Adi Shakti is born in Bombay, why do you come to me?"

65
00:14:57,477 --> 00:15:00,677
So they told us.

66
00:15:01,077 --> 00:15:04,757
So I said, "I must see this man,"

67
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:10,317
and that's how I went to his place to meet him.

68
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:15,077
Now, he's supposed to control the rain.

69
00:15:15,677 --> 00:15:20,397
He could control the rain. So he was

70
00:15:20,957 --> 00:15:25,517
sitting there on a stone

71
00:15:25,997 --> 00:15:30,757
and he was moving his head with great

72
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:35,157
agitation when I reached there.

73
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:38,357
And it was raining so heavily

74
00:15:38,677 --> 00:15:43,797
that I went up to his place when I was completely drenched.

75
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:48,397
So I went inside the cave where he used to live,

76
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:53,797
and he came back

77
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:58,397
with great anger towards the rain.

78
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:05,197
So he said, "Mother, why did You not allow me to control the rain?"

79
00:16:05,837 --> 00:16:07,837
I said, "I didn't do that."

80
00:16:08,037 --> 00:16:11,237
"No, You did; because I can always control the rain,

81
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,637
and You were coming all the way with my invitation,

82
00:16:14,837 --> 00:16:17,597
and this rain should not have misbehaved."

83
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:20,357
I said, "No, no, he didn't misbehave."

84
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:24,837
So what happened, he was quite in a temper, you know.

85
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:29,157
I said, "You settle down, I'll tell you what has happened.

86
00:16:29,677 --> 00:16:33,037
See, you have bought a sari for Me

87
00:16:33,317 --> 00:16:35,717
and you are a sanyasi,

88
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:39,157
and I won't take a sari from a sanyasi,

89
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:41,597
so the rain has made it convenient.

90
00:16:41,797 --> 00:16:46,517
Now it's all drenched so I'll have to take your sari."

91
00:16:46,837 --> 00:16:51,517
Immediately, you see, he felt terrible love for Me,

92
00:16:51,717 --> 00:16:56,757
started crying and he fell at My feet.

93
00:16:57,077 --> 00:17:00,237
And then he said, "Mother, now I know

94
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:03,597
what is the greatness of love,

95
00:17:03,837 --> 00:17:08,557
how it takes you away from mundane things and

96
00:17:08,797 --> 00:17:12,397
dry behaviour, and takes you to a place

97
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:18,877
where you can enjoy the showers of love."

98
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:23,117
This is one of the stories I am telling you.

99
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:27,997
But the main thing behind the whole episode is this,

100
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:32,517
that you should try your love,

101
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:38,957
your tricks of pure love, pure love, and it works.

102
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:42,597
And you must learn, gradually you will learn how to try.

103
00:17:42,797 --> 00:17:44,517
You should not give up.

104
00:17:44,717 --> 00:17:48,637
Some people are very difficult, I agree - very, very difficult.

105
00:17:48,837 --> 00:17:53,117
But at least try with people who are not so difficult.

106
00:17:53,317 --> 00:17:56,477
And you'll be amazed that you'll have a good company

107
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:59,837
and lots of friends and friendship,

108
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:03,037
as we have here now in Sahaja Yoga.

109
00:18:03,397 --> 00:18:07,717
First time when I came to Delhi I got such a fright of this place,

110
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:11,797
because there were very few Sahaja yogis and they brought

111
00:18:11,997 --> 00:18:15,037
- I don't know why they wanted to do My puja, might be

112
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:17,837
Bombay people must have told them, something

113
00:18:18,157 --> 00:18:20,757
- and they brought kum-kum and everything in a plastic

114
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:23,637
little, little bottles - oh, my!

115
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:26,317
I really shrunk, you know, with their ignorance.

116
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:29,837
I said, "Now what to do? What will happen?"

117
00:18:30,037 --> 00:18:36,917
But today, see, same Delhi which has become so great

118
00:18:37,197 --> 00:18:41,837
and so beautiful, and so enthusiastic.

119
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,477
I saw them with their flags and

120
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:49,157
I didn't know there's such a procession of flags will be here,

121
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:53,597
though we had once or twice, I think, in Cabella.

122
00:18:53,837 --> 00:18:57,157
But how they were enjoying each other!

123
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:02,277
It's really remarkable. If you can enjoy love,

124
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,517
you won't enjoy anything else

125
00:19:04,717 --> 00:19:10,077
but love for other people, and not for yourself.

126
00:19:10,597 --> 00:19:14,677
On the contrary you will see that your body,

127
00:19:14,877 --> 00:19:17,877
your mind, your thoughts,

128
00:19:18,077 --> 00:19:22,557
everything are directed towards creating love for others,

129
00:19:22,757 --> 00:19:25,677
and not for yourself.

130
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:29,437
The whole attitude changes.

131
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:34,037
Like in the darkness you can't see anything,

132
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:39,197
but even there's a small light, it spreads all over.

133
00:19:39,397 --> 00:19:44,637
Nobody tells the light that, "You have to spread the light

134
00:19:45,237 --> 00:19:47,877
all over," but it does.

135
00:19:48,077 --> 00:19:51,797
In the same way you all are enlightened people,

136
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:54,357
you are all enlightened with love;

137
00:19:54,717 --> 00:19:59,677
and the light of this love spreads automatically,

138
00:19:59,837 --> 00:20:03,157
spontaneously, sahaj.

139
00:20:04,157 --> 00:20:06,757
I was also very much

140
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:12,157
enamored the way our Yuva Shakti was dancing and enjoying.

141
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:14,997
I think it's a very great blessing,

142
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:17,757
because these days our young children,

143
00:20:17,957 --> 00:20:22,317
our young people are getting astray.

144
00:20:22,677 --> 00:20:25,837
They are not so badly off as in other countries,

145
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:28,837
but quite a big trend is going on

146
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:33,357
to spoil them and to make them a, what you'd call

147
00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:38,757
a very Westernized, spoiled personality.

148
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:43,077
But now I saw so many of these dancing together,

149
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:46,437
forgetting their caste, creed, everything,

150
00:20:46,637 --> 00:20:50,277
and enjoying each other's company.

151
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:53,157
This is something has to happen

152
00:20:53,557 --> 00:20:56,437
in this country and in every country;

153
00:20:56,637 --> 00:20:58,957
that we should all feel oneness

154
00:20:59,197 --> 00:21:03,517
and enjoy the oneness with each other.

155
00:21:03,877 --> 00:21:08,477
If we do not enjoy we are like a drop outside the ocean,

156
00:21:09,037 --> 00:21:11,077
which can be dried any time.

157
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:14,317
But if you are a part and a parcel of that ocean,

158
00:21:14,557 --> 00:21:20,157
then what happens is that every

159
00:21:20,357 --> 00:21:23,597
movement of the ocean you carry with you,

160
00:21:23,797 --> 00:21:28,637
and you are part and parcel of that ocean absolutely,

161
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:33,637
because you do not have separate identity.

162
00:21:33,997 --> 00:21:37,757
All these things that make a separate identity

163
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:42,397
in our society or in our culture

164
00:21:42,597 --> 00:21:47,237
or in our behavior, in personal lives,

165
00:21:47,437 --> 00:21:51,317
all should be completely curbed down.

166
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,477
And this will settle many problems,

167
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:59,037
from family life to national life, to international life.

168
00:21:59,237 --> 00:22:04,117
So we should curb down all such feelings of separatedness,

169
00:22:04,317 --> 00:22:07,637
that we should have a separate house, separate state,

170
00:22:07,837 --> 00:22:11,597
separate nation.

171
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,637
Gradually all nations will become one, I am sure of that;

172
00:22:15,837 --> 00:22:18,157
because great times are coming,

173
00:22:18,357 --> 00:22:24,117
and so many people at the helm of affairs will take to Sahaja Yoga.

174
00:22:24,397 --> 00:22:26,197
Once they take to Sahaja Yog,

175
00:22:26,397 --> 00:22:29,237
then things will be very much different.

176
00:22:29,437 --> 00:22:32,477
Today it is not with them,

177
00:22:32,837 --> 00:22:35,317
Sahaja Yoga is not with them.

178
00:22:35,517 --> 00:22:42,397
They have no knowledge of our great movement of love,

179
00:22:42,797 --> 00:22:45,357
so they want to have separate of everything.

180
00:22:45,557 --> 00:22:49,077
They don't know tomorrow they will be scorched away

181
00:22:49,277 --> 00:22:54,557
with the heat around or maybe with the rain they'll be washed away,

182
00:22:54,757 --> 00:22:59,437
or maybe that the Mother Earth might absorb them.

183
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:05,037
So we all should be together, whatever may be the differences.

184
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:08,157
In different families we are born - after all,

185
00:23:08,357 --> 00:23:10,717
all cannot be born in one family.

186
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:13,877
But now you belong to Sahaja Yoga family,

187
00:23:14,077 --> 00:23:16,917
and this Sahaja Yoga family is one.

188
00:23:17,197 --> 00:23:20,317
It doesn't believe in having separate existence

189
00:23:20,557 --> 00:23:23,237
or separate speciality.

190
00:23:23,437 --> 00:23:25,437
We are all one with each other,

191
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:29,717
and we don't care what sort of differences are outside.

192
00:23:30,317 --> 00:23:33,037
I was really very much touched,

193
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:36,997
because now the new year is coming with

194
00:23:37,197 --> 00:23:39,877
a new challenge for all of us

195
00:23:40,077 --> 00:23:43,237
which we have to accept, that Kali Yuga is over

196
00:23:43,437 --> 00:23:46,237
and we have to establish the Satya Yuga;

197
00:23:46,437 --> 00:23:52,357
for which all of you from every country should have thinking,

198
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:55,957
how you can do it in your country and in other countries.

199
00:23:56,197 --> 00:23:58,637
What are the problems in another country?

200
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:01,797
Put your attention outside, not inside

201
00:24:01,997 --> 00:24:04,237
this way that you should say

202
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:07,437
that I need this, I need that, I need that.

203
00:24:07,677 --> 00:24:12,237
We should know what other people need:

204
00:24:12,597 --> 00:24:15,317
what is their need,

205
00:24:15,517 --> 00:24:19,957
what the people in our society, in our nation,

206
00:24:20,277 --> 00:24:24,477
in our world require?

207
00:24:24,957 --> 00:24:28,077
Better write them down: what do they require?

208
00:24:28,397 --> 00:24:32,677
It's better, it will work; might be, it might be corrected.

209
00:24:32,877 --> 00:24:35,877
It's very important for Sahaja yogis to sit down

210
00:24:36,077 --> 00:24:41,277
and write down what the world needs, and what is to be done.

211
00:24:41,477 --> 00:24:43,757
It will be a nice idea for all of you

212
00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:48,677
to really aspire for that kind of homogeneous society

213
00:24:48,877 --> 00:24:50,797
that we have here today.

214
00:24:50,997 --> 00:24:53,677
And we'll be one day, you will be surprised

215
00:24:53,877 --> 00:24:57,557
that we will be the ones who will guide

216
00:24:57,757 --> 00:25:04,837
and lead the rest of the people with our love, attention and care.

217
00:25:05,877 --> 00:25:07,757
So it's very important time,

218
00:25:07,957 --> 00:25:11,157
and at this time we should all think on those lines.

219
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:15,557
Thank you very much. May God bless you.
