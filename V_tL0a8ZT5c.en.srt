1
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,640
I have told them in Hindi language

2
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,240
that love, you can see one person's love

3
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,920
manifested in so many eyes here.

4
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,840
And when I saw the enthusiasm

5
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:56,160
also My heart got filled with great love, greater love.

6
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,160
So one can see how powerful is this love.

7
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:10,680
All kinds of bad feelings, negative thinking

8
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,240
and also self-destructive elements

9
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,960
can be corrected and controlled very simply in Sahaja Yoga,

10
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:29,360
if you with sincere heart meditate morning and evening, twice.

11
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,360
That time you shouldn't see your watches, of course,

12
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,160
but enjoy, enjoy your meditation.

13
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,280
That will give you such a strength to love others,

14
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
to forgive others;

15
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,440
instead of you feeling bad for small, small things,

16
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,960
you feeling irritated

17
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,200
because you think your self-respect is challenged,

18
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,960
or else sometimes

19
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,560
we become aggressive towards some people,

20
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,720
very aggressive, for no fault of theirs.

21
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,880
Best thing is to see the vibrations of another person.

22
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:27,640
If the vibrations are bad, no use fighting,

23
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,400
it will create more confusions.

24
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,600
A person who has very bad vibrations,

25
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:42,640
you can't fight with that person, you cannot control that person.

26
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,400
Or a person who is too much of self-importance,

27
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,080
you should not try to pacify him

28
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:01,160
or sort of try to negotiate with him,

29
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,240
or also sometimes people try to pamper his vanity.

30
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,400
By doing that you are spoiling him more.

31
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,720
So the best thing is to show your love

32
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,800
in very sweet and different manner.

33
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,360
I'll give you an example which I've given many a times,

34
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,120
that I went to see this Gagangarh Maharaj

35
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,400
who was living on a very high mountain,

36
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,040
and there was no way of going by car or anything, and I had to walk.

37
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,720
So everybody said, "Mother, why should You go there after all?" 

38
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,040
I said, "You see the vibrations.

39
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,000
Good vibrations coming, all right? That's why I'm going." 

40
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,960
But he had told many people about Me, and he said that

41
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,200
"Adi Shakti is born in Bombay, why do you come to me?" 

42
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,600
So they told us.

43
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,680
So I said, "I must see this man," 

44
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,240
and that's how I went to his place to meet him.

45
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,000
Now, he's supposed to control the rain.

46
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,320
He could control the rain. So he was

47
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,440
sitting there on a stone

48
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,680
and he was moving his head with great

49
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,080
agitation, when I reached there.

50
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,280
And it was raining so heavily

51
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,720
that I went up to his place when I was completely drenched.

52
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,320
So I went inside the cave where he used to live,

53
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,720
and he came back

54
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,320
with great anger towards the rain.

55
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:05,120
So he said, "Mother, why did You not allow me to control the rain?" 

56
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,760
I said, "I didn't do that." 

57
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,160
"No, You did; because I can always control the rain,

58
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,560
and You were coming all the way with my invitation,

59
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,520
and this rain should not have misbehaved." 

60
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,280
I said, "No, no, he didn't misbehave." 

61
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,760
So what happened, he was quite in a temper, you know.

62
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,080
I said, "You settle down, I'll tell you what has happened.

63
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,960
See, you have bought a sari for Me

64
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,640
and you are a sanyasi,

65
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,080
and I won't take a sari from a sanyasi,

66
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,520
so the rain has made it convenient.

67
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,440
Now it's all drenched so I'll have to take your sari." 

68
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,440
Immediately, you see, he felt terrible love for Me,

69
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,680
started crying and he fell at My feet.

70
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,160
And then he said, "Mother, now I know

71
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,520
what is the greatness of love,

72
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,480
how it takes you away from mundane things and

73
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,320
dry behavior, and takes you to a place

74
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:18,800
where you can enjoy the showers of love." 

75
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,040
This is one of the stories I am telling you.

76
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,920
But the main thing behind the whole episode is this,

77
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,440
that you should try your love,

78
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,880
your tricks of pure love, pure love, and it works.

79
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,520
And you must learn, gradually you will learn how to try.

80
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,440
You should not give up.

81
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,560
Some people are very difficult, I agree - very, very difficult.

82
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,040
But at least try with people who are not so difficult.

83
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,400
And you'll be amazed that you'll have a good company

84
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,760
and lots of friends and friendship,

85
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,960
as we have here now in Sahaja Yoga.

86
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,640
First time when I came to Delhi I got such a fright of this place,

87
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,720
because there were very few Sahaja yogis and they brought

88
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,960
- I don't know why they wanted to do My puja, might be

89
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,760
Bombay people must have told them, something

90
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,680
- and they brought kum-kum and everything in a plastic

91
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,560
little, little bottles - oh, Ba!

92
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,240
I really shrunk, you know, with their ignorance.

93
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,760
I said, "Now what to do? What will happen?" 

94
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:36,840
But today, see, same Delhi which has become so great

95
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,760
and so beautiful, and so enthusiastic.

96
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,400
I saw them with their flags and

97
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,080
I didn't know there's such a procession of flags will be here,

98
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,520
though we had once or twice, I think, in Cabella.

99
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,080
But how they were enjoying each other!

100
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,200
It's really remarkable. If you can enjoy love,

101
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,440
you won't enjoy anything else

102
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,000
but love for other people, and not for yourself.

103
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,600
On the contrary you will see that your body,

104
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,800
your mind, your thoughts,

105
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,480
everything are directed towards creating love for others,

106
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,600
and not for yourself.

107
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,360
The whole attitude changes.

108
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,960
Like in the darkness you can't see anything,

109
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,120
but even there's a small light, it spreads all over.

110
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,560
Nobody tells the light that "You have to spread the light

111
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,800
all over,"  but it does.

112
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,720
In the same way you all are enlightened people,

113
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,280
you are all enlightened with love;

114
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,600
and the light of this love spreads automatically,

115
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,080
spontaneously, sahaj.

116
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,680
I was also very much

117
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,080
enamored the way our Yuva Shakti was dancing and enjoying.

118
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,920
I think it's a very great blessing,

119
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,680
because these days our young children,

120
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,240
our young people are getting astray.

121
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,760
They are not so badly off as in other countries,

122
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,760
but quite a big trend is going on

123
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,280
to spoil them and to make them a, what you'd call

124
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,680
a very Westernized, spoiled personality.

125
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,000
But now I saw so many of these dancing together,

126
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,360
forgetting their caste, creed, everything,

127
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,200
and enjoying each other's company.

128
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,080
This is something has to happen

129
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,360
in this country and in every country,

130
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,880
that we should all feel oneness

131
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,440
and enjoy the oneness with each other.

132
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,400
If we do not enjoy we are like a drop outside the ocean,

133
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,000
which can be dried any time.

134
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,240
But if you are a part and a parcel of that ocean,

135
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,080
then what happens is that every

136
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,520
movement of the ocean you carry with you,

137
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,560
and you are part and parcel of that ocean absolutely,

138
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,560
because you do not have separate identity.

139
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,680
All these things that make a separate identity

140
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,320
in our society or in our culture

141
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,160
or in our behavior, in personal lives,

142
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,240
all should be completely curbed down.

143
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,400
And this will settle many problems,

144
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,960
from family life to national life, to international life.

145
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,040
So we should curb down all such feelings of separatedness,

146
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,560
that we should have a separate house, separate state,

147
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,520
separate nation.

148
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,560
Gradually all nations will become one, I am sure of that;

149
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,080
because great times are coming,

150
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:24,040
and so many people at the helm of affairs will take to Sahaja Yoga.

151
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,120
Once they take to Sahaja Yog,

152
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,160
then things will be very much different.

153
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,400
Today it is not with them,

154
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,240
Sahaja Yoga is not with them.

155
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:42,320
They have no knowledge of our great movement of love,

156
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,280
so they want to have separate of everything.

157
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,000
They don't know tomorrow they will be scorched away

158
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,480
with the heat around or maybe with the rain they'll be washed away,

159
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,360
or maybe that the Mother Earth might absorb them.

160
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,960
So we all should be together, whatever may be the differences.

161
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,080
In different families we are born - after all,

162
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,640
all cannot be born in one family.

163
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,800
But now you belong to Sahaja Yoga family,

164
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,840
and this Sahaja Yoga family is one.

165
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,240
It doesn't believe in having separate existence

166
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,160
or separate speciality.

167
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,360
We're all one with each other,

168
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,640
and we don't care what sort of differences are outside.

169
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,960
I was really very much touched,

170
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,920
because now the new year is coming with

171
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,800
a new challenge for all of us

172
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,160
which we have to accept, that Kali Yuga is over

173
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,160
and we have to establish the Satya Yuga;

174
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:52,280
for which all of you from every country should have thinking,

175
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,880
how you can do it in your country and in other country.

176
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,560
What are the problems in another country?

177
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,720
Put your attention outside, not inside

178
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,160
this way that you should say

179
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,360
that I need this, I need that, I need that.

180
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,160
We should know what other people need:

181
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,240
what is their need,

182
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,880
what the people in our society, in our nation,

183
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,400
in our world require?

184
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,000
Better write them down: what do they require?

185
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,600
It's better, it will work; might be, it might be corrected.

186
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,800
It's very important for Sahaja yogis to sit down

187
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,200
and write down what the world needs, and what is to be done.

188
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,680
It will be a nice idea for all of you

189
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,600
to really aspire for that kind of homogeneous society

190
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,720
that we have here today.

191
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,600
And we'll be one day, you will be surprised

192
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,480
that we will be the ones who will guide

193
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:04,760
and lead the rest of the people with our love, attention and care.

194
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,680
So it's very important time,

195
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,080
and at this time we should all think on those lines.

196
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,480
Thank you very much. May God bless you.
