1
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:30,689
Today is the last day, ah, in this pendal

2
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:34,601
and today I'll be telling you

3
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:41,457
about the last center of Sahastrara.

4
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:06,317
They are all coming.

5
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:10,954
If I come late it is better I think (Laughing).

6
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:18,345
Still I was quite late I was thinking.

7
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:29,929
Do you think this is needed on the eyes so much

8
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:32,945
or are you not getting My picture just?

9
00:01:33,145 --> 00:01:36,922
This one if you could little bit push it the other way.

10
00:01:37,122 --> 00:01:40,355
This one is too much.

11
00:01:46,892 --> 00:01:50,462
That's thank you.

12
00:02:06,388 --> 00:02:15,543
So, this last center,

13
00:02:15,743 --> 00:02:26,320
 the Sahastrara, is contained in the limbic area of the brain.

14
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:38,686
Our head is like a coconut.

15
00:02:38,886 --> 00:02:45,749
The coconut has the hair, and then a hard nut

16
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:49,833
and then a black covering

17
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:59,636
and inside is white shell

18
00:02:59,837 --> 00:03:04,946
of coconut and inside is the space, the water.

19
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:10,772
In the same way, our brain is made.

20
00:03:10,972 --> 00:03:15,241
That's why coconut is called as Shreephala.

21
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:26,555
Is the fruit of the power that is Shree.

22
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:33,258
Shree power is the right side power

23
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:38,125
and the left side power is the Lalita power.

24
00:03:38,325 --> 00:03:43,883
So, we have two Chakras - left side, here, is the Lalita

25
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:50,781
and right side, here, is the Shree Chakra.

26
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:57,422
These two Chakras are working out

27
00:03:57,622 --> 00:04:00,883
the right side Mahasaraswati's power

28
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:06,223
and left side Mahakali's powers.

29
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:14,938
Now, the central power is the Kundalini.

30
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:21,907
That has to rise and penetrate through different Chakras,

31
00:04:22,107 --> 00:04:30,227
enter into the limbic area and enlighten the seven Pithas -

32
00:04:30,427 --> 00:04:34,290
seats of these seven Chakras.

33
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,853
So, it penetrates through six Chakras,

34
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:44,228
enters into the limbic area,

35
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:52,834
enlightens all the seven Pithas in the brain,

36
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:59,279
which are placed along the mid-line of the limbic area.

37
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:03,607
So, we start it from the back, is placed here,

38
00:05:03,807 --> 00:05:08,255
at the back, is the Mooladhara Chakra.

39
00:05:08,455 --> 00:05:14,903
Around it is the Swadishthana,

40
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:20,255
then is the Nabhi, then the Heart,

41
00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:25,013
then the Vishuddhi and then the Agnya.

42
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:31,536
So, all these six centers are combining

43
00:05:31,736 --> 00:05:35,302
to make the seventh center.

44
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:39,732
This is a very important point, which we should know.

45
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:43,504
Now, the Shree Chakra is the right side working

46
00:05:43,705 --> 00:05:47,793
and the Lalita Chakra is the left side working.

47
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:54,231
So, when the Kundalini doesn't rise

48
00:05:54,432 --> 00:05:59,786
then we do with our right side

49
00:05:59,987 --> 00:06:03,536
our physical and mental activities.

50
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:07,270
So our brain is doing right side activity

51
00:06:07,471 --> 00:06:12,838
and that's why our brain is like Shreephala.

52
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:22,090
Sahastrara is actually

53
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:28,567
is the assemblage of these six Chakras

54
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:31,301
and is a hollow space,

55
00:06:31,502 --> 00:06:36,098
on the sides of it there are one thousand Nadis.

56
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:42,692
And when the light penetrates into the limbic area,

57
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:50,871
then the enlightenment of these Nadis take place

58
00:06:51,072 --> 00:06:54,519
and you can see them as flames,

59
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,605
very gentle flames burning

60
00:06:58,806 --> 00:07:02,418
and these flames have all the seven colors

61
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:08,142
that you see in the vibjyor.

62
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:14,980
But the last one, ultimately becomes again integrated

63
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:18,168
and it is a crystal clear flame.

64
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:25,400
All these seven lights ultimately become crystal clear.

65
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:31,230
So, you have Sahastrara with one thousand petals,

66
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:34,152
as they called it,

67
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:40,191
but if you cut the brain in a transverse section

68
00:07:40,392 --> 00:07:44,761
or horizontal section, you will be able to see

69
00:07:44,962 --> 00:07:50,097
that all these nerves are built like this

70
00:07:50,298 --> 00:07:54,824
along the limbic area, all of them are like a petal,

71
00:07:55,025 --> 00:08:00,566
and if you cut it like this, you will find that

72
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:08,329
there are many nerves in every bundle of nerves.

73
00:08:09,635 --> 00:08:12,022
So, when it is enlightened,

74
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:26,058
you can see Sahastrara as a burning bundle of flames.

75
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:37,438
When I'm speaking you should not do all these things, please.

76
00:08:41,424 --> 00:08:45,908
They are still coming and just disturbing Me.

77
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:52,127
This a very deep subject.

78
00:08:56,918 --> 00:09:01,725
So the, when the enlightenment of the Kundalini

79
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:08,139
takes place in the brain,

80
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:15,373
then the truth is perceived through your brain.

81
00:09:15,574 --> 00:09:18,007
That's why it's called as Satyakhand, means

82
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:25,046
you start seeing the truth perceived by your brain

83
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:29,562
because so far whatever you see through your brain,

84
00:09:29,763 --> 00:09:33,359
is not the truth.

85
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,132
What you see, is just the outer side,

86
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,046
say, you can see the colors.

87
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:44,655
You can see the different aesthetics of the colors.

88
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:48,850
You can see the quality of the thing.

89
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:53,569
But you cannot say

90
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:59,592
whether this carpet has been used by some saint.

91
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:03,391
You cannot say whether this is made by a devil

92
00:10:03,592 --> 00:10:07,313
or a divine person.

93
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:10,774
You cannot say that this gentleman,

94
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:17,290
is he a good person or he is an evil person.

95
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:21,142
You cannot say if this Deity

96
00:10:21,343 --> 00:10:26,205
has come out of the Mother Earth or not.

97
00:10:26,406 --> 00:10:36,302
Also, you cannot say about any person,

98
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,694
who is your relation,

99
00:10:38,895 --> 00:10:48,319
whether he is a good relation or a bad relation,

100
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,598
or what sort of a person he is,

101
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,700
whether he goes to wrong people or to the right people,

102
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:58,106
whether he has connections with wrong side

103
00:10:58,307 --> 00:11:00,892
or with good side.

104
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:05,384
Here good means Divine. So actually you do not know

105
00:11:05,585 --> 00:11:10,204
anything about divinity with your mind, nothing.

106
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:14,290
Nothing - is impossible for you to judge a person

107
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:17,543
about his divinity unless and until the Kundalini

108
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:22,402
reaches at least this part, which is the limbic area.

109
00:11:22,603 --> 00:11:27,238
You cannot make out whether a person is real or not,

110
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:31,488
whether a guru is real or not.

111
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:38,301
Because divinity cannot be perceived through your brain,

112
00:11:38,502 --> 00:11:46,275
unless and until this light of your Spirit shines into it.

113
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:50,523
Now, the Spirit is expressed in the heart,

114
00:11:50,724 --> 00:11:52,724
is reflected in the heart,

115
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:56,919
the center of the Spirit, we can say, is in the heart.

116
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,388
But actually, the seat of Spirit is above, here

117
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:07,044
And that is the Spirit what we call of the God Almighty,

118
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:16,383
Who say, Whom you call [SOUNDS LIKE Parvardigar],

119
00:12:16,584 --> 00:12:20,016
you call Him Sadashiva

120
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:27,899
or you can call Him, ah, the Rahim

121
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,633
and you can call Him by many names

122
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:36,117
which are said about

123
00:12:36,318 --> 00:12:41,305
the Lord who is God Almighty.

124
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:45,289
Neeranjan, they call It, Neerankar,

125
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:50,930
every sort of words which start with Nira, Nihi.

126
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:57,502
Now, at every center

127
00:12:57,703 --> 00:13:02,693
in the body you'll receive a different type of joy.

128
00:13:03,969 --> 00:13:07,210
Every center has a different type of joy

129
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:10,327
and there are names for every types of joy

130
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:14,788
you receive at every center when the Kundalini rises.

131
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:19,343
But when the Kundalini comes into the Sahastrara,

132
00:13:19,544 --> 00:13:24,320
then the joy you receive is called as Neerananda,

133
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:26,067
Neerananda.

134
00:13:26,268 --> 00:13:33,674
Now, Nee means nothing else but Ananda. Neerananda.

135
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:38,646
Also, is surprising, My name is Neera -

136
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:42,310
also, in My family I'm called as Neera.

137
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:46,583
And Neera also means Mary, Maria.

138
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,849
Because it means marine. Neera is water.

139
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,841
Neera means water in Sanskrit language.

140
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:57,646
It is called as Neerananda in the brain.

141
00:13:57,847 --> 00:14:02,427
And this stage ultimately unfolds.

142
00:14:02,628 --> 00:14:07,607
First what you know is the Satya, is the Truth -

143
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:13,107
what is this another gentleman is suffering from,

144
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:17,646
that you see on your fingers. First you see your fingers.

145
00:14:17,847 --> 00:14:21,459
With your attention you know what Chakras,

146
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,482
what fingers are catching, with your attention.

147
00:14:24,683 --> 00:14:28,576
Then with your brain you can depict

148
00:14:28,777 --> 00:14:31,068
what center, which is catching.

149
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:33,269
Because, if you say this finger,

150
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,324
that doesn't mean it is Vishuddhi Chakra.

151
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:40,519
But your brain then says, "It is Vishuddhi."

152
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,688
And that depicts it that this fellow is suffering

153
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:48,297
from the troubles of the Vishuddhi Chakra.

154
00:14:48,498 --> 00:14:51,578
But still it is rational.

155
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:56,109
Because you see what finger it catches and then you say it.

156
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:04,581
But when the Satyakhanda or the Sahastrara unfolds itself more,

157
00:15:04,782 --> 00:15:10,305
you don't have to think about it, you just say it.

158
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:18,675
Then there is no difference between your Chitta and your Satya.

159
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:28,328
The enlightened Chitta and the enlightened brain become one.

160
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,737
There is no problem at all for such a person,

161
00:15:32,938 --> 00:15:36,244
there's no need to see on the fingers, no need to say

162
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:40,291
anything on the fingers and then depict it through brain.

163
00:15:40,492 --> 00:15:42,955
Which you have learnt in Sahaja Yoga,

164
00:15:43,156 --> 00:15:47,432
that if you find something wrong here, it means Agnya -

165
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:52,265
that's not necessary! You just say Agnya.

166
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:57,859
And you just say it and it is there.

167
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:04,173
Then it unfolds more.

168
00:16:04,374 --> 00:16:09,306
First it is integrated with, as I said, Chitta.

169
00:16:09,507 --> 00:16:18,235
Then, when it gets absolutely integrated with the Spirit,

170
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:25,607
then whatever you say, is the truth.

171
00:16:27,137 --> 00:16:30,691
You just say it, it is so.

172
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:42,511
That is how this brain unfolds into three new dimensions.

173
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:50,754
First, it depicts the truth through logical conclusions.

174
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:55,059
Because, I have told you that

175
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,739
if this finger is catching then it is Vishuddhi.

176
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,794
And then you ask the person, "Have you got a problem here?"

177
00:17:01,995 --> 00:17:05,278
He says, "Yes". Then you believe in Me

178
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:08,669
and then you believe that this is the Vishuddhi Chakra,

179
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,870
which is showing, is true.

180
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,739
This is the logical conclusion, in a way,

181
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:18,012
that you have experimented, you are seeing

182
00:17:18,213 --> 00:17:21,442
and still doubting whether Mother says it's true or not.

183
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:24,419
And then, you are sure, "Yes, it is so,

184
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,864
we have seen that this is Vishuddhi Chakra." So,

185
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:30,372
the truth becomes logically acceptable to his brain.

186
00:17:30,573 --> 00:17:35,403
But still, there is the brain working out on its gross level.

187
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:43,465
Then the second stage, as I told you, where you believe,

188
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,294
you know for definite that this means Vishuddhi Chakra,

189
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,495
no doubt about it. Nobody.

190
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:51,112
Then - then we start Nirvikalpa has started,

191
00:17:51,313 --> 00:17:54,706
when there's no doubt about Me or Sahaja Yoga.

192
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:59,417
But then, the new unfolding starts within.

193
00:17:59,618 --> 00:18:04,425
For that, one has to do meditation.

194
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:10,001
In humility, one has to do meditation.

195
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,261
And then also, for this new dimension,

196
00:18:14,462 --> 00:18:19,353
where your Chitta itself becomes merged

197
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:24,876
into your brain or into the enlightened brain,

198
00:18:25,077 --> 00:18:30,597
for that one has to very honestly and humbly

199
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:34,902
surrender to Sahaja Yoga.

200
00:18:35,103 --> 00:18:40,722
Now, what do we do when we get our vibrations?

201
00:18:40,923 --> 00:18:43,199
We have different-different reactions.

202
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,426
Some people do not even understand the value of vibrations.

203
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:53,837
Some people try to learn what it means.

204
00:18:54,182 --> 00:18:58,269
And some people suddenly think, "O, now they are realized souls,

205
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,925
they can go on giving realizations, this, that."

206
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:05,774
They go on a ride of a ego-trip.

207
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:10,503
When they go on a ride of a ego-trip, then they find that

208
00:19:10,704 --> 00:19:12,823
they've failed and they've to come back,

209
00:19:13,024 --> 00:19:16,886
from the very beginning they start. It's like

210
00:19:17,087 --> 00:19:21,438
the game of Snake & Ladder.

211
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:27,932
So, reaction to vibration should be

212
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:33,455
a very humble, receptive reaction.

213
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:39,494
Now, on the gross level, because as I told you that the brain

214
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:46,002
is the one which holds the Father in it.

215
00:19:46,203 --> 00:19:51,229
So, if we commit any sins against the Father,

216
00:19:51,446 --> 00:19:58,140
then this unfoldment in the brain takes some time.

217
00:19:59,135 --> 00:20:03,247
So, we start reading books.

218
00:20:03,448 --> 00:20:06,230
And though people have told that first see the vibrations

219
00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:08,431
and then read the books, still we say, "O, what's wrong,

220
00:20:08,632 --> 00:20:11,363
we should read other books."

221
00:20:11,564 --> 00:20:15,121
You go down again, Snake and Ladder, as I said.

222
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:19,861
That is one of the snakes.

223
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:22,744
We think that, "What's the need to do meditation,

224
00:20:22,945 --> 00:20:28,142
I've no time, I have this thing, that thing." You do not progress.

225
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,921
The other point which is very gross.

226
00:20:33,122 --> 00:20:36,288
Also, there are some very gross people in Sahaja Yoga

227
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:39,476
who enter into it. Doesn't matter.

228
00:20:39,677 --> 00:20:42,322
But first thing you must know you have to be honest,

229
00:20:42,523 --> 00:20:45,947
very honest in Sahaja Yoga.

230
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:50,275
The honesty is like - I have seen people.

231
00:20:50,476 --> 00:20:54,713
If we have a dinner, say, for a marriage-party,

232
00:20:54,914 --> 00:20:58,572
they'll just crawl into it without having any self-respect,

233
00:20:58,773 --> 00:21:01,076
without having any understanding as to

234
00:21:01,277 --> 00:21:04,373
who is going to pay for the all this? They'll bring all their family,

235
00:21:04,574 --> 00:21:07,545
come down and sit down.

236
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:13,092
There are people who avoid paying money

237
00:21:13,293 --> 00:21:17,295
which should be paid for Sahaja Yoga.

238
00:21:17,496 --> 00:21:20,303
Supposing, they're eating food or they are travelling

239
00:21:20,504 --> 00:21:24,389
or they're coming from abroad,

240
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:28,623
they have to pay money for their travelling, for their food.

241
00:21:28,824 --> 00:21:32,318
And, sometimes, you know I have to pay lot of money.

242
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:35,770
Doesn't matter, I don't mind. But is not good for you,

243
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:39,340
the main thing it's not good for you.

244
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,961
So, how you behave towards Sahaja Yoga

245
00:21:43,162 --> 00:21:45,930
as far as money is concerned is also very important,

246
00:21:46,131 --> 00:21:50,211
though it looks gross. But it can give a big trouble

247
00:21:50,412 --> 00:21:54,922
in the unfoldment because of the Nabhi catching

248
00:21:55,123 --> 00:21:58,070
and, as you know, if the Nabhi catches

249
00:21:58,271 --> 00:22:02,195
it can spread up to the whole of void.

250
00:22:02,396 --> 00:22:05,656
And if the void is catching Ekadesha Rudra,

251
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:10,880
which is placed here, the destructive forces, built-in.

252
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:17,133
So, before coming to Sahaja Yoga, it was all right,

253
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:19,656
you're doing all kinds of things

254
00:22:19,857 --> 00:22:24,383
and you'd have smoothly gone to hell without any difficulties.

255
00:22:24,584 --> 00:22:26,946
It is very easy to go to hell.

256
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:30,594
You can take two running jumps and go to hell.

257
00:22:30,795 --> 00:22:35,235
The rest of it you should see. But going to hell is the easiest thing.

258
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:39,476
For that you don't have to work hard or do anything about it.

259
00:22:39,677 --> 00:22:44,624
But, when you are ascending, when you are rising,

260
00:22:44,825 --> 00:22:47,265
then it is little difficult.

261
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,374
You have to be careful that you should not falter,

262
00:22:50,575 --> 00:22:54,280
you should not fall and that you are ascending.

263
00:22:54,481 --> 00:22:57,186
So, you have to be very alert about yourself

264
00:22:57,387 --> 00:23:02,467
that you are not falling into the same habits, which you had.

265
00:23:02,668 --> 00:23:08,030
Some people have a habit of saving money at the cost of Sahaja Yoga.

266
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:12,538
Some have a habit of making money at the cost of Sahaja Yoga.

267
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:18,546
Some people have habit of not giving the due amount -

268
00:23:18,747 --> 00:23:23,788
and like that. It's something, you know, of cheating.

269
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:26,244
They all go out of Sahaja Yoga in no time.

270
00:23:26,445 --> 00:23:29,385
They may be looking like great leaders in the beginning,

271
00:23:29,586 --> 00:23:33,526
but they go out just like that. And many a time people tell Me

272
00:23:33,727 --> 00:23:35,909
"why don't You keep a proper account and all that".

273
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,826
But in Sahaja Yoga I'm not supposed to keep any accounts

274
00:23:39,027 --> 00:23:43,381
or anything. Because My accountants are Sahaja Yogis.

275
00:23:43,582 --> 00:23:45,582
If you try to play tricks with Sahaja Yoga,

276
00:23:45,783 --> 00:23:48,895
immediately you are pushed out; in your awareness,

277
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:51,606
in your Nabhi Chakra you are never helped -

278
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:53,807
you may make a thousand rupees here,

279
00:23:54,008 --> 00:23:56,963
but you will thousands of rupees by get into trouble.

280
00:23:57,164 --> 00:24:00,643
You will have any kind of a problem that I cannot tell you

281
00:24:00,844 --> 00:24:05,510
and then you will say, "how did I get this problem?"

282
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:12,830
So, Nabhi Chakra if you are not honest in your seeking.

283
00:24:13,031 --> 00:24:16,376
Honesty of seeking not only means "I want to seek."

284
00:24:16,577 --> 00:24:19,142
It also means what is your behavior is,

285
00:24:19,343 --> 00:24:22,814
towards yourself and towards others.

286
00:24:23,015 --> 00:24:25,286
You have to be honest to yourself

287
00:24:25,487 --> 00:24:28,044
that you sit down for meditation,

288
00:24:28,245 --> 00:24:31,216
try to improve your Antar Yoga,

289
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:36,802
try to make your - ah - thoughtless awareness,

290
00:24:37,003 --> 00:24:42,169
this feeling of thoughtlessness, wider and wider.

291
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:48,643
Try to achieve that state where you really feel thoughtless.

292
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:53,792
So the honesty lies as you rise higher and higher,

293
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,089
deeper and deeper into your own being.

294
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:02,402
First you depend on Me, that "after all, Mother is going to do everything.

295
00:25:02,603 --> 00:25:05,769
When I went to Mother, my Sahastrara opened out.

296
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,488
This thing happened, then this thing happened."

297
00:25:08,689 --> 00:25:12,433
But what about you doing something that helps you

298
00:25:12,634 --> 00:25:14,902
to open your Sahastrara.

299
00:25:15,103 --> 00:25:20,923
So, opening of the Sahastrara is very important.

300
00:25:21,314 --> 00:25:27,197
Now, surprisingly, it is so placed that Sahastrara has got

301
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:31,103
the Brahmarandhra at the level where there is,

302
00:25:31,304 --> 00:25:36,306
I mean, at the point, where there is the Heart Chakra.

303
00:25:36,507 --> 00:25:39,408
So, we must know that Brahmarandhra

304
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:43,986
is directly connected to your heart.

305
00:25:44,187 --> 00:25:50,064
If it is not done from the heart, superficially done Sahaja Yoga,

306
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:52,265
you can not go very high.

307
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:55,476
You have to put your full heart into it -

308
00:25:55,677 --> 00:25:57,765
that is the main thing.

309
00:25:57,966 --> 00:26:00,421
Like, people they come to Sahaja Yog

310
00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:02,622
and they are murmuring behind.

311
00:26:02,823 --> 00:26:05,466
"This could have been like that, that could have been like that,"

312
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:11,021
all those things. All such people also are

313
00:26:11,222 --> 00:26:14,688
what Christ calls as "murmuring souls." He said that,

314
00:26:14,889 --> 00:26:17,157
be careful about these murmuring souls -

315
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:22,237
those who go on murmuring behind and taking advantage

316
00:26:22,438 --> 00:26:29,118
- ah - as if - ah - they, they are trying to save others.

317
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:32,735
All such people also can suffer a lot.

318
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:36,063
Because, they are doing a double game.

319
00:26:36,264 --> 00:26:39,813
And such a double game is very dangerous

320
00:26:40,014 --> 00:26:43,813
when you enter into the kingdom of God.

321
00:26:44,014 --> 00:26:48,321
Any kingdom you are member of, any kingdom,

322
00:26:48,522 --> 00:26:52,048
if you are treacherous to that kingdom, you are punished.

323
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:55,984
But in the God's kingdom, it's so blissful,

324
00:26:56,185 --> 00:27:02,330
absolutely blissful, complete blessings are poured on,

325
00:27:02,531 --> 00:27:09,041
absolutely, with everything - health, wealth,

326
00:27:09,242 --> 00:27:12,939
mental, emotional - all kinds of prosperity

327
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,701
you can get in Sahaja Yoga, no doubt.

328
00:27:15,902 --> 00:27:20,709
But when you are so much blessed, you are also forgiven,

329
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:24,834
and forgiven, and forgiven, and there is a long rope

330
00:27:25,035 --> 00:27:30,936
given to you to hang yourself. But you really hang fully,

331
00:27:31,137 --> 00:27:33,043
it's not half way.

332
00:27:33,244 --> 00:27:36,840
So, those people who think they can be dishonest

333
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:39,041
with Sahaja Yoga,

334
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,371
have to be very careful; please don't do it.

335
00:27:42,572 --> 00:27:45,174
If you don't like to be in Sahaja Yoga, you better go away,

336
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:50,666
is better; from your point of view and from our point of view also.

337
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:54,689
Because, in case you are dishonest,

338
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,658
you are trying to play tricks and games,

339
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:03,010
and you suffer and you look funny and strange,

340
00:28:03,211 --> 00:28:05,971
then people will say "what's wrong with Sahaja Yoga?"

341
00:28:06,172 --> 00:28:09,693
So we will unnecessarily suffer. Because we cannot show you

342
00:28:09,894 --> 00:28:16,927
in the mirror, that this man has been very, very - aaah - disloyal.

343
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:20,052
We cannot show that. So, it will bring a bad name to us -

344
00:28:20,253 --> 00:28:23,927
first of all. And secondly, you will be harmed,

345
00:28:24,128 --> 00:28:26,880
by this kind of a thing. If you are harmed,

346
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:32,380
then also we'll have a bad name that "how could it happened?"

347
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:35,888
But if you are honest about Sahaja Yoga

348
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,951
and about your seeking,

349
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:42,256
you don't know how much God looks after you.

350
00:28:42,457 --> 00:28:45,263
Anybody who tries to do any harm to you will be

351
00:28:45,464 --> 00:28:48,701
very badly harmed and removed from your path.

352
00:28:48,902 --> 00:28:53,232
God protects you out and out and He looks after you

353
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:58,521
with complete attention and care.

354
00:28:58,722 --> 00:29:03,584
And He's so loving that description of His compassion

355
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:09,870
cannot be given in words but can be only felt and understood.

356
00:29:10,777 --> 00:29:14,951
Now, the problem is, people who are dishonest

357
00:29:15,152 --> 00:29:19,053
are because of their background, sometimes,

358
00:29:19,254 --> 00:29:26,467
because of their education, because of their upbringing

359
00:29:26,668 --> 00:29:31,045
or may be because they are cowards.

360
00:29:31,246 --> 00:29:34,717
But there is also another thing that can make you dishonest -

361
00:29:34,918 --> 00:29:40,264
is your poorva-janmas and that's how you take your birth

362
00:29:40,465 --> 00:29:46,936
and your Kundalini is made like that. But after Realization,

363
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:51,233
those people who are of a great valor

364
00:29:51,434 --> 00:29:55,928
and great strength ascend so fast

365
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:59,647
that all the problems of the stars,

366
00:29:59,848 --> 00:30:04,608
all the problems of your Nakshatras and all that constellations,

367
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:07,406
everything disappears and you become a Sahaja Yogi

368
00:30:07,607 --> 00:30:10,515
means a newly born, absolutely a different personality;

369
00:30:10,716 --> 00:30:15,578
it has nothing to do from where you have come.

370
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:21,732
Like an egg becoming a beautiful bird.

371
00:30:24,413 --> 00:30:28,212
So, this Kundalini, when it arrives here,

372
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:36,009
the first hurdle the Kundalini has to enter into Sahastrara,

373
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:40,158
is Ekadesha Rudra, is here.

374
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:47,585
There are 11 rudra shaktis, 11 destroying shaktis placed here.

375
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:54,893
Five on this side, five on the other side and one in the center.

376
00:31:02,113 --> 00:31:06,850
These are obstruction within us,

377
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:11,389
built by two kinds of sins we commit.

378
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:16,842
If we bow our head to wrong type of gurus

379
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:23,881
and submit ourselves to their vicious ways,

380
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:29,451
then we develop rudra sh... -

381
00:31:29,652 --> 00:31:35,612
rudra problems on the left hand side - these five go out.

382
00:31:48,718 --> 00:31:54,892
If you have, I think it's other way round, ha, is the -

383
00:31:55,093 --> 00:31:58,996
if you have bowed - because I've never bowed to anybody wrong,

384
00:31:59,205 --> 00:32:03,801
so I don't know what to say, the mistake comes from there.

385
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:11,168
If you bow to someone who is a wrong type of a person

386
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:19,402
and who is anti God,

387
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:29,580
then the problem comes on this side of the thing,

388
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,827
on the right side.

389
00:32:33,695 --> 00:32:39,346
If you have the sense that "I can look after myself,

390
00:32:39,547 --> 00:32:42,791
I'm my own guru, I, who can teach me,

391
00:32:42,992 --> 00:32:46,385
I don't want to listen to anybody and I don't believe in God,

392
00:32:46,586 --> 00:32:50,174
ah - who is God, I just don't care for God".

393
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:54,947
All such feeling, if you have, then,

394
00:32:55,148 --> 00:33:00,150
your right side doesn't catch, but the left side catches.

395
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:06,061
Because right side moves this side and the left side this side.

396
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:12,118
So these ten things and one is Virata Vishnu, because also

397
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:15,186
in the stomach we have got 10 Guru Sthanas

398
00:33:15,387 --> 00:33:18,991
and one that of Vishnu.

399
00:33:19,192 --> 00:33:22,397
So, the seeking is also wrong,

400
00:33:22,598 --> 00:33:27,816
as well as these 10 Gurus are there.

401
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:33,585
Then you develop this Ekadesha Rudra.

402
00:33:33,786 --> 00:33:38,921
When this thing is settle - set in within you,

403
00:33:39,122 --> 00:33:43,562
as I said, one on this side, one on that side.

404
00:33:43,763 --> 00:33:48,304
So, those people who are bowed to wrong type of people

405
00:33:48,505 --> 00:33:55,578
develop a temperament or a kind of a personality

406
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:58,570
which is very vulnerable for incurable diseases

407
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:00,771
like cancer and all that.

408
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:05,281
You may develop cancer or any such disease -

409
00:34:05,482 --> 00:34:10,661
those who have bowed to wrong type of people.

410
00:34:11,646 --> 00:34:17,359
Now, those who think, "I'm better than anybody else.

411
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,851
I don't care for God, I don't want God, I've nothing to do"-

412
00:34:21,052 --> 00:34:29,244
all such people develop the left side Ekadesha.

413
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:37,568
And left side Ekadesha is extremely dangerous too.

414
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:41,982
Because such people develop the problems of the right side -

415
00:34:42,183 --> 00:34:47,701
heart attacks, physically I am saying,

416
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:52,792
and all other problems of the right side.

417
00:34:56,868 --> 00:35:02,221
So, one of the greatest hurdles of Kundalini entering into

418
00:35:02,422 --> 00:35:09,265
Sahastrara is this Ekadesha Rudra, which comes from Void.

419
00:35:11,597 --> 00:35:20,690
And which covers the Medha - is the plate of the brain.

420
00:35:23,877 --> 00:35:31,658
And that is how it cannot enter into the limbic area.

421
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:39,255
Even those who have been to wrong gurus,

422
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:41,607
if they've reached right conclusion

423
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:45,334
and surrender themselves to Sahaja Yoga,

424
00:35:45,535 --> 00:35:50,022
accepting their mistakes and saying

425
00:35:50,223 --> 00:35:54,194
that "I am my own Guru,"

426
00:35:54,395 --> 00:35:58,428
they can be cured. And those, who have been thinking

427
00:35:58,629 --> 00:36:01,080
that "I'm above all, I don't believe in God, who is God,

428
00:36:01,281 --> 00:36:03,300
I don't believe in any prophets or anything" -

429
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:06,769
anything against God or prophets is the same.

430
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:15,340
Anti-God personality who talks like that, who develops the problems,

431
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:23,867
gets all right if he humbles down himself

432
00:36:24,068 --> 00:36:27,851
and accepts Sahaja Yoga is the only way

433
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:34,890
of - of entering into the superconsciousness.

434
00:36:35,091 --> 00:36:40,445
I've seen people who have been Tantrikas, are being saved.

435
00:36:40,646 --> 00:36:44,781
I've seen people who have done all kinds of wrong things

436
00:36:44,982 --> 00:36:48,225
have been saved. Those people, who were members

437
00:36:48,426 --> 00:36:55,097
of very funny, strange organizations have been saved.

438
00:36:55,496 --> 00:37:01,389
But - it is very difficult to convince anyone

439
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,577
that whatever they are doing has been wrong

440
00:37:04,778 --> 00:37:08,679
and they should come to right path.

441
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:20,168
So, a star came to play its part called Pluto,

442
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:27,659
and this star is the one which has brought cancer disease

443
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:32,753
because, Pluto is the one that cures cancer,

444
00:37:32,954 --> 00:37:38,362
or all such diseases which are incurable.

445
00:37:38,563 --> 00:37:48,189
So, those people who just go head-long into wrong paths,

446
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:53,306
suffer from funny type of heart troubles,

447
00:37:53,507 --> 00:37:57,689
palpitations,

448
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:01,994
insomnia,

449
00:38:02,195 --> 00:38:05,502
vomitings,

450
00:38:05,703 --> 00:38:08,369
giddiness,

451
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:16,210
all sorts of ah, we can say irrelevant talking.

452
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:23,256
It is a very serious thing to go to a wrong guru

453
00:38:23,457 --> 00:38:27,777
and bow to him.

454
00:38:29,355 --> 00:38:39,577
Sahastrara becomes a closed area for such a person.

455
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:45,901
The persons who are against Sahaja Yoga,

456
00:38:46,102 --> 00:38:50,620
have a very strong Sahastrara, like a nut,

457
00:38:50,821 --> 00:38:53,868
in the sense that it's such a strong shell

458
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:57,438
that you can not just break it - it's a strong shell,

459
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:00,735
like a thick nut.

460
00:39:00,936 --> 00:39:07,428
Even if you want to use a hammer, you cannot break it.

461
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,235
Today, the time has come,

462
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:15,727
that you have to recognize Sahaja Yoga,

463
00:39:15,928 --> 00:39:18,040
you have to.

464
00:39:18,241 --> 00:39:22,056
You did not recognize any saints, any prophets, anyone,

465
00:39:22,257 --> 00:39:24,061
any incarnations. ealization.

466
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:27,908
But today the condition is that you have to recognize.

467
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:31,580
If you do not recognize it, your Sahastrara cannot be opened

468
00:39:31,781 --> 00:39:35,668
because this is the time when the Sahastrara was opened

469
00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:38,434
and you have to have your Realization.

470
00:39:38,635 --> 00:39:45,801
So it's a very important thing that you have to recognize

471
00:39:46,002 --> 00:39:47,690
Sahaja Yoga. There are many people who say that

472
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:50,979
"Mother, why to believe in Sahaja Yoga this way,

473
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,292
we can just call You just Mother, You could be my Mother," you see.

474
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:59,917
All right, doesn't matter. But you can't get your Realization.

475
00:40:00,118 --> 00:40:03,276
And even if you get it, you cannot retain it.

476
00:40:03,477 --> 00:40:07,945
So you have to recognize, recognition is the only

477
00:40:08,146 --> 00:40:15,354
worship of Sahaja Yoga.

478
00:40:15,555 --> 00:40:24,554
Recognition is the only worship when you want to know

479
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:28,249
God in Sahaja Yoga.

480
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:35,101
All the other Ganas, Devatas, Deities, Shaktis,

481
00:40:35,302 --> 00:40:40,343
are one in unison in Sahaja Yoga.

482
00:40:40,544 --> 00:40:45,023
And anyone who does not recognize Sahaja Yoga,

483
00:40:45,224 --> 00:40:47,586
They just are not bothered about you,

484
00:40:47,787 --> 00:40:51,054
what sort of a person you are.

485
00:40:51,255 --> 00:40:55,359
For example, a man who worships Shiva,

486
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,780
he comes to Me,

487
00:40:57,981 --> 00:41:02,678
and I find his heart is catching - surprising.

488
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:07,522
He says, "Mother, I worship Shiva, how is it, my heart is catching?"

489
00:41:07,723 --> 00:41:11,210
I said, "You have to recognize Sahaja Yoga.

490
00:41:11,411 --> 00:41:14,023
Just ask Shiva."

491
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:16,726
And when he asked the questions to Shiva,

492
00:41:16,927 --> 00:41:19,742
then only the vibrations start flowing.

493
00:41:19,943 --> 00:41:25,226
So, Sahastrara takes charge

494
00:41:25,427 --> 00:41:29,179
that it makes you recognize and also it convinces you -

495
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,411
to proves it to you.

496
00:41:33,693 --> 00:41:39,890
And by this proving, even if you are not recognizing,

497
00:41:40,091 --> 00:41:46,364
then you cannot get your Realization.

498
00:41:48,836 --> 00:41:54,401
But those who recognize also, recognize partly -

499
00:41:54,602 --> 00:41:58,052
they take liberties, they behave in a funny manner

500
00:41:58,253 --> 00:42:04,568
without understanding that Who is this Person, Who is here?

501
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:08,316
I've seen many a times, I'm talking, people are just putting

502
00:42:08,517 --> 00:42:11,787
their hand up, Kundalini, they are just talking,

503
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:17,037
chit chatting - I'm surprised. Because, if you have recognized,

504
00:42:17,238 --> 00:42:20,193
then you should know whom you are facing.

505
00:42:20,394 --> 00:42:24,279
Because, it's not for My good, I'm not going to lose anything.

506
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,013
But only you, in your ascent have not recognized.

507
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:32,073
That shows that you have not yet recognized.

508
00:42:32,847 --> 00:42:38,341
And the way some people try to monopolize Me also,

509
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:41,740
is absolutely wrong. There is no need to monopolize Me,

510
00:42:41,941 --> 00:42:45,651
nobody can monopolize. There are some people who say that

511
00:42:45,852 --> 00:42:48,776
"Mother must have misunderstood." I never misunderstand,

512
00:42:48,977 --> 00:42:52,206
there's no question. Or, some people try to tell Me,

513
00:42:52,407 --> 00:42:56,972
"Do this, do that" - that also not necessary.

514
00:42:57,173 --> 00:43:01,425
Try to open yourself to this protocol

515
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:03,626
which is very important in Sahaja Yoga,

516
00:43:03,827 --> 00:43:06,331
which I have told for the first time today,

517
00:43:06,532 --> 00:43:11,894
that you must try to recognize in a full way.

518
00:43:12,095 --> 00:43:15,347
And if you do not recognize, I'm sorry,

519
00:43:15,548 --> 00:43:19,458
I can't give you the Realization, which will sustain,

520
00:43:19,659 --> 00:43:24,192
I'll, it will start, but it may not sustain.

521
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:29,692
So, this is the simplest way of achieving your higher things

522
00:43:29,893 --> 00:43:35,096
is by recognizing gradually and recognizing gradually.

523
00:43:38,557 --> 00:43:41,387
It is very difficult to tell anybody if something is wrong

524
00:43:41,588 --> 00:43:44,481
with that person, it's impossible.

525
00:43:44,682 --> 00:43:47,465
After Sahaja Yoga, I can tell you, this Chakra is catching,

526
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,342
that Chakra is catching. But also because you know

527
00:43:50,543 --> 00:43:52,842
what does that Chakra means, you can come back on me.

528
00:43:53,043 --> 00:43:55,623
"No, no, Mother, You see, it's not so. I'm not."

529
00:43:55,824 --> 00:43:58,404
That's not so, why should I tell you you are catching?

530
00:43:58,605 --> 00:44:01,888
You have to cleanse yourself with full honesty.

531
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:05,505
But first thing is to recognize with full humility

532
00:44:05,706 --> 00:44:08,247
and understanding.

533
00:44:08,448 --> 00:44:14,356
Once you have recognized, gradually you will do everything

534
00:44:14,557 --> 00:44:20,221
that has to be done, you'll know - what is to be done.

535
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:29,516
Now the essence of Sahastrara is integration.

536
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,448
In Sahastrara all the Chakras are there,

537
00:44:34,649 --> 00:44:38,698
so all the Deities get integrated.

538
00:44:38,899 --> 00:44:45,206
And you can feel their integration. That means, when you get your

539
00:44:45,407 --> 00:44:50,245
Kundalini in Sahastrara, your mental, emotional,

540
00:44:50,446 --> 00:44:56,690
and your spiritual, everything being becomes one.

541
00:44:56,891 --> 00:45:00,549
Your physical being also merges into it.

542
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:04,127
Then you have no problem, as to,

543
00:45:04,328 --> 00:45:08,894
"Yes, I love Mother. But ah I'm sorry, ah -

544
00:45:09,095 --> 00:45:14,532
I have to steal this money."

545
00:45:15,947 --> 00:45:20,387
"Yes, I know, I recognize Mother, yes, I know She is great,

546
00:45:20,588 --> 00:45:26,627
but I can't help it I have to tell Her lies".

547
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:32,411
Or, "I have to do this wrong thing, because after all,

548
00:45:32,612 --> 00:45:38,567
ah - I can't help it." There is no compromise with Me.

549
00:45:38,768 --> 00:45:41,184
It has to be completely integrated.

550
00:45:41,385 --> 00:45:46,606
Your Dharma should be corrected. You can not do anything wrong

551
00:45:46,807 --> 00:45:49,684
and then say, "I'm a Sahaja Yogi." You cannot.

552
00:45:49,885 --> 00:45:54,176
But for this, the strength comes from within.

553
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,377
Your Spirit strengthens you.

554
00:45:56,578 --> 00:46:01,791
You must just put in your will-power that "Yes, let my Spirit act."

555
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:06,229
And then you start acting according to the Spirit.

556
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:10,174
Once you start acting according to the Spirit,

557
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:13,752
you find you have no slavery of anything.

558
00:46:13,953 --> 00:46:18,346
You become Samarth, means equal to your meanings.

559
00:46:18,547 --> 00:46:22,479
Samartha, also Samarth means powerful personality.

560
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,620
So, you develop that powerful personality

561
00:46:25,821 --> 00:46:30,425
which has no temptations, which has no wrong ideas,

562
00:46:30,626 --> 00:46:35,751
which has no catches, no problems.

563
00:46:37,946 --> 00:46:42,604
But people who are sneaky, sly

564
00:46:42,805 --> 00:46:48,377
try to try, play some tricks are really harming themselves,

565
00:46:48,578 --> 00:46:52,400
not Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga is going to be,

566
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:57,126
he has been and will be, is going to be established.

567
00:46:57,327 --> 00:47:02,774
Even if they are ten people in the boat, God is not bothered.

568
00:47:02,975 --> 00:47:06,157
It's only My botheration as a Mother.

569
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:10,477
As a Mother, I want many people to come up in the boat.

570
00:47:10,678 --> 00:47:15,485
But don't try to jump back by doing all dishonest things.

571
00:47:15,686 --> 00:47:20,173
So, this is what it is - simple, that you are integrated.

572
00:47:20,374 --> 00:47:26,423
By integration, you get the power to do what you understand,

573
00:47:26,624 --> 00:47:32,329
and you have power to feel happy with what you understand.

574
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:37,540
So, you come to a stage where you develop this Neerananda.

575
00:47:37,741 --> 00:47:40,087
And this Neeranand you develop

576
00:47:40,288 --> 00:47:45,595
when you are absolutely the Spirit.

577
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:52,228
In Neerananda state there is no duality left -

578
00:47:52,429 --> 00:47:56,517
is Adwaita, is one personality.

579
00:47:56,718 --> 00:47:59,697
That is, you are complete integrated

580
00:47:59,898 --> 00:48:09,165
and the joy is not anymore dented - is complete.

581
00:48:09,485 --> 00:48:14,378
It hasn't got a happiness and a sorrow aspect,

582
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:19,714
but is just Joy. The Joy is not that you laugh loud,

583
00:48:19,915 --> 00:48:27,019
the Joy is not that ah you you're always smiling. No,

584
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:32,277
Is the stillness, the quietitude within your Self,

585
00:48:32,478 --> 00:48:36,910
the peace of your being, of your Spirit

586
00:48:37,111 --> 00:48:43,121
that asserts itself into vibrations which you feel,

587
00:48:43,322 --> 00:48:49,106
that when you feel that peace, you feel like light of the sun,

588
00:48:49,307 --> 00:48:52,598
the whole rays of that beauty spreading.

589
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:55,614
But first of all we are curbed down

590
00:48:55,815 --> 00:49:01,192
by our own personal, selfish, stupid ideas.

591
00:49:01,393 --> 00:49:05,184
Throw them away! We have them because we are insecured,

592
00:49:05,385 --> 00:49:08,489
because we have wrong ideas, throw them away.

593
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:13,278
Just stand alone, one with God.

594
00:49:13,479 --> 00:49:18,247
And you'll find all these fears were useless.

595
00:49:18,448 --> 00:49:21,794
Our cleansing is very important,

596
00:49:21,995 --> 00:49:27,247
and that cleansing comes only when you really practice

597
00:49:27,448 --> 00:49:32,151
the cleansing as told in Sahaja Yoga.

598
00:49:33,995 --> 00:49:39,067
The Sahastrara is the blessing of the heavens, I should say.

599
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:42,262
It has worked out so well.

600
00:49:42,463 --> 00:49:45,176
It's very difficult to break the Sahastrara.

601
00:49:45,377 --> 00:49:48,778
And when I really broke it,

602
00:49:48,979 --> 00:49:53,419
I didn't know that it would be that successful.

603
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,419
First, I thought is still premature

604
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:02,372
because there are many Rakshasas still on the street,

605
00:50:02,573 --> 00:50:06,005
selling their goods; and there are many fanatics

606
00:50:06,206 --> 00:50:09,396
who are calling themselves by the so-called religions

607
00:50:09,597 --> 00:50:14,544
they are following, not the real religion of the Atma.

608
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:19,364
But, gradually it has taken its roots.

609
00:50:19,565 --> 00:50:23,822
Now, let this truth take its root within yourself

610
00:50:24,023 --> 00:50:25,788
through your Sahasrara.

611
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:31,973
And once this truth becomes absolutely the light that guides you,

612
00:50:32,174 --> 00:50:36,153
the light that nourishes you, the light that enlightens you

613
00:50:36,354 --> 00:50:41,255
and gives you a personality that has the light,

614
00:50:41,456 --> 00:50:44,177
then only you should know that your Sahastrara

615
00:50:44,378 --> 00:50:47,599
is completely enlightened by your Spirit.

616
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,486
Your face should be such that people should know

617
00:50:51,687 --> 00:50:56,955
that there's a personality who's standing before you who is light.

618
00:50:57,156 --> 00:51:01,822
This is how Sahastrara is to be looked after.

619
00:51:02,023 --> 00:51:06,994
For looking after Sahastrara is is important that

620
00:51:07,195 --> 00:51:13,252
you should try to cover your head during winter time.

621
00:51:13,453 --> 00:51:16,518
Is better to cover your head during wintertime

622
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:21,041
so that there is no freezing in the brain

623
00:51:21,242 --> 00:51:27,229
because brain is also made of Medha, means fats,

624
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:30,752
so it should not be frozen. Moreover,

625
00:51:30,953 --> 00:51:34,611
you should not take too much heat on your brain.

626
00:51:34,812 --> 00:51:37,986
To keep your brain all right, you should not sit in the sun

627
00:51:38,187 --> 00:51:41,478
all the time as some of the Westerners do.

628
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:47,874
Then your brain melts and you become a crazy person.

629
00:51:48,663 --> 00:51:54,759
Is a sign that a person is going out for madness -

630
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,789
is something which I've told many a times

631
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:01,805
that don't take too much heat on your head.

632
00:52:02,006 --> 00:52:06,000
Even if you are sitting in the sun, keep your head covered.

633
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:09,716
Covering of the head is very important. But

634
00:52:09,917 --> 00:52:14,344
the covering of the head should be done occasionally,

635
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:19,266
not all the time because if you just put

636
00:52:19,467 --> 00:52:23,560
a very heavy band around your head, then the circulation

637
00:52:23,761 --> 00:52:28,583
becomes poor and you may have trouble with bad circulation.

638
00:52:28,784 --> 00:52:36,927
So, it is an occasional opening of the head

639
00:52:37,128 --> 00:52:43,122
to the sun and to the moon, occasionally.

640
00:52:43,323 --> 00:52:49,260
Otherwise, you will sit in the moon and land up in the lunatic asylum.

641
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:56,090
Anything I tell you, you must know that in Sahaja Yoga,

642
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:59,996
we have not to go to anything [Ati/Adhi ?].

643
00:53:00,197 --> 00:53:03,863
Even sitting in the water, some people will sit for 3 hours.

644
00:53:04,064 --> 00:53:07,822
I never said so. Only for ten minutes you have to sit,

645
00:53:08,023 --> 00:53:10,023
but with full heart.

646
00:53:10,224 --> 00:53:14,156
If I tell them anything, they'll go on doing it for 4 hours,

647
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:17,125
there's no need do it for ten hours.

648
00:53:17,326 --> 00:53:21,586
Give your body different-different types of treatments,

649
00:53:21,787 --> 00:53:25,028
not all the time the same treat. The body gets bored

650
00:53:25,229 --> 00:53:31,075
or gets absolutely ah - overburdened.

651
00:53:31,276 --> 00:53:34,075
Now, if you tell somebody, "this is your mantra".

652
00:53:34,276 --> 00:53:37,468
All right, it is to be used till you get rid of your Chakras,

653
00:53:37,669 --> 00:53:39,669
finished.

654
00:53:39,878 --> 00:53:42,935
Lo, something, some screw is to be put here; all right;

655
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,771
now what you do - you put the screw till it fixes,

656
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,972
you do not go on even when it is fixed.

657
00:53:48,173 --> 00:53:52,816
Are you going to screw it more and more

658
00:53:53,017 --> 00:53:56,957
so that ah - the whole thing gets spoiled?

659
00:53:57,158 --> 00:54:01,402
Is better that use wisdom. And for this wisdom,

660
00:54:01,603 --> 00:54:08,988
we must know that it is Shri Ganesha or Jesus Christ

661
00:54:09,189 --> 00:54:12,355
who are placed on both the sides. Here is Mahaganesha,

662
00:54:12,556 --> 00:54:14,259
here is Jesus Christ.

663
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:20,498
Both of Them help you to correct your vision,

664
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:23,021
understanding and give you wisdom.

665
00:54:23,222 --> 00:54:27,334
So, the wisdom lies not in sticking on to something.

666
00:54:27,535 --> 00:54:29,803
Sahaja Yogis are not stuck-up people.

667
00:54:30,004 --> 00:54:33,920
If they are stuck up, they are not progressing.

668
00:54:34,121 --> 00:54:36,670
You are not to get stuck up with ideas

669
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:38,511
and stuck up with things.

670
00:54:38,712 --> 00:54:42,667
You have to be all the time moving and in the movement,

671
00:54:42,868 --> 00:54:46,473
it doesn't mean that you should fall from somewhere

672
00:54:46,674 --> 00:54:49,379
and people think, "Oh, we are earning such a lot,

673
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:52,327
because we are falling down." You have to ascend

674
00:54:52,528 --> 00:54:55,233
in your movement, not to fall.

675
00:54:55,434 --> 00:54:58,530
So, when you are achieving something in Sahaja Yoga,

676
00:54:58,731 --> 00:55:02,233
first of all you should see your health should be all right.

677
00:55:02,434 --> 00:55:05,530
Your mind should be normal. You should be a normal person.

678
00:55:05,731 --> 00:55:08,077
If you are still barking at people,

679
00:55:08,278 --> 00:55:10,278
then know that there's something wrong with you.

680
00:55:10,479 --> 00:55:15,036
Or if you are still sulking and still tantrumish

681
00:55:15,237 --> 00:55:19,356
and if you are still in a bad mood,

682
00:55:19,557 --> 00:55:23,637
then think you are not yet a Sahaja Yogi. You can judge yourself,

683
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:27,903
if you are free like a bird then it's all right.

684
00:55:28,104 --> 00:55:30,191
But that doesn't mean on the road you start singing

685
00:55:30,392 --> 00:55:32,847
like a bird and jumping on a tree.

686
00:55:33,048 --> 00:55:36,472
You see, any analogy I give to a stupid man,

687
00:55:36,673 --> 00:55:41,144
he can behave in a very stupid way. But to a wise man,

688
00:55:41,345 --> 00:55:45,066
he discreetly uses it for a proper purpose.

689
00:55:45,267 --> 00:55:48,691
So, one has to understand, Sahaja Yoga is

690
00:55:48,892 --> 00:55:53,782
known by the discretion person has.

691
00:55:54,978 --> 00:56:00,941
Now, what happens actually that you get stuck with one thing,

692
00:56:01,142 --> 00:56:05,489
that is your Atma and the whole your being

693
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:12,223
floats like a [SOUNDS LIKE Patangas ?] does, or ah a kite that floats,

694
00:56:12,424 --> 00:56:14,591
goes all over the places, everything,

695
00:56:14,792 --> 00:56:18,864
but you are stuck to only one thing, that is your Spirit.

696
00:56:19,065 --> 00:56:25,739
And, if you could really do it, genuinely and honestly,

697
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:30,419
not worry too much about your money and your families

698
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:35,903
and other mundane things, just don't worry about anything,

699
00:56:36,104 --> 00:56:38,512
you don't have to worry, just give it a bandhan.

700
00:56:38,713 --> 00:56:40,713
If it doesn't work out, doesn't work out, finished.

701
00:56:40,914 --> 00:56:45,515
What's that wrong? If it works out, well and good.

702
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:50,018
Not that your desire is important, but, "Thy will be done".

703
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:52,440
First you say, "Thy will be done"

704
00:56:52,641 --> 00:56:55,643
that it is so surprising that your wills change,

705
00:56:55,844 --> 00:57:00,041
your desires change and whatever you say, is done.

706
00:57:00,242 --> 00:57:04,080
But when this also comes up, people develop an ego;

707
00:57:04,281 --> 00:57:10,111
so be careful. It's all done by the Shakti and not by you,

708
00:57:10,312 --> 00:57:15,438
by your Atma and not by you. You have to be the Atma

709
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:18,711
and once you become the Atma, you become into Akarma

710
00:57:18,912 --> 00:57:22,274
where you don't know that you are doing it, it just works out.

711
00:57:22,475 --> 00:57:26,508
You don't feel, you are not aware.

712
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:30,555
I wish, after all these lectures,

713
00:57:30,756 --> 00:57:34,844
most of your Chakras must have been opened.

714
00:57:35,045 --> 00:57:42,328
But this is all My work. You have to also do some homework.

715
00:57:42,529 --> 00:57:47,344
And, you have to also work and see for yourself. Be alert.

716
00:57:47,545 --> 00:57:51,328
Try to face yourself in the mirror and see for yourself

717
00:57:51,529 --> 00:57:54,781
how far honest you have become.

718
00:57:54,982 --> 00:57:57,273
How far clean have you been.

719
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,367
How far friendly you are in collectivity -

720
00:58:00,568 --> 00:58:03,390
which is a very important point in Sahaja Yoga.

721
00:58:03,591 --> 00:58:09,523
If you are not collective, if you are funny, if you are strange,

722
00:58:09,724 --> 00:58:15,442
if you cannot communicate with others, then something wrong.

723
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:24,658
And then you should face yourself as you are and try to correct it.

724
00:58:24,859 --> 00:58:26,859
Because you separate yourself from yourself

725
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:30,578
like I separate My sari from Myself and try to clean it.

726
00:58:30,779 --> 00:58:34,406
In the same way, you separate yourself from yourself

727
00:58:34,607 --> 00:58:39,929
and try to clean it. This is the way Sahaja Yogis are going to ascend.

728
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:42,130
When the Sahaja Yogis will ascend,

729
00:58:42,331 --> 00:58:44,708
the rest of the things also will ascend.

730
00:58:44,909 --> 00:58:50,935
Many Sahaja Yogis of this kind will impress so many people

731
00:58:51,136 --> 00:58:55,380
that they will also ascend. So, the whole thing can ascend very fast.

732
00:58:55,581 --> 00:58:59,005
But you people who are rising higher should try to rise

733
00:58:59,206 --> 00:59:02,091
higher and higher without being aware of it -

734
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:06,127
that's very important.

735
00:59:07,206 --> 00:59:11,896
Those who are also who think that others are higher than them

736
00:59:12,097 --> 00:59:14,873
are also sadly mistaken, because that's not so.

737
00:59:15,074 --> 00:59:17,303
It's the whole that's rising.

738
00:59:17,504 --> 00:59:21,951
Nobody should feel that way inferior or in anyway low

739
00:59:22,152 --> 00:59:25,639
or feel insulted that somebody thinks we low.

740
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:29,366
Let somebody think, what does it matter, Divine doesn't think so.

741
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:33,452
So, all these little- little things you should be careful about,

742
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:38,022
and otherwise it's very easy in this Krita Yuga

743
00:59:38,223 --> 00:59:44,545
achieve the ultimate goal of Atma Sakshatkar.

744
00:59:44,746 --> 00:59:48,967
I think today I have told you quite a lot about Sahastrara

745
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:53,147
but if you have any problem about Sahastrara you may ask Me now

746
00:59:53,348 --> 00:59:56,085
but only about Sahastrara and nothing else, is better

747
00:59:56,286 --> 01:00:01,176
to ask Me questions about Sahastrara instead of all other things.

748
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:08,537
You can ask Me questions.

749
01:00:42,463 --> 01:00:47,557
[Hindi]

750
01:00:47,994 --> 01:00:50,746
[Pergunta em Hindi]

751
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:53,792
This is the trouble with you. You read some nonsensical books -

752
01:00:53,993 --> 01:00:57,894
Samadhi, Bindu, this, that, all that. Now please forget it,

753
01:00:58,095 --> 01:01:01,692
please forget all these things. Sama-dhi, Samadhi means,

754
01:01:01,893 --> 01:01:05,911
first is the Nirvichara Samadhi. First is Nirvichara Samadhi

755
01:01:06,112 --> 01:01:09,559
that you achieve and the Kundalini just comes out of your head.

756
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,590
Sama-dhi means, the dhi means the buddhi.

757
01:01:12,791 --> 01:01:16,246
And when it has got enlightenment it means Samadhi.

758
01:01:16,447 --> 01:01:19,116
So first of all, the buddhi gets enlightened - I just now

759
01:01:19,317 --> 01:01:22,429
I told you about that only, the first enlightenment.

760
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:25,671
Now, the Bindu and this and that are higher stages.

761
01:01:25,872 --> 01:01:28,905
Ardha Bindu,

762
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:34,757
then Bindu and then Valaya. But you should not be futuristic,

763
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:37,527
 just now if you have read some book no use

764
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:39,894
trying to show off that. That's not a good thing.

765
01:01:40,095 --> 01:01:44,011
Just try to see what you are. Why do you want to talk about

766
01:01:44,212 --> 01:01:46,706
things which - which do not concern at this stage?

767
01:01:46,907 --> 01:01:50,698
Just now, supposing you are going by bullock cart,

768
01:01:50,899 --> 01:01:52,899
why do you want to ask about the aeroplane?

769
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:56,430
Just now you go by bullock cart, then you get into the train,

770
01:01:56,631 --> 01:02:00,289
then you get into the airplane. All right? One by one,

771
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:02,773
not like this. Because you have read the book,

772
01:02:02,974 --> 01:02:05,968
 it's not doesn't mean that you are supposed to know everything.

773
01:02:06,169 --> 01:02:09,554
All these books are written by some sort of crankish fellows

774
01:02:09,755 --> 01:02:12,577
who have read something here and there and have put it down.

775
01:02:12,778 --> 01:02:15,811
But you must experience. I'm your Mother,

776
01:02:16,012 --> 01:02:18,546
so I don't want to give you big ideas, this and that.

777
01:02:18,747 --> 01:02:23,444
I want you to do the way we have to move. As a mother would say,

778
01:02:23,645 --> 01:02:27,124
"Now, this is the way you are. Now you are in the first class,

779
01:02:27,325 --> 01:02:31,194
so pass your first exam. Then you'll go into the second class,

780
01:02:31,395 --> 01:02:32,699
then pass your exam".

781
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:36,551
Everybody has to go that way to mature properly;

782
01:02:36,752 --> 01:02:39,324
there should be no immaturity in a personality.

783
01:02:39,525 --> 01:02:42,769
So all these books that you have read you better throw them away,

784
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:45,706
there's no good. But if it is by some realized souls

785
01:02:45,907 --> 01:02:49,433
you can keep them and think that they are higher people

786
01:02:49,634 --> 01:02:52,925
and we have to be at their stage.

787
01:02:53,126 --> 01:02:57,534
Only by reading the book you don't become those personalities, do you?

788
01:02:57,735 --> 01:03:01,844
[Hindi]

789
01:03:02,054 --> 01:03:04,798
All such questions are there, one better than the other.

790
01:03:04,999 --> 01:03:08,368
I'll tell you it is such a empty thing,

791
01:03:08,569 --> 01:03:11,587
how can you be satisfied with empty things?

792
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:15,920
You haven't got anything.

793
01:03:17,343 --> 01:03:22,220
First of all achieve a state, first of all settle down,

794
01:03:22,421 --> 01:03:25,087
gradually you will know about it. By reading books

795
01:03:25,288 --> 01:03:29,952
you do not become anyway realized soul, do you?

796
01:03:33,468 --> 01:03:36,494
According to Mr. Poolkani all questions are of this type,

797
01:03:36,695 --> 01:03:39,382
they are of no use. That only means that you have read some books,

798
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:42,751
that's all, finished, nothing more that. And it's true.

799
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:44,952
If you have just read some books you are just coming

800
01:03:45,153 --> 01:03:49,421
and quoting it, no use. Gradually come up. If you are honest

801
01:03:49,622 --> 01:03:52,336
and if you want to have it, then come up gradually.

802
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:58,107
Just don't try to show off anything.

803
01:04:03,278 --> 01:04:06,965
You better give him writing.

804
01:04:17,703 --> 01:04:21,127
There are request that, You please give a part of Your lecture

805
01:04:21,328 --> 01:04:24,383
in Hindi, because some people can not understand English.

806
01:04:24,584 --> 01:04:27,953
All right, you see now I've given My lecture in English.

807
01:04:28,154 --> 01:04:32,086
But I give My lectures in Hindi also in different places.

808
01:04:32,287 --> 01:04:36,586
Here I'm giving in English. So those who want to hear Me

809
01:04:36,787 --> 01:04:39,438
in Hindustani can come to other programs.

810
01:04:39,639 --> 01:04:43,912
[Hindi]

811
01:04:55,329 --> 01:04:59,508
[Hindi]

812
01:05:06,999 --> 01:05:11,280
[Hindi]

813
01:05:17,718 --> 01:05:22,202
[Hindi]

814
01:05:26,787 --> 01:05:31,406
[Hindi]

815
01:05:42,301 --> 01:05:45,721
[Hindi]

816
01:05:45,993 --> 01:05:49,878
He calls it pustaki, pustaki questions, pustaki.

817
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,448
You see it is nothing Divine, it's all pustaki. This is true.

818
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:56,360
That's why I used to wonder why Kabirdas once has said,

819
01:05:56,561 --> 01:05:59,391
"Pari pari pandita moora khabaye."

820
01:05:59,592 --> 01:06:02,477
Now I know why he said it, because by reading

821
01:06:02,678 --> 01:06:06,531
people really become funny and they just try to test Me,

822
01:06:06,732 --> 01:06:09,844
My knowledge, or trying to show off their own knowledge.

823
01:06:10,045 --> 01:06:11,411
Ka pustaki.

824
01:06:11,612 --> 01:06:14,634
What is relation between Kundalini, prana and astral bodies

825
01:06:14,835 --> 01:06:19,087
and soul, are they same in different forms?

826
01:06:19,288 --> 01:06:21,493
Astral body, prana...

827
01:06:21,694 --> 01:06:23,798
Kundalini and a soul.

828
01:06:23,999 --> 01:06:27,112
Soul. Now this gentleman who has asked the question

829
01:06:27,313 --> 01:06:29,807
perhaps has come only today.

830
01:06:30,008 --> 01:06:32,565
Otherwise I've explained most of these things.

831
01:06:32,766 --> 01:06:38,430
But for your benefit I'll tell you.

832
01:06:38,766 --> 01:06:43,120
First is Kundalini. Kundalini is the pure desire

833
01:06:43,321 --> 01:06:50,887
to be one with God and this energy is placed in the sacrum bone,

834
01:06:51,088 --> 01:06:55,550
which is awakened when some authorized person

835
01:06:55,751 --> 01:07:00,542
from God can raise it.

836
01:07:00,743 --> 01:07:04,722
This is Kundalini, is pure desire.

837
01:07:04,923 --> 01:07:08,191
Now prana is the Shakti,

838
01:07:08,392 --> 01:07:12,168
expression of the Shakti of the right side, that is

839
01:07:12,369 --> 01:07:16,098
Mahasaraswati's Shakti, is created out of five elements,

840
01:07:16,299 --> 01:07:21,215
called prana. Astral - what - Astral body.

841
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:26,746
Astral bodies are in simple Hindi language are bhoots

842
01:07:26,947 --> 01:07:32,324
and they are the people who just come into your being

843
01:07:32,525 --> 01:07:39,329
and take your soul out. Never try these tricks, never.

844
01:07:39,861 --> 01:07:43,277
These tricks are tried in America very much

845
01:07:43,478 --> 01:07:46,519
and I've told them not to try such tricks

846
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,792
and horrible things are happening

847
01:07:49,993 --> 01:07:55,284
because a person living in Geneva had a child

848
01:07:55,485 --> 01:07:58,344
and in are you know English people don't keep their children

849
01:07:58,545 --> 01:08:03,086
sleeping with them. So the child used to sleep in another room

850
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:09,242
and the lady, her grandmother who was fond of this child

851
01:08:09,443 --> 01:08:15,320
wanted to talk to the child through this astral body business.

852
01:08:15,521 --> 01:08:19,234
At every night she used to talk to the child.

853
01:08:19,435 --> 01:08:24,562
Ultimately so happened that the soul of the child

854
01:08:24,763 --> 01:08:28,070
which used to call out could not return back to the body

855
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:32,492
and got lost and the child died.

856
01:08:32,693 --> 01:08:35,726
It has so many problems, astral body things have,

857
01:08:35,927 --> 01:08:39,882
that it is nothing but a dead soul

858
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:43,601
from the left or the right can come into you

859
01:08:43,817 --> 01:08:46,786
and can carry your soul outside your body

860
01:08:46,987 --> 01:08:49,286
and you can be lost, you can be dead.

861
01:08:49,487 --> 01:08:52,911
So this is something going just the other way round

862
01:08:53,112 --> 01:08:56,942
than the Kundalini awakening. By Kundalini awakening

863
01:08:57,143 --> 01:09:03,122
your prana Shakti and your Manas Shakti are integrated

864
01:09:03,323 --> 01:09:08,083
and you become one with the Divine

865
01:09:08,284 --> 01:09:13,408
so your Superconsciousness is awakened.

866
01:09:15,555 --> 01:09:19,265
[Hindi]

867
01:09:21,539 --> 01:09:23,876
I can feel the Kundalini reaching my head,

868
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:27,384
but I can't feel it come out and I can't feel the cool vibrations.

869
01:09:27,585 --> 01:09:31,181
That is good. Somebody is feeling the Kundalini on their head,

870
01:09:31,382 --> 01:09:34,587
that is what Kabirdas has clearly said,

871
01:09:34,788 --> 01:09:39,360
[SOUNDS LIKE "Shunnya shi khara bhara Anahata bajine."]

872
01:09:39,561 --> 01:09:46,001
So the [ANADAHATA ?] is ah is hitting the fontanel bone,

873
01:09:46,202 --> 01:09:48,837
but it is not coming out, that's it.

874
01:09:49,038 --> 01:09:52,149
Then means it has not broken the Brahmarandra, as simple as that.

875
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:54,350
Till it has not broken the Brahmarandra

876
01:09:54,551 --> 01:09:57,724
you can not feel the cool breeze, it's absolutely spontaneous,

877
01:09:57,925 --> 01:10:00,227
it has to work out that way. So is correct,

878
01:10:00,428 --> 01:10:03,180
your Brahmarandra is not broken, that is your state.

879
01:10:03,381 --> 01:10:06,427
So it has to break and the reason for that is something wrong

880
01:10:06,628 --> 01:10:10,940
with your heart. If your heart is clean it will break,

881
01:10:11,141 --> 01:10:14,406
if your heart is strong it will break,

882
01:10:14,607 --> 01:10:17,062
but if you have a weak heart also it will not break,

883
01:10:17,263 --> 01:10:19,678
if you're suffering from heart trouble it will not break.

884
01:10:19,879 --> 01:10:22,069
It has something to do with your heart.

885
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:25,788
If you are a seeker of other things than Spirit

886
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:28,626
also it may not break. So there are many reasons

887
01:10:28,827 --> 01:10:32,845
various reasons why this Brahmarandra won't break.

888
01:10:33,046 --> 01:10:36,064
But what is a reason that we have to find out -

889
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:41,702
yourself, you can face yourself and find out what's the matter.

890
01:10:58,617 --> 01:11:00,617
Brahmarandra. We'll work it out;

891
01:11:00,818 --> 01:11:02,818
we'll work it out for you, all right?

892
01:11:03,019 --> 01:11:05,019
Sit down, doesn't matter. We'll work it out, don't you worry,

893
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:09,277
it will work out. It takes sometimes little time, doesn't matter.

894
01:11:09,478 --> 01:11:14,215
Why should you have fear about it, just it will work out.

895
01:11:14,416 --> 01:11:18,692
Yes, we'll work it out. All right? It will work out.

896
01:11:18,893 --> 01:11:22,033
Who else, what else is there?

897
01:11:22,315 --> 01:11:24,315
One man says he had met Muktananda,

898
01:11:24,516 --> 01:11:30,086
now he finally want to be close to Sahaja Yoga meditation center (...)

899
01:11:38,918 --> 01:11:43,124
This Muktananda (...),

900
01:11:43,325 --> 01:11:47,098
Terrible fellow.

901
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,880
There is a mantra for him.

902
01:11:50,081 --> 01:11:54,083
Who are the people of Muktananda just raise your hands please.

903
01:11:54,284 --> 01:11:56,692
Those who have written this letter about Muktananda -

904
01:11:56,893 --> 01:12:00,783
raise your hands please.

905
01:12:03,323 --> 01:12:06,880
So now, we'll tell you the mantra how to get rid of the problem,

906
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:09,857
all right? There's a mantra for that

907
01:12:10,058 --> 01:12:13,568
who he was in the past life and all that, I know and we know

908
01:12:13,769 --> 01:12:16,146
how to get rid of it. But you have to religiously do it,

909
01:12:16,347 --> 01:12:18,628
religiously do it and you'll get rid of.

910
01:12:18,829 --> 01:12:21,628
I know it has it has done lot of harm to many people.

911
01:12:21,829 --> 01:12:26,253
But if those who are not anymore into the clutches,

912
01:12:26,454 --> 01:12:30,401
we can work it out, alright? So all those who are wanting

913
01:12:30,602 --> 01:12:33,753
to know about it you will know in our centers

914
01:12:33,954 --> 01:12:39,026
or if you can come on the sides I'll ask somebody to help you,

915
01:12:39,227 --> 01:12:43,891
 all of those of that kind. Now, what else is there?

916
01:12:51,063 --> 01:12:54,625
[Hindi]

917
01:12:58,821 --> 01:13:03,076
[Hindi]

918
01:13:07,370 --> 01:13:11,604
[Hindi]

919
01:13:16,689 --> 01:13:19,831
Those who have not got Realization should come on this side

920
01:13:20,032 --> 01:13:22,542
and that side and all of them should be worked out.

921
01:13:22,743 --> 01:13:25,487
We have lots of Sahaja Yogis from all over the world

922
01:13:25,688 --> 01:13:30,969
and everybody must get Realization, no doubt about it.

923
01:13:38,116 --> 01:13:40,509
Physically I am fit, no heart problems.

924
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:43,228
My problem is that I think too much about myself.

925
01:13:43,429 --> 01:13:46,837
Result is that I have become a psychic case.

926
01:13:47,038 --> 01:13:50,821
All right, those who are a psychic case also should come this side,

927
01:13:51,022 --> 01:13:55,264
I will tell them how it arises, from where, all right?

928
01:14:00,753 --> 01:14:04,392
Kindly advise, may I practice meditation in office

929
01:14:04,593 --> 01:14:07,991
keeping Your photo before me?

930
01:14:19,133 --> 01:14:22,073
No, not in the office, you can not do meditation

931
01:14:22,274 --> 01:14:25,401
in the office at all. You see, you have to be very careful.

932
01:14:25,602 --> 01:14:28,317
Actually, you see, office people are so gross

933
01:14:28,518 --> 01:14:30,559
and they will never understand Sahaja Yoga.

934
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,473
So best thing is first to talk to them about Sahaja Yoga,

935
01:14:33,674 --> 01:14:36,387
not about Me, don't even show them My photograph,

936
01:14:36,588 --> 01:14:39,942
because it's very funny that some people who see My photograph

937
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:42,987
are frightened, they can't see Me. If they are possessed

938
01:14:43,188 --> 01:14:47,024
they even shake before Me. So it's better not to tell them about Me,

939
01:14:47,225 --> 01:14:49,493
but about Sahaja Yoga, how you are health.

940
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:53,337
Gradually with great care, like a nice mother

941
01:14:53,538 --> 01:14:56,508
you must bring them to the position

942
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:59,078
where they can receive Realization.

943
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:02,609
And then gradually open the thing, but not in the office, please,

944
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:06,007
no, not in the office. You have to do it at home

945
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:10,398
and you have to do it in the group where you meet

946
01:15:10,599 --> 01:15:14,211
in the centers. That you must do every week,

947
01:15:14,412 --> 01:15:18,102
that is very important.

948
01:15:18,303 --> 01:15:24,102
And once a month in the ashram, once a month in the ashram.

949
01:15:24,303 --> 01:15:29,188
Man says should one do yogic asanas and pranayams?

950
01:15:29,389 --> 01:15:32,946
Should one do transcendental meditation, second question?

951
01:15:33,147 --> 01:15:36,149
- Cha transcendental kakya?
- Transcendental meditation.

952
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:38,162
- Should we do?
- TM.

953
01:15:38,363 --> 01:15:41,678
He's done?

954
01:15:41,879 --> 01:15:45,795
He's done all that?

955
01:15:45,996 --> 01:15:51,764
Now, about pranayama and about, I've already talked about it,

956
01:15:51,965 --> 01:15:53,152
but you might come now.

957
01:15:53,353 --> 01:15:56,121
Pranayam and all these physical exercises of Hatha Yoga

958
01:15:56,322 --> 01:15:59,684
now I'm already told that in Sahaja Yoga

959
01:15:59,885 --> 01:16:03,075
we too do some exercises, quite a lot

960
01:16:03,276 --> 01:16:05,276
of our physical fitness sometimes,

961
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:07,885
sometimes for adjusting our Chakras and all that

962
01:16:08,086 --> 01:16:12,213
and for improving the bad moon you do exercises.

963
01:16:12,414 --> 01:16:15,580
But we have to know what Chakra is catching,

964
01:16:15,781 --> 01:16:20,807
 there's a science. It's not done that your throat is bad

965
01:16:21,008 --> 01:16:24,104
and you are doing all the asanas for the stomach.

966
01:16:24,305 --> 01:16:27,966
All the asanas are not done. Like taking all the medicines

967
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:31,443
at the same time. One is for cold, one is for heat,

968
01:16:31,644 --> 01:16:34,654
it's like that, all the medicines we don't take.

969
01:16:34,855 --> 01:16:38,849
So according to need of the person we do pranayama also

970
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:41,826
we do according to the need of the person,

971
01:16:42,027 --> 01:16:45,080
gradually we understand what is wrong with us

972
01:16:45,281 --> 01:16:50,307
and that's how we do the asana. Not blindfolded. First thing.

973
01:16:50,508 --> 01:16:56,057
Then about transcendental meditation less said the better.

974
01:16:56,258 --> 01:16:59,690
You have to see for yourself what others have achieved, you see.

975
01:16:59,891 --> 01:17:02,648
When you go to guru you must first find out

976
01:17:02,849 --> 01:17:06,226
how much money he takes. If he takes the money, just don't go,

977
01:17:06,427 --> 01:17:13,200
first thing. Secondly, how does he live, what is his style of life.

978
01:17:13,849 --> 01:17:19,593
Thirdly what others have achieved, what is their condition.

979
01:17:19,794 --> 01:17:23,687
Most of the disciples of transcendental meditations

980
01:17:23,888 --> 01:17:27,015
are now beggars on the street.

981
01:17:27,216 --> 01:17:29,687
And some of them are epileptic patients,

982
01:17:29,888 --> 01:17:34,794
I have seen so many getting epilepsy.

983
01:17:35,764 --> 01:17:39,899
So if you have done transcendental meditation it is not meditation

984
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:42,454
but it is anti-God thing.

985
01:17:42,655 --> 01:17:44,884
So you have to first neutralize yourself,

986
01:17:45,085 --> 01:17:47,085
come down to normal conditions

987
01:17:47,286 --> 01:17:49,585
and then you receive your Realization.

988
01:17:49,786 --> 01:17:52,757
We have a lady here who was a granddaughter of a Duke.

989
01:17:52,958 --> 01:17:55,976
She lost all her money and her husband was the director

990
01:17:56,177 --> 01:17:59,656
of one of these "flying squads" that he was having.

991
01:17:59,857 --> 01:18:01,857
He lost all his money and became bankrupt,

992
01:18:02,058 --> 01:18:06,248
this lady got epilepsy, he got epilepsy, her child got epilepsy,

993
01:18:06,449 --> 01:18:09,350
all of them got epilepsy. They came to Sahaja Yoga

994
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:13,389
when they had nothing with them. Today they are all right,

995
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:17,420
all corrected and they are doing well.

996
01:18:17,621 --> 01:18:21,147
But we do not take a guarantee on anything

997
01:18:21,348 --> 01:18:24,544
because you have to also decide in your mind

998
01:18:24,745 --> 01:18:26,745
that you are not going to have this funny ideas

999
01:18:26,946 --> 01:18:29,878
because some of the TM people who come are so arrogant

1000
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:33,503
so egoistical, that it is impossible to manage them.

1001
01:18:33,704 --> 01:18:36,526
So it is your need, not our need

1002
01:18:36,727 --> 01:18:40,159
and that's how you should come to a doctor as a patient comes.

1003
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:46,227
Then only it will work out. Otherwise don't waste our time, please.

1004
01:18:50,834 --> 01:18:54,826
That? Now all the questions are over

1005
01:18:55,027 --> 01:19:01,159
and for the last time let us go into meditation here in this hall.

1006
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:10,929
[Hindi]
