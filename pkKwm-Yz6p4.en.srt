1
00:00:01,931 --> 00:00:03,900
Warren: They are just asking questions, Mother.

2
00:00:04,101 --> 00:00:06,064
Shri Mataji: What kind? Warren: Just practical.

3
00:00:06,265 --> 00:00:08,140
Shri Mataji: Practical? That’s good,

4
00:00:08,738 --> 00:00:11,207
practical questions are very good.

5
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:29,695
Warren: Would you like to talk to them for a while?

6
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:31,578
Shri Mataji: First I talk to them and then

7
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:34,140
ask the questions.

8
00:00:40,053 --> 00:00:42,499
I am overjoyed to see you all here.

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,580
Actually the whole night I was working

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,500
on Melbourne seekers,

11
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:49,368
that they should come today and

12
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:52,980
should establish their realisation very well.

13
00:00:54,994 --> 00:00:57,549
Now we have to understand

14
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:00,669
a few things about Sahaja Yoga very clearly

15
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:03,860
and there is no compromise on these few things

16
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,820
that we have to accept.

17
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:07,916
Because, as I told you,

18
00:01:08,117 --> 00:01:10,062
Truth cannot compromise for you,

19
00:01:10,263 --> 00:01:12,700
you have to compromise for Truth.

20
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:14,836
So the first is that

21
00:01:15,037 --> 00:01:17,976
Sahaja Yoga is not just a precept,

22
00:01:18,176 --> 00:01:19,980
is not just a precept:

23
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,704
it is practice.

24
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,115
It is not just a mental idea.

25
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:27,820
Now you got realisation, all right,

26
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,420
but it is not sufficient.

27
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,354
Even if you think that you got realisation so, now,

28
00:01:32,554 --> 00:01:35,500
you are all right, you become the Spirit,

29
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:40,620
all right; but still, it is more a mental conception

30
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,860
than a real identification.

31
00:01:44,342 --> 00:01:46,220
So it is not that

32
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:50,780
if you get your realisation, and you start the

33
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,500
awakening of your Kundalini, starts very well.

34
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:55,992
Still, it is

35
00:01:56,192 --> 00:01:58,940
to be understood that it is the practice of Sahaja Yoga

36
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,234
which is more important than the precept of it.

37
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:05,464
There are many people in India

38
00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:07,715
who can’t read or write,

39
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,899
who don’t have all these mental activities as you have

40
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:14,740
and are not so complicated as you are;

41
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,259
some of them are aboriginal people,

42
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,285
just living in the villages, very simple people.

43
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:23,340
They get realisation,

44
00:02:24,572 --> 00:02:28,419
they feel the joy much faster than the complicated ones will

45
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:32,220
and they just start working on it. You have to work it out.

46
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,860
This is not the compassion that speaks, talks,

47
00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:40,160
elaborates and advertises, but it works.

48
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,300
Sahaja Yoga is a thing that works, the religion that works.

49
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:47,522
And this is what we must understand first of all,

50
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:50,780
that it is not the talking, it is not the

51
00:02:54,993 --> 00:02:58,107
precept that you are a great soul:

52
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:00,435
you have to become.

53
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:04,678
Not that you are not, you are. But you have to be aware of it.

54
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:07,378
More light has to flow into you.

55
00:03:07,723 --> 00:03:10,995
Definitely, you must be something special to get it, no doubt.

56
00:03:11,196 --> 00:03:12,817
But you must allow

57
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:15,740
your lamp to be cleared out,

58
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,740
cleansed, so that more light is given.

59
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:21,700
And it works wonders for people

60
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,020
who honestly want to ascend

61
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,620
in spirituality.

62
00:03:26,595 --> 00:03:30,110
As I told you before also that it is a concept

63
00:03:30,742 --> 00:03:34,180
many people have that Sahaja Yoga cures people.

64
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:36,024
It is not true.

65
00:03:36,225 --> 00:03:39,140
It is just as a by-product it may cure you;

66
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:41,415
just as a by-product.

67
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:45,380
So one must understand the blessing has come to you

68
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,152
only because

69
00:03:48,253 --> 00:03:50,123
you are a seeker,

70
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:54,327
you have done a lot of good in your past life and this life also

71
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:58,088
and that God has chosen you to be in His Kingdom.

72
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:03,180
But it cannot be demanding, you cannot demand,

73
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:05,780
you cannot demand anything from God,

74
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,900
He has to give you because He knows what you deserve.

75
00:04:09,102 --> 00:04:11,782
And He gives you much, much, much more than what you deserve.

76
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:13,830
I mean, I have seen people who have been in

77
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,060
Sahaja Yoga that after one year they start asking,

78
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,020
“Mother, what did we do to deserve all this?”.

79
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,660
They just can’t believe it. I said, “Must be something,

80
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,780
you must know there must be something

81
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,380
that the blessings have come to you”.

82
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,766
This is one thing that one has to understand

83
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:34,220
that you cannot make Sahaja Yoga compromise for you,

84
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,980
you have to understand all the techniques and things

85
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,718
about Sahaja Yoga.

86
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:42,580
Now the thing could be that you may start doubting,

87
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,580
you see, so that’s what we have people who

88
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,290
are doubting about it and doing all kinds of things; you see,

89
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,300
in the beginning, they are rather slow movers.

90
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,067
So we have to sort them out, to begin with, because the second

91
00:04:55,552 --> 00:04:58,580
stage of awareness is doubtless awareness:

92
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:01,794
you are doubtless about yourself,

93
00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:04,603
doubtless about the working of Sahaja Yoga,

94
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:06,780
doubtless about God’s existence,

95
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,613
doubtless about His Laws.

96
00:05:08,813 --> 00:05:11,907
You become absolutely doubtless, not mentally, it’s a state,

97
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:14,060
it’s a state of your being

98
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,380
by which you achieve lots of

99
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:21,124
results and you really become powerful:

100
00:05:21,324 --> 00:05:23,420
you can see your compassion so powerful,

101
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,504
so discrete, so understanding,

102
00:05:25,704 --> 00:05:27,998
so forbearing. And you are amazed of yourself,

103
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:30,107
you really become a saint

104
00:05:30,308 --> 00:05:33,340
in the real sense of the word, that you become humble,

105
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,137
flowering,

106
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:37,820
beautifully, not taking anything

107
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,620
aggressive upon yourself; and you are really

108
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,478
in the Kingdom of God that you 
feel that you are looked after, protected,

109
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,300
guided, blessed, every moment you walk along.

110
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,373
And that’s the state everybody should aspire

111
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,795
to reach this doubtless awareness;

112
00:05:55,995 --> 00:05:58,369
and unless and until you reach that state,

113
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,700
we don’t call you Sahaja Yogi,

114
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:02,693
you may start calling yourself,

115
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:04,426
but that’s left to yourself.

116
00:06:04,627 --> 00:06:07,906
There are not sort of… we do not have sort of certification,

117
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:11,001
or things going on; or we do not give any written

118
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:13,215
certificates to people, nothing of the kind.

119
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,903
It is you who have to certify yourself.

120
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,755
So gradually people grow up

121
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,100
into beautiful beings.

122
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:23,773
They start

123
00:06:23,974 --> 00:06:26,320
having their self esteem fully established,

124
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,092
understanding themselves.

125
00:06:28,293 --> 00:06:30,740
But practice of Sahaja Yoga must be done

126
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,474
without thinking too much about it.

127
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:35,061
First, you just try it, more trying

128
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,060
– because if you start doubting, I tell you,

129
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,101
your progress will be much less.

130
00:06:39,528 --> 00:06:42,399
So first, just like a scientist, to try to

131
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,100
accept one by… there is nothing that has to be done,

132
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,556
you do not have to pay Me anything, of course,

133
00:06:47,756 --> 00:06:50,847
you do not have to do any acrobatics or anything.

134
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,420
But for example a small thing like my photograph, you see,

135
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,260
many people say, “Why Your photograph?”

136
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,300
So “Use your photograph,” I say, if that works out, you see.

137
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,220
It is something surprising: that’s how people challenging Me

138
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,020
“Why Your photograph?”. “Why not use yours?

139
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,540
I will be very happy, use anybody’s” 
but doesn’t work out, what to do now?

140
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,674
It’s My photograph that works out, but

141
00:07:08,874 --> 00:07:11,780
even if you do not like it, you have to use it – what can I do?

142
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,740
Is as simple like that, you see,

143
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,900
but in that, I do not gain anything from you,

144
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,980
I do not want anything from you, nothing material

145
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,006
that you can give Me.

146
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:26,899
But you will enjoy, you will enjoy My love, you will enjoy.

147
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:29,980
It is all for your own enjoyment, everything is done.

148
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,660
And this is a special time we are born in,

149
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,100
we have a special responsibility.

150
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,724
Today we had a lady who came,

151
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,124
her husband came, and they were saying that

152
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,900
“We had a son who was very well equipped

153
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,460
and he went to one of the gurus and he got completely ruined.”

154
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,381
And this particular guru

155
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:53,420
we need to be rather careful about, it’s this Rajaneesh fellow.

156
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,732
His disciples are rather difficult.

157
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,220
They come to Sahaja Yoga, all right, but they are a very

158
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,346
extreme type of people.

159
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,142
They come with a great force to Sahaja Yoga, again go back;

160
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:06,326
so all those who have been to Rajaneesh and have taken his initiation,

161
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:09,940
have to be extremely careful. All of you who have been to gurus

162
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,100
must know that they will be again and again attacked.

163
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,140
So you need to be rather

164
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,660
patient with yourselves as we are with you,

165
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,100
and must know that you must assert your will power a little bit,

166
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,660
to come up, and shed off all that

167
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,300
was screwed into your head…

168
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,060
and you paid for it, you see. Forget it.

169
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,660
Some time people say that “We have paid for it, so better have it”.

170
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,340
That’s not the way. You’d better through it away.

171
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:40,020
It is horrible, you have bought a snake on your head, on your neck.

172
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,808
So just through away all these things that they have put

173
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:44,466
you on.

174
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,580
You all forget it and become your Self, first of all,

175
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,660
and become your own guru. Ask your vibrations,

176
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,740
develop your vibratory awareness and grow with it.

177
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,860
Some people will find also that

178
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,278
their vibrations are not showing

179
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:02,540
very good results, some of you will find that kind of thing.

180
00:09:03,702 --> 00:09:05,247
And when you find

181
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:07,980
that your vibrations are not

182
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,740
working out in your hands and 
things, you should not get worried about it.

183
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,060
Maybe your Vishuddhi chakra is not all right.

184
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,460
There are ways and methods to 
improve your Vishuddhi chakra, by which

185
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,491
you know the exact

186
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:21,630
mantras to be said

187
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:24,715
and how to improve it; and we also

188
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:27,660
vibrated oil and all that, you can apply here.

189
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,433
And also there are other methods 
by which you can improve your sinus.

190
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:35,339
And if you have any problem with the 
Vishuddhi because of over-smoking or anything,

191
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,060
there are so many ways

192
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,500
which you can call the 
Grandmother’s medicine, simple, simple things

193
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,020
which will work it out, should try to clear out.

194
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,780
So whatever centre is not working out,

195
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,860
you should get after that and

196
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,152
don’t worry about the centres that are 
good because those who are good are good.

197
00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:54,460
So we have to look after the centres which are in trouble

198
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,021
and try to improve our centres and

199
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:01,886
complete being has to be brought into balance.

200
00:10:02,086 --> 00:10:04,011
Some people have some centres

201
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:05,700
so badly off that,

202
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,060
despite the fact they have all the centres all right,

203
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,902
because of one centre, you see,

204
00:10:10,102 --> 00:10:13,020
they are in imbalance. So, the first thing in Sahaja Yoga

205
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,286
is to establish a balance.

206
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,550
Now certain things about morality and all that,

207
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,623
I do not want to talk to you; gradually your self will realise

208
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,860
what is good for you and bad for you.

209
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,300
But in Sahaja Yoga, you will be given a proper guidance

210
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,100
as to what is to be done, how to lead a life and

211
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,571
how to have a normal, good

212
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:36,020
married life, how to have children,

213
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,020
how to look after them, how to get to your parents.

214
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,930
So the social side also

215
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,300
you can learn very well by which you really feel happy.

216
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,340
But the main society that you have is that of Sahaja yogis.

217
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,940
Of course, you do not have to cut off from 
anyone, you do not have to give up anyone.

218
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,700
But you grow among your

219
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,740
Sahaja yogis, these are called sajñānas, you see.

220
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,620
“Sa-jñāna”, the people

221
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,860
who are the followers of Truth.

222
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,580
So once you come together, it is a collective happening

223
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,540
and it works out more collectively and it helps you much more.

224
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,790
But if you say “Individually, 
Mother, I can do it”, it doesn't work out.

225
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,051
In Sahaja Yoga, I have seen, you do not go too far.

226
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:18,431
You all have to work it together, you have to meet.

227
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:20,660
Luckily, you have a very good ashram here.

228
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,620
You all can come and meditate and 
take a proper help from these people.

229
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,987
God has already blessed this place so much.

230
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,900
And when I came to Melbourne,

231
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,454
I stayed in a very small little house, with, I think,

232
00:11:31,654 --> 00:11:33,820
two bedrooms and some sort of a thing like that.

233
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,396
And this time I find a big, huge thing given to you,

234
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:40,860
and they may start here also a nice school for

235
00:11:41,864 --> 00:11:43,420
small children here.

236
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,660
Your small children can go to that school

237
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,500
where they can be looked after well,

238
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,540
they won’t have any complications.

239
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,903
And everything can be done at a

240
00:11:53,104 --> 00:11:54,604
much better level

241
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:57,354
than what you find in mundane life.

242
00:11:57,609 --> 00:12:00,260
Everything has a meaning, spiritual meaning,

243
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,620
everything in life has a meaning!

244
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,540
So you should try to find out whatever is good for your ascent

245
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,571
and for your nourishing

246
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:10,660
of your spiritual being!

247
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:14,700
I hope next time when I come,

248
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,660
all of you will be great Sahaja Yogis

249
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:19,740
and will be great people!

250
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,500
Individually everyone will be working out

251
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,549
on many people, and we have to 
change the face of Melbourne completely!

252
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,353
May God Bless you all.

253
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,925
So if you have any questions, you ask Me. Now…

254
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,008
Warren: Mother, there was one gentleman – he asked me a question.

255
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:36,496
He has got a son at home who's; 
he is mentally disturbed. He was asking

256
00:12:37,274 --> 00:12:40,154
how he can deal with that. Because he won’t come.

257
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:43,460
I suggested that first he and his wife should get it.

258
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,820
This gentleman here, in the suit.

259
00:12:46,785 --> 00:12:49,864
Shri Mataji: What’s the problem exactly? What is it called?

260
00:12:50,072 --> 00:12:52,386
Seeker: Well, schizophrenia.

261
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,848
He was very, very religious once upon a time.

262
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,977
Shri Mataji: Where did he go? To what place?

263
00:12:59,177 --> 00:13:02,226
Warren: What religious cult? What religious group?

264
00:13:02,427 --> 00:13:04,340
Seeker: Well, he belongs to the Catholic religion as I am.

265
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,373
Shri Mataji: What is that?

266
00:13:07,504 --> 00:13:09,068
Warren: Catholic, Mother.

267
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:12,248
He himself is a Catholic and he is a great believer in Christ.

268
00:13:12,448 --> 00:13:14,031
But his son became …

269
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:18,395
Seeker: He had a love affair which did not go right.

270
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:22,140
Shri Mataji: With a? Warren: I am just, I am not interrupting, I am just passing on.

271
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,420
She does not hear you too clearly.

272
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,533
He had a love affair and it did not go right.

273
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,308
Shri Mataji: What is his age?

274
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,340
Seeker: Pardon? Shri Mataji: What is his age?

275
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,707
Warren: Age. Seeker: Twenty-four now.

276
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,940
Shri Mataji: Now I don’t want to criticise Catholicism,

277
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,890
I say because as you are a believer of Christ, it is all right.

278
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,500
But there are certain practices they have taken to,

279
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,118
which are quite injurious to human beings.

280
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:47,836
Seeker: The thing is he is schizophrenic.

281
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:50,460
That can happen to any Catholic.

282
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,620
Why? See, the reason I will tell you. Please be seated.

283
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,102
If you listen to Me patiently there,

284
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,140
two things which they do very wrong.

285
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,389
One is to build churches

286
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,740
and then put all the dead bodies in it.

287
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,782
It is absolutely absurd you see,

288
00:14:03,982 --> 00:14:06,390
to have a graveyard in the church. Absolutely.

289
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,572
That is so dangerous. Now I have had many Catholic

290
00:14:09,772 --> 00:14:11,272
people coming to Me.

291
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:14,540
And they had very big problems with two centres.

292
00:14:14,852 --> 00:14:18,679
One is this back centre and another is left this one.

293
00:14:19,918 --> 00:14:23,143
Of course, left Swadishthana is there because it is unauthorised.

294
00:14:23,344 --> 00:14:26,260
They are not realised souls and they cannot preach about God.

295
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,718
They have no authority to preach about God. Or to baptise anyone.

296
00:14:30,406 --> 00:14:33,140
No human being has got the authority to touch this

297
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,780
precious place without being baptised.

298
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,820
They themselves should be really baptised.

299
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,980
Actualisation of baptism is needed.

300
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,919
You think about it, logically.

301
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,208
Anybody can become a priest you see, and you cannot elect them.

302
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:48,260
It has to come from God, isn’t it?

303
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,500
So that is one thing that is wrong there.

304
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,405
And another thing they are always caught up

305
00:14:53,605 --> 00:14:55,158
is the left Vishuddhi, is here.

306
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:59,220
When they do this confession business, 
you see – who are these priests to confess to?

307
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,220
Actually, I have seen the priests also go mad.

308
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,100
So many priests have come to Me.

309
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,712
Because the people have confessed 
to them. And in that confession, poor

310
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:11,740
– the priests have gone off their heads.
Because they couldn’t bear it anymore you see.

311
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,780
The kind of confessions people did, that – 
“I have murdered someone, I have done this and that”.

312
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,100
And they couldn’t keep it you see; 
their conscience couldn’t keep it in themselves.

313
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,540
So one has to face it clearly;

314
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,620
anybody can get mad like that.

315
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,420
I have known people who really got very mad.

316
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,060
So one has to understand that

317
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,767
you must get your realisation first of all.

318
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:34,897
Seeker: Yeah but Mother, I have noticed when I pray,

319
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:38,580
it has an influence and

320
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:41,139
he really calms down.

321
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,340
Shri Mataji: He will. Of course, I agree.

322
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:47,993
Seeker: He hasn't been cured, but it changes him.

323
00:15:48,194 --> 00:15:50,262
Shri Mataji: Must be. Because if you pray to Christ,

324
00:15:50,462 --> 00:15:52,570
He will definitely help. But not through your church.

325
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,693
What I am saying, must be…

326
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:58,036
Seeker: I am a believer in Christ. Shri Mataji: That’s all right.

327
00:15:58,236 --> 00:16:01,085
Then it’s all right. But what I am saying, that,

328
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:03,619
to get a complete connection with God

329
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,740
or with Christ, you have to be born again, isn’t it?

330
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,799
So you must get your realisation. Seeker: Yes.

331
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:12,420
Shri Mataji: And if you can get your 
realisation, you can help your son immensely.

332
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,820
Seeker: That is what I want.

333
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,300
Shri Mataji: So you all must get realisation. All parents

334
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,545
who are interested in their children;

335
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,540
all children who are interested in their parents,

336
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,500
must get their realisation. Seeker: I want to tell you Mother,

337
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,140
that since he became sick four years ago,

338
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,620
I have turned to Christ more than ever.

339
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,780
And I have found very great comfort.

340
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,540
And I have found all the answers.

341
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,747
That is why I want to help You.

342
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,180
Shri Mataji: Yes, but one thing must 
be - Seeker: I know that this life is a lie.

343
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,244
The life we are leading is a lie. I know that.

344
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:48,260
Shri Mataji: So you must get 
your realisation and understand Christ

345
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,516
and in a better way, in a fuller way,

346
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:52,780
in a real way, how He helps you.

347
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,606
Otherwise, you cannot understand Him.

348
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:58,140
Superficially how far can you go? He’s been kind to you,

349
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,180
but now you have to be

350
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,960
more realistic about it. All right?

351
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:05,025
Seeker: That is why I wanted to help of you.

352
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,780
Shri Mataji: No, don’t bring your son.

353
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,286
We can work it out. Have you got a photograph of his?

354
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,620
Seeker: I haven’t got it, but I can bring a photograph.

355
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,340
Shri Mataji: You send Me the photograph. All right? I can work…

356
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,918
Seeker: I send you the photograph.

357
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:19,714
Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s better. 
You send Me the photograph, all right.

358
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:22,074
To our Sydney address. When I'm there…

359
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:25,700
Seeker: You'll be going. I will give it to one of your - Shri Mataji: No, no. You can give it to one of them.

360
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,081
They will bring it along. All right?

361
00:17:28,282 --> 00:17:31,300
That’s all. Now what else, My child?

362
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:54,631
Warren: He is asking whether there are
different degrees of Kundalini awakening

363
00:17:54,831 --> 00:17:57,060
because he has heard or read that -

364
00:17:57,714 --> 00:17:59,260
that can be very dangerous.

365
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,940
Shri Mataji: No, no, it’s not. It
is all people who are absolutely;

366
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,227
you see, they – people as I told you the other day that

367
00:18:06,427 --> 00:18:09,140
a person comes from the village and puts his fingers into the

368
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,060
holes of a plug and says it is the electricity

369
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,140
gives you the shock and something like that.

370
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,578
But I, I can assure you that Kundalini is

371
00:18:16,778 --> 00:18:19,242
never, never dangerous. She is your mother.

372
00:18:19,442 --> 00:18:22,610
But, there is another centre down below

373
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,100
which might sometimes give you a little heat

374
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,820
or some sparking in the finger.

375
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,740
Or maybe a little electrical discharge.

376
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,460
For a while. Just for a while. If there is a problem.

377
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,386
On that centre. A little bit, not much.

378
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:41,190
But you can gradually feel that

379
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,700
cool breeze after the tingling is over.

380
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,402
In the beginning, you might feel a little tingling.

381
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:48,406
So far I have given realisation, I think,

382
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:50,879
to so many people. The Sahaja Yoga has worked out so well.

383
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,131
Nobody has suffered. Everybody has gained.

384
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:56,375
But if you have been to some guru. For example, take,

385
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,220
say, people who have been to say,

386
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,580
Mahesh Yogi. Now, about thirty people came to Me

387
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,139
and only I could save eight of them.

388
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,246
Because of the rest of them; they used to come,

389
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:11,926
go back, come, go back. Like that,

390
00:19:12,207 --> 00:19:14,860
to that state. I could save only eight of them

391
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,220
because they were so badly damaged you see.

392
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,561
But even, they went back to the lunatic asylum,

393
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:23,100
this, that – but still they were remembering Me.

394
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,381
I don’t know, they are still coming out,

395
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,686
going in, like that. So they take time.

396
00:19:27,886 --> 00:19:30,641
But it is not, never dangerous. It tries to improve you.

397
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:33,100
Even when I go you will find

398
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,460
it will rise and gradually tickle you here and there.

399
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,147
It doesn't trouble you at all. It is a very

400
00:19:38,347 --> 00:19:40,580
kind, compassionate mother of yours

401
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,660
who has been with you all your lives.

402
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,300
And now she is anxious to establish your realisation.

403
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,154
She is one who gives your second birth.

404
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,420
So she cannot be unkind.

405
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,138
See, she is your pure mother.

406
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:55,535
She has no interest in you but to give you your second birth.

407
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:57,380
And she is your individual mother.

408
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,500
Of course, some of you have 
harmed her very much. I have seen her

409
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,540
very much upset.

410
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,249
But doesn’t matter.

411
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,171
She looks after you. She is the one who does all this job.

412
00:20:10,371 --> 00:20:12,300
She is the one who cures you, she is one

413
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,372
who gives you realisation, she is the one who gives you peace,

414
00:20:15,572 --> 00:20:18,060
she is the one who takes you to the Spirit.

415
00:20:19,243 --> 00:20:22,290
All right? So nothing; don’t have any fears.

416
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:23,870
May God Bless You.

417
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:26,972
This is all funny people. You see, 
everybody has written about Kundalini.

418
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:28,820
I am Myself, I am amazed.

419
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,100
They had no fear of God, no fear of anything

420
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,940
– all lies, they have written and

421
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,509
those who really suffered must be unauthorised, horrible people

422
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,310
who must have tried. You have to have a proper, holy life, isn’t it?

423
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,099
You have to be a holy person. Because Kundalini

424
00:20:42,353 --> 00:20:44,420
is a kanya,

425
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,833
means a virgin. Now imagine,

426
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:51,120
they call the sleeping serpent on this

427
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,180
Ayers Rock you see –

428
00:20:54,381 --> 00:20:56,047
for the “kuniya”.

429
00:20:56,248 --> 00:20:58,700
That is what it is – Kundalini is a virgin.

430
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,260
Can you imagine how it is so much so here?

431
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,191
And if you see the photographs, it is all Ganesha’s things.

432
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:07,309
Absolutely the same colour, everything – just imagine.

433
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,780
I told them a long time back when he met Me first,

434
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,273
that your country is the country of Mooladhara.

435
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:14,776
And then he sent Me this photograph from there.

436
00:21:14,976 --> 00:21:18,138
And I saw and I was amazed – even
 the trunk is there. Can you imagine?

437
00:21:18,338 --> 00:21:20,175
And the whole colour, everything is the same.

438
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,044
You have such a blessing of God; why should you worry?

439
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,900
Your land is very holy.

440
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,620
Is a holy land. Is written about this land.

441
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,220
In the ancient books of India, where a

442
00:21:33,898 --> 00:21:37,061
saint was, had done something wrong.

443
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:38,959
So God cursed him.

444
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,660
And said, “You will go”, is called 
Trishanku – your Southern Cross.

445
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,540
That you will go to a land and create a heaven there for yourself.

446
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,700
See, first, he was cursed to go

447
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,099
in the Southern Hemisphere.

448
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,660
And then it was told that you will create your own heaven.

449
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,390
That is what it is.

450
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,180
Warren: They may have not heard of the word Southern Cross, Mother.

451
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:00,940
Shri Mataji: Southern Cross.

452
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,820
You know the Southern Cross. It is called as Trishanku.

453
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,807
It was hanging down, made hanging upside down.

454
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:09,340
And the curse was, a little bit what you call

455
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,260
concession given we can say.

456
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,418
As a concession to him that,

457
00:22:13,618 --> 00:22:16,849
“No because you are a saint, you will create your own heaven”.

458
00:22:17,189 --> 00:22:20,095
That’s what it is, Australia.

459
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,808
“Aus” itself is,

460
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,900
“Terra” means the land and “aus” means

461
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,050
“antariksha” – antariskha means what?

462
00:22:28,251 --> 00:22:31,319
Warren: There is a lady, blind 
lady up there who is asking questions.

463
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:37,787
Shri Mataji: What is she saying?

464
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:39,483
Warren: No.

465
00:22:45,396 --> 00:22:48,380
Warren: A Christian scientist, practitioner told her once

466
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,109
there is no such thing as birth. Is that correct?

467
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,620
Shri Mataji: Do you believe him? 
What good has he done to the world?

468
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,994
They can say anything. You must ask,

469
00:22:58,194 --> 00:23:00,421
“What good have they done?”. All right.

470
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:03,459
What is the criteria, see, of a saint? You must find.

471
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,769
Everybody can talk about God. Who is going to check them?

472
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,260
Even Hitler talked on God, even Napoleon talked, I don’t know.

473
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,140
See, you must understand if they have 
any right to talk? Are they saintly people?

474
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,537
All these Christian scientists, do you think they are saintly people?

475
00:23:16,738 --> 00:23:19,084
Have they done any saintly work?

476
00:23:20,155 --> 00:23:21,999
Warren: He does healing work.

477
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,660
Shri Mataji: You see, you can also heal with spirits. With dead spirits.

478
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,003
That’s one thing you can do. Horrible. Keep away from them.

479
00:23:33,675 --> 00:23:36,309
 She doesn’t know what she is talking about.

480
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,339
Warren: Any other question?

481
00:23:41,641 --> 00:23:44,767
Shri Mataji: You see, anybody can say anything. I am not here answerable to them.

482
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:47,750
There can be a lot of mad people,

483
00:23:47,951 --> 00:23:51,499
funny people, people who are anti-God, any sort but

484
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,740
what I am talking is talking for myself. All right?

485
00:23:58,713 --> 00:24:00,216
What is she saying?

486
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:02,470
Warren: She brought some sugar 
and she would like Your vibrations in it.

487
00:24:02,671 --> 00:24:05,992
Shri Mataji: All right. I will give you but what about your eyes?

488
00:24:09,067 --> 00:24:11,167
Warren: She’s got very poor vision.

489
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:15,198
Shri Mataji: All right. Now for that, 
we have to work out for you, all right?

490
00:24:15,398 --> 00:24:18,445
We will tell you what is to be done. Have you got somebody to be with you?

491
00:24:18,645 --> 00:24:21,430
Have you got someone with you, who lives with you? Warren: Okay we could show them.

492
00:24:21,631 --> 00:24:25,002
Shri Mataji: All right. We can tell you what is to be done. That can be cured. All right?

493
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:28,580
That thing can be done. So you have to come back again.

494
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,990
And they will tell you precisely what is to be done.

495
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,300
So work it out. You can get back your vision.

496
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,898
All of you who have got poor vision

497
00:24:37,098 --> 00:24:40,271
also must know what is to be done about it. What is it?

498
00:24:41,626 --> 00:24:43,892
Seeker: Can we hear something about hearing?

499
00:24:44,104 --> 00:24:47,040
Shri Mataji: Healing? Yes, yes, hearing can also be done.

500
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:48,860
Seeker: Migraine? Warren: Migraine, headaches.

501
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:52,515
Shri Mataji: Of course, migraine, 
can be worked out very easily, no doubt.

502
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,535
Yes, of course, migraine is very simple.

503
00:24:55,629 --> 00:24:57,325
Seeker: High blood pressure.

504
00:24:58,005 --> 00:24:59,553
Shri Mataji: Of course. He is another;

505
00:24:59,753 --> 00:25:01,855
he had high blood pressure.

506
00:25:05,786 --> 00:25:08,786
Warren: She was born partially 
deaf; that may be a little more difficult.

507
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:10,336
Seeker: Yes, she's three years.

508
00:25:10,537 --> 00:25:14,056
Shri Mataji: It is all right – still we 
will work it out. You see it is, what I am saying,

509
00:25:14,256 --> 00:25:16,140
you don’t have to pay for it,

510
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,259
you don’t have to do anything – if it works out, well and good.

511
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:20,909
You should try.

512
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,550
You should try everything, all right, but…

513
00:25:24,598 --> 00:25:26,100
Warren: She brought her with her.

514
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,980
Shri Mataji: Good. Where is she?

515
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,098
Seeker: In the car. I will go and get her? Shri Mataji: All right.

516
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:35,860
We will see. Little later, little later, all right. Let’s finish the whole thing.

517
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,700
What else?

518
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:39,540
Seeker: Falling of the hair.

519
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,164
Shri Mataji: What’s she…. Warren: Falling hair. Shri Mataji: You have?

520
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,040
Warren: Alopecia.

521
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,661
Shri Mataji: You have the kind where you lose part, part of…

522
00:25:52,862 --> 00:25:56,560
Warren: Yes, clumps of hair goes. 
Shri Mataji: That we have got cured now of somebody.

523
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:59,375
He's much better.

524
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:06,340
Shri Mataji: Who is it? Warren: What’s the question?

525
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,490
Seeker: Supposing you get realisation

526
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,698
and wake up the Kundalini -

527
00:26:10,898 --> 00:26:12,442
Warren: How would you get it?

528
00:26:12,643 --> 00:26:14,271
Shri Mataji: We will work it out.

529
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:15,958
You come for the first time.

530
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,955
All right we will work it out.

531
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:20,471
Warren: How will we get Kundalini awakening, he is saying.

532
00:26:20,644 --> 00:26:22,220
Shri Mataji: We will work it out.

533
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:26,235
His Agyna is too much. What, are you Christian or…?

534
00:26:27,742 --> 00:26:29,280
Your,

535
00:26:30,053 --> 00:26:32,860
centre of Christ is catching so badly.

536
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:35,398
Just imagine. We will work it out. All right?

537
00:26:35,598 --> 00:26:37,319
Doesn’t matter.

538
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,540
What Christ has said, “Humble down yourself in your heart”.

539
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,580
First of all, humble down yourself in your heart.

540
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,220
Then it works out. Humble down.

541
00:26:50,904 --> 00:26:52,604
All right?

542
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,980
Agyna. This centre is very important.

543
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,700
It works out better, you see.

544
00:27:01,866 --> 00:27:04,060
Don’t take up responsibility upon yourself.

545
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,562
God is doing everything for you. Don’t worry.

546
00:27:09,623 --> 00:27:12,420
Seeker: Earlier on, we heard that,

547
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,380
there is good and there is bad.

548
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:19,780
But if God is in all people. Shri Mataji: What is he saying?

549
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,736
Seeker: But then if you say
something is bad, you say God is bad?

550
00:27:22,937 --> 00:27:24,740
Warren: Earlier on, he heard that

551
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,140
there a Good and bad people.

552
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,029
But if God is Good

553
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:35,213
how is it that we can reach such a conclusion?

554
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,614
Shri Mataji: You see, you should not

555
00:27:37,814 --> 00:27:40,700
decide mentally who is good and who is bad, all right.

556
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,029
And you should not give up anyone as such;

557
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,454
as an absolutely wretched person.

558
00:27:45,655 --> 00:27:48,340
But on vibrations you realise

559
00:27:48,915 --> 00:27:50,500
that you can help

560
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,660
quite a lot of people. Some of them you have to give up.

561
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,360
But you just can’t help it, you just can’t help it. You can try.

562
00:27:57,412 --> 00:27:59,422
Like people are getting drowned, all right?.

563
00:27:59,623 --> 00:28:01,780
They are overloaded with things.

564
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,682
You can bring, in the West about,

565
00:28:06,214 --> 00:28:09,276
I would say about forty per cent people.

566
00:28:09,477 --> 00:28:11,067
easily up

567
00:28:11,267 --> 00:28:13,106
and twenty more with little

568
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:15,615
effort or quite a great effort.

569
00:28:15,816 --> 00:28:18,860
And ten more with really

570
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:22,060
very great struggle with them.

571
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,740
But such an ego-oriented society; it is difficult to reach them.

572
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,285
Because the ego covers them completely.

573
00:28:29,393 --> 00:28:31,808
But never discard anyone; just try.

574
00:28:32,008 --> 00:28:35,100
But don’t try very difficult words just now, you know.

575
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,120
Try simple words. When we want to first learn a new language,

576
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,100
we try simple words, you see.

577
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,392
In the same way, first, try simple people.

578
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,198
But don’t discard anyone,

579
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:47,812
but postpone.

580
00:28:48,013 --> 00:28:50,007
Till you become a master.

581
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:53,220
Then you can try the most difficult ones also.

582
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,780
But just now don’t think of the 
most difficult. Normally what happens,

583
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,060
people stick on to someone very difficult, like an ego challenge.

584
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,380
“I must transform” – and then you go wrong.

585
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,650
You don’t have to transform anyone, God has to do it.

586
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,900
But as you are a beginner, try with simple people.

587
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,340
All right?

588
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:22,256
Warren: You spoke about Ayers 
Rock. What was it you were saying?

589
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,692
Shri Mataji: Ayers Rock is the

590
00:29:27,815 --> 00:29:29,497
first centre.

591
00:29:29,698 --> 00:29:32,580
Which shows. The deity of the first centre.

592
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,360
It’s very vibrated.

593
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,220
You get tremendous vibrations from it.

594
00:29:37,904 --> 00:29:40,500
And the whole story about it they will let you later on.

595
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,908
Because, actually I told him that

596
00:29:43,109 --> 00:29:46,060
the centre is, the first centre is – 
and then they sent Me the photograph

597
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,220
of the Ayers Rock. It is true. It has vibrations.

598
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,633
Such a great thing that has come out of the Mother Earth.

599
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:53,596
Seeker: What vibrations? Will it vibrate?

600
00:29:53,797 --> 00:29:55,475
Shri Mataji: Yes, Holy vibrations.

601
00:29:55,676 --> 00:29:57,424
Seeker: Evil? Shri Mataji: Good.

602
00:29:57,598 --> 00:29:59,855
Seeker: Holy vibrations? Shri Mataji: Holy vibrations.

603
00:30:00,056 --> 00:30:01,576
Seeker: Ayers Rock?

604
00:30:04,081 --> 00:30:06,045
Warren: From primordial times. From way back.

605
00:30:06,246 --> 00:30:07,671
Shri Mataji: It has come from Mother Earth.

606
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:10,330
Which is told in the Bible.

607
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:14,420
That you shall now worship anything that is created by Mother Earth.

608
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,860
Now, what is created by Mother Earth?

609
00:30:17,131 --> 00:30:19,801
We should not reproduce and worship.

610
00:30:20,002 --> 00:30:22,558
But whatever is created by Mother Earth. And this is one of them.

611
00:30:22,758 --> 00:30:24,773
You have got such a great thing here.

612
00:30:25,685 --> 00:30:27,786
It is tremendous. When you become aware of it,

613
00:30:27,986 --> 00:30:30,443
you will be amazed. It just emits vibrations all over.

614
00:30:30,643 --> 00:30:34,180
But people who are evil, who are following black magic,

615
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,820
wrong practices – may call it an evil one.

616
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,740
Because for them, you see, it is evil, isn’t it?

617
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,447
Because that destroys all black magic and all that.

618
00:30:46,965 --> 00:30:49,740
Seeker: Something’s gone wrong with my Kundalini.

619
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,638
It has been burning at the bottom of my spine for years.

620
00:30:54,337 --> 00:30:56,060
Shri Mataji: When was this?

621
00:30:57,353 --> 00:30:59,185
How many years back?

622
00:30:59,386 --> 00:31:01,853
Seeker: Must have been four years.

623
00:31:02,201 --> 00:31:04,869
Warren: Did you go to anybody? Shri Mataji: Did you go to anyone?

624
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,980
Seeker: Yeah, Maharishi. Warren: Maharishi.

625
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,580
Shri Mataji: That’s a difficult fellow. But I will work it out.

626
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,740
Sit down on Mother Earth.

627
00:31:14,644 --> 00:31:16,550
Maharishi is one person; is horrid.

628
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,967
Warren: Take your shoes off. Shri Mataji: Take it out.

629
00:31:24,745 --> 00:31:26,825
Warren: This is a good example.

630
00:31:30,285 --> 00:31:32,980
Shri Mataji: But despite all this you see, nobody has made

631
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,300
a very joint effort.

632
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,780
Why don’t you write to our government or someone?

633
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,578
You see, it can be done.

634
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:42,660
Actually, when I talk to the government people because

635
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:45,558
I am quite highly connected. My brother himself is a minister.

636
00:31:45,758 --> 00:31:48,660
I know the President and everyone there.

637
00:31:48,861 --> 00:31:51,908
What they said is that is it You only who says these things.

638
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:55,220
I openly say. But nobody says anything you see;

639
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,020
nobody has anything written against it.

640
00:31:59,325 --> 00:32:01,570
So if you people write from here,

641
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,530
join together that they have taken so much money from us,

642
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,300
they have ruined us, they have done this and that, isn’t it?

643
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,607
Then it will be better.

644
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,460
Because they think that you are all very much satisfied with them.

645
00:32:14,418 --> 00:32:16,114
And it so happens that in the beginning,

646
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:18,540
some people come, they get ruined; the others come.

647
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,660
It’s like a moving train, you see, that takes passengers ahead.

648
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,786
And the passengers who have suffered are

649
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:26,568
left behind without any combined effort.

650
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:29,420
But in Paris, they have started a thing like that now.

651
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,500
Which is a very good thing.

652
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:34,381
Which is trying to oppose this.

653
00:32:34,581 --> 00:32:36,420
But unless and until you write something,

654
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,900
I don’t know how to take up with the government.

655
00:32:45,116 --> 00:32:46,671
What’s it?

656
00:32:48,186 --> 00:32:50,460
This one is talking too much.

657
00:32:55,581 --> 00:32:58,300
Warren: Look, you have asked quite a few questions.

658
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,924
I'll give this one to Mother and we will make it the last.

659
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:03,220
Warren: Doctor McDonald Baynes who was

660
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,199
a writer who lived in the Himalayas,

661
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:08,180
about the spiritual development said there is a celestial city

662
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,634
over the Dandenong ranges which is

663
00:33:10,835 --> 00:33:12,739
nearby to Melbourne here.

664
00:33:13,236 --> 00:33:14,744
What are your views?

665
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:17,660
Shri Mataji: I haven’t seen them as yet.

666
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,984
But must be, must be celestial here, no doubt.

667
00:33:21,184 --> 00:33:24,240
Is it towards the sea, the Southern side?

668
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:27,118
Warren: To the…what is it, the east? To the east.

669
00:33:27,418 --> 00:33:29,420
Shri Mataji: I don’t know this Baynes fellow,

670
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,660
how much to depend on him also.

671
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,460
Warren: He’s not realised.

672
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:36,585
He has good vibrations, but not realised.

673
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,220
Shri Mataji: It’s all right. Makes no difference, you see.

674
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,163
You have to have vibrations.

675
00:33:41,363 --> 00:33:43,420
What is the use of having these ranges around?

676
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,220
You better have them.

677
00:33:51,535 --> 00:33:53,939
Now done, everyone?

678
00:33:55,718 --> 00:33:58,980
How many of you did feel the cool breeze the other day?

679
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,700
Let's raise your hands.

680
00:34:03,024 --> 00:34:05,500
Warren: Put your both hands up so Mother can see.

681
00:34:09,503 --> 00:34:11,651
A lot of them haven’t been before.

682
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:15,852
Shri Mataji: All right. If you all put your 
hands, let us see how many of you feel again.

683
00:34:16,844 --> 00:34:19,900
Just sit down, comfortably, put your hands towards Me.

684
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:24,100
You can’t sit like that. Can you get some chair for the lady?

685
00:34:24,684 --> 00:34:27,620
Just, there are some chairs. You get a chair.

686
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,384
You are not supposed to sit with your feet towards Me, you see.

687
00:34:30,584 --> 00:34:33,300
It is not regarded as good, all right? Better take chairs.

688
00:34:34,901 --> 00:34:37,540
I am sorry. I know why you feel…

689
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,856
you can put the chair here on the sides. Come along.

690
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:44,660
Then you, that’s what it is. Then you can’t…

691
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,500
hello, how are you?

692
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:49,820
Put yourself like that

693
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,175
or you can sit on the chair.

694
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:53,780
Come along, it is all right. Just come here.

695
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,703
This doesn’t matter, If you have to sit on the chair, doesn't matter

696
00:34:56,903 --> 00:34:58,365
it is all right.

697
00:35:02,429 --> 00:35:04,700
Shri Mataji: Anyway, anyway, but not towards Me, you see.

698
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,136
You just can’t put your feet like that.

699
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:12,256
That’s what it is supposed to be. 
Doesn’t matter, after all, you are children.

700
00:35:12,457 --> 00:35:15,757
And I am the Mother. Doesn’t matter what you do.

701
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,870
Some of them are great people over here.

702
00:35:27,404 --> 00:35:30,380
Now, put your hands towards Me like this.

703
00:35:37,025 --> 00:35:39,246
I think, better close your eyes.

704
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,660
Can you take out this a little? I will put My feet on the ground.

705
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:45,061
Mother Earth.

706
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:52,937
Warren: Would you like me to pull the 
chair forward? Shri Mataji: It’s all right.

707
00:36:16,697 --> 00:36:18,881
What’s the matter with the lady?

708
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,620
Are you shaking too much?

709
00:36:21,983 --> 00:36:24,700
You been to some clairvoyant person?

710
00:36:25,915 --> 00:36:28,746
That’s the reason. All right. You come sit on the Mother grass,

711
00:36:28,946 --> 00:36:30,750
all right, would be better. Yes.

712
00:36:30,951 --> 00:36:32,606
Shri Mataji: Anyone shaking there?

713
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:34,398
Anyone shaking in the body?

714
00:36:34,598 --> 00:36:38,100
Keep your eyes open and sit on the Mother 
Earth. She takes away the problem, you see.

715
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,576
If you have been to a clairvoyant or someone, you may.

716
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,675
Shri Mataji: If you are not shaking it’s all right.

717
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:50,377
Everyone doesn’t get affected but some do, you see,

718
00:36:50,577 --> 00:36:52,577
it’s those horrible things they do.

719
00:36:53,369 --> 00:36:55,460
Sit on the Mother Earth, it’s better.

720
00:36:57,088 --> 00:36:59,499
What’s she saying? Warren: A bit giddy.

721
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,308
Shri Mataji: Better sit on the Mother Earth. 
You have been to some clairvoyant person?

722
00:37:03,509 --> 00:37:05,019
No?

723
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,660
Been to a guru?

724
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,367
Must be having a liver.

725
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:15,820
All right, come along here, let me see.

726
00:37:18,248 --> 00:37:21,700
She has a liver. Very bad liver you have.

727
00:37:23,315 --> 00:37:25,420
Did you feel giddy also before?

728
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,420
Seeker: I just had a serious operation.

729
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,820
Shri Mataji: What operation? Seeker: Brain surgery.

730
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,535
Warren: Brain surgery.

731
00:37:31,736 --> 00:37:33,860
Shri Mataji: It's all right. Keep your eyes open all right.

732
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,940
Don’t close them. Keep your eyes open.

733
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,940
You had an accident?

734
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:42,275
Doesn’t matter.

735
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,620
Nabhi is too much.

736
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,904
Keep your eyes open, please.

737
00:37:54,104 --> 00:37:55,780
How are you feeling now?

738
00:37:56,551 --> 00:37:58,096
Still giddy?

739
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:01,601
Better? Would you like to lie down?

740
00:38:02,028 --> 00:38:04,133
We can get you a pillow. All right.

741
00:38:04,347 --> 00:38:07,269
Better lie down. You can let her 
lie down here. You can lie down here.

742
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,300
Warren: Come over here. Shri Mataji: Put the pillow there.

743
00:38:09,501 --> 00:38:12,100
Put the pillow on that side and the feet at the back, yes.

744
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,900
Let her lie down.

745
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,614
Warren: Put your head down here.

746
00:38:15,814 --> 00:38:18,060
Shri Mataji: Don’t cry. Don’t cry. You are going to be alright.

747
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,180
You just don’t worry. Put your head here.

748
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,707
Towards Me. Yes, just…

749
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:27,860
You have to work it out. Don’t cry. You wanted to see Me, is it?

750
00:38:28,075 --> 00:38:29,675
Or lie this way.

751
00:38:30,303 --> 00:38:32,580
Parallel to, will be better.

752
00:38:34,778 --> 00:38:38,778
It shows, you see there's any problem, it shows, it shows.

753
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:43,780
Just lie down. Be comfortable.

754
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:51,930
Will work out. Don’t you worry.

755
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,940
You are going to be all right.

756
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,420
It’s good, fine. May God Bless You.

757
00:39:04,971 --> 00:39:06,660
All right?

758
00:39:10,905 --> 00:39:13,948
Now those who are feeling the cool breeze,

759
00:39:14,148 --> 00:39:15,654
already,

760
00:39:16,412 --> 00:39:18,820
can get up and see others,

761
00:39:19,146 --> 00:39:20,940
who are not feeling it.

762
00:39:21,147 --> 00:39:22,859
And you can stand behind one person each.

763
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,675
I will teach you how to give them realisation also.

764
00:39:25,876 --> 00:39:27,435
Can be done now.

765
00:39:27,635 --> 00:39:30,900
All right. Those who are really feeling the cool breeze, can get up.

766
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:33,700
It’s a good idea to help others. Yes. Let’s have it.

767
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,695
Warren: Can the Sahaja Yogis do the same thing.

768
00:39:35,896 --> 00:39:39,340
Shri Mataji: Also the Sahaja Yogis. Those 
who are feeling the cool breeze. Come along.

769
00:39:44,609 --> 00:39:47,444
Now, all of you should put your

770
00:39:48,008 --> 00:39:51,580
left hand towards Me and right hand on top of the head of the person.

771
00:39:52,094 --> 00:39:54,041
Left hand towards me, yes.

772
00:39:54,241 --> 00:39:56,580
On top, not touching, not touching.

773
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,460
Higher. Like this, yes.

774
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,009
See. It works better.

775
00:40:05,712 --> 00:40:08,100
You act as a sort of  a

776
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,740
wire, thing.

777
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,965
It passes. See, now, ha, better?

778
00:40:13,165 --> 00:40:14,860
All right.

779
00:40:16,529 --> 00:40:18,540
What about you? You feeling it?

780
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:22,060
Now get up. You can get up. Those who are feeling can get up.

781
00:40:22,557 --> 00:40:24,420
Now, are you better now?

782
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,125
Not yet.

783
00:40:27,287 --> 00:40:30,540
You put your right hand out like that, yourself.

784
00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:33,367
The Indian gentleman put your right hand.

785
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:36,860
Like this, at the back, yes. And put left towards Me.

786
00:40:39,434 --> 00:40:41,500
All right? Good.

787
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,220
You getting it?

788
00:40:43,686 --> 00:40:46,299
Are you? No, not yet.

789
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,427
All right. It will work out. Just don’t you worry.

790
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,894
Maybe some of you can put your left hand and see

791
00:40:54,094 --> 00:40:56,700
with the right hand like this. It will work out.

792
00:40:57,198 --> 00:41:00,020
Left towards Me and right hand out.

793
00:41:01,276 --> 00:41:04,300
No, no, left towards Me like this, left like this

794
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,145
and the right like that.

795
00:41:06,346 --> 00:41:08,220
Just try, some of you.

796
00:41:08,874 --> 00:41:11,301
If it works out better. Or the other way round.

797
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,694
She’s got it. You feeling it?

798
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:17,780
Good. She’s got it. Now work on ….you feeling now?

799
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,493
Good, good.

800
00:41:20,899 --> 00:41:23,980
It’s good. Put it like that

801
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,700
and this one like that.

802
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,420
You can put it towards Me. The right hand if you want.

803
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,580
Right towards Me. One hand has to be towards Me.

804
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,828
Put one hand towards Me, like that. That’s it.

805
00:41:34,028 --> 00:41:35,540
Now, tell her also.

806
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,540
Put the other hand,

807
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,478
the way she is doing. No. Yes, good.

808
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:42,380
Good.

809
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:45,500
Are you feeling? No.

810
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:50,140
Sit on the Mother Earth. Move on the Mother Earth more.

811
00:42:03,124 --> 00:42:04,749
Now try another lady.

812
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:07,428
Yes, yes, you go on trying. She’s very good.

813
00:42:07,745 --> 00:42:10,605
She doing very well, yeah. Just put one hand

814
00:42:10,805 --> 00:42:12,759
towards Me, that's all. Simple. Is it?

815
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,900
Seeker: Hot vibration. Shri Mataji: But not cool.

816
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,433
Not cool as yet. Seeker: Not much though.

817
00:42:18,633 --> 00:42:20,940
Shri Mataji: It will, it will work out. What about you?

818
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,460
Not yet? Try on her. Maybe.

819
00:42:24,051 --> 00:42:26,051
Seeker: Very hot, Mother.

820
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:28,788
Shri Mataji: You are feeling hot?

821
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:30,834
On her?

822
00:42:31,066 --> 00:42:33,020
What’s the problem?

823
00:42:33,735 --> 00:42:35,804
You think too much, do you?

824
00:42:35,999 --> 00:42:38,287
Seeker: I don't know what I supposed to be feeling?

825
00:42:38,561 --> 00:42:40,900
Shri Mataji: You feel the cool breeze on the hand do you?

826
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:44,263
No, no. No, no. That’s a different thing. You feel a

827
00:42:44,463 --> 00:42:47,090
sensation in your hand. No?

828
00:42:55,662 --> 00:42:57,165
All right?

829
00:42:58,352 --> 00:42:59,940
She’s good.

830
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:02,010
It’s rising, it’s rising.

831
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,797
She’s got it.

832
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,380
You got it, no. Not feeling it?

833
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,340
Can you take out that necklace a little bit?

834
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,269
These things a little bit, sometimes that also affects.

835
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:14,027
Are you better, My child?

836
00:43:14,227 --> 00:43:16,862
Better now? Good. Good.

837
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,380
Put your left hand up that way.

838
00:43:26,078 --> 00:43:28,491
All right? It will work out.

839
00:43:34,462 --> 00:43:36,180
Is she better?

840
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,763
Little bit. She's improving. Put your hand like this.

841
00:43:38,964 --> 00:43:41,899
Have patience with yourself. You
must have some patience with yourself.

842
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:43,613
That’s the main point is.

843
00:43:45,855 --> 00:43:48,143
Better now? It's Better?

844
00:43:48,344 --> 00:43:50,980
Yes, it is. Working out?

845
00:43:51,242 --> 00:43:52,762
Better.

846
00:43:59,774 --> 00:44:01,580
Keep your eyes open.

847
00:44:02,748 --> 00:44:04,992
Tell her to keep her eyes open.

848
00:44:05,192 --> 00:44:07,580
All right? Better?

849
00:44:12,506 --> 00:44:14,111
No?

850
00:44:14,633 --> 00:44:17,049
Her Vishuddhi is not all…yes?

851
00:44:18,482 --> 00:44:19,982
Very hot?

852
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:23,100
All right. She has been to some guru?

853
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,020
No one.

854
00:44:26,673 --> 00:44:28,700
To no clairvoyant or anyone?

855
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,479
Not at all?

856
00:44:36,987 --> 00:44:40,699
Put your left hand on the right-hand side of your stomach.

857
00:44:45,554 --> 00:44:47,300
Is it all right?

858
00:44:48,563 --> 00:44:51,060
Put your left hand

859
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:52,740
on the Mother Earth.

860
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,393
Like that, yes. And right hand towards Me.

861
00:44:58,448 --> 00:44:59,948
Like this.

862
00:45:12,253 --> 00:45:14,188
Did you feel the cool breeze? Good.

863
00:45:14,388 --> 00:45:16,100
Why not work on these two gentlemen?

864
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,100
This gentleman and this lady?

865
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,660
Did you feel? No? All right, you get up and work on them.

866
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,986
Not on your relations or friends all right? Other people.

867
00:45:25,186 --> 00:45:27,980
That’s important. In the beginning.

868
00:45:29,117 --> 00:45:30,762
It’s better now?

869
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:32,767
No? No?

870
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:36,340
He is a very difficult, horrible person I tell you.

871
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,600
One of the worst you can think of this Mahesh Yogi.

872
00:45:39,801 --> 00:45:42,223
And how much money has amassed do you know?

873
00:45:46,485 --> 00:45:49,860
We have someone there from him. The whole family is ruined.

874
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,642
It's Terrible.

875
00:45:58,383 --> 00:45:59,888
Is it?

876
00:46:07,157 --> 00:46:08,893
Comes and goes. All right. Don’t think.

877
00:46:09,093 --> 00:46:10,660
Just watch Me without thinking.

878
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,500
If it comes. Are you better?

879
00:46:19,505 --> 00:46:22,151
She has an Agyna, I think. This lady.

880
00:46:22,352 --> 00:46:23,740
What about you?

881
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,340
Did you feel? Good.

882
00:46:28,974 --> 00:46:32,819
He has to put his left hand on his stomach. Liver, you see.

883
00:46:33,192 --> 00:46:36,187
Liver and Vishuddhi both the Center.

884
00:46:39,551 --> 00:46:41,974
He is difficult. He is very difficult.

885
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:46,067
You sit on Mother Earth. Let him sit. 
He is difficult. He’s from that horrible

886
00:46:46,268 --> 00:46:48,390
Satya Sai Baba. He’s the worst.

887
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:50,860
Till you get a heart attack he won’t leave you.

888
00:46:55,264 --> 00:46:58,356
Put your right hand on Mother Earth and left hand towards Me.

889
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,100
Is she better?

890
00:47:15,017 --> 00:47:17,288
Little hot is she?

891
00:47:17,605 --> 00:47:19,249
She has a liver too.

892
00:47:21,378 --> 00:47:23,900
Hello? You put your left hand

893
00:47:24,131 --> 00:47:26,260
on your stomach on the right side.

894
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,945
Right side.

895
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:29,643
Right side, yes.

896
00:47:29,737 --> 00:47:31,920
Who is the gentleman with migraine?

897
00:47:32,356 --> 00:47:34,292
You have got migraine?

898
00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:36,073
Seeker: No, my wife has.

899
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:37,944
My wife has it, I have nothing!

900
00:47:38,145 --> 00:47:40,780
Shri Mataji: All right. You watch at Me. Watch this side.

901
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,958
You see, don’t watch other people.

902
00:47:47,236 --> 00:47:48,736
She?

903
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:51,566
She’s all right, she's coming. She a liver, it's true.

904
00:47:51,767 --> 00:47:53,948
So many have livers, livers – I don’t know why.

905
00:47:54,149 --> 00:47:56,380
What about this lady? Did she feel any?

906
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,660
Good, good. But keep your hands, have more.

907
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:02,012
You see, I am here for a short time. I'll go away.

908
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,780
Now don’t put your shoes towards Me, all right.

909
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,867
If you can take out, thank you.

910
00:48:08,206 --> 00:48:11,206
Is she crying? Put her right to the left.

911
00:48:14,113 --> 00:48:16,247
You are all right. She’s got it.

912
00:48:17,959 --> 00:48:20,398
I can see from your eyes. Good.

913
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:22,820
You are doing a good job.

914
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,375
Seeker: Mother, can I ask you,

915
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,873
I know I shouldn't be asking you questions

916
00:48:27,468 --> 00:48:30,187
but I've been ill for twelve years with

917
00:48:30,387 --> 00:48:31,860
kidneys and...

918
00:48:32,374 --> 00:48:34,218
Shri Mataji: Now no more. It’s finished.

919
00:48:34,418 --> 00:48:36,381
It is done, it's done.

920
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:38,740
Got some water for Me?

921
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,804
Seeker: You saw me at a lecture.

922
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:42,426
Shri Mataji: Did you bring water?

923
00:48:42,626 --> 00:48:44,980
Seeker: No, I have been drinking the water you gave me.

924
00:48:45,411 --> 00:48:47,140
Shri Mataji: Good. You are all right.

925
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,924
No kidneys, nothing. Finished.

926
00:48:50,124 --> 00:48:53,898
Did you go on the machine anytime with the kidney?

927
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:57,090
Seeker: What machine? 
Shri Mataji: That they do circulation of the -

928
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:57,966
Seeker: No.

929
00:48:58,166 --> 00:49:00,408
Shri Mataji: Thank God. Then its all right, no problem.

930
00:49:00,608 --> 00:49:03,500
What about this gentleman here? Did you feel?

931
00:49:04,701 --> 00:49:06,420
Hot? Hot?

932
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:13,420
You put your left hand on your stomach, on the right-hand side.

933
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:15,992
Can you?

934
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:18,296
What is it?

935
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:21,069
Can you try this gentleman here?

936
00:49:21,269 --> 00:49:22,903
He will be all right.

937
00:49:23,103 --> 00:49:24,779
Keep your eyes open.

938
00:49:24,979 --> 00:49:26,468
This lady.

939
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:30,665
Ask her also to open her eyes.

940
00:49:33,327 --> 00:49:35,089
Very pale.

941
00:49:35,297 --> 00:49:36,815
What about you?

942
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,573
Left hand?

943
00:49:41,844 --> 00:49:43,346
Not right hand?

944
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,000
You also put your left hand on 
the stomach, on the right-hand side.

945
00:49:52,976 --> 00:49:54,742
Good. It will work out.

946
00:49:54,942 --> 00:49:57,120
It will slowly work out in everyone.

947
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:00,118
Good.

948
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:05,129
You still have? All right. Come along here.

949
00:50:07,117 --> 00:50:08,810
Can you sit facing that side?

950
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,700
I have to put My foot if you don’t mind.

951
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,595
Seeker: On the back? Lovely.

952
00:50:12,796 --> 00:50:15,146
Shri Mataji: Just sit comfortability.

953
00:50:15,732 --> 00:50:18,540
No, I think it’s here.

954
00:50:22,109 --> 00:50:24,843
There are certain exercises you have to do for this.

955
00:50:25,043 --> 00:50:27,492
But in any case, I will cure you now.

956
00:50:27,813 --> 00:50:29,500
This will dissolve out.

957
00:50:34,714 --> 00:50:37,346
How are these people? Are you all right? Good.

958
00:50:37,547 --> 00:50:39,510
I am happy you are working it.

959
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:41,748
From Mauritius, yes, good.

960
00:50:41,948 --> 00:50:43,820
Good, good, I'm happy.

961
00:50:45,154 --> 00:50:46,940
They are not getting it?

962
00:50:54,564 --> 00:50:56,686
They will, they will. All of them have to get it.

963
00:50:56,886 --> 00:50:58,903
They will get it, don’t you worry.

964
00:51:00,095 --> 00:51:01,995
It's better now?

965
00:51:04,153 --> 00:51:06,940
Some ossification has taken place.

966
00:51:07,546 --> 00:51:09,340
What were you doing?

967
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:12,540
Seeker: Hatha yoga. Shri Mataji: Hatha yoga!

968
00:51:14,122 --> 00:51:16,136
That’s it, without your...

969
00:51:16,336 --> 00:51:18,460
I was wondering how it’s gone into that.

970
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,028
Seeker: Yeah, it is difficult.

971
00:51:20,228 --> 00:51:22,378
Shri Mataji: It is horrible. Stop all Hatha yoga.

972
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:26,202
No, no, no, no. I will tell you what exercises are to be done.

973
00:51:26,403 --> 00:51:29,100
For everyone, not the same exercise

974
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,328
– for everyone there is a different exercise, all right.

975
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:37,180
Good. Enjoy.

976
00:51:46,232 --> 00:51:47,740
Is he all right?

977
00:51:51,222 --> 00:51:53,540
He’s been to some guru or someone?

978
00:51:54,843 --> 00:51:57,436
No, not you. Him. Have you been?

979
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:03,623
Seeker: Don't believe in gurus.

980
00:52:03,824 --> 00:52:05,820
No? Thank God.

981
00:52:06,654 --> 00:52:08,140
Shri Mataji: But...

982
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,340
Seeker: I practice meditation.

983
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:11,777
Shri Mataji: Your own?

984
00:52:11,977 --> 00:52:14,020
Seeker: No not my own, it's

985
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:15,677
Buddhist meditation.

986
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,295
Shri Mataji: That’s it. That’s just the same.

987
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,740
Just the same, all right?

988
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,602
Ask him to put his right hand 
towards Me and left hand on his stomach.

989
00:52:27,803 --> 00:52:30,525
And say, “Mother, make me my own guru”.

990
00:52:33,581 --> 00:52:36,717
Better now, madam? All right?

991
00:52:37,082 --> 00:52:40,154
Seeker: There is blue light in the Agyna centre.

992
00:52:41,949 --> 00:52:44,856
Shri Mataji: No, that should not be so. It should go away.

993
00:52:45,057 --> 00:52:47,314
All must go away. It’s a horrible thing.

994
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:51,191
You ought to be.

995
00:52:51,391 --> 00:52:54,740
You are to become the light. 
The light does not see the light, does it?

996
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:58,275
You have to become. Not see something.

997
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:01,469
If you see the sky, you don’t become the sky, do you?

998
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,660
But when you are the sky, you don’t see the sky.

999
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:09,787
All right? Now better?

1000
00:53:13,407 --> 00:53:15,249
What about you? Didn’t feel it?

1001
00:53:15,449 --> 00:53:17,178
Don’t be upset about it. Nothing to be

1002
00:53:17,378 --> 00:53:19,363
– you have a liver problem, do you know that.

1003
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:22,060
That’s all. It’s very simple. Now do one thing.

1004
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,140
You put your right hand towards Me

1005
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,218
and left hand on the Mother Earth.

1006
00:53:26,419 --> 00:53:28,488
Just on the backside.

1007
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:31,297
No, that side. Behind your hand.

1008
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:35,375
Yes. It will work out. Now don’t get upset.

1009
00:53:36,211 --> 00:53:39,620
Nobody should be upset. Now those who are not feeling anything,

1010
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,660
please raise your hand. Let’s see.

1011
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,370
Keep your hands raised, all right?

1012
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:53,542
You put both your hands and say, “Mother, is this the

1013
00:53:53,743 --> 00:53:56,753
power of God? Is this the power of Brahma?.

1014
00:53:56,954 --> 00:53:59,018
Is this the Brahmashakti?”.

1015
00:54:13,805 --> 00:54:15,820
Are you feeling, some of you?

1016
00:54:21,232 --> 00:54:22,820
Don’t doubt it, you see.

1017
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,900
It’s a kind of feeling you get in your fingers.

1018
00:54:26,357 --> 00:54:28,514
Raise them higher. Let’s see.

1019
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:34,768
You are all right.

1020
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:40,460
Higher, on your heads.

1021
00:54:45,033 --> 00:54:46,612
It’s there.

1022
00:54:52,336 --> 00:54:54,300
Now, are you feeling it now?

1023
00:54:54,944 --> 00:54:56,940
It’s there. Good.

1024
00:55:00,102 --> 00:55:03,631
Are you feeling? Seeker: Tingling. Tingling.

1025
00:55:03,861 --> 00:55:06,512
Shri Mataji: Tingling? Tingling has to go away a little bit.

1026
00:55:06,729 --> 00:55:10,100
You can put both your hands on the 
Mother Earth. Now let’s see. On the Mother Earth.

1027
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,615
For a while. There’s tingling.

1028
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:45,820
Now just see. Tingling has gone? Raise your hands and see.

1029
00:55:46,121 --> 00:55:48,263
Tingling is gone.

1030
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:56,341
Better?

1031
00:56:34,901 --> 00:56:36,583
It’s better now.

1032
00:56:37,542 --> 00:56:39,894
All right, now bring it down, see.

1033
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,911
Let her sit on the Mother Earth. Is she sitting on the Mother Earth?

1034
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:59,540
Let her put her left hand... left hand on the Mother Earth.

1035
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:01,564
Is she been to some guru?

1036
00:57:01,765 --> 00:57:03,395
Warren: It’s a man.

1037
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:06,197
He’s getting hotter and hotter.

1038
00:57:06,397 --> 00:57:08,160
Have you been to a guru?

1039
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,135
Shri Mataji: Rajneesh?

1040
00:57:11,447 --> 00:57:13,250
Warren: Has he been to a guru?

1041
00:57:15,927 --> 00:57:17,939
An Indian fellow or…?

1042
00:57:18,795 --> 00:57:20,420
Muktananda.

1043
00:57:38,064 --> 00:57:41,238
Shri Mataji: Put your left hand towards 
Me and right hand on the Mother Earth.

1044
00:57:44,289 --> 00:57:47,820
You have to work hard I must tell you, this Muktananda.

1045
00:57:50,896 --> 00:57:53,287
Warren: He had only one visit to the centre, it wasn't by

1046
00:57:53,487 --> 00:57:56,660
-Was it by him, himself or by the people?

1047
00:57:57,922 --> 00:57:59,454
Was it the guru himself?

1048
00:57:59,663 --> 00:58:02,820
Shri Mataji: He also is left 
Swadishthana is so catching, how can that be?

1049
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,974
Warren: Yes, they were affected by him.

1050
00:58:05,174 --> 00:58:07,300
Shri Mataji: Very bad left Swadishthana.

1051
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,180
Better now? Are they cooler?

1052
00:58:11,225 --> 00:58:14,225
Good, good, it’s working out, all right.

1053
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,259
Warren: Even if you go to meetings where

1054
00:58:34,459 --> 00:58:36,367
you don’t get initiated but

1055
00:58:36,567 --> 00:58:38,512
mixing with these people, do you get affected?

1056
00:58:38,713 --> 00:58:42,300
Shri Mataji: Of course. You see, to get dirty is easy, isn’t it?

1057
00:58:42,507 --> 00:58:44,820
But to get holy is difficult.

1058
00:58:45,578 --> 00:58:48,860
Seeker: I've been hot and my hands radiant heat

1059
00:58:49,061 --> 00:58:51,045
and my body has gotten very, very hot.

1060
00:58:51,245 --> 00:58:53,522
Shri Mataji: Why don’t you sit on the Mother Earth?

1061
00:58:54,278 --> 00:58:55,869
She will clear out.

1062
00:58:56,852 --> 00:58:58,993
Shri Mataji: Which meetings you have been to?

1063
00:59:01,449 --> 00:59:03,029
Warren: She visits any.

1064
00:59:05,503 --> 00:59:09,380
Shri Mataji: Let the Mother Earth help you. 
All right, come along on the Mother Earth. Please.

1065
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,538
All right? She will help you. That’s a very good thing.

1066
00:59:12,739 --> 00:59:15,620
Mother Earth, those who are sitting are better helped, here.

1067
00:59:15,882 --> 00:59:17,614
It’s all for that.

1068
00:59:19,543 --> 00:59:22,155
Warren: Anyone who’s not feeling should move on the earth.

1069
00:59:22,356 --> 00:59:25,263
Shri Mataji: She helps. Definitely helps, definitely helps.

1070
00:59:25,464 --> 00:59:27,270
If you are even sitting on this

1071
00:59:27,506 --> 00:59:30,140
impervious material, whatever it is.

1072
00:59:31,722 --> 00:59:33,940
something artificial in those,

1073
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,515
things stuck inside those.

1074
00:59:40,056 --> 00:59:42,190
Warren: And slip your shoes off too.

1075
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,847
Shri Mataji: It’s very pleasant today, isn’t it?

1076
00:59:53,535 --> 00:59:57,464
How is he? Keep his eyes open. All this thing just see this.

1077
00:59:57,782 --> 01:00:00,685
He’s got all this, Hamsa. Keep your eyes open.

1078
01:00:00,886 --> 01:00:04,125
Warren: He’s been to Muktananda and 
he’s got it. But he can’t feel it, unfortunately.

1079
01:00:04,326 --> 01:00:08,094
Shri Mataji: Hamsa, you see. Hamsa 
is there. Hamsa and Vishuddhi both.

1080
01:00:10,279 --> 01:00:12,140
You get it, sinus?

1081
01:00:14,222 --> 01:00:15,904
So only Hamsa.

1082
01:00:16,339 --> 01:00:20,140
All people who have been to gurus put your left 
hand towards Me and right hand on Mother Earth.

1083
01:00:20,341 --> 01:00:22,161
That’s the simple thing as that.

1084
01:00:22,362 --> 01:00:24,495
Let him sit on the Mother Earth. Let him work it out.

1085
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:28,658
Warren: If you have been to a guru and see if it works out.

1086
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:30,359
Shri Mataji: It will improve your,

1087
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,996
always improve your sensitivity. See, better.

1088
01:00:36,796 --> 01:00:39,743
He is a Hamsa fellow, problem with his...

1089
01:00:39,944 --> 01:00:42,559
What are you wearing in your hand? Take it out also.

1090
01:00:42,767 --> 01:00:45,303
Right Vishuddhi. You can take it out for a while.

1091
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,700
You sit on the Mother Earth. All right? It is better.

1092
01:00:50,462 --> 01:00:51,997
It’s good.

1093
01:00:52,721 --> 01:00:55,380
Warren: Anyone having problems, come up to the front here.

1094
01:00:57,855 --> 01:01:01,026
Shri Mataji: On the Mother Earth. 
Mother Earth helps you, the sun helps you,

1095
01:01:01,227 --> 01:01:03,442
the light helps you. Everything helps you.

1096
01:01:03,643 --> 01:01:06,334
All right let’s see. What the problem is now.

1097
01:01:06,723 --> 01:01:10,500
Can you take out the cross for a while, for a while, just for a while?

1098
01:01:12,365 --> 01:01:14,786
If you could. Ha!

1099
01:01:15,726 --> 01:01:17,620
Been to a Muktanand?

1100
01:01:19,085 --> 01:01:21,809
He’s horrible – gives such a bad Vishuddhi and

1101
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:24,393
all this, Ekadasha?

1102
01:01:25,336 --> 01:01:28,649
Keep your eyes open, My child. 
Keep your eyes open. Watch Me, please.

1103
01:01:31,751 --> 01:01:33,540
I will let you know, I'm talking to him.

1104
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:36,555
Right, it’s all right. Don’t you worry. We have clear it out.

1105
01:01:38,138 --> 01:01:39,638
Are you all right?

1106
01:01:40,524 --> 01:01:42,293
Sahaja Yogi: She doesn't feel it, Mother.

1107
01:01:44,171 --> 01:01:45,673
She doesn't what?

1108
01:01:45,874 --> 01:01:47,795
Warren: She has Vishuddhi catching.

1109
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,783
Shri Mataji: She’s been to some guru?

1110
01:02:04,236 --> 01:02:05,736
She will be all right.

1111
01:02:06,046 --> 01:02:07,546
She will be all right.

1112
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:09,459
Whom do you worship?

1113
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:12,241
Whom do you worship? Seeker: Ram, Shri Ram.

1114
01:02:12,442 --> 01:02:14,694
Shri Mataji: All right. Ask her to say the mantra.

1115
01:02:14,895 --> 01:02:17,437
Just let her put her left hand on the heart.

1116
01:02:19,117 --> 01:02:21,048
Right heart. Right heart.

1117
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:23,335
Just ask her, all right.

1118
01:02:23,535 --> 01:02:25,820
It is good. It will work out in no time.

1119
01:02:54,603 --> 01:02:56,323
Just see on her head.

1120
01:03:09,221 --> 01:03:10,721
Good.

1121
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:13,620
The time has come for you to recognise

1122
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:16,620
and get the reward for all your bhakti, isn’t it?

1123
01:03:17,118 --> 01:03:20,098
The time has to come. May God Bless You.

1124
01:03:20,298 --> 01:03:22,380
Indians are very easy to handle. Ask her.

1125
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:24,460
Is she an Indian lady?

1126
01:03:28,001 --> 01:03:29,700
Krishna. All right.

1127
01:03:31,901 --> 01:03:34,100
Good. Better, this will work out.

1128
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,300
Close your eyes now. Enjoy.

1129
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:43,671
Good.

1130
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:47,756
All right?

1131
01:03:50,699 --> 01:03:53,776
We have to get over all these evil forces, isn’t it?

1132
01:03:54,321 --> 01:03:56,807
You have to. Are you all right, My child?

1133
01:03:58,298 --> 01:03:59,870
All right?

1134
01:04:00,406 --> 01:04:02,515
You can come here, on the Mother Earth.

1135
01:04:02,716 --> 01:04:05,284
Anyone who needs help, come along. Come here.

1136
01:04:05,485 --> 01:04:08,605
Warren: She is feeling it too, the 
other lady. She’s from Ceylon. She’s asked,

1137
01:04:08,804 --> 01:04:10,338
“Are you Krishna?”.

1138
01:04:10,503 --> 01:04:12,669
Shri Mataji: All right. Now keep both the hands.

1139
01:04:12,869 --> 01:04:15,860
And you enjoy yourself. Is she, what’s your name please?

1140
01:04:16,684 --> 01:04:18,447
She’s from Ceylon?

1141
01:04:21,469 --> 01:04:23,100
Seeker: Prabha. Shri Mataji: Prabha?

1142
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,353
And the surname? Seeker: Rao.

1143
01:04:25,554 --> 01:04:27,081
Shri Mataji: Prabha Rao. All right.

1144
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:29,270
It will work out in no time.

1145
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:33,470
You put your bag on the ground 
below and put both your hands towards Me.

1146
01:04:35,364 --> 01:04:38,198
It will work out Mrs Rao, yes it's working out.

1147
01:04:38,398 --> 01:04:41,724
Sit down. Yes. Be comfortable. Be comfortable.

1148
01:04:44,153 --> 01:04:47,027
Better? Are you? No, same?

1149
01:04:51,218 --> 01:04:53,486
Seeker: I seem so very tired.

1150
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:57,100
Shri Mataji: It’s horrible, I tell you.

1151
01:04:57,676 --> 01:05:00,351
We have to work it and work it out. It will work out, all right?

1152
01:05:00,551 --> 01:05:02,580
Don’t give up. Patience. It will work out.

1153
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:05,780
Touch your, Mother Earth. Little.

1154
01:05:06,878 --> 01:05:09,878
You have lost your fingers? Seeker: Yes. Shri Mataji: How?

1155
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:11,903
Seeker: From a saw.

1156
01:05:12,585 --> 01:05:14,260
Shri Mataji: Are you?

1157
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:18,033
Put your, all right, no, no.

1158
01:05:18,233 --> 01:05:20,348
Put your left hand on the Mother Earth. Left hand.

1159
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:22,260
Now, what about you My child?

1160
01:05:23,381 --> 01:05:24,998
You feel it and

1161
01:05:25,753 --> 01:05:27,391
goes away, is it?

1162
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:31,714
Put your right hand towards Me. Right hand like that.

1163
01:05:32,858 --> 01:05:34,544
Put it on your, on your lap.

1164
01:05:35,149 --> 01:05:38,259
All right? Comfortably on the Mother Earth.

1165
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:40,220
Be relaxed, yes,

1166
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:42,208
at the back you can put it.

1167
01:05:42,408 --> 01:05:45,620
Just be relaxed, be relaxed. Just, it will work out.

1168
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,385
Gradually it will works out.

1169
01:05:47,585 --> 01:05:50,493
It’s like the power flowing, all right.

1170
01:05:54,028 --> 01:05:55,700
Shri Mataji: Hamsa.

1171
01:05:56,847 --> 01:05:58,355
What is it?

1172
01:05:59,731 --> 01:06:02,540
I couldn’t hear. What is the word he is using?

1173
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,980
In Sanskrit, you are saying something?

1174
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:07,816
I didn’t follow your word. Just ask him.

1175
01:06:08,647 --> 01:06:11,615
What word is he using in Sanskrit language?

1176
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:17,228
Warren: Varashamsa.

1177
01:06:17,429 --> 01:06:21,066
Shri Mataji: Varsamsha is not a 
Sanskrit word, My child. Who’s told you?

1178
01:06:21,502 --> 01:06:23,604
It’s not a Sanskrit word.

1179
01:06:31,272 --> 01:06:34,128
Shri Mataji: No, no, just don’t do any mantras. Don’t chant.

1180
01:06:34,329 --> 01:06:36,290
Don’t chant just now. You have to learn the whole

1181
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:39,270
science about it, all right? Don’t chant.

1182
01:06:41,406 --> 01:06:45,371
Don’t do any chanting of mantras. 
You have to know the whole science of it.

1183
01:06:45,572 --> 01:06:49,107
Don't do it with your closed eyes and closed brains.

1184
01:06:49,307 --> 01:06:51,300
Have to understand why you are doing that.

1185
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,722
Put your hand like this, My child.

1186
01:06:54,156 --> 01:06:55,740
In the blue.

1187
01:06:57,103 --> 01:06:59,201
It works out better this way.

1188
01:07:02,861 --> 01:07:04,361
Better?

1189
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:24,617
Shri Mataji: He has already.

1190
01:07:25,217 --> 01:07:26,721
And then?

1191
01:07:27,066 --> 01:07:28,860
He had it, before?

1192
01:07:29,154 --> 01:07:30,775
What cancer?

1193
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:38,860
You got pain there?

1194
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:42,180
Just watch him. On the Vishuddhi.

1195
01:07:43,243 --> 01:07:47,180
Can you, Warren, look after the gentleman there? It’s all right.

1196
01:07:49,391 --> 01:07:52,180
You see, all these are chakras which are showing.

1197
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:54,864
He has a right Swadishthana.

1198
01:07:55,682 --> 01:07:57,420
What sort of a cancer?

1199
01:07:57,684 --> 01:07:59,684
He’s been to some guru?

1200
01:08:00,211 --> 01:08:02,917
Sahaja Yogi: You been to any guru at all or nothing?

1201
01:08:03,423 --> 01:08:05,956
Shri Mataji: Is it on the right-hand side you have a liver?

1202
01:08:06,157 --> 01:08:07,860
Cirrhosis or something?

1203
01:08:14,793 --> 01:08:16,740
Where do you have?

1204
01:08:17,182 --> 01:08:18,740
In the liver?

1205
01:08:25,804 --> 01:08:27,305
Muscle?

1206
01:08:38,233 --> 01:08:40,500
Put your left up like that.

1207
01:08:41,035 --> 01:08:44,687
Left hand like that, yes, left hand. Right towards Me.

1208
01:08:48,527 --> 01:08:50,220
Can you bring some vibrated water?

1209
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:53,020
Put it on his feet. So the Mother Earth can take away.

1210
01:08:56,246 --> 01:08:58,801
Or ordinary water. Just put it on his feet.

1211
01:09:00,082 --> 01:09:01,820
Are you better now?

1212
01:09:04,526 --> 01:09:06,303
Shri Mataji: There’s no breeze passing.

1213
01:09:06,504 --> 01:09:08,899
Seeker: Only the physical one. Shri Mataji: No, no, not physical.

1214
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:12,930
It will be all right. You just stay, we will
 tell you, if you have got it or not, all right.

1215
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:18,195
Ask this lady to put her hand towards Me like that. This way.

1216
01:09:18,395 --> 01:09:20,260
Towards Me, you have put like this as if

1217
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,984
you are asking for something. This one.

1218
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:26,973
You are all right. You got it.

1219
01:09:27,924 --> 01:09:29,900
Now still those haven’t felt

1220
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,381
any cool breeze, raise your hand, please.

1221
01:09:37,371 --> 01:09:39,193
Warren: This fella has a cancer of the muscle

1222
01:09:39,393 --> 01:09:41,735
on the right space of the right side.

1223
01:09:41,936 --> 01:09:44,540
Shri Mataji: Is he, has he been running too much?

1224
01:09:46,653 --> 01:09:49,820
Now stop all that jogging business! All right.

1225
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:52,202
Everything you do to such an extreme.

1226
01:09:52,402 --> 01:09:54,020
Jogging, sun tanning,

1227
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:56,853
I mean it’s madness. I just don’t understand.

1228
01:09:57,701 --> 01:09:59,467
Going too far with your body.

1229
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:02,980
Then you develop cancer, you develop this problem, that problem.

1230
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:06,420
What is the need to tan yourself to that extent?

1231
01:10:13,838 --> 01:10:16,900
Now give up that jogger of yours, all right.

1232
01:10:25,451 --> 01:10:27,940
Some possessions to do this kind of madness.

1233
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:32,140
Even old people of eighty years are 
jogging – For what? I just don't know.

1234
01:10:37,384 --> 01:10:39,380
They look quite funny, don’t they?

1235
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:44,340
To Me, I don’t know, if you feel that.

1236
01:10:48,002 --> 01:10:50,260
You must accept your age and live with it.

1237
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:52,220
And be decent about it.

1238
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:55,300
The more grown-up you are, the more mature you are.

1239
01:10:58,955 --> 01:11:01,020
We can’t be horses, can we?

1240
01:11:06,386 --> 01:11:09,425
All kinds of fads we accept; we shouldn’t.

1241
01:11:09,626 --> 01:11:11,260
It’s not sensible.

1242
01:11:13,014 --> 01:11:14,820
No common sense in that.

1243
01:11:15,098 --> 01:11:17,540
Better. Are you better sir?

1244
01:11:18,513 --> 01:11:20,300
Muktananda is it?

1245
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,460
Did…Muktananda?

1246
01:11:23,917 --> 01:11:26,187
You know how much money he’s got now?

1247
01:11:26,573 --> 01:11:28,258
He’s got

1248
01:11:28,702 --> 01:11:31,463
sixty thousand – he’s dead now, thank God.

1249
01:11:31,663 --> 01:11:33,889
Sixty thousand

1250
01:11:36,635 --> 01:11:39,053
crores. I don’t know if you understand crores.

1251
01:11:39,254 --> 01:11:42,054
Warren: Six billion. Six thousand million.

1252
01:11:42,273 --> 01:11:45,300
Shri Mataji: Six thousand million worth of

1253
01:11:46,031 --> 01:11:49,362
diamonds he’s got. And both the disciples are fighting now.

1254
01:11:49,616 --> 01:11:52,352
Must have also contributed to that.

1255
01:12:00,085 --> 01:12:02,791
Are you all right? Better, Mrs Rao?

1256
01:12:03,345 --> 01:12:05,427
Mrs Rao: I haven't so much tingling now.

1257
01:12:05,628 --> 01:12:07,540
Shri Mataji: No, it’s better. It is passing.

1258
01:12:07,748 --> 01:12:10,131
It will work out. You see, gradually it will works out.

1259
01:12:10,331 --> 01:12:13,420
Have patience in yourself. You's better, aren’t you?

1260
01:12:15,573 --> 01:12:17,260
Put on your hand, head.

1261
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:19,740
Left, Left hand. Just see

1262
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:21,440
if there’s a cool breeze.

1263
01:12:21,641 --> 01:12:24,841
Warren: Don’t look. Just put your attention there.

1264
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:29,511
Shri Mataji: All right?

1265
01:12:31,731 --> 01:12:34,454
It will work out. How are you? Are you better? Good.

1266
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:37,346
Be peaceful. First thing you feel is peaceful.

1267
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:39,604
You feel your peace within yourself.

1268
01:12:42,823 --> 01:12:45,491
Now if the people who haven’t got it;

1269
01:12:47,532 --> 01:12:49,572
if you raise your hands.

1270
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,529
Can you attend to them, some of the Sahaja Yogis?

1271
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:58,101
Where are the Sahaja Yogis now?

1272
01:12:58,302 --> 01:13:01,203
Can you attend to the people who haven’t got it there? One or two.

1273
01:13:01,403 --> 01:13:03,580
Please keep your hands raised, all right.

1274
01:13:05,228 --> 01:13:08,220
This lady hasn’t got it yet? What’s the problem with this one?

1275
01:13:08,421 --> 01:13:12,421
What’s the problem? Are you keeping 
all right, your health is all right, My child?

1276
01:13:12,766 --> 01:13:14,269
What’s the problem?

1277
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:17,441
Come here.

1278
01:13:22,496 --> 01:13:25,070
You fell down? Seeker: No, motor car accident.

1279
01:13:26,225 --> 01:13:28,476
Warren: Motor car accident. Shri Mataji: Ah, that’s why.

1280
01:13:28,677 --> 01:13:30,967
Seeker: Also I am on medication of lithium. Shri Mataji: Medication?

1281
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:33,147
Seeker: Of lithium. Warren: Lithium.

1282
01:13:33,931 --> 01:13:35,700
She’s an alcoholic. Are you an alcoholic?

1283
01:13:35,901 --> 01:13:37,020
Seeker: No. Oh yeah.

1284
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:39,260
Warren: A bit of everything drugs, alcohol. The whole thing.

1285
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:41,848
She’s addicted, Mother.

1286
01:13:42,144 --> 01:13:44,260
Shri Mataji: All right. Sit down. Turn around.

1287
01:13:45,108 --> 01:13:47,005
All right? Now put your,

1288
01:13:48,145 --> 01:13:49,890
take your feet

1289
01:13:50,091 --> 01:13:52,931
that side and sit on the ground. Can you?

1290
01:13:53,131 --> 01:13:55,437
Or can you give her a seat or something to sit down?

1291
01:13:55,637 --> 01:13:57,260
It’s all right? Can you?

1292
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:03,900
It’s terrible.

1293
01:14:08,161 --> 01:14:10,672
It’s all right, but it’s working out.

1294
01:14:11,659 --> 01:14:13,159
Warren: The right side.

1295
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,383
Shri Mataji: I know, it is the right side.

1296
01:14:19,465 --> 01:14:20,965
Yes, my child?

1297
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:23,632
Seeker: My hands are warm on the inside, cold on the outside.

1298
01:14:25,656 --> 01:14:27,820
Shri Mataji: All right. Now put it up like that.

1299
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:30,184
Just take it out like that, you see.

1300
01:14:30,385 --> 01:14:33,260
No, no, no… Warren: Up, up and down.

1301
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,969
Up and down.

1302
01:14:38,271 --> 01:14:41,475
Shri Mataji: Some people haven’t got 
as yet attended? Ask somebody else?

1303
01:14:41,675 --> 01:14:43,500
Some of the girls can come out.

1304
01:14:54,302 --> 01:14:56,890
Have they made the rice alright? Warren: I don’t know Mother.

1305
01:14:57,091 --> 01:14:58,940
Shri Mataji: Did they prepared the rice.

1306
01:15:00,484 --> 01:15:02,700
Have you got some plates and things?

1307
01:15:03,853 --> 01:15:06,845
This lady hasn’t been attended to, just see. Warren: Which one?

1308
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:08,824
Shri Mataji: This one, there.

1309
01:15:20,464 --> 01:15:21,984
Shri Mataji: Veins?

1310
01:15:24,366 --> 01:15:26,778
I will work it out. All right. Don't you worry.

1311
01:15:26,979 --> 01:15:28,672
Seeker: It doesn’t really worry me.

1312
01:15:30,892 --> 01:15:33,425
Shri Mataji: It worries Me.

1313
01:15:35,086 --> 01:15:37,002
Better now My child?

1314
01:15:37,202 --> 01:15:38,984
Still the pain?

1315
01:15:52,241 --> 01:15:55,099
Shri Mataji: Still taking a lot of these drugs are you?

1316
01:15:56,929 --> 01:15:59,666
Sahaja Yogi: The lady is coming in forty minutes at the most.

1317
01:16:00,047 --> 01:16:01,643
Forty minutes?

1318
01:16:01,844 --> 01:16:04,260
Shri Mataji: To put the rice? Sahaja Yogi: Rice is on, yeah.

1319
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:07,100
Shri Mataji: And what I have given should be put in a…,

1320
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:11,140
should be put in a little... It is all right if the rice is very hot.

1321
01:16:11,489 --> 01:16:14,412
Rice is ready? Sahaja Yogi: Nearly ready.

1322
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,220
Shri Mataji: But see that it is cooked well, otherwise…

1323
01:16:17,452 --> 01:16:19,898
Ask Bill to look at it.

1324
01:16:20,098 --> 01:16:23,420
Ask him to cook it well. See that’s very important.

1325
01:16:50,132 --> 01:16:51,660
It’s here.

1326
01:16:59,171 --> 01:17:02,445
Now give up all that. Give up all the drugs. You can.

1327
01:17:02,645 --> 01:17:04,429
Have you reduced it now?

1328
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:06,263
Since you met Me?

1329
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:10,620
All right. You can give up overnight. Just put a little bit power.

1330
01:17:13,851 --> 01:17:16,140
Right side is your willpower.

1331
01:17:18,332 --> 01:17:20,298
Which is out of gear.

1332
01:17:23,351 --> 01:17:26,820
How is this lady? Ask her to open her eyes.

1333
01:17:27,451 --> 01:17:30,188
It’s on the Vishuddhi, what the problem is.

1334
01:17:31,062 --> 01:17:33,896
Ask her to take out the cross for a while. Rosary.

1335
01:17:34,112 --> 01:17:35,860
Just for a while.

1336
01:17:40,795 --> 01:17:42,580
All you all right, My child?

1337
01:17:43,015 --> 01:17:46,014
Better? Did you feel? No?

1338
01:17:46,427 --> 01:17:49,090
Now we should see. You should feel it, why not?

1339
01:17:49,814 --> 01:17:51,900
What’s that? Are you better?

1340
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:54,599
No.

1341
01:17:58,085 --> 01:18:01,300
I will see. All right? Are you better?

1342
01:18:01,792 --> 01:18:04,492
Yeah. Yes.

1343
01:18:07,388 --> 01:18:09,020
Are you all right?

1344
01:18:10,315 --> 01:18:12,380
All right, I will see.

1345
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:18,980
This is the place. All right?

1346
01:18:19,619 --> 01:18:22,420
It’s your willpower. It’s finished.

1347
01:18:23,535 --> 01:18:25,458
Now you must have a willpower

1348
01:18:25,658 --> 01:18:27,640
because you have to live more

1349
01:18:28,297 --> 01:18:30,037
and you have to enjoy your spirit

1350
01:18:30,245 --> 01:18:32,753
and you have to give it to others, the enjoyment, all right?

1351
01:18:32,954 --> 01:18:35,054
You have a purpose now.

1352
01:18:48,829 --> 01:18:51,966
Right to the left. Right to the left.

1353
01:18:54,546 --> 01:18:56,420
No, you are all right. I will work that out.

1354
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:58,359
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

1355
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,378
It’s all right, put your hand on the sciatica on the back.

1356
01:19:01,579 --> 01:19:04,802
Ah, that’s all. You can put your 
hand towards Me. You can do it yourself.

1357
01:19:05,003 --> 01:19:06,695
You can cure yourself.

1358
01:19:06,896 --> 01:19:09,140
Yes, of course, you can.

1359
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:12,408
That’s the minimum.

1360
01:19:12,608 --> 01:19:14,220
Are you all right?

1361
01:19:14,648 --> 01:19:16,590
Just don’t go into thinking just,

1362
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:18,340
be alert.

1363
01:19:19,173 --> 01:19:20,673
Be alert.

1364
01:19:20,874 --> 01:19:24,222
Seeker: Mother, I think I am starting to feel the cool breeze.

1365
01:19:25,059 --> 01:19:29,059
Old drugs when I was in my teens, you see taking drugs.

1366
01:19:29,269 --> 01:19:31,715
Shri Mataji: It’s all right. Everything will be cleared.

1367
01:19:31,916 --> 01:19:33,580
It’s like a flood.

1368
01:19:35,628 --> 01:19:38,300
Don’t worry. Don’t worry about your past.

1369
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,260
Just don’t worry.

1370
01:19:41,453 --> 01:19:43,401
That doesn’t exist for Me.

1371
01:19:43,601 --> 01:19:45,580
You just go on thinking about

1372
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:48,300
what wrong you have done. Forget it.

1373
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:51,785
I told you a hundred times to forget it. Let Me look after you.

1374
01:20:00,446 --> 01:20:03,409
Actually, I don’t want to know about it. All right?

1375
01:20:05,494 --> 01:20:09,202
But some were still very worried, so I said write to Me.

1376
01:20:09,535 --> 01:20:11,513
They wrote and I never read them.

1377
01:20:11,714 --> 01:20:13,344
Burnt them off.

1378
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,460
What to do? How to convince them that…

1379
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:28,936
Seeker: What can I do for my high blood pressure?

1380
01:20:29,617 --> 01:20:33,540
Shri Mataji: No, no that will be automatically 
taken over. Don’t you worry. You will be all right.

1381
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:35,460
Blood pressure takes no time.

1382
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:37,816
Are you better My child now?

1383
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,780
All right?

1384
01:21:13,115 --> 01:21:14,615
What’s it?

1385
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,740
Warren: She's been to Muktananda. Why don't you just say,

1386
01:21:17,947 --> 01:21:20,980
“Please forgive me Mother, for going 
to him and give me my Self-realisation”.

1387
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:24,135
and straight away she felt it. 
Shri Mataji: Really? Let's, better try.

1388
01:21:24,335 --> 01:21:26,300
Say that. Come along, let’s see.

1389
01:21:26,561 --> 01:21:29,961
Mother, forgive me, all right. Tell them. These two.

1390
01:22:06,519 --> 01:22:08,019
Better?

1391
01:22:08,710 --> 01:22:10,288
Seeker: Don’t know.

1392
01:22:10,489 --> 01:22:12,460
Shri Mataji: Touch your hand yourself.

1393
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:16,927
No, see the pain.

1394
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:21,340
Still there? Where?

1395
01:22:21,541 --> 01:22:23,638
Wherever is the pain you put your hand.

1396
01:22:25,128 --> 01:22:27,020
Just you put your hand.

1397
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,500
Better now?

1398
01:22:38,498 --> 01:22:41,180
You have got every kind of a drug in your body, is it?

1399
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:43,180
Left, right both sides.

1400
01:22:48,622 --> 01:22:51,820
They are so particular in customs; we saw.

1401
01:22:52,918 --> 01:22:54,740
Went round every

1402
01:22:55,689 --> 01:22:59,380
bit of it, even pencils and the

1403
01:23:00,222 --> 01:23:04,221
even the fountain pens they opened out to see the drugs.

1404
01:23:04,421 --> 01:23:06,309
I don’t know how they penetrate.

1405
01:23:06,509 --> 01:23:09,120
Yes, despite all that effort.

1406
01:23:13,017 --> 01:23:16,140
You must help the police to find them out. Really.

1407
01:23:19,466 --> 01:23:21,660
These are all anti-God things.

1408
01:23:23,572 --> 01:23:25,605
Yes, I came out because

1409
01:23:25,805 --> 01:23:27,507
I have a diplomatic passport.

1410
01:23:27,707 --> 01:23:30,851
They didn’t bother Me at all. But these people were held up for

1411
01:23:31,051 --> 01:23:33,798
about an hour. They went thoroughly into everything.

1412
01:23:33,998 --> 01:23:37,291
Every bit of it, you see. Even a pencil, even a

1413
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:41,660
sharpener every bit of it was opened out completely by them.

1414
01:23:45,369 --> 01:23:47,380
Such a thorough examination.

1415
01:23:49,377 --> 01:23:50,877
Better now?

1416
01:23:52,666 --> 01:23:54,380
Ask for forgiveness.

1417
01:23:54,839 --> 01:23:56,580
You too ask for forgiveness.

1418
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:58,865
For going to this horrible fellow.

1419
01:23:59,066 --> 01:24:01,540
Take a chair. I think you will be better off.

1420
01:24:03,546 --> 01:24:05,540
Are you all right now, My child?

1421
01:24:23,237 --> 01:24:25,627
You're all right, I think you are better now?

1422
01:24:26,534 --> 01:24:28,934
May God Bless You. Let’s see.

1423
01:24:29,134 --> 01:24:31,642
May God Bless You. Now see if you feel the cool breeze.

1424
01:24:31,842 --> 01:24:33,842
It is looking better.

1425
01:24:35,233 --> 01:24:37,633
Now, who else? Sciatica. Come along.

1426
01:24:40,878 --> 01:24:42,380
Turn around.

1427
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:44,940
Left side?

1428
01:24:45,201 --> 01:24:47,701
More on the left hand? Seeker: It's on the left, yes.

1429
01:24:47,902 --> 01:24:50,729
Shri Mataji: All right, just sit down with your stretched legs here.

1430
01:24:50,930 --> 01:24:52,980
Stretch your legs fully.

1431
01:24:54,427 --> 01:24:56,860
Let’s see. It's here.

1432
01:24:58,709 --> 01:25:01,740
I have done medicine for the same reason.

1433
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:03,659
All right?

1434
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:06,140
To know the names, what you call them.

1435
01:25:08,598 --> 01:25:11,205
How, how are you, My child? Felt it?

1436
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:12,906
Good.

1437
01:25:33,985 --> 01:25:35,500
Are you all right?

1438
01:25:36,217 --> 01:25:39,087
Nothing much. What is you feel the

1439
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:42,860
You feel the pull in the muscle?

1440
01:25:45,153 --> 01:25:46,653
I see.

1441
01:25:47,416 --> 01:25:49,006
You are better.

1442
01:25:50,042 --> 01:25:52,853
Isn’t it? It is flowing down there.

1443
01:26:03,225 --> 01:26:06,251
Good. But don’t do too strenuous exercise, all right.

1444
01:26:06,451 --> 01:26:09,900
Try to avoid for the time being. You can walk at the most.

1445
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,885
Be careful When you have your bath especially.

1446
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:14,700
Just wipe out yourself well.

1447
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:17,515
All right, that is the thing – you leave yourself open

1448
01:26:17,715 --> 01:26:19,660
and you catch this as a cold thing.

1449
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:21,887
It is melting. It is all right.

1450
01:26:24,735 --> 01:26:26,264
What’s the matter?

1451
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:29,780
Is she all right?

1452
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:33,653
Sahaja Yogi: Liver. Shri Mataji: Got a liver?

1453
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:37,540
Come on the Mother Earth. The best to cure your liver all right?

1454
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:41,420
Just sit on Her, put your left hand

1455
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:43,940
on the right side of your stomach.

1456
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:47,252
Lower, little lower, little lower. Just a little higher.

1457
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:49,347
Little high. Under the ribs.

1458
01:26:49,547 --> 01:26:51,860
All right. Now push it hard and put your hand

1459
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:53,931
on the Mother Earth. Right hand.

1460
01:26:56,983 --> 01:26:58,940
You've cleared out.

1461
01:26:59,243 --> 01:27:02,111
All right? Cleared out. May God Bless You.

1462
01:27:02,502 --> 01:27:05,902
So sweet of you. Thank you very 
much. Thank you. Are you going now?

1463
01:27:06,103 --> 01:27:08,502
Seeker: This is my friend. Can you do something for her at home?

1464
01:27:08,729 --> 01:27:11,899
Shri Mataji: Whom? She’s all right now. She’s all right.

1465
01:27:12,099 --> 01:27:15,188
Yeah, she’s all right. May God Bless You. Thank you very much.

1466
01:27:18,812 --> 01:27:21,345
Seeker: I'm in a lot of pain with my back at moment?

1467
01:27:21,698 --> 01:27:23,229
Shri Mataji: So what do you want?

1468
01:27:23,907 --> 01:27:25,420
All right. Come along.

1469
01:27:25,862 --> 01:27:27,380
What do you do?

1470
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:30,016
Seeker: I'm in the bank. And I have traction once a week.

1471
01:27:30,217 --> 01:27:32,402
I've had that... twisted spine.

1472
01:27:32,605 --> 01:27:35,167
Shri Mataji: All right. Now put your hand towards Me. Right one.

1473
01:27:35,368 --> 01:27:37,232
Put this one on the stomach.

1474
01:27:37,433 --> 01:27:39,264
Lower. Little bit.

1475
01:27:40,392 --> 01:27:43,840
You just say, “Mother, are you the source of all the banks?”.

1476
01:27:45,334 --> 01:27:46,852
Shri Mataji: Again.

1477
01:27:47,889 --> 01:27:49,391
Again.

1478
01:28:01,631 --> 01:28:03,940
All right? It’s working out.

1479
01:28:05,506 --> 01:28:08,412
And the pain? All right. Come along, turn round.

1480
01:28:08,613 --> 01:28:10,113
Sit down.

1481
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:16,768
You see, in the bank, we are just cashiers aren’t we?

1482
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,593
We don’t do anything.

1483
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:21,559
We don’t own it, do we? Seeker: Exactly.

1484
01:28:25,441 --> 01:28:28,528
Shri Mataji: Did you fix his right Vishuddhi?

1485
01:28:28,729 --> 01:28:30,657
Warren: Which one, Mother? Shri Mataji: This gentleman.

1486
01:28:30,857 --> 01:28:32,900
Warren: He’s got a total spine problem.

1487
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:35,380
From top to bottom. And I…

1488
01:28:38,025 --> 01:28:41,180
he’s a major problem from early,

1489
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:43,904
what is it, curvature?

1490
01:28:45,281 --> 01:28:47,822
Shri Mataji: Can you go forward a little bit?

1491
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:51,802
It’s left Swadishthana. Have you been to anyone like that?

1492
01:28:52,217 --> 01:28:54,005
Seeker: Nah, nah nothing like that, no.

1493
01:28:54,206 --> 01:28:56,770
Warren: Who have you been to? Any spiritual seeking?

1494
01:28:57,195 --> 01:29:00,720
Warren:  No. But who, what sort of seeking?

1495
01:29:00,921 --> 01:29:04,080
Seeker: I am a Catholic. 
Warren: You're Catholic. He is Catholic.

1496
01:29:04,409 --> 01:29:07,311
Shri Mataji: All right, let him ask 
the question of the Holy Ghost then.

1497
01:29:08,041 --> 01:29:10,180
Warren: Turn around and face Mother.

1498
01:29:12,379 --> 01:29:14,220
Shri Mataji: Put your left hand towards Me.

1499
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:18,340
And right hand on the Mother Earth. 
On Mother Earth. Now ask a question.

1500
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:20,420
Warren: Ask the question – “Mother, are you

1501
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:22,571
incarnation of the Holy Ghost?”.

1502
01:29:24,713 --> 01:29:27,380
Seeker: Are you incarnation of the Holy Ghost?

1503
01:29:36,476 --> 01:29:38,745
Seems like cool, cool breeze.

1504
01:29:40,433 --> 01:29:44,433
Shri Mataji: Ask the question, 
“Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”.

1505
01:29:52,405 --> 01:29:56,128
Shri Mataji: All right. It’s more physical. Just turn around.

1506
01:29:57,809 --> 01:30:00,540
Warren: Did you feel that cool? Shri Mataji: Yes he did.

1507
01:30:02,215 --> 01:30:05,900
Just move further. All Nabhi, see catching.

1508
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:09,340
He’s got it on the Nabhi. It's a very bad Nabhi.

1509
01:30:10,026 --> 01:30:11,747
Now, what have you got?

1510
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:18,460
To begin with, this?

1511
01:30:18,661 --> 01:30:21,057
Warren: Left swadhisthan the Nabhi is there.

1512
01:30:21,758 --> 01:30:23,540
This little boy’s got,

1513
01:30:23,911 --> 01:30:25,911
Shri Mataji: What’s it? Warren: - Diabetes.

1514
01:30:26,057 --> 01:30:27,980
Shri Mataji: What this, Diabetes? Come along.

1515
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:29,680
Come here.

1516
01:30:30,122 --> 01:30:33,547
Take out their shoes. Please take out their shoes. Both?

1517
01:30:36,247 --> 01:30:38,500
Shri Mataji: Take out your shoes, please.

1518
01:30:45,465 --> 01:30:47,657
Very bad Nabhi he has got.

1519
01:30:50,554 --> 01:30:53,421
Warren: Sit down, just sit down. That’s it.

1520
01:30:54,027 --> 01:30:55,527
Shri Mataji: Let me see.

1521
01:30:57,655 --> 01:30:59,522
No, towards Me.

1522
01:30:59,723 --> 01:31:01,460
Warren: Turn your tummy towards…

1523
01:31:02,925 --> 01:31:05,000
A bit closer still, bit closer.

1524
01:31:27,757 --> 01:31:29,620
Shri Mataji: Did you feel the cool breeze,

1525
01:31:29,866 --> 01:31:31,423
these two ladies?

1526
01:31:34,697 --> 01:31:36,197
Good.

1527
01:31:56,203 --> 01:31:58,179
Did you feel the cool breeze yourself?

1528
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:00,460
Good now. Are you feeling peaceful now?

1529
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:02,161
Better.

1530
01:32:02,461 --> 01:32:05,904
Put your right hand on the spleen yourself.

1531
01:32:10,956 --> 01:32:13,500
Shri Mataji: She’s more on the spleen, he’s more on the

1532
01:32:13,766 --> 01:32:15,260
pancreas.

1533
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:18,100
Warren: She’s on the spleen, he is on the pancreas.

1534
01:32:22,031 --> 01:32:24,231
Shri Mataji: Better sir? Are you?

1535
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:26,180
Warren: Is it easing?

1536
01:32:30,648 --> 01:32:33,900
Shri Mataji: First of all, to ease out this centre is very bad you see,

1537
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:35,600
than that one.

1538
01:32:38,548 --> 01:32:41,180
Now push back, My foot.

1539
01:32:43,535 --> 01:32:45,035
That’s good.

1540
01:32:52,154 --> 01:32:54,597
Well feeling hot there? Seeker: Yes.

1541
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:56,717
Shri Mataji: Little hot? Seeker: Yes.

1542
01:33:05,541 --> 01:33:08,226
Shri Mataji: How are you feeling now, this lady?

1543
01:33:08,426 --> 01:33:11,100
Are you feeling better now? Good, good.

1544
01:33:11,995 --> 01:33:13,751
Better. And in the hands?

1545
01:33:13,952 --> 01:33:15,452
Seeker: I am still very hot.

1546
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:19,023
Shri Mataji: Now what you do is put left hand like that.

1547
01:33:36,464 --> 01:33:38,106
Is she better? She’s all right.

1548
01:33:38,306 --> 01:33:40,399
She’s all right. She’s very good I should say.

1549
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:41,751
Warren: Clearing nicely.

1550
01:33:41,952 --> 01:33:44,276
Shri Mataji: You must get her some 
olive oil or something to put in the head.

1551
01:33:44,477 --> 01:33:47,752
Warren: But she’s having acupuncture 
at the moment, Mother. She should stop it.

1552
01:33:55,695 --> 01:33:57,195
Shri Mataji: No need.

1553
01:33:59,154 --> 01:34:00,667
Acupuncture.

1554
01:34:02,088 --> 01:34:03,679
You did too?

1555
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:05,238
Seeker: Four times.

1556
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:07,388
Shri Mataji: Oh God! Are you all right now?

1557
01:34:07,584 --> 01:34:09,472
Seeker: I've just finished now I suppose.

1558
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,925
Shri Mataji: Better now my child? Seeker: It is easing now.

1559
01:34:22,097 --> 01:34:25,580
Shri Mataji: Easing now, it is out.
 It has to melt away. How are you?

1560
01:34:26,551 --> 01:34:28,051
Terrible.

1561
01:34:31,024 --> 01:34:33,988
Warren: Is it always on the left side?

1562
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,252
Warren: Left Swadishthan.

1563
01:34:36,453 --> 01:34:39,393
Shri Mataji: Is there any Sahaja Yogi here? Available?

1564
01:34:39,594 --> 01:34:40,881
Warren: Who would you like Mother?

1565
01:34:41,082 --> 01:34:43,490
Shri Mataji: Anyone. Get some ice for Me.

1566
01:34:53,905 --> 01:34:55,780
He’s better now.

1567
01:34:57,018 --> 01:34:58,603
Warren: It's good to clear him.

1568
01:35:16,757 --> 01:35:19,765
Shri Mataji: Right heart. What about your father?

1569
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:28,939
Warren: Where is he, is he alive or? But he's incapacitated?

1570
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:32,743
He was in an accident nine years ago but is he well otherwise?

1571
01:35:33,186 --> 01:35:35,168
How is your relationship with him?

1572
01:35:45,042 --> 01:35:47,804
Shri Mataji: Where is that? Have you kept the masala?

1573
01:35:48,005 --> 01:35:50,405
Sahaja Yogini: Masala? I don’t know.

1574
01:35:55,345 --> 01:35:57,506
Sahaja Yogini: Garam masala?

1575
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:18,611
Sahaja Yogini: Cut that fast and into smaller pieces.

1576
01:36:25,728 --> 01:36:27,454
Shri Mataji: Where is it?

1577
01:36:38,330 --> 01:36:40,339
This is My profession. I live by that.

1578
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:42,815
That’s how I earn My living.

1579
01:37:04,608 --> 01:37:06,999
This will bring about the whole thing.

1580
01:37:34,879 --> 01:37:37,612
Hold it with the whole hand.

1581
01:38:23,946 --> 01:38:25,973
Cumin seeds must be jeera.

1582
01:38:37,111 --> 01:38:41,111
This can be done in the blender? 
Can you make smaller pieces in the blender?

1583
01:38:58,594 --> 01:39:01,220
They are very nice some of these plates aren't they.

1584
01:39:03,279 --> 01:39:06,606
They are old, aren’t they? You can’t get these nowadays.

1585
01:39:15,151 --> 01:39:17,019
Cardamom powder?

1586
01:39:50,977 --> 01:39:53,742
I am sorry we are using quite a lot of this.

1587
01:41:01,263 --> 01:41:03,196
Shri Mataji: Are you sure this is saffron?

1588
01:41:03,722 --> 01:41:07,376
Yogini: It's saffron, Mother but 
I don’t think, I think it’s imitation.

1589
01:41:08,471 --> 01:41:10,024
Shri Mataji: Salt?

1590
01:41:20,295 --> 01:41:21,984
It's the colour?

1591
01:41:32,701 --> 01:41:36,100
We can use it just to make the colour.

1592
01:41:39,668 --> 01:41:41,465
They have written it is artificial.

1593
01:41:41,666 --> 01:41:42,686
Yoginis: Yes, yes.

1594
01:41:42,823 --> 01:41:45,580
Shri Mataji: But the thing is, if it would have been real

1595
01:41:45,851 --> 01:41:48,260
it would have been better because

1596
01:41:48,460 --> 01:41:51,256
this gives the colour you see. Saffron.
