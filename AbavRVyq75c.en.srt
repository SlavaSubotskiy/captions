2
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:40,710
the word guru comes from the one which

3
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:47,260
is magnetic the person who is magnetic

4
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:55,719
the one it attracts the attention of the

5
00:00:47,260 --> 00:01:04,259
seekers is the Guru also it means the

6
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:13,420
heaviness or you can say a person who is

7
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:20,259
very steady who is very deep who has the

8
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:27,149
knowledge and who can act like the

9
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:33,000
mother earth for the power of magnetism

10
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:36,700
in the mother earth also is called as

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:46,420
magnetic but in sanskrit is guru to

12
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:50,409
occur sure means the attraction of the

13
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:58,600
heaviness of the mother but actually it

14
00:01:50,409 --> 00:02:04,859
is a power of the mother earth that

15
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:09,369
makes us stand for he on our legs when

16
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:14,410
it is rotating with such a tremendous

17
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:18,040
speed otherwise he would be all thrown

18
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:25,209
away with that velocity that she is

19
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:33,190
moving we are still attached or we are

20
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:33,950
one in our balance is only because she

21
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:43,030
has

22
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:54,370
gravity this gravity has to be in a guru

23
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:54,370
gravity means a kind of a serious

24
00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:07,310
understanding of oneself and one's own

25
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:14,060
responsibilities so a guru has to be

26
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:21,920
very steady in these modern times people

27
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:28,340
are very mobile all the time as you take

28
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:30,230
it all the time getting disturbed small

29
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:36,319
things happening here and there they get

30
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:41,410
it they meet people who are not of any

31
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:47,139
quality then they get disturbed these

32
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:51,859
disturbing qualities come from our

33
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:54,760
deficiency in our gravity a person who

34
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:59,630
has gravity does not get depressed

35
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:03,200
neither get excited not get overly

36
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:08,030
enthusiastic not easy

37
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:14,120
very sad or unhappy so he is in the

38
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:17,060
center he is in the center of his be the

39
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:23,950
most level we think a good guru is that

40
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:23,950
person who

41
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:50,020
just attraction towards themselves body

42
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:50,020
language or maybe other attractions

43
00:04:52,480 --> 00:05:04,840
which are gross and that's why people

44
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:04,840
always go to the Guru's who are false

45
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:18,770
who are superficial but the one who is

46
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:27,110
above the gravity of the mother earth

47
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:31,810
the gross the subtle the subtle subtler

48
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:38,140
in the subtlest beyond all these

49
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:44,720
attractions that is the one is the Guru

50
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:49,960
where is your attention is important if

51
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,960
you are the Guru wearing your attention

52
00:05:51,310 --> 00:06:02,210
if your attention is on the correction

53
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:05,780
and the nourishment of yourself are no

54
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:08,290
further then you are first of all the

55
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,290
sahaja yogi

56
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:22,950
and once you rise above the

57
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:28,380
gravitational force of materialism then

58
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:31,740
you could be called as the good you do

59
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:34,650
not need education for that in your city

60
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:40,260
education you need not read books you

61
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:43,020
need not do anything only thing is that

62
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:47,370
you have to have your value system

63
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:49,710
correctly in your value system you have

64
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:58,670
to first of all understand what is

65
00:06:49,710 --> 00:07:05,070
auspiciousness what is divine beauty and

66
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:09,180
what is morality of the Spirit these

67
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:12,860
fittings are to be alive and how to be

68
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:15,660
part and parcel of your being so that

69
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:19,380
when people see you they should say it

70
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:23,520
here is a person you can see who has

71
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:27,570
that gravity here is the person who has

72
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:30,750
that you then he talks to others he

73
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:31,730
talks with them he doesn't talk to

74
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:39,860
frivolous things

75
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:43,580
useless things I think which are of very

76
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,580
basic level

77
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:57,480
in an all enter crisis I would say he

78
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:01,030
has a kind of a decency and a decoder so

79
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:04,600
not that the Guru himself has the value

80
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:09,160
system but through his lifestyle through

81
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:16,020
his own teachings through his own

82
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:18,430
behavior he radiates gravity plus dvdx

83
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,140
grammatical so either none of this

84
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:25,960
gravity

85
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:28,540
Evette discrimination let you know what

86
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,240
is your personality and what is the

87
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:35,530
water barometer you know how to

88
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:39,160
discriminate and this discrimination is

89
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:44,320
also actually innately comes from your

90
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:46,900
guru person now and then I suppose you

91
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,070
have constable you have come out of here

92
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:55,570
so that yeah transcendence all those

93
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:57,430
things through your amun-re but that

94
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:05,350
does not mean that you have developed

95
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:11,560
that gravity you have now achieved a

96
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:14,500
state if a flower is there and you push

97
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,560
it put the flower on the water it will

98
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,560
float

99
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:24,690
but when it becomes the fruit and

100
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:27,200
matures then you put it in the water it

101
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:30,780
does not feel it goes tick-tock

102
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:35,880
it does not get dissolved it keeps its

103
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:38,550
own identity that is what is to be done

104
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:44,070
now that you have to become the fruits

105
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:49,610
of reading now all of you can become

106
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:54,030
gurus every one of you can become goose

107
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:56,670
and can develop that great capacity to

108
00:09:54,030 --> 00:10:05,130
be being one with that cosmic

109
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:09,200
consciousness completely out of the

110
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,200
clutches of the gravity of the earth

111
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:21,210
materialism without achieving that you

112
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:27,630
have no right to tell it anybody what is

113
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:30,840
to be done first it should be your

114
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:36,810
practice and preserve it in your own

115
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:39,590
life in your own example and then your

116
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:43,050
example is sufficient to convince others

117
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:45,510
and this is what they have to see if we

118
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:49,650
can develop that gravity within our

119
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:58,310
sense and understanding within okay well

120
00:10:49,650 --> 00:11:01,290
happy resides within you the joy of

121
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:04,440
becoming sahaja Yogi's will be really

122
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:09,150
effect will be really understood and

123
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:11,630
will be enjoyed by all of it may God

124
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,630
bless you

125
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:39,809
[Music]

126
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,910
you
