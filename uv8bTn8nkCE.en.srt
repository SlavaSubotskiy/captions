1
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,677
Hindi

2
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:35,885
I am sorry I was delayed.

3
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:38,955
We were supposed to see the Collector and the

4
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:41,475
Tahsildar, as they call him.

5
00:05:41,715 --> 00:05:44,875
They have done so much for us; so much they have organized,

6
00:05:45,075 --> 00:05:48,995
all the way, and officially they have done so well,

7
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:53,955
that I had to wait for them to thank them very much.

8
00:05:54,995 --> 00:05:58,155
I think

9
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:01,875
it's not very much hot for you, see the

10
00:06:02,115 --> 00:06:05,915
wind is blowing, can you imagine.

11
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:15,035
And if you see, there's no, no leaves, leaves are not moving.

12
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:27,955
You always used to go and sit in the sun,

13
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:32,675
so now here it is, you'd better have some of it.

14
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:37,595
I hope you all enjoyed your stay in Jabalpur

15
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,395
and the visit to Jabalpur.

16
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:44,475
It was quite interesting. Some people have not yet arrived.

17
00:06:44,755 --> 00:06:49,555
I am sorry to say they haven't been able to arrive

18
00:06:49,835 --> 00:06:53,235
from Bombay.

19
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:57,755
I think they are more Bombayites, not from the foreign countries,

20
00:06:57,955 --> 00:07:01,835
but otherwise I think all of you are here.

21
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:06,475
It's a very unusual thing to happen like this, you see,

22
00:07:06,714 --> 00:07:11,275
this My father built this house about eighty years back.

23
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,315
He was very imaginative and fond of guests,

24
00:07:14,515 --> 00:07:20,635
so he also put up guest bedrooms and guest bathrooms, such,

25
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:24,995
and it was a hill station.

26
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:29,435
Now of course, because of crowdedness very cold and a hill station

27
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:32,835
so people used to come, his friends used to come from Nagpur,

28
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,635
so he had made arrangements for them.

29
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:37,755
There were no hotels or anything so they used to have -

30
00:07:37,955 --> 00:07:40,955
and the people of this place are extremely hospitable,

31
00:07:41,155 --> 00:07:43,595
very hospitable.

32
00:07:43,915 --> 00:07:48,195
So it was his idea that he should have a house here

33
00:07:48,475 --> 00:07:49,995
where his guests could be.

34
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:52,435
His brother had a big house

35
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:57,075
but it was joint and he couldn't receive his guests,

36
00:07:57,355 --> 00:08:02,555
so he thought it's better to build a house here,

37
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:06,115
and behind was a huge, big compound bigger than this,

38
00:08:06,315 --> 00:08:07,435
which I have seen.

39
00:08:07,635 --> 00:08:10,955
I was only four years of age when we went away from here,

40
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:13,515
but I remember each and everything

41
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:17,915
about this house, and everything about Chhindwara.

42
00:08:18,435 --> 00:08:24,555
And you know My memory is unusually, very, very sharp.

43
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:30,035
I mean, I remember even My birth, it's to that extent.

44
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:39,915
But I never knew that there would be so many saints coming

45
00:08:40,155 --> 00:08:42,235
to visit this place of My birth.

46
00:08:42,475 --> 00:08:46,235
I never expected that there would be so many people

47
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,995
who will take to Sahaja Yoga in My lifetime,

48
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:52,155
because when I was born I found people were so blind.

49
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:55,195
I thought, "How will I talk about Sahaja Yog? What will I do?

50
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,875
How will it work out? It's very difficult."

51
00:08:58,115 --> 00:08:59,915
My father knew about My mission,

52
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:02,315
and he told Me that "You'd better find out a way

53
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:06,115
by which You can give Realization en masse.

54
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:07,755
That was important, because

55
00:09:07,955 --> 00:09:11,475
even if You give Realization one person, is of no use.

56
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:13,235
Also You should not write anything,

57
00:09:13,435 --> 00:09:16,835
because You don't create another Bible, Gita, Koran,

58
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:19,315
because books also bind them.

59
00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:23,875
So best thing is that You should take to...

60
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:25,795
search of human beings,

61
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:30,475
why they can't get it, their en masse Realization,

62
00:09:30,755 --> 00:09:33,395
because now You have come for that purpose."

63
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:35,235
Somehow it worked it out,

64
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,835
and really it was surprising, I was really,

65
00:09:38,075 --> 00:09:40,155
was not thinking to open Sahasrara,

66
00:09:40,355 --> 00:09:45,995
but I was literally forced into it and it worked out.

67
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:50,355
It's working out. You can see, all of you are here.

68
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:55,715
It's very amazing thing that can happen to someone like this,

69
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:57,515
that in the lifetime only,

70
00:09:57,755 --> 00:10:02,875
you have come here to see this birthplace of Mine.

71
00:10:03,115 --> 00:10:05,155
It was such, such vibrations

72
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:09,235
that My Sahasrara became completely jammed with vibrations.

73
00:10:09,435 --> 00:10:14,075
So cool inside, and outside was so hot that I didn't know

74
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:15,875
what was happening.

75
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:19,875
So I'm happy all of you could come and see this place,

76
00:10:20,115 --> 00:10:22,275
and a very humble house it was,

77
00:10:22,475 --> 00:10:25,635
but in those days it was the most,

78
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:29,435
I mean, well-planned house as such,

79
00:10:29,675 --> 00:10:32,595
and was very much appreciated by people.

80
00:10:32,835 --> 00:10:36,995
And after that four years I was here,

81
00:10:37,795 --> 00:10:43,235
and then we went to Nagpur because we had a,

82
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:45,315
My father had a big practice in Nagpur,

83
00:10:45,515 --> 00:10:47,395
he had to go many times down,

84
00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:49,555
so they thought it's better to go.

85
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:51,995
There also he had many houses,

86
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:56,355
and Babamama is going to take you round to see those houses.

87
00:10:56,555 --> 00:11:01,275
He says he'll find out time to see wherever I have lived.

88
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:05,195
But Nagpur also is very vibrated place, you can feel it.

89
00:11:05,395 --> 00:11:09,755
People are very quiet, it's a very quiet place.

90
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:13,595
So this is a very novel thing,

91
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:16,315
I don't think it has happened in the lifetime of

92
00:11:16,555 --> 00:11:20,155
any one of the incarnations who came on this earth.

93
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:23,195
Even for Rama Janma Bhoomi we are fighting even today.

94
00:11:23,435 --> 00:11:24,714
So you can imagine.

95
00:11:24,915 --> 00:11:29,355
Thank God, we have got this place - in a way. It's not yet ours,

96
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,155
but in a way we are there,

97
00:11:31,435 --> 00:11:37,155
and maybe with your good wishes we'll own it very soon.

98
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:41,675
Today's puja I thought was best to have

99
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,835
Shri Ganesha Puja in a short way,

100
00:11:45,035 --> 00:11:48,635
because the first Puja here, and I was born here,

101
00:11:48,835 --> 00:11:51,635
so it's better that we should have a Ganesha Puja.

102
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:55,675
It would be a nice thing to start with,

103
00:11:55,955 --> 00:11:58,035
and I, we have a doctor here.

104
00:11:58,275 --> 00:12:00,915
They are all Sahaja Yogis and they are going to help us

105
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:04,075
to do the curing. Actually I always thought,

106
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:06,915
"Which is the place where people will get cured?"

107
00:12:07,115 --> 00:12:11,555
So now we'll send all of them here to get cured.

108
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:14,435
It's a, it was a jungle here.

109
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:16,955
All around was jungles, hills,

110
00:12:17,155 --> 00:12:19,715
but I think all that's finished and broken now.

111
00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:24,435
And we used to get tigers and things;

112
00:12:24,635 --> 00:12:27,275
little far away from here is a place called Tamiya

113
00:12:27,475 --> 00:12:30,155
where they could go see tigers,

114
00:12:30,795 --> 00:12:33,555
but now they are there no doubt,

115
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:38,515
but they are saying that nobody is now going that side,

116
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:41,475
they all go to some preserve places

117
00:12:41,675 --> 00:12:44,275
which you have seen yourself, also Kanha Kisli.

118
00:12:44,595 --> 00:12:49,235
I hope you enjoyed. How did you enjoy Kanha Kisli?

119
00:12:51,955 --> 00:12:55,875
And the River Narmada also I was told you enjoyed very much.

120
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,315
I am happy this has happened.

121
00:12:58,515 --> 00:13:02,115
It was a little circuitous and quite

122
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:07,355
different from all the tours we have had so far,

123
00:13:08,714 --> 00:13:12,515
but I am happy you all have enjoyed it.

124
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:22,595
I have said so many things about Shri Ganesh,

125
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,235
I don't know what to say now, anymore,

126
00:13:25,475 --> 00:13:29,315
but all of you have seen that, a place, now see the -

127
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:33,395
this breeze is coming from where? I don't know.

128
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:37,995
You are sending breeze to Me, instead of I doing it.

129
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:39,715
All right.

130
00:13:45,555 --> 00:13:51,115
