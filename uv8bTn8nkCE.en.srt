1
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,677
Hindi

2
00:02:32,524 --> 00:02:34,524
I am sorry I was delayed.

3
00:02:34,724 --> 00:02:37,604
We were supposed to see the Collector and the

4
00:02:37,844 --> 00:02:40,124
Tahsildar, as they call him.

5
00:02:40,364 --> 00:02:43,524
They have done so much for us; so much they have organized,

6
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:47,644
all the way, and officially they have done so well,

7
00:02:47,844 --> 00:02:52,604
that I had to wait for them to thank them very much.

8
00:02:53,644 --> 00:02:56,804
I think

9
00:02:57,404 --> 00:03:00,524
it's not very much hot for you, see the

10
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:04,564
wind is blowing, can you imagine.

11
00:03:07,364 --> 00:03:13,684
And if you see, there's no, no leaves, leaves are not moving.

12
00:03:23,364 --> 00:03:26,604
You always used to go and sit in the sun,

13
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:31,324
so now here it is, you'd better have some of it.

14
00:03:31,524 --> 00:03:36,244
I hope you all enjoyed your stay in Jabalpur

15
00:03:36,524 --> 00:03:39,044
and the visit to Jabalpur.

16
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:43,124
It was quite interesting. Some people have not yet arrived.

17
00:03:43,404 --> 00:03:48,204
I am sorry to say they haven't been able to arrive

18
00:03:48,484 --> 00:03:51,884
from Bombay.

19
00:03:52,124 --> 00:03:56,404
I think they are more Bombayites, not from the foreign countries,

20
00:03:56,604 --> 00:04:00,484
but otherwise I think all of you are here.

21
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:05,124
It's a very unusual thing to happen like this, you see,

22
00:04:05,363 --> 00:04:09,924
this My father built this house about eighty years back.

23
00:04:10,164 --> 00:04:12,964
He was very imaginative and fond of guests,

24
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:19,284
so he also put up guest bedrooms and guest bathrooms, such,

25
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:23,644
and it was a hill station.

26
00:04:23,844 --> 00:04:28,084
Now of course, because of crowdedness very cold and a hill station

27
00:04:28,324 --> 00:04:31,484
so people used to come, his friends used to come from Nagpur,

28
00:04:31,684 --> 00:04:33,284
so he had made arrangements for them.

29
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:36,404
There were no hotels or anything so they used to have -

30
00:04:36,604 --> 00:04:39,604
and the people of this place are extremely hospitable,

31
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:42,244
very hospitable.

32
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:46,844
So it was his idea that he should have a house here

33
00:04:47,124 --> 00:04:48,644
where his guests could be.

34
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:51,084
His brother had a big house

35
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:55,724
but it was joint and he couldn't receive his guests,

36
00:04:56,004 --> 00:05:01,204
so he thought it's better to build a house here,

37
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:04,764
and behind was a huge, big compound bigger than this,

38
00:05:04,964 --> 00:05:06,084
which I have seen.

39
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:09,604
I was only four years of age when we went away from here,

40
00:05:09,804 --> 00:05:12,164
but I remember each and everything

41
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:16,564
about this house, and everything about Chhindwara.

42
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:23,204
And you know My memory is unusually, very, very sharp.

43
00:05:23,444 --> 00:05:28,684
I mean, I remember even My birth, it's to that extent.

44
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:38,564
But I never knew that there would be so many saints coming

45
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:40,884
to visit this place of My birth.

46
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:44,884
I never expected that there would be so many people

47
00:05:45,124 --> 00:05:47,644
who will take to Sahaja Yoga in My lifetime,

48
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:50,804
because when I was born I found people were so blind.

49
00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:53,844
I thought, "How will I talk about Sahaja Yog? What will I do?

50
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:56,524
How will it work out? It's very difficult."

51
00:05:56,764 --> 00:05:58,564
My father knew about My mission,

52
00:05:58,764 --> 00:06:00,964
and he told Me that "You'd better find out a way

53
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:04,764
by which You can give Realization en masse.

54
00:06:05,004 --> 00:06:06,404
That was important, because

55
00:06:06,604 --> 00:06:10,124
even if You give Realization one person, is of no use.

56
00:06:10,324 --> 00:06:11,884
Also You should not write anything,

57
00:06:12,084 --> 00:06:15,484
because You don't create another Bible, Gita, Koran,

58
00:06:15,684 --> 00:06:17,964
because books also bind them.

59
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:22,524
So best thing is that You should take to...

60
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:24,444
search of human beings,

61
00:06:24,644 --> 00:06:29,124
why they can't get it, their en masse Realization,

62
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:32,044
because now You have come for that purpose."

63
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:33,884
Somehow it worked it out,

64
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:36,484
and really it was surprising, I was really,

65
00:06:36,724 --> 00:06:38,804
was not thinking to open Sahasrara,

66
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:44,644
but I was literally forced into it and it worked out.

67
00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:49,004
It's working out. You can see, all of you are here.

68
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:54,364
It's very amazing thing that can happen to someone like this,

69
00:06:54,604 --> 00:06:56,164
that in the lifetime only,

70
00:06:56,404 --> 00:07:01,524
you have come here to see this birthplace of Mine.

71
00:07:01,764 --> 00:07:03,804
It was such, such vibrations

72
00:07:04,044 --> 00:07:07,884
that My Sahasrara became completely jammed with vibrations.

73
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:12,724
So cool inside, and outside was so hot that I didn't know

74
00:07:12,964 --> 00:07:14,524
what was happening.

75
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:18,524
So I'm happy all of you could come and see this place,

76
00:07:18,764 --> 00:07:20,924
and a very humble house it was,

77
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:24,284
but in those days it was the most,

78
00:07:25,004 --> 00:07:28,084
I mean, well-planned house as such,

79
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:31,244
and was very much appreciated by people.

80
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:35,644
And after that four years I was here,

81
00:07:36,444 --> 00:07:41,884
and then we went to Nagpur because we had a,

82
00:07:42,124 --> 00:07:43,964
My father had a big practice in Nagpur,

83
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,044
he had to go many times down,

84
00:07:46,244 --> 00:07:48,204
so they thought it's better to go.

85
00:07:48,444 --> 00:07:50,644
There also he had many houses,

86
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:55,004
and Babamama is going to take you round to see those houses.

87
00:07:55,204 --> 00:07:59,924
He says he'll find out time to see wherever I have lived.

88
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:03,844
But Nagpur also is very vibrated place, you can feel it.

89
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:08,404
People are very quiet, it's a very quiet place.

90
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:12,244
So this is a very novel thing,

91
00:08:12,444 --> 00:08:14,964
I don't think it has happened in the lifetime of

92
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:18,804
any one of the incarnations who came on this earth.

93
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:21,844
Even for Rama Janma Bhoomi we are fighting even today.

94
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,363
So you can imagine.

95
00:08:23,564 --> 00:08:28,004
Thank God, we have got this place - in a way. It's not yet ours,

96
00:08:28,204 --> 00:08:29,804
but in a way we are there,

97
00:08:30,084 --> 00:08:35,804
and maybe with your good wishes we'll own it very soon.

98
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,324
Today's puja I thought was best to have

99
00:08:40,524 --> 00:08:43,484
Shri Ganesha Puja in a short way,

100
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:47,284
because the first Puja here, and I was born here,

101
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:50,284
so it's better that we should have a Ganesha Puja.

102
00:08:50,524 --> 00:08:54,324
It would be a nice thing to start with,

103
00:08:54,604 --> 00:08:56,684
and I, we have a doctor here.

104
00:08:56,924 --> 00:08:59,564
They are all Sahaja Yogis and they are going to help us

105
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:02,724
to do the curing. Actually I always thought,

106
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:05,564
"Which is the place where people will get cured?"

107
00:09:05,764 --> 00:09:10,204
So now we'll send all of them here to get cured.

108
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:13,084
It's a, it was a jungle here.

109
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:15,604
All around was jungles, hills,

110
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:18,364
but I think all that's finished and broken now.

111
00:09:18,604 --> 00:09:23,084
And we used to get tigers and things;

112
00:09:23,284 --> 00:09:25,924
little far away from here is a place called Tamiya

113
00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:28,804
where they could go see tigers,

114
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,204
but now they are there no doubt,

115
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:37,164
but they are saying that nobody is now going that side,

116
00:09:37,364 --> 00:09:40,124
they all go to some preserve places

117
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:42,924
which you have seen yourself, also Kanha Kisli.

118
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:47,884
I hope you enjoyed. How did you enjoy Kanha Kisli?

119
00:09:50,604 --> 00:09:54,524
And the River Narmada also I was told you enjoyed very much.

120
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:56,964
I am happy this has happened.

121
00:09:57,164 --> 00:10:00,764
It was a little circuitous and quite

122
00:10:02,924 --> 00:10:06,004
different from all the tours we have had so far,

123
00:10:07,363 --> 00:10:11,164
but I am happy you all have enjoyed it.

124
00:10:19,164 --> 00:10:21,244
I have said so many things about Shri Ganesh,

125
00:10:21,484 --> 00:10:23,884
I don't know what to say now, anymore,

126
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,964
but all of you have seen that, a place, now see the -

127
00:10:28,204 --> 00:10:32,044
this breeze is coming from where? I don't know.

128
00:10:32,324 --> 00:10:36,644
You are sending breeze to Me, instead of I doing it.

129
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,364
All right.

130
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:49,764
[Shri Mataji is starting to talk in Hindi for about 5 minutes}
