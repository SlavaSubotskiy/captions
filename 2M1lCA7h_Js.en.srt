3
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:23,892
I bow to all the seekers of truth. It is very kind of you all to have come to celebrate my birthday.

4
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:33,892
It’s all your goodness. In modern times, who looks after the mother?

5
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,892
One of the signs of modern times is that the parents will be neglected by the children.

6
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,892
They may have to stay in an orphanage.

7
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:04,892
But I find all of you here with such love, with such affection, all the way from all distances,

8
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:17,892
you have come to greet your Mother. Words stop at this point.

9
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:34,892
I cannot understand the love that is pouring so much like an ocean over Me.

10
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:51,892
I just get lost into the beautiful feeling of a Mother who has thousands of children,

11
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:04,892
who are so kind and also after my image of a good son or a good daughter.

12
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,892
We had another great mother here, in this Maharashtra, was Jijabai, Jija Mata.

13
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,892
And she is the one she had  an image [unsure] of her son, that one day her son

14
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:38,892
will be able to establish the kingdom of God, of honesty, of freedom, of character.

15
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,892
Such ” Yuvapurushas” are born in many years.

16
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,892
Even his son could not come up to his standard, to his character.

17
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:58,892
The way he respected the daughter-in-law of Kalyan Subhedar, the way  he came towards people,

18
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,892
the way he led a life of dynamic bhakti.

19
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:19,892
Such people are rarely born and he could not even create someone like him.

20
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:33,892
But today, I am so very fortunate to have children of your great character,

21
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:46,892
understanding and such spiritual values. Sahaja Yoga has created a new culture of spiritual value.

22
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:59,892
The value system has taken a funny shape in the modern times

23
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,892
but in these modern times only when the shackles of this horrible culture -

24
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,892
whether you call it eastern, western, modern, ancient, anything,

25
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,892
because all of them have gone to the collapsible stages.

26
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:32,892
One finds a new culture, a new life, a new age of a new race coming up.

27
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:44,892
I am so gratified that you are all here to represent that culture of spiritual values,

28
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:59,892
where we do not believe in any separatist ideals. We are not reactions.

29
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:11,892
We do not react to any concept. We are self-made, standing on our self-experiences and the truth,

30
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:24,892
that is so evident. We are not the people who have taken to a kind of a violent

31
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:37,892
or peaceful - if you call it - reaction to the society. Like we have many organizations today I find,

32
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,892
“This is a reaction to this, that is a reaction to that”.

33
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,892
This is not the society that is demanding anything like money,

34
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:57,892
power - nor is it a society that calls itself a downtrodden or underprivileged people.

35
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,892
It is the most privileged society we have today [unsure].

36
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,892
The essence of this privilege is that you are all Yogis, you are all saints, you are all Safiyas [pure].

37
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,892
That there is satisfaction in your heart, that now the time has come to give,

38
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:24,892
no more asking for oil or for light. What you have got is the light and the oil all the time flowing in you.

39
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,892
You have to just spread this love into the whole world.

40
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:46,892
Such confidence of love, such modesty of dynamism, such sharpness of compassion,

41
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:57,892
such deep peace. Its prevalent in the society of Sahaja Yogis:

42
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:10,892
the friendship, the love like many waves of beautiful thoughts and feelings.

43
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:20,892
This ocean of a new understanding of a higher life, of a sober life,

44
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:30,892
of a sublime life has to break all the barriers, all the nonsensical work.

45
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:41,892
Today we are facing face-to-face, thank God. Due to fundamentalist, due to fanatics,

46
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,892
due to non-believers, due to politicians, economics, scientists, all of them,

47
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,892
who are conditioned by whatever false path they have created.

48
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,892
Scientists are very much more conditioned than anybody else.

49
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,892
They just refuse to accept that there is God Almighty above us.

50
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,892
They are not scientists, because they have no open-mindedness.

51
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,892
If you don’t have an open-mindedness, you are not a scientist.

52
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,892
Now the time has come for you to prove the existence of God and His realm,

53
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,892
which gives us security, peace and joy.

54
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,892
About Kundalini - I don’t know how many lectures I’ve given and have worked it in so many ways

55
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,892
that it should be appreciated, understood, knowledgeable to all of you.

56
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,892
Only the knowledge of Kundalini is not going to help us at all.

57
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,892
You might find some people who have much more knowledge of Kundalini than some of you have.

58
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,892
They might have read at least hundred books on Kundalini,

59
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,892
but it is not known to them, its not the knowledge. It has to be within [unsure],

60
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,892
it has to be known on your central nervous system. It has to be in your being,

61
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,892
that you should be able to know what is Kundalini.

62
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,892
As soon as you see somebody you should know where he stands - as far as spirituality is concerned.

63
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:26,892
As soon as you feel the atmosphere, you should know where you are as far as God’s realm is concerned.

64
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,892
I must tell you a story. Once I was travelling with my husband in Kashmir

65
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:41,892
and just in a very wild place, I felt tremendous vibrations.

66
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,892
And I said, “From where do these vibrations are coming?” So, my husband said,

67
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,892
“How can you have vibrations in this forlorn place?” He asked the driver. He said,

68
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,892
“No, there is no temple, nothing here, it’s a very wild place.”

69
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,892
I said, “All right, let’s go the way this road is”. And we went one way ahead,

70
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,892
about five miles and there, some Muslims, poor Muslims were living there.

71
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,892
So, the driver asked them, is there a temple here? They said,

72
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:21,892
“No, there is no temple. But about a mile ahead there is the Hazratbal (Mosque).”

73
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,892
Hazratbal was the one hair of Mohammad Sahab. Can you imagine the vibrations?

74
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,892
I caught them about 5-6 miles away, from one hair of Mohammad Sahab.

75
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,892
When we deny Mohammad, or when we deny Christ, when we deny Krishna

76
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:51,892
or we deny Dattatreya, we are denying the truth, because they are all one. There’s no difference.

77
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:04,892
They are like flowers on one tree of life. We are not their judge. They are our judge.

78
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,892
We are not to judge them, we haven‘t got that capacity to judge them.

79
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,892
What capacity we have, that we have to achieve, that we have to reach, that has to mature.

80
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,892
The spirituality has to mature to that extent where it Hazrat Nizamudin

81
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:29,892
or it is Chishti or it is Sainath. You should see nothing but Dattatreya  present in them.

82
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,892
For that you have to have that sight of Kabira.

83
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,892
You have to have that growth of Nanaka. Otherwise, we just talk.

84
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,892
Those who have understood Sahaja Yoga have understood that all

85
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,892
these barriers of religion has no meaning. It‘s all integrated,

86
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,892
well-woven and worked out beautifully by sending all these Incarnations,

87
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,892
all these Great Prophets on this Earth. To create the humanity which is described by Confucius.

88
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,892
To create valencies, our valencies, which are 10 valencies that we call as Dharma,

89
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,892
of a human Dharma, which is described by Confucius.

90
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:20,892
It is described in different, different ways no doubt, but still, he says the same thing, same tone.

91
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,892
As I said this morning Sahaja Yoga has only one theme and that is pure love.

92
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,892
It has no greed, it has no lust, it has no ambitions, nothing!

93
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,892
It has nothing but pure love flowing through your channels to the whole world.

94
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,892
I hope we have achieved a very great height [unsure].

95
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,892
To think that we have people from all over the world who follow this path of Sahaja Yoga.

96
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,892
Now it is for others to see whether they can come up through all this turmoil [unsure]

97
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,892
because Sahaja Yoga is not a thing where you can be a member,

98
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,892
you can pay some money or you can sort of put a sign-board that I am a Sahaja Yogi.

99
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,892
Its the becoming of Sahaja Yoga is important. Those who have that capacity will come to us.

100
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,892
Don’t you worry if the whole world doesn’t come. For Me, you are the world.

101
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,892
Those who want to come, can join us and can enjoy themselves, can have that.

102
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,892
We cannot run after them, we cannot fall at their feet, that come along - take to God.

103
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,892
Let them themselves come on their own and enjoy the beauty of their own being,

104
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,892
which is created by God specially for them.

105
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:53,892
Today, I must say that every year, the age reduces in a way

106
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:05,892
because you are going towards your goal. But one has to remember that every year you mature.

107
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:16,892
You mature like a seed comes up to a tree, then becomes a flower and ultimately a fruit.

108
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,892
And the fruit has to fall again to the ground, to give the resurgence of the same.

109
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,892
In the same way whatever it is, whether the time is passing, one has to just judge

110
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,892
how far have I matured in compassion, in love, in understanding of the truth.

111
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,892
How far I can stand against all the atrocities done to others who are suffering.

112
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,892
We have to open our eyes to the society, to our surroundings, to our country, to other countries,

113
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,892
to everyone. We have to be alert. It’s not to be enjoyed only by you.

114
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,892
It is to be given to others and for that those who come to us,  we have to tell them.

115
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,892
I am sure one day will come many will open their eyes and see for themselves

116
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,892
that the only solution for this world’s turmoil is Self Realisation, to know the Self,

117
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,892
that still they are not fully there yet.  Once it happens I am sure,

118
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,892
I am very, very sure that this world will become a beautiful garden of oneness.

119
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,892
May God bless you all!

120
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:43,892


121
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,892
Indian Sahaja Yogi: By the grace of Shri Mataji, it has, all they have teached is

122
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,892
that one must read [unsure] everyday regarding this program [unsure] of Shri Mataji.

123
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:05,892
May I, while passing make a remark, that Shri Mataji with Her own mantras

124
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:14,892
has given a different interpretation all together.  Shri Mataji, with Her own interpretations,

125
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,892
has given a different, all together, meaning to Gita, Quran, what Nanak Sahab has said,

126
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,892
and our Sahaja Yogis have been writing about it. One such, our Sudhakar,

127
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:36,892
has written this strotram Nirananda and I would request Shri Mataji to have Her blessings on this,

128
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,892
this is strotram Nirananda.  (Audience applauds)

129
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:56,892


130
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,892
Another Sahaja Yogi:  Most Holy Mother, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi, all of us who are Sahaja Yogis,

131
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:13,892
we bow to You.  We thank You very much for having given us the  Self Realisation,

132
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:22,892
for having given us what we know as love.  Today with Your shining words

133
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,892
You have given us depth, which we are and which we look forward to.

134
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,892
I thank all of you who have come here today to celebrate with us,

135
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,892
on this great occasion of Shri Mataji’s birthday.

136
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,892
All of us who are Sahaja Yogis over here, we promise You, O Mother, that Your works,

137
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,892
through us will carry far and to all corners of the world and with Your blessings,

138
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:09,892
this world can be a different place.  Thank You very much. Jai Shri Mataji!
