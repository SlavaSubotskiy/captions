1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,200
Today you all have gathered here

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,640
to do the Guru Puja.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,080
Your Guru is a Mother first and then a Guru

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,320
and that has given Me a greater help.

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,720
We have had before also many Guru Pujas,

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,480
mostly in England.

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,520
And you should wonder why

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,520
Mother always somehow is doing Guru Puja in London.

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,000
The time falls in such a way that it is in Guru Puja,

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:56,040
I am here, during that time I have to be in London.

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:03,960
So many years we have been doing Guru Puja in England.

12
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,280
All things happen if according to ritambhara pragya

13
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,400
then there must be some reason

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,480
why Mother is here in England for a Guru Puja.

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,800
It is stated in the Puranas that

16
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,440
the Adi Guru Datattreya

17
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,800
worshipped Mother

18
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,800
along the banks of the river Tamasa.

19
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,200
Tamasa is the same as your Thames

20
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,800
and He himself came and worshipped here.

21
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,120
And the druids, those who had

22
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,080
the manifestation of the Stonehenge and all that,

23
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,560
are originated from that time in this great country of Shiva,

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,560
of the Spirit.

25
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,440
So the Spirit resides here as in the heart of human beings,

26
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,240
and the Sahasrara

27
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,360
is in the Himalayas where Sadashiva exists at the Kailasha.

28
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,240
This is the great secret

29
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,960
of we having so many Guru Pujas here.

30
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,240
To culminate it today and to this special type of Guru Puja

31
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,400
in the year of the sixtieth birthday of your Mother

32
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,840
is, has a special, very, very special significance

33
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,280
because is the Guru Sashti -

34
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,360
is the sixty years of your Guru has been celebrated today.

35
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,720
And that's how it's a very big occasion that you all have gathered

36
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,200
under the influence of again ritambhara pragya.

37
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,640
So all that has happened has happened by the nature's own gift to you

38
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,520
and everything has worked out so well

39
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,040
because that was the desire of the Divine

40
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,280
and the design of the Divine.

41
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,920
So the river Thames, which we call Her as Thames -

42
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,240
you see, English have a method of making everything English.

43
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,800
Like Bombay they made it - Mumbai was Bombay,

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,200
you see, like Calcutta, like all other words just like that.

45
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,120
Like Varanasi was made into Benares,

46
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:19,000
River Thames which was really Tamsa was called as Thames.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,520
Now from the name Tamsa one should know

48
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,600
that is a place of Tamo Guna.

49
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,440
Is a place where left-sided resided since long.

50
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,120
So people were very worshipful, left-sided people, emotional type,

51
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,360
and they worshipped God more

52
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,360
than that they went into yagyas and all that.

53
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,080
And Datattreya lived here

54
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,960
and meditated on the banks of River Thames.

55
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,960
That's why Guru puja here has to give us a great background

56
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,120
for your awakening of the Guru Principle.

57
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,880
We have to go to the roots of everything

58
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,920
so that we understand the importance of it.

59
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,320
Unless and until you know the roots and the traditions behind

60
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,720
you cannot understand the depth,

61
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:27,520
the gravity, the intensity of any puja.

62
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,000
Today we have gathered here to do the Guru Puja, again.

63
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,160
The reason is we have got a Guru Principle within ourselves

64
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,160
as I told you last time

65
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,200
and also I have given elaborately

66
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,560
the Ten Commandments as expressed within us

67
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,040
which are describing the different

68
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,360
the different types of essences within us.

69
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,320
The essence of Guru Puja has to be awakened within us.

70
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,400
That's how we are having this program here.

71
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,640
Now it is important

72
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,960
that we have to establish

73
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,240
the dharma within us.

74
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,840
Without the dharma you cannot have the ascent.

75
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,920
And as I have told you before that the cleanliness

76
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,080
of your being

77
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,240
depends on how much dharma you follow, religiously.

78
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,200
At the time of Moses

79
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,520
it was worked out

80
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,280
and all the rules and regulations

81
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
were created for realized souls.

82
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,400
But as I read in one of the books - it was very good,

83
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,280
because if I had said this, people would not have believed -

84
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,120
that it had to be changed.

85
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,560
I think during the speech the children should not be here,

86
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,480
it's better to take them out.

87
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,520
After the speech you can bring them along - those who make noises.

88
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Those who are quiet it's all right,

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,160
but those who are making noises you better bring them out.

90
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,520
If they are going to make noises, better to be out or near the door

91
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,080
so that if they make noises you can get out,

92
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,560
so there is no disturbance.

93
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,840
And during the puja is all right, you could be at the gate,

94
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,520
door or some place from where you can go.

95
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,520
So the laws and regulations that were given to human beings

96
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,560
were actually for the realized souls who would understand.

97
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,720
But when Moses must have discovered the way human beings are,

98
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,000
He must have changed them to very strict rules,

99
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,920
because with human beings as they are,

100
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,480
one has to be extremely strict.

101
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,320
They can't understand anything but fear.

102
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,200
If you have

103
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,680
a stick in your hand, you can put them right.

104
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,320
Without that stick human beings won't listen.

105
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,240
They are only all right if there's a fear.

106
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,360
Now if you see

107
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,920
the today condition of all the nations,

108
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,800
those who are having leaders, or prime ministers, or presidents

109
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,200
they are all people extremely strict,

110
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,840
very dominating and very dry.

111
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,640
And normally people like such people.

112
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,160
Even Hitler succeeded because of that nature.

113
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,040
So the character of a guru so far

114
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,240
has been of a very strict nature

115
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,760
for people who are not realized.

116
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,120
Normally a guru doesn't - a good guru, Satguru,

117
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,320
He doesn't like to talk to people much.

118
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
They throw stones

119
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,440
or they don't like to talk to people

120
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,960
who are not realized.

121
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,520
But if they are realized then these Gurus change their attitude

122
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,320
towards the people who want to see them.

123
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,240
There is a tremendous difference

124
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,680
between a person who is a realized and non-realized

125
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,160
in the protocol of God.

126
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,520
A man may be the king or anything, he'll be asked to sit outside.

127
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,880
It has nothing to do with what position you enjoy.

128
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,320
As long as he is a realized soul and not possessed

129
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,080
he is given the highest position.

130
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,040
But if you are possessed then also the Guru will tell him

131
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,560
that "You get out from here,

132
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,760
first get rid of your possession and then come."

133
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,840
And all these strict rules were there,

134
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,720
that such and such person must be killed,

135
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,320
such and such person must be given a punishment

136
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,720
of cutting the hands, cutting the feet,

137
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,160
even absolutely destroying the eyes.

138
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,040
This was done because they were not realized souls.

139
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,240
It was the great realization of Moses, I think,

140
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,240
that He took to another kind of law which is known as Sharia now

141
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,520
and that's what the Muslims are following.

142
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,440
In a way it's good I think,

143
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,960
because people who are now normal people really deserve such a rule,

144
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,400
but it should not be so fanatical that you cannot discriminate

145
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,400
between a realized soul and a non-realized soul.

146
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,000
Now the Guru within you

147
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,400
will be awakened if you are strict with yourself.

148
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
That's one point is very important.

149
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,200
Unless and until you are strict with yourself

150
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,960
the Guru will not be awakened within you.

151
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,560
People who are lazy lumps, who cannot sacrifice anything,

152
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,880
who are very fond of comfort can never be gurus, take it from Me.

153
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,920
They can be good administrators, they can be anything,

154
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,560
but never a guru.

155
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,160
A guru should be willing to live the way he has to live.

156
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,240
He should be able to sleep on stones,

157
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,280
he should be able to sleep under any circumstances.

158
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,840
Not that the disciple should force on him,

159
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,160
but it should be his own nature, that he can adjust himself.

160
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,280
Comfort cannot crawl on a guru.

161
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,760
Now those who want your Guru Principle to be awakened

162
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,160
must know that you should not ask for comfort.

163
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,680
Even for a thing like that, yesterday you saw the dancing,

164
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,480
one has to do real tapasya.

165
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,720
Intensive tapasya you have to do,

166
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,520
you cannot learn even a thing like dancing

167
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,720
without going into a penance about it.

168
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,000
So a guru has to go through all penances is important.

169
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,200
Sahaja Yogi need not go, but a guru Sahaja Yogi has to do it.

170
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,520
We have to have penances,

171
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,960
and the penance can be any kind of desire you have.

172
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,560
Say, supposing you are very fond of food,

173
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,600
just don't eat the food that you want to eat.

174
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,200
If you are very fond of sweet food,

175
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,360
then eat something very bitter, raised to power hundred and eight.

176
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,040
And if you are fond of some sort of a very ...

177
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,000
- as Indians are, sometimes -

178
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,480
... very spicy food then eat so bland the food, without salt.

179
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,200
Teach your tongue to behave itself.

180
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,640
It doesn't behoove a guru to put his attention to food.

181
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,720
I have seen some of the Sahaja Yogis, they are all right

182
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,400
when the food is there, quite concentrated,

183
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,080
but when it comes to the programme they have no concentration.

184
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:39,520
Such a sad thing, such people cannot be gurus. They can be cooks, good,

185
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,440
or could be food-tasters or something like that.

186
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,000
Will suit them better, but if they have to be gurus

187
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,720
they must learn to control their tongue and their desires.

188
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,520
I mean, fasting is a good thing for such people, fasting is very good.

189
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,280
All the time they are worried, what are we going to have for lunch,

190
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,280
what are we going to have for dinner?

191
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,520
Such people cannot have their Guru Principle awakened,

192
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:13,000
neither they can be gurus. So please be careful.

193
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,080
The guru must have control over the tongue.

194
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,360
He must know when to get angry

195
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,040
and when to be gentle.

196
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,760
He must know what to say when,

197
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,680
how much to say.

198
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,560
That's why many gurus have been more effective by not speaking.

199
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,480
Silence is the best way you can help others,

200
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,520
but when it comes to explaining Sahaja Yoga, you should speak.

201
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,680
But I have seen with some people they are very eloquent

202
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,120
when it comes to nonsensical things,

203
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,280
but when it comes to Sahaja Yoga, they don't know anything

204
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,000
about Sahaja Yoga.

205
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,800
So you have to be the master of Sahaja Yoga,

206
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,600
if you have to be a Guru,

207
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,360
not only in talking, but in your behaviour, in everything.

208
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,400
And the karamat

209
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,680
is the ...

210
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,280
I don't know if you use charismatic-word, charismatic they call it

211
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,240
or you say, the one how to do it

212
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,320
how to raise the Kundalini, how to put it at the Sahasrara,

213
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,720
how to break the Sahasrara, all these things you must know,

214
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,600
how to spend your knowledge is viniyoga in Sanskrit.

215
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,560
Guru principle is awakened in a person

216
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,840
when he himself has achieved something.

217
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,240
Imagine a half-baked guru going along talking as a Guru.

218
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,960
He'll end up as a disciple ultimately.

219
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,880
So you have to be master of your own,

220
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,440
but when the Guru Principle comes in

221
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,440
you have to give it to others,

222
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,560
it's a question of giving it to others.

223
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,280
So you have to be at a higher level to give it to others,

224
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,960
have to be at a very high level.

225
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,520
If you are attached to money, if you are attached to food,

226
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,160
if you are attached to mundane things of life, you cannot give.

227
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,520
Now the higher state than that can be achieved,

228
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,160
which is naturally in Me, but can be achieved,

229
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,320
is that you don't have to have any dependence like that,

230
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,840
that any rules and regulations,

231
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,520
like saying that I will have no worry about food,

232
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,440
I should fast, this, that -

233
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:49,360
it all ends up. When you eat but don't eat,

234
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,600
that's the state one should have,

235
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,320
that you are eating the food

236
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,720
and if you ask, "Did you have your lunch?"

237
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,720
"I don't know ..."

238
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,080
"Will you have your lunch?"

239
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,880
"I don't know ..."

240
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,080
Absolutely indifferent to the problems of the body.

241
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,120
"Where did you sleep?"

242
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,240
"I don't know ..."

243
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,600
"What did you eat, what will you have?"

244
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,480
"I don't know ..."

245
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,240
This kind of a state is called ateeta state where you go beyond

246
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,440
and whatever you do, you are doing it

247
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,360
because it is to be done. Without paying any attention to it,

248
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,960
is automatic.

249
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,760
Nothing is important, but this is -

250
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,160
before becoming ateeta you have to steady yourself,

251
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,360
"Nothing is important," you see, is a, avir bhava

252
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,920
they call it, is a kind of a drama you have to put in.

253
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,000
"Oh, nothing is important, this carpet is not important,

254
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,840
I should try to sleep on the cement."

255
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,520
First you have to do that.

256
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,400
But after some time it happens

257
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,240
that you don't remember whether you slept on the cement

258
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,520
or on a cot, "Where did I sleep? I don't know."

259
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,920
That is the ateeta state.

260
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:32,240
And that state is to be achieved now by many Sahaja Yogis-

261
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,680
in a state where you go beyond.

262
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,440
Say there is somebody who is before you and you have to get angry.

263
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,960
All right, you give them left, right, left, right nicely

264
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,960
and then you are smiling next moment.

265
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,840
Did you get angry with that person? "I don't know, did I?"

266
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,600
Like Buddha once said something

267
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,000
in one village

268
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,000
and there was a horrible fellow who got up

269
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,880
and said lots of things to him.

270
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,640
And when He went to the next village the fellow felt

271
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,680
that "Oh, I should not have done that," Left Vishuddi, perhaps.

272
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,960
So he went down and said, "I am sorry Sir, I have said so

273
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,720
and I should not have said it,

274
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,480
I didn't know You are the enlightened one,

275
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,200
so it happened, so forgive me."

276
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,120
He said "When, where did you say?"

277
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,080
He said, "In the last village."

278
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,520
"Oh, everything in the last village I have left there alone

279
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,560
I don't take with me."

280
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,320
That is the ateeta state that you have to reach.

281
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,080
So even not to feel, it's not important.

282
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,760
These identifications when they drop out completely

283
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:52,720
then you are doing things in akarma state,

284
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,320
where, like sun is shining it doesn't know it is shining.

285
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,600
When the vibrations are flowing you don't know it is flowing.

286
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,160
Already it has started working in you.

287
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,720
You are surprised, you raise the hands and the Kundalini is rising.

288
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,920
You don't know you are raising the Kundalini actually.

289
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,760
How do you raise it?

290
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,160
You don't know, that's it.

291
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,280
That state has already started ateeta in you,

292
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,120
but get it established in every walk of life,

293
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,000
everything, that you go beyond.

294
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,040
And if you can manage that,

295
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,240
that's the highest that you have to reach.

296
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,880
Now with the incarnations it's very different,

297
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,120
it's the other way round.

298
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,760
Everything is the other way round.

299
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,880
They don't have to do any tapasya.

300
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,440
They don't have to starve, they don't have to cleanse themselves,

301
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,400
whatever they do is the punya.

302
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,040
They don't have to collect punyas either.

303
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,880
If they kill somebody it is dharma.

304
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,240
If they hit somebody it is the dharma.

305
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,960
Nothing they do wrong.

306
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,160
They are absolutely immaculate.

307
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,680
If they deceive someone, they cheat someone,

308
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,200
it's perfectly all right.

309
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:34,000
Because for a higher goal you have to give up the smaller goals.

310
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,080
It's justified in our day-to-day life you'll see,

311
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,880
that when you are defending your country,

312
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,200
there is an enemy on you, if you have to defend your country

313
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,800
you can slay him.

314
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,760
You can cheat him, diplomatically you can befool him.

315
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,600
Is allowed, why?

316
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,040
Because for a higher goal you have to give up the smaller goal.

317
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,800
But for an incarnation it is always the higher goal.

318
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,200
He is not bothered about smaller goals at all.

319
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,960
He doesn't have to weigh, think, rationalize

320
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,600
or to train himself or do some drama or anything, it's all done.

321
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,440
Even the movement, every movement, every movement of an incarnation

322
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,640
has a ripple in it, which is for the good.

323
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,880
There is nothing, not even a moment is such

324
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,560
which is not for the good of the world.

325
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,160
So the incarnation is a very different thing,

326
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,560
that is not to be achieved, that has to be.

327
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
Now for example

328
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,960
the incarnation is the bhokta, is the enjoyer,

329
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,080
He is the enjoyer of everything.

330
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,240
Many people, say, have created,

331
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,120
now we have a carpet here from Turkey.

332
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,000
These carpets were created by Turkish peoples

333
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,240
some time back for an incarnation to sit.

334
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,400
So the ritambhara pragya will bring it round in such a way

335
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,160
that at least I see it,

336
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,920
or I have it,

337
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,720
so that their souls will be blessed,

338
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,440
so that they feel nice.

339
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,120
Like Michelangelo has made that not for popes, I can tell you.

340
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,560
and not for all the rubbish people who go there.

341
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,240
Neither Blake did all that work

342
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,080
for the useless people who want to go and see nude artists.

343
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,280
It was all done for the incarnation to see.

344
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,440
That's the way they have blessed the most,

345
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,640
because they are beyond, nothing touches them, nothing is important,

346
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,560
but it's not rational or anything that they have trained themselves,

347
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,560
but it is automatically they have.

348
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,960
Like Shri Krishna had to marry sixteen thousand women.

349
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,320
Can you imagine?

350
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,800
In those days of monogamy he would be prosecuted hundred times.

351
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,160
The reason was he has sixteen thousand powers

352
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,920
and He was to be born

353
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,480
with those sixteen thousand powers on this Earth

354
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,120
and five elements became His queens.

355
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,120
He had to do some justification to have them around.

356
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,880
And as I have now Sahaja Yogis whom I have,

357
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,960
I mean, given Realization.

358
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,360
So automatically I am your Mother, is established.

359
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,400
But for Him there was no way out

360
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,320
but to marry His sixteen thousand powers.

361
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,640
And so He married, but He was never married,

362
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,720
He was a bachelor out and out all His life.

363
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,840
Because He is Yogeshwara and He is a brahmacharya.

364
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:14,520
Who can marry ... Him?

365
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,800
So for Them all these worldly things are just a drama,

366
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,040
has no meaning at all.

367
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,640
It's just a drama.

368
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,040
A person

369
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,320
who is not an incarnation should not try to be.

370
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,880
That's not the right of a human being.

371
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,560
Like a policeman standing on the road,

372
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,120
if he puts his hands right, left - we follow it.

373
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,640
But you ask some mad man to go and stand there, he will be arrested.

374
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,400
So for normal people, even you are a guru

375
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,280
you shouldn't allow them to touch your feet.

376
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,320
Only an incarnation's feet must be touched

377
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,040
and nobody else's feet must be touched.

378
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,040
Of course in samayachara

379
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,320
like as we have in India the custom to touch the feet of the father,

380
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,480
but because the father is a representative of the father

381
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,960
in you, that's why - or the mother.

382
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,160
But that's symbolic,

383
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,840
but in reality you are not to surrender yourself to anybody else,

384
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,200
but to an incarnation.

385
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,160
Also if there's a teacher in your,

386
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,400
any art or in anyway the master, you must touch his feet.

387
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,760
Even to take his name you have to pull your ears.

388
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,520
But nobody

389
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,880
who is a human being should make touch your feet,

390
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,640
especially the Sahaja Yogis should not.

391
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,120
Nobody should ask anyone to touch your feet.

392
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,280
As an elder you may,

393
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,760
that's a different point, but not as a guru.

394
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,240
Is a very dangerous thing,

395
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,280
once you start it, you know what it happens, with so many,

396
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,800
they have just gone out of Sahaja Yoga.

397
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,560
So to develop the Guru Principle within you

398
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,680
first of all you must develop yourself, fully.

399
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,400
Now how to develop yourself a Guru Principle, one must see.

400
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,880
We have got the ten principles within you, as I told you before

401
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,680
and we should develop these all ten principles in such a way,

402
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,560
that we stand out from others.

403
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,840
Yesterday as I told you that when we do dhyana-dharana-samadhi

404
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,560
and achieve the blessings of the ritambhara pragya,

405
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,280
then put that whole thing

406
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,880
onto different areas

407
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,040
as called as desh or bhoomi.

408
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,360
How you spend them is the point - is through mantras,

409
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,240
cleanse it through mantras,

410
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,800
cleanse it through your attention,

411
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,040
every day you must know which chakra to be cleared out.

412
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,880
You must know about yourself, where is the problem,

413
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,760
how it is to be cleansed,

414
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,880
how we have to clear it out.

415
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,320
Do not take it for granted.

416
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,880
Many people who have got, say, left-sided problem,

417
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,080
you will just bring them lemon and chillis

418
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,080
and think that Mother has done the job.

419
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,000
I can only do the job temporarily,

420
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,400
but if there is a vacuum again you will suck in.

421
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,280
You see ...

422
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,520
these vacuums within you feel hungry again to have some more.

423
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,240
So to take out that vacuum is your job

424
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,960
and for that you have to religiously get

425
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,640
after all your defects.

426
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,840
That's the most important thing for all of you.

427
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,720
And try to put full attention to all these different deshas

428
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,080
- is the nations, they are called like this.

429
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,960
And once you have cleared it,

430
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,160
it is enlightened, is full of light,

431
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,640
then you call it pradesh,

432
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,840
means the desha has been enlightened.

433
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,680
Once that has achieved

434
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,840
then you have reached the point you can become a guru,

435
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,840
but still you are not a Satguru.

436
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,080
To become the Satguru you must achieve the state of ateeta.

437
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,960
The ateeta state is such

438
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:04,120
that the person who is not a good man will tremble before you.

439
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,640
A man who is a liar,

440
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:12,080
who has cheated others will lose his tongue.

441
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,600
A man who has adulterous eyes,

442
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:24,960
who is a man without, no control,

443
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,320
without any control over his mind

444
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,360
as far as the women are concerned or men are concerned,

445
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,000
such a person will have shaking in his eyes.

446
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,040
Some of them will shake,

447
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,560
those who have been possessed will be shaking with it.

448
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,960
They'll be all exposed before the light of a Sat Guru.

449
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,560
When you achieve that you don't have to fight them,

450
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,320
they will themselves be exposed

451
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,560
and you won't have to do anything.

452
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,760
One day I was told

453
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,360
that there is a servant, lady-servant

454
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,240
who is a very possessed person, in the family.

455
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,080
So I said "Get rid of her."

456
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,200
I went to the airport. On My way I stopped at that house

457
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,360
and the maid-servant just walked in, you see

458
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,560
and there was a big gutter flowing,

459
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,880
I mean not a gutter but a open sort of a thing

460
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:31,360
and she saw Me and she fell in that.

461
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,440
I said, "Oh God,"

462
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,200
so I told the driver to take the car a little ahead.

463
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,800
And she fell in. It happens.

464
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,080
I was traveling by plane one day

465
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,360
and the gentleman in front started just jumping.

466
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,600
So a Sahaja Yogi asked, "Are you from TM?" He said, "How do you know?"

467
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,400
He said, "We know." So I sat back.

468
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,120
It may be they may all have ...

469
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,840
A day may come when they might start jumping like that.

470
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,960
Or a pilot might start jumping.

471
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,120
It's a big problem for Me.

472
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:22,120
Even the lights ...

473
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,320
... you enter into a church

474
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,680
and suddenly you find all the lights going off like this.

475
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,760
Even in big banquets, I find, when I am sitting there

476
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,480
and suddenly everybody comes and sit down

477
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,840
and all their bhoots come around,

478
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,600
they start jumping and then people start looking, "What's happening,

479
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,680
is there a fire on?"

480
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,680
So many things can happen,

481
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,440
like there was a gentleman very much possessed in a war

482
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,280
and we were going to a ship

483
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,760
and there was a little  platform on which we had to first jump

484
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,240
and the platform started doing like this, like that

485
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,040
and the fellow didn't know what to do with it,

486
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,960
he didn't understand why it was doing this.

487
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,480
So when you reach that state you don't have to argue or do anything,

488
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,640
even if you lift your eye

489
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,520
it happens that the person gets into problems.

490
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,960
Or there could be some ego-oriented people, they'll melt down.

491
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,120
First you have to do the drama of a guru,

492
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,000
dress up in a way which is simple,

493
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,760
you have to behave in a way which is very gentle,

494
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,280
because you have to attract them.

495
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,240
"Come along, come along, come along."

496
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,800
That's advertising, Advertising Department.

497
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,360
And once it is done, that drama is done

498
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,800
it can be exposed very soon, if they will find out that you are not good,

499
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,040
you are just a dramatist.

500
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,400
Once the drama has been done then

501
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,720
very cleverly you can bring out your real self before them.

502
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,400
So first you don't show them that you are a real, hard taskmaster.

503
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,320
Never.

504
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,240
First use all your sweet qualities.

505
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,840
The more they are difficult the more I am gentle with them.

506
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,440
Then they come inside.

507
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,560
Then you put to the mill and you can cure them.

508
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,480
First prepare them. First of all sometimes they are so frightened,

509
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,280
they are so nervous, they are so upset, sometimes too much of ego.

510
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,800
So be gentle.

511
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,680
Gradually they'll strengthen themselves also in your company

512
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,560
and then, even if you hit them they are all right.

513
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,240
That's how it has to be done very cleverly.

514
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,960
and if you see the way I manage My Gurudom

515
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,640
you can also manage.

516
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,680
But the key to Guru is patience,

517
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,440
a complete patience and complete dependence on God Almighty.

518
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,560
That's the key, complete patience.

519
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,560
First you tell them that this should be such,

520
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,680
but they will not accept. They will argue -

521
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,240
how, why, this, that. All right, go ahead.

522
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,720
Then they will come back with a black eye.

523
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,880
Or they may come back with a punched nose.

524
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,440
Then you say, "All right, I'll soothe it down." You soothe it down,

525
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,160
and then tell them.

526
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:41,160
So is the wisdom, the discretion of Yogeshwara you should have.

527
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,960
How to deal with people is very important,

528
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,360
why I say Yogeshwara.

529
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:51,520
Because at the guru state you have to give it on a collective level.

530
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,680
Individual level finishes and you jump into collective,

531
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,640
once you start becoming a guru.

532
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:07,360
So all these methods which I explained the other day to Modi,

533
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:15,040
you can understand that the ten of

534
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,200
your problems at the void

535
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,960
- once solved -

536
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,800
you solve the sixteen problems of the Vishuddhi.

537
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,880
And once sixteen problems are crossed you come to Agnya.

538
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,680
And at the Agnya Chakra

539
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:44,080
there is such a tremendous sacrifice

540
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:51,000
without feeling the sacrifice, is awaiting.

541
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,920
And one has to see what you can sacrifice

542
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,520
in that ateeta state, because you don't sacrifice anything.

543
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,800
Everything is already sacrificed, what is there to sacrifice?

544
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,560
And such a state should be achieved

545
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:19,200
by realizing that you are realized souls.

546
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,520
You are not ordinary people

547
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,560
and you cannot have ordinary,

548
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,280
mundane types

549
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,960
of rules and regulations.

550
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,440
Like yama and nyama,

551
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,360
the nyamas are for yourself, yamas for others, nothing.

552
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,040
There should be absolute truths with you.

553
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,400
So much so that you should manifest them

554
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,360
and all these truths have powers.

555
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:59,320
By every truth that is within you established,

556
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:04,080
you don't have to do anything, they work out themselves.

557
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,560
So first of all you must get your chakras all right.

558
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,760
On the chakras you must put your attention.

559
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,120
After the samadhi state you will start opening them out properly.

560
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,680
Clear them out. Know what are the chakras that are bad.

561
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,600
I have seen people who have very bad few chakras

562
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,880
and many good chakras,

563
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,840
but they will be only enjoying the good chakras

564
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,920
and will not worry about the bad ones.

565
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,680
Pay attention to your bad chakras, cleanse them, cleanse them.

566
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,840
Put all your attention to that.

567
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:45,680
Put the attention of the God,

568
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,280
of the Deity whom you worship

569
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,120
and you'll get the ...

570
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,320
... complete manifestation of their power within yourself.

571
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,960
So clear all the chakras,

572
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,480
all the pradeshas to be established

573
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,600
and after the establishment of the pradeshas

574
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,000
you'll have to establish the rapport with others

575
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,160
on the collective level.

576
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,680
Then a state when you become a complete spirit at the Agnya Chakra.

577
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,800
It's a, easiest in Sahaja Yoga and I have told

578
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,600
you the reason, because you are such fortunate people.

579
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,160
The easiest of easiest is Sahaja Yoga.

580
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,840
The essence of Sahaja Yoga is that it's the easiest thing to do.

581
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,640
And that is why we should take full

582
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:01,000
advantage of that easiest method,

583
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,640
made easy, absolutely for you.

584
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,360
This is the blessing of Guru Puja for you

585
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:17,560
that you all should become gurus by next year.

586
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,600
Just you have to dedicate and say today in your heart,

587
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,800
to promise Me in your heart that Mother, not we'll try but we will be

588
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:33,200
and thrice you should say, "We will be, we will be."

589
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,560
Now last of all I want to tell you

590
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,880
that now I have completed My sixtieth year

591
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,440
and no more celebrations of My birthday, this is the last.

592
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,840
Please remember this.

593
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,600
I have accepted whatever you said,

594
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,040
because of sixtieth birthday is very auspicious.

595
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:17,080
After this no more celebration of My sixtieth birthday.

596
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:41,160
You have already thought of giving Me some present

597
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,920
from all Europeans.

598
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,320
On the sixtieth birthday I have accepted,

599
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:53,880
but no more of this kind of planning should be done anymore

600
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:59,240
for the sixtieth birthday, which is over now.

601
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,880
I am telling you very frankly, all right?

602
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,480
So nobody is going to celebrate My sixtieth birthday anymore.

603
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,960
I hope it's clear to you.

604
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:19,880
So the protocol

605
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,840
of the Guru and the Mother

606
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:34,640
is to be understood in Sahaja Yoga mostly by experiencing it.

607
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,720
But that doesn't mean

608
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,040
that you go out of the way to experience the other side of it.

609
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,320
By being protocolish more and more

610
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,960
you will find you will receive much more help.

611
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,080
Like Nick one day I told him, he will tell you that,

612
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,600
there were two ladies who wanted to go to Belgium.

613
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,520
I told them they are going tomorrow.

614
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,600
And the ladies said, "No, we are going today."

615
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,720
He said, "The Mother has said that you are going tomorrow,

616
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,360
so you go tomorrow, whatever it is."

617
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,680
They said, "No, we are going today.

618
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,640
How is it Mother has said that we are going tomorrow?"

619
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,800
He said, "But She said it" -  they wouldn't listen.

620
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,880
So we sent them to the airport

621
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,120
and they found they had to go next day.

622
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,640
So that is how it is, that the protocol should be that,

623
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,720
"Yes, Mother has said it, doesn't matter.

624
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,600
It may go wrong, doesn't matter.

625
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,200
Whatever She says, let's obey and see."

626
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,120
By experiencing only you will know,

627
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,680
but in the beginning only you will say,

628
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,280
"No, we'll not do this and that," - it's not good.

629
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,120
So the protocol is the simplest of simple to do,

630
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,160
So that's the essence of Sahaja Yoga,

631
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,000
the simplest of the simple is the protocol.

632
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,480
If you understand the protocol

633
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,400
you don't have to do anything, you will grow by it automatically.

634
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,640
But you lack in protocol and that's how you do not know.

635
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:16,080
This is the point is, that to grow best in Sahaja Yoga

636
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,960
is to know the protocol, which you can ask others.

637
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,640
With experienced people you can ask,

638
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,080
or if you want to have your own experience you can have.

639
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,120
But some people try the other way round, like answering Me back,

640
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,520
by saying all kinds of things

641
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,160
they think "Let's experiment what happens."

642
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,840
And then they break their necks and come to Me for curing.

643
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,680
So that should not happen. Experience should be for betterment.

644
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,800
And that's how if you can ask others, take their advice,

645
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,160
those people who are rising higher then normal,

646
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,120
what is the protocol?

647
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,480
And put your attention to it, how can you improve your protocol,

648
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,280
what should we do to observe protocol,

649
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,160
what wrong are we doing, where are we going wrong?

650
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:04,080
Because the essence of Sahaja Yoga today is the protocol,

651
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,840
which should be the simplest.

652
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,760
Should be the simplest thing to do

653
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,080
and once you know the protocol that "If She has said it,

654
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,160
if it is meant, then it's all right."

655
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,520
But some people are so funny

656
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,640
that they start using Me as a quotation.

657
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,840
"Mother has said everybody must fast."

658
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,000
I told somebody that "You'd better fast."

659
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,160
So a thin man comes next day fainting, I said, "What happened?"

660
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,120
When I say something to a particular person they just circulate it,

661
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:50,400
because they think, "Why should I fast alone, everybody must fast."

662
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,800
Is a big problem, that they always quote Me.

663
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,720
Nobody is to quote Me to others,

664
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,560
because one thing is important,

665
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,640
whatever you have to say you put it on the notice board

666
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,720
maybe with My signature, better - for general things.

667
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:21,520
and for particular whatever I say, you should do it for particular.

668
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,680
At least that much discretion we all should have.

669
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,360
And try. You'll be very much helped,

670
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,040
you will be surprised, you'll be very much helped,

671
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,560
because it is for, everything is for your betterment

672
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,080
and a special grace,

673
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:42,440
if you understand the essence of protocol.

674
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,760
So I am taking you to that point

675
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,640
where you'll start understanding

676
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,800
that nothing is to be surrendered to Mother as such,

677
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,960
because She doesn't take anything, nothing goes to Her.

678
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,160
Is only your surrendering yourself,

679
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,680
by leaving all that is not wanted.

680
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,360
It's a very beautifying process which one should take.

681
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,680
You all have come up so much and you have to grow very much further,

682
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,760
I am sure you will go ahead and will become great Gurus

683
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,160
as you have promised today, by next year.

684
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,400
So I don't know what is the procedure of the puja today is,

685
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,760
whatever is the procedure, let's start.

686
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,720
So now the first, the twenty-one names of Shri Vishnu,

687
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,600
because it is for the sustainance.

688
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,960
Then is the Ganesha Puja, Ganesha's Puja.

689
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,440
Then the third thing ...

690
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,800
Then sankalpa. Sankalpa is the

691
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,880
dedicated vow -

692
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,120
for what are you doing this Puja, that is to be said by all of you.

693
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,960
Then the Ganesha Puja.

694
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,600
After Ganesha's Puja then

695
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:13,640
you do the Guru Puja

696
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,920
and after the Guru Puja

697
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:22,280
after the Guru Puja we will be doing Devi Puja.

698
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:28,920
After the Devi Puja we will be going out for our Havana,

699
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,320
then after that

700
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,440
- if you are not worried, I'll tell you - is lunch.

701
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:48,320
So just now put all your attention to the puja.

702
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,720
A little suggestion is that

703
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,960
these are the mantras for your central path of Sushumna Nadi.

704
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:51,040
Every mantra has a very great meaning and deep significance.

705
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,280
The resonance must help your chakras to open out.

706
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:58,560
First and foremost thing, you must say it from your heart.

707
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,640
Not from your tongue but from your heart.

708
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,880
Say it from your heart, then the intensity will be great.

709
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,840
We are not ordinary people who are just saying ordinary mantras.

710
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:15,400
We are realized souls, we have to say it from our heart.

711
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,840
This is the part called sankalpa

712
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:28,120
where you have to have the dedicated

713
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:33,960
declaration to Me why you are doing this Puja.

714
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,760
It's to all the world, to everyone,

715
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,600
to all the directions, all the Gods,

716
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:44,000
every word is noted down in the historical documentation.

717
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,480
So you have to say why you are doing this Puja

718
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,320
on this day, at this time, where ...

719
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,080
What’s the name of the river here? You tell him.

720
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,999
Arun.

721
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:57,960
All they say, some day in 24-th of July 1983,

722
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,440
at Lodge Hill and west bank of the river Arun

723
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,040
in the county of Sussex, in country of England

724
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,800
in Europe, in the summer season,

725
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:15,960
at 10:25 in the morning, when the sun is in the Leo

726
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,080
and the moon is in Aquarius.

727
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,440
we are doing this Guru Puja to our Mother Shri Adi Shakti.

728
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,440
On the full moon day.

729
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:31,200
On the full moon day,

730
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:34,120
the Guru Purnima.

731
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,840
We do this Puja on behalf of all the Sahaja Yogis,

732
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,000
from all the countries of the world.

733
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,760
And according to all religious Scriptures, all of us

734
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,400
with all of our families, pray now for wellbeing,

735
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,080
the spiritual wellbeing,

736
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:57,640
the victory over all obstacles, the fearlessness,

737
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,920
for longevity, for the longevity of our Guru,

738
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,480
for health, for wealth,

739
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,840
for nullification of all the baddhas of the Sahaja Yogis,

740
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,999
to be the master of eight siddhis,

741
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:19,200
to give peace to all, whether on two legs or on four.

742
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:25,520
We pray for the health, satisfaction and auspiciousness,

743
00:59:25,999 --> 00:59:28,480
for all those who are now handicaped,

744
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,999
for the emancipation, for all the people.

745
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,640
to give them the highest knowledge.

746
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:41,320
And whatever is our powers, whatever our knowledge,

747
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,800
whatever offerings we could bring,

748
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:49,160
through meditation or by whatever means, are given sixteen times,

749
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,440
these we surrender in the Puja.

750
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,520
And to the seat of the Mother, to the water jar,

751
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:02,920
the conch and the bell, we are doing Puja to all of them.

752
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:08,640
We request all the rivers to cleanse our bodies.

753
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,720
Above all we worship MahaGanapati

754
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:18,080
and request Him to continue this Puja without any hindrance.

755
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:23,960
And we invite the Goddess,

756
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,080
oh, Mother who has all the thousand purushas in Her

757
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:34,400
You have a thousand eyes and you have surpassing powers,

758
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,360
we request You, invite You very humbly,

759
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:42,720
be present for this occasion on Puja.

760
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,640
You tell about this water.

761
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,000
Just stand up and tell what you have got it for.

762
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,720
SY: This is rose water.
SM: Loudly.

763
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:51,720
Rose water, made from rose petals. They fell in Scotland

764
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,960
on Guru day, today, three days ago, on Thursday.

765
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,800
And from Highland spring water.

766
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,240
so that we bow with washing Mother's Feet with this rose water

767
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,520
offering the Guru tatwa of Scotland and all nations.

768
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,480
with Mother's blessings.

769
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:12,440
Put it in that water so that....

770
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,080
Let our ears hear that which is true,

771
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,400
let our eyes see that which is pure,

772
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:23,400
let our beings praise that which is divine,

773
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:28,560
and let those who listen hear not my voice but the wisdom of God.

774
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,120
Let us worship with the same song, the same strength

775
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:36,880
and the same knowledge and let our meditation enlighten and enrich.

776
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,520
Let there be amongst us compassion and peace.

777
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,680
Now the prayer:

778
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,280
Salutation to Shrī Ganesh, sākshāt Shrī Jesus

779
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,480
Sākshāt Shrī Nirmalā Devyai namo namah.

780
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,280
It is You who is the beginning of all the beginnings.

781
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,600
It is You who is the doer of all deeds which have been done,

782
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,720
are being done, and will be done.

783
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,840
It is You who supports all things that are supported.

784
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,040
It is You who protects all things that are protected.

785
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,960
It is You who is the complete, all-pervading Spirit,

786
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,160
God’s divine energy.

787
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:12,200
Think clearly brain, speak only the truth.

788
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:15,680
Let Your presence, awakened in us by Kundalini, speak;

789
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:19,160
let Your presence, awakened in us by Kundalini, listen;

790
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:22,920

01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,760
let Your presence, awakened by Kundalini in us,

793
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,640
Your disciples, be the disciple.

794
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,320
You are the essence of all the sacred literature and holy words

795
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,440
and You are the energy that understands the holy words.

796
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,440
You are the divine combination of complete truth,

797
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:46,200
complete happiness and complete energy; and You are beyond.

798
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,000
You are all knowledge, and You are the use to which knowledge is put

799
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,680
You exist until the end of all things,

800
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,160
and after the end of all things You are.

801
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:58,240
You create the end of all things, and after the end of all things,

802
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,000
You remain indifferent.

You are the earth, You are the water, You are the fire,

804
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,640
You are the air, and You are the space above the air.

805
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,320
You are the gunas and You are beyond the gunas.

806
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,680
You are the body and You are beyond the body.

807
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:15,040
You are the essence of time and You are beyond time.

808
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:18,000
You and only You exist at the Muladhara chakra.

809
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,880
You are the Spirit and You are beyond the Spirit;

810
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,920
and those who would join God meditate upon You

811
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:28,560
You are Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra; You are Indra, Agni, Vayu;

812
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,640
You are the sun at noon, You are the full moon;

813
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,160

You are the all-pervading energy of innocence and wisdom.

815
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:41,280
You are the divine servant who stoops to wash the feet of saints;

816
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,400
You are the tiny core of all things,

817
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,000
without which the large have no purpose;

818
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:49,360
You are the key to the libraries of all the scriptures,

819
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,480
without which the truth is hidden;

820
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,320
You are the full stop which completes the sentence,

821
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,960
and without which the sentence loses its meaning.

822
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,720
You are the crescent moon,

823
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:01,560
You are the stars and You are beyond the stars;

824
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,880
all the things, from tiny dot to universe, is You.

825
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,840
You are not to put your hand inside.

826
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,800
Just pour water on My Feet when he says the mantras.

827
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,720
You are where the sounds combine;

828
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,680
You are the silence between the sounds;

829
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,800
You are the rhythm of all music and all prayers.

830
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,360
This is the knowledge of Nirmal Ganesh,

831
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,520
and You, Nirmal Ganesh, are the master of that knowledge,

832
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:27,440
and all knowledge. You are the God and You are the Goddess.

833
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,160
Aum Gam Nirmal Ganapataye

834
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:33,080
To Your powers, Ganesha, let all surrender;

835
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,840
and the left side of memory and the right side of action

836
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:39,640
surrender to You. And let Your enlightenment prevail.

837
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:43,160
Your first tooth You have, and four hands:

838
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,640
one holding a rope, the second a goad,

839
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:49,360
the third is raised in blessing and the fourth offers sustenance.

840
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:52,960
Your banner is that of a humble mouse.

841
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,640
You have long ears and are clothed in red.

842
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:59,200
Red decorates You and You are worshipped with red flowers.

843

To Your powers, Aum Jesus, let's all surrender;

851
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,160
let the left side of memory and the right side of action

852

surrender to You and let Your enlightenment prevail.

853
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,240
You are the Word that was the beginning;

854
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,760
You are the Word that will be the ending.

855
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:37,400
You are He who was born of a virgin, and died on the cross.

861
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,680
and the Spirit that protects.

862
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,040

01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,560
who is unending love, salutations to You.

871
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:34,600
Sākshāt Mātājī Nirmalā Devī,

872
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:38,680
who is unending joy, salutations to You.

873
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:44,000
Now the Sanskrit verses

874
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,920
which are being translated in English as you heard it

875
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:50,560
will be said, at the time when they'll be pouring water on My Feet,

876
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,800
called as abhisheka.

877
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,480
Loud speak.

878
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,840
Slowly.

879
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:14,280
You have to put hand, to hold it up.

880
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,520
See now viniyoga, the word has come -

881
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,160
the spending of it.

882
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:33,040
What is the spending of the name of Shri Ganesha?

883
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:37,280
When you remember Him, then where do you spend it?

884
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:41,360
Viniyog, is a very good word.

885
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:14,520
All right. The girls come.

886
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,120
No, unmarried.

887
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:07,999
Now they will read about Shri Mahavishnu in English,

888
01:15:08,999 --> 01:15:12,280
who was an incarnation,

889
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,920
came on this Earth as Lord Jesus Christ.

890
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,120
How He was created

891
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:23,960
and the essence of it was that of ....

892
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,520
That when, was the One,

893
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,440
had the essence of Shri Ganesha

894
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:39,080
and He came on this earth ultimately as Shri Lord Shri Jesus Christ.

895
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,880
But how He became Mahavishnu

896
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,999
and what were His blessings we should say,

897
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:48,680
who was the Son of Shri Krishna.
