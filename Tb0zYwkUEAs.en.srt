1
00:00:01,436 --> 00:00:06,873
Hindi

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,720
I am sorry I was delayed.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,800
We were supposed to see the Collector and the

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,320
Tahsildar, as they call him.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,720
They have done so much for us; so much they have organized,

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,840
all the way, and officially they have done so well,

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,800
that I had to wait for them to thank them very much.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,000
I think

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,720
it's not very much hot for you, see the

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,760
wind is blowing, can you imagine.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:49,880
And if you see, there's no, no leaves, leaves are not moving.

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,800
You always used to go and sit in the sun,

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,520
so now here it is, you'd better have some of it.

14
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,440
I hope you all enjoyed your stay in Jabalpur

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,240
and the visit to Jabalpur.

16
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,320
It was quite interesting. Some people have not yet arrived.

17
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,400
I am sorry to say they haven't been able to arrive

18
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,080
from Bombay.

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,600
I think they are more Bombayites, not from the foreign countries,

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,680
but otherwise I think all of you are here.

21
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,320
It's a very unusual thing to happen like this, you see,

22
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:46,120
this My father built this house about eighty years back.

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,160
He was very imaginative and fond of guests,

24
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,480
so he also put up guest bedrooms and guest bathrooms, such,

25
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,840
and it was a hill station.

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,280
Now of course, because of crowdedness very cold and a hill station

27
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,680
so people used to come, his friends used to come from Nagpur,

28
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,480
so he had made arrangements for them.

29
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,600
There were no hotels or anything so they used to have -

30
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,800
and the people of this place are extremely hospitable,

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,440
very hospitable.

32
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,040
So it was his idea that he should have a house here

33
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,840
where his guests could be.

34
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,280
His brother had a big house

35
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,920
but it was joint and he couldn't receive his guests,

36
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,400
so he thought it's better to build a house here,

37
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,960
and behind was a huge, big compound bigger than this,

38
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,280
which I have seen.

39
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,800
I was only four years of age when we went away from here,

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,360
but I remember each and everything

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,760
about this house, and everything about Chhindwara.

42
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,400
And you know My memory is unusually, very, very sharp.

43
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,880
I mean, I remember even My birth, it's to that extent.

44
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,760
But I never knew that there would be so many saints coming

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,080
to visit this place of My birth.

46
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,080
I never expected that there would be so many people

47
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,840
who will take to Sahaja Yoga in My lifetime,

48
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,000
because when I was born I found people were so blind.

49
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,040
I thought, "How will I talk about Sahaja Yog? What will I do?

50
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,720
How will it work out? It's very difficult."

51
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,760
My father knew about My mission,

52
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,160
and he told Me that "You'd better find out a way

53
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,960
by which You can give Realization en masse.

54
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,600
That was important, because

55
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,320
even if You give Realization one person, is of no use.

56
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,080
Also You should not write anything,

57
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,680
because You don't create another Bible, Gita, Koran,

58
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,160
because books also bind them.

59
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,720
So best thing is that You should take to...

60
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,640
search of human beings,

61
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,320
why they can't get it, their en masse Realization,

62
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,240
because now You have come for that purpose."

63
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,080
Somehow it worked it out,

64
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,680
and really it was surprising, I was really,

65
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,000
was not thinking to open Sahasrara,

66
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,840
but I was literally forced into it and it worked out.

67
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,200
It's working out. You can see, all of you are here.

68
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,560
It's very amazing thing that can happen to someone like this,

69
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,360
that in the lifetime only,

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,720
you have come here to see this birthplace of Mine.

71
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,000
It was such, such vibrations

72
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,080
that My Sahasrara became completely jammed with vibrations.

73
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,920
So cool inside, and outside was so hot that I didn't know

74
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,720
what was happening.

75
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,720
So I'm happy all of you could come and see this place,

76
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,120
and a very humble house it was,

77
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,480
but in those days it was the most,

78
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,280
I mean, well-planned house as such,

79
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,440
and was very much appreciated by people.

80
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,840
And after that four years I was here,

81
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:18,080
and then we went to Nagpur because we had a,

82
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,160
My father had a big practice in Nagpur,

83
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,240
he had to go many times down,

84
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,400
so they thought it's better to go.

85
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,840
There also he had many houses,

86
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,200
and Babamama is going to take you round to see those houses.

87
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,120
He says he'll find out time to see wherever I have lived.

88
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,040
But Nagpur also is very vibrated place, you can feel it.

89
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,600
People are very quiet, it's a very quiet place.

90
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,440
So this is a very novel thing,

91
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,160
I don't think it has happened in the lifetime of

92
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,000
any one of the incarnations who came on this earth.

93
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,040
Even for Rama Janma Bhoomi we are fighting even today.

94
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,559
So you can imagine.

95
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,200
Thank God, we have got this place - in a way. It's not yet ours,

96
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
but in a way we are there,

97
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,000
and maybe with your good wishes we'll own it very soon.

98
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,520
Today's puja I thought was best to have

99
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,680
Shri Ganesha Puja in a short way,

100
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,480
because the first Puja here, and I was born here,

101
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,480
so it's better that we should have a Ganesha Puja.

102
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,520
It would be a nice thing to start with,

103
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,880
and I, we have a doctor here.

104
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,760
They are all Sahaja Yogis and they are going to help us

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,920
to do the curing. Actually I always thought,

106
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,760
"Which is the place where people will get cured?"

107
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,400
So now we'll send all of them here to get cured.

108
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,280
It's a, it was a jungle here.

109
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,800
All around was jungles, hills,

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,560
but I think all that's finished and broken now.

111
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,280
And we used to get tigers and things;

112
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,120
little far away from here is a place called Tamiya

113
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,000
where they could go see tigers,

114
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,400
but now they are there no doubt,

115
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,360
but they are saying that nobody is now going that side,

116
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,320
they all go to some preserve places

117
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,120
which you have seen yourself, also Kanha Kisli.

118
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,080
I hope you enjoyed. How did you enjoy Kanha Kisli?

119
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,720
And the River Narmada also I was told you enjoyed very much.

120
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,160
I am happy this has happened.

121
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,960
It was a little circuitous and quite

122
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,200
different from all the tours we have had so far,

123
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:47,360
but I am happy you all have enjoyed it.

124
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,440
I have said so many things about Shri Ganesh,

125
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,080
I don't know what to say now, anymore,

126
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,160
but all of you have seen that, a place, now see the -

127
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,240
this breeze is coming from where? I don't know.

128
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,840
You are sending breeze to Me, instead of I doing it.

129
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,560
All right.

130
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,960
[Shri Mataji is starting to talk in Hindi for about 5 minutes}
