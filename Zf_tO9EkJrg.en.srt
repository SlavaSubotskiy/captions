1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:09,450
Today I am going to talk to you about attention.

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:31,810
What is attention, what is the movement of
attention

3
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:40,830
and what are the ways and methods of raising
our attention.

4
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,690
Keep it in broad ways.

5
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,219
Alright?

6
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,890
But when I am saying all these things

7
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,789
you must know that I am talking to you individually

8
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:53,570
– it’s not about others.

9
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,870
Always the first thing human beings do is,
when I am speaking to you,

10
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,050
you try to find out about who Mataji is speaking!

11
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,340
This is the best way of putting your attention
onto something else.

12
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:12,999
If you put your attention to yourself that,
“This is for me and me and me alone,”

13
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:17,590
then it will have an effect, because these
[words of mine] are mantras.

14
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,009
And that’s why it is wasted

15
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,069
because whatever is given to you is thrown
onto another person.

16
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:34,509
So the attention, that you have, is the only
way to know the reality.

17
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:39,859
Your own attention is important, not the attention
of others

18
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:42,979
or your attention on others!

19
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,670
This must be clearly understood.

20
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,560
If you understand this point that the whole
thing

21
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,090
is to be consumed by you,

22
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,700
through your attention to raise yourself to
a higher situation,

23
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,460
it will work out.

24
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,459
Otherwise, it is like giving food to you

25
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:00,209
and going to another person who is getting
nourished,

26
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:02,209
while you are getting nothing.

27
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:06,979
And that person also may not be able get nourished,

28
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:09,709
because he doesn’t know that you are throwing
it to that person.

29
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:14,590
So today, as I am going to speak to you about
attention,

30
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:21,360
you should know that your attention should
absorb all that I am saying.

31
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,750
It is not meant for anybody else.

32
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,409
You better sit in thoughtless awareness, that’s
the best way,

33
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:29,810
so that it goes into you.

34
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,370
Otherwise it’s like a lecture, you know.

35
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,640
That you listen to me has no effect.

36
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,650
Every lecture will transform you because,
after all, I am speaking.

37
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,390
But because you always think of others

38
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,639
and you think of your problems all the time

39
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,870
– something nonsensical is going on, about
which you are worried –

40
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,840
and the attention is so overloaded

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,819
that whatever is said to you doesn’t go
into you.

42
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,390
So, just now, utilise it by being attentive
and knowing

43
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,569
that all these nonsensical things have no
value.

44
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:11,930
It’s your attention that has to come up
and has to grow.

45
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:29,799
So, attention is the whole of the canvas of
your being

46
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,040
– is a complete canvas, is the attention.

47
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,430
Complete canvas of your being is the attention.

48
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,139
How much you have gone into it, how much you
have discovered it,

49
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:49,730
how far you have raised it is a different
point.

50
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,900
Attention is Chitta and God is attention.

51
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:01,739
How far your attention has been enlightened
is a different point.

52
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:09,849
But your attention is God

53
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:13,310
– if you become enlightened to that extent.

54
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,910
It is like a canvas.

55
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:24,340
You can say it is like a canvas which is spread
out for a film,

56
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:33,949
and whatever aptitudes or, you can say, the
drags or movements, your attention has,

57
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:36,569
shows on that canvas.

58
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:43,720
I don’t know what is the word for ‘vritti’
in English language.

59
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:51,659
It’s not aptitude, but a person gets prone
to, or his attention is dragged to

60
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:55,410
– I don’t know [if] there is a word like
that in English language – vritti.

61
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:01,880
Can you suggest any word?

62
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,780
So our attention is just a pure, completely
pure canvas

63
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:18,539
and is acted upon by the three gunas we have,
to begin with.

64
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:21,210
And the three gunas come to you, as you know,

65
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,710
one from your past, one from your future sense
and one from the present.

66
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:40,379
Now, whatever have been your experiences about
a particular thing or a particular occasion,

67
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,610
so far, is completely recorded in your memory.

68
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,860
For example, if you see the black colour:

69
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:56,840
all that goes with the black colour is recorded
in your memory.

70
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:09,460
As soon as you see this black colour, quite
a lot of it comes up.

71
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:16,110
That means, as soon as you see this with your
attention,

72
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,020
the attention gets muddled up, or you can
say the attention gets coloured

73
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,580
with all the memories about this black colour.

74
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:36,120
And then your action takes place according
to the way your attention is affected.

75
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:43,139
For example, just now something was burned
by these flames.

76
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:48,599
Now, all of you became aware of it.

77
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:53,370
Next time whenever you will see a flame,

78
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,889
first thing [that] will happen will be that
you will be cautious about it.

79
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:00,539
It is not going to happen again,

80
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:03,860
but the whole memory will come to you

81
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,740
and you will try to be cautious or warn others,

82
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:14,509
because your attention will become aware of
that

83
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:20,360
as soon as you will see that, because that
canvas of your attention

84
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,760
itself will start throwing out these pictures,
out of itself,

85
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,510
through your past experiences, on to the canvas.

86
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,949
This is a living canvas.

87
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:46,439
Or may be that 
if you have got some ideas which you have

88
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,439
premeditated,

89
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,879
or thought of, of the future.

90
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,400
For example, you must have thought of somebody
that,

91
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,360
“If I meet that man I will tell him like
this.”

92
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,560
As soon as you will meet that man,

93
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,780
your attention will start bubbling out with
those ideas

94
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,599
that are coming about this man, and you will
start addressing to him accordingly.

95
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,659
It’s all stored up within you,

96
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,080
whether it is about the future or about the
past.

97
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,199
It’s given out of the attention through
that bubbling process

98
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:30,539
which depends on your dragging nature, where
are you dragged.

99
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:31,680
That’s called as vritti,

100
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,130
but I don’t know what you call it in English
language.

101
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,960
I do not know what is the, what you are prone
to (tendency).

102
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,450
Vritti is a very neutral word.

103
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,520
It doesn’t mean anything bad.

104
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,110
It means where you are drawn to.

105
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,730
Vritti means a temperament by which you are
drawn to.

106
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,940
And whatever is your temperament, it acts
like that.

107
00:08:52,940 --> 00:09:00,110
For example, if you see a man walking, say,
blindly

108
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,110
– he cannot see things –

109
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,320
one person may get angry with that person,

110
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,060
another may have pity for that person,

111
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,440
third may come forward to help him out.

112
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,990
It’s the vritti, it’s the temperament,

113
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,600
that you have developed through your three
gunas.

114
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:31,260
That’s why this attention becomes identified
with you.

115
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:39,650
And when you are identified with this, your
vritti, your temperaments,

116
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:45,380
then you are still in a misidentified area.

117
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:51,780
Let us take a case of somebody who has been
possessed before.

118
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:57,640
Now, coming to Sahaja Yoga his possession
goes away.

119
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:03,170
But the memory remains in the brain that he
was possessed.

120
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:09,330
And [if] the memory is stronger in a person,
left side is stronger,

121
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:18,090
then that memory lingers on, and as soon as
that person comes in contact with anyone

122
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,550
which has got something to do with the past
possession, it clicks.

123
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:26,400
And the whole thing starts coming into you
bubbling out

124
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,000
and you think you are again possessed.

125
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,210
It is the memory which gives you [this reaction].

126
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,560
It’s a myth.

127
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:45,070
It’s the memory that tells you, “Oh, you
are again possessed!”

128
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,150
Because your left side is weak, means you
always live in your memory.

129
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,400
Your memory is stronger than yourself.

130
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,670
If you could make yourself stronger than your
memory, nothing can possess you.

131
00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:05,550
But after you get your Realisation,

132
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:12,930
you are not still identified with that state
of mind

133
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:21,740
in which you see your ego and superego as
myths.

134
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:29,620
Still you get caught up into your ego and
superego,

135
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,860
and that’s why your attention is still in
a mess.

136
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:42,600
In a pure simple way of attention in an innocent
child,

137
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,860
he sees everything in pratyaksha,

138
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,500
means in actual experiencing of something
– for a child –

139
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,250
because he has no memory.

140
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:59,560
So he’ll have to burn his hand to feel that
this burns.

141
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,410
He has to touch something cold to know that
it is cold.

142
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,520
His memory is not yet built up.

143
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:16,980
So into the actual experiencing of it he lives.

144
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,160
But that actual experiencing becomes memory.

145
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,500
And once the memory is built up stronger,

146
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,130
the whole personality is affected by memory.

147
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,020
All the conditioning of all kinds come through
that;

148
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:38,150
your reading, even the whole atmosphere can
come to you.

149
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:42,530
You see, sometimes you smell a particular
soap,

150
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,240
or say a rose, you smell it –

151
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,140
then all the memories of smelling such a rose,
sometimes,

152
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,270
comes to you and you may feel really elated
sometimes,

153
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,880
maybe sometimes, maybe, or sometimes very
unhappy,

154
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,190
whatever may be the situation.

155
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,600
So you may feel happy or unhappy.

156
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,830
Because, whatever experiences you have had,

157
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,061
has given you a memory.

158
00:13:09,061 --> 00:13:13,780
This memory might have given you a superego,

159
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,320
or might have given you a ego.

160
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,060
This scanning might have taken place.

161
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,850
If it has been a ego and a superego,

162
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,010
then may be that, if it was ego you must have
felt happy.

163
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:32,270
If it is satisfying to your ego you feel very
happy.

164
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:37,640
If it is not, if it is superego, if you are
suppressed by this,

165
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,630
then you feel very unhappy.

166
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,370
So both things like happiness or unhappiness

167
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:47,730
are the states where you are still in the
myth,

168
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,120
still the myth exists.

169
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
You have to still go beyond.

170
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,720
So if you feel happy about some situation,
you should know you

171
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,750
are only happy before Realisation,

172
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,440
because it is giving some support to your
ego to bloat.

173
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:10,990
And if you are unhappy, then you should know
that

174
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,650
there is some sort of a suppression on your
ego

175
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,180
and there’s a superego developing.

176
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:24,060
So both the situations have been of no help
to you,

177
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:29,230
of no help to you for your growth,

178
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,740
except that both these institutions develop
so much

179
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:42,040
that you are away from the real experiencing.

180
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,940
The real experiencing stops

181
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:51,050
because your attention is so much muddled
up.

182
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:56,670
So on one side if you move – on the left
hand side –

183
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:05,730
your attention is muddled up with fear, with
pain,

184
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:14,800
with unhappiness, with hopelessness, dejection.

185
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,029
The other side, if you indulge too much on
to the right hand side

186
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:22,650
– little bit also –

187
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:28,260
you start getting elated, excited, over-dominating.

188
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:39,070
The colour of the left side is blue.

189
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,280
And the blue colour starts changing to the
black.

190
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:49,200
While on the right hand side it is, to begin
with, yellow,

191
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,710
light yellow or you can say golden,

192
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,970
then yellow, then orange and then red.

193
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,380
So you go to aggression on the right hand
side.

194
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:09,010
On the left hand side you go into a complete
state of

195
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,510
entropy, you can call it,

196
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:16,040
or a state where you are separated from yourself

197
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,940
into a complete frozen state.

198
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,390
So [on] one side you become completely frozen,

199
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:25,050
on the other side you become completely heated
up.

200
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:32,480
Both these things are, again, movement on
the wrong direction.

201
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,790
Even in the centre when the attention is kept

202
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,410
– that you keep your attention more in the
centre –

203
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,800
there also, because it’s a very sensitive
point,

204
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,860
it doesn’t stay there.

205
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,020
For example,

206
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:55,560
when we, say, use fire, we can use it for
burning the house.

207
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:03,710
In the same way we can use it for creating
smoke.

208
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:10,399
But we can also use this fire in its proper
way, if we use it,

209
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:15,079
in its proper proportion, for cooking the
food [or] for giving us light.

210
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:22,329
If it is too much, it can burn like a big
fire.

211
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,980
If it is too little, it can burn like smoke.

212
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,639
But in the center when you know how to balance
it,

213
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:31,789
then you can use it for your own purpose

214
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:40,149
– for cooking or for giving light, and then
for a puja too.

215
00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:49,429
So in the same way when we really balance
our gunas properly,

216
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:59,090
then we become gradually the master of the
whole situation.

217
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:05,330
The attention doesn’t get dragged

218
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,730
into things that we have been doing

219
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,490
or that we have understood through our memories

220
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,650
or through our experiences or whatever it
is,

221
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:17,000
and is not also dragged towards, too much,
on the right hand side

222
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,429
that we try to overpower, or try to dominate
someone.

223
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:25,049
Because if you move too much that side you
have seen [that]

224
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:26,090
it becomes blood.

225
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,210
It is difficult for people to understand how,

226
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:35,269
when people become very religious-minded,
like now Iran,

227
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:39,030
the movement is on the right

228
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,970
– all the austerities, all that, everything
– now bloodshed.

229
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,149
Christians also did the same.

230
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:49,650
Brahmins did the same in India.

231
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:55,100
Buddhists did the same, even [though] they
talked of nonviolence

232
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:01,610
they got to bloodshed, because movement started
[on the] right hand side.

233
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:07,690
Left hand side movement will take you to very
sly and dark methods.

234
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:12,769
So right-handed sided people – like big
nations

235
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:16,169
who are supposed to be developed nations –

236
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:17,750
they justify war.

237
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,940
“We must have weapons to face each other.”

238
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,669
But you all, each other, are the same people
from God’s point of view!

239
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:30,049
Why are you fighting?

240
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:32,710
When God asks you, “Why are you fighting,
what is the need?

241
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,960
Why don’t you sit down properly and listen
to each other?

242
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,740
What are you fighting about?

243
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,880
You are fighting about land.

244
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,559
Is it your father’s land?

245
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,059
It belongs to God!

246
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:43,940
God has created this land.

247
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,210
Why are you fighting?”

248
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,169
But your attention is such that immediately
you think,

249
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:50,899
“Oh, this is my land, this is my motherland,

250
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,690
this is my fatherland, this is my brotherland.”

251
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,420
But what about your land which is within you?

252
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,100
It’s not your own!

253
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:04,879
So if you go on telling these people that
we should have no war they will not listen.

254
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:06,740
Realisation is the only way.

255
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,879
By Realisation your attention gets higher

256
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:15,289
and gets separated from that strata from where
these things bubble in.

257
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:18,710
Do you understand my point now?

258
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,360
The strata goes higher,

259
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,730
the attention goes higher, at a higher state.

260
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:32,950
By right side movement you get vikshepa, confusion.

261
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,399
First you get confusion.

262
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:38,860
Every intellectual, whatever brilliant he
may be, he is confused.

263
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,440
And the more confused he is, the more he asserts
himself

264
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,250
because he is confused, he’s not sure of
himself, so he asserts,

265
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,799
“This is the thing; this is the thing.”

266
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,030
I mean, if it is so, why should you assert
it?

267
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:54,360
But he goes on asserting, “This is the thing!”

268
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,139
Then understand that now he is going towards
lunatic asylum – absolutely!

269
00:20:57,139 --> 00:21:02,330
And the way he asserts, and goes on talking
about it,

270
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:08,090
all the time, that means he is not sure.

271
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:11,780
He becomes like a possessed personality.

272
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:18,740
When he explains everything through his brains
that

273
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,870
“This is the thing.

274
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,870
This is correct.

275
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:21,870
We must all do, this is what…”

276
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,690
and he convinces many others who are confused
like him.

277
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:25,920
They depend on him.

278
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,659
He becomes a leader because, you see,

279
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:29,779
they are much more confused

280
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:32,730
and they find somebody who is not so much
confused outwardly

281
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,679
[so] they stick on to him, and all of them
get to war

282
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:41,840
or some sort of a bloodshed or some sort of
– they want to see blood.

283
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,049
They become heartless, passionless, compassionless,

284
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:53,480
you can say – compassionless, loveless people.

285
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,480
The other movement is the blue side, is like
the blue moonlight.

286
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,659
So, for the romanticism starts.

287
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:02,789
Sitting in the moonlight, you see!

288
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:09,750
The ideas start coming from Lord Byron (laughter).

289
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:15,740
And they come into your attention

290
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,561
– then it becomes very strong passion with
you.

291
00:22:18,561 --> 00:22:23,390
You think, “Oh, I am still, I have to find
out my loves!”

292
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:28,629
And you go on in search of your loves and
this and that.

293
00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:32,160
These things are not really giving joy.

294
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:38,169
That’s why so many poems have been written
that,

295
00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:43,980
“Love is the most painful thing, it’s
worse than death,”

296
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,090
and all sorts of poems are written like that

297
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,220
so why did you get into it?

298
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,450
I mean, it’s already written down, books
after books,

299
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,379
still why do you get into it? (laughing)

300
00:22:56,379 --> 00:22:59,940
You are already warned about it that,

301
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,559
“Don’t go after love, love is deception,
love is this, that,

302
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:08,039
it is very temporary, it is for the little
while you get that.”

303
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:11,950
By chance, if somebody could stop at a point

304
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,649
by marrying somebody who is sweet enough and
realise

305
00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:21,700
that love and marriage and all these things
are in the centre,

306
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,169
are like the fire in the kitchen,

307
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:27,740
are like the fire in the temple:

308
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:34,860
looks after it and doesn’t overdo something
about it.

309
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:39,499
Then maybe that this may be utilized.

310
00:23:39,499 --> 00:23:45,480
In the same way the right side movement of
the Sun line.

311
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,190
If people think that, yes, the sun is important,

312
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,360
we have to have sun in the house,

313
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:57,649
but you are not to become naked and insult
the Sun and get your skin cancer!

314
00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:02,649
Sun is not for your skin cancer!

315
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:07,529
But if you overdo it, also it is dangerous.

316
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:13,970
A person who exposes himself too much to planning

317
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,730
and doing that, and doing this, and doing
all this,

318
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,440
can land up into very great difficulties.

319
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,869
So you have to balance that side also

320
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:28,179
and this side and you have to be in the centre,
in the equilibrium.

321
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:33,049
Now this word ‘equilibrium’ doesn’t
exist in our day-to-day life.

322
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:35,320
It exists only in the fiction

323
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,390
or may be in the so-called scientific research.

324
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,460
But as far as human beings are concerned,

325
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,259
they do not know what is equilibrium is.

326
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:50,190
Because of this, the attention, though after
Realisation

327
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:54,990
comes up, still on the sides they just go
down,

328
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,970
this side or that side according to your vrittis.

329
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,830
And when these identifications still act in
them,

330
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:07,659
they are prone to go down again in their attention

331
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:16,960
and again start bubbling out the same thing
as they had.

332
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:23,899
Now one has to become lighter in one’s own
mind

333
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:26,010
and should think that,

334
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:30,059
“We have dropped all that now why are we
there?”

335
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:35,110
One should become lighter with all that load
flowing out,

336
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:43,120
because you are here to raise your attention
higher and higher

337
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,470
so that you come up to a point

338
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,259
where you become one with the attention of
God.

339
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:57,179
Already your attention is sparkled because
through your attention

340
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:58,200
you can see what’s wrong with you,

341
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,539
you can see what’s wrong with others

342
00:26:01,539 --> 00:26:05,980
and you can see how far you are going with
yourself.

343
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:11,659
But the progress is retarded because you do
not know that this attention

344
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:15,659
is pure form and all that you get into this
attention

345
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:24,450
is a mythical stuff, is a myth.

346
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:30,840
If you drop this myth gradually, treat everything
as a myth

347
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,600
and not depend on becoming unhappy or happy

348
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,621
– just seeing the thing –

349
00:26:36,621 --> 00:26:37,950
[then] your attention will take a flight

350
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:42,700
and it will be at a much higher level residing
there.

351
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:48,519
Instead of that, every moment you go this
way or that way

352
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:50,210
– it goes on like that –

353
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,940
and the movement upwards is much less.

354
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,309
Even in Sattvoguna, when you rise,

355
00:26:56,309 --> 00:27:00,669
you can go much worse in that condition also.

356
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:04,750
For example, if you say that, “I am trying
to be Sattwoguni.”

357
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:14,610
In Sattwoguni it is that you start seeing
everything,

358
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,039
discriminating through your understanding

359
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,929
– not through vibrations – through understanding:

360
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:20,929
“Oh!

361
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:27,409
Should we not somehow or the other take out
our attention from here?”

362
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:30,679
“Should we not give up this?”

363
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:32,320
“Should we be charitable?”

364
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,130
“Should we go and serve the people?”

365
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,900
There are people who think,

366
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,559
“Oh, we are going to do something great!”

367
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,490
– like your Salvation Army.

368
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,989
Let them be salvaged by themselves!

369
00:27:44,989 --> 00:27:48,340
I don’t know what salvation they are going
to do.

370
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,080
So these ideas – ideas, I am saying – of
Sattvoguna,

371
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,999
can also immobilise you and can really freeze
you down once for all,

372
00:27:57,999 --> 00:28:02,350
and that also can work in you in such a sly
manner,

373
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:07,260
we can say, in such a secretive manner,

374
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,610
that you won’t feel it.

375
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:11,590
All these ideas of helping others, being charitable,

376
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,429
“Let’s have a charity association!”

377
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:14,429
– finished!

378
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:16,789
Once you work in a charity association,

379
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:18,879
your attention is finished there.

380
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:23,399
But if your attention goes higher

381
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:25,440
– say [as] my attention is.

382
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,509
I am only nothing but charity!

383
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:29,049
I mean what am I?

384
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:31,899
It just flows.

385
00:28:31,899 --> 00:28:36,049
You just become the charity.

386
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:39,330
So the difference between

387
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,269
a person who is a realised and a not realised
is this

388
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:51,679
that the attention which was giving myth as
reality to you

389
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,789
is gone now, is gone higher.

390
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:57,529
It can see that it is myth.

391
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:00,909
Attention can clearly see that it is myth,

392
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:03,659
and you can see that yourself

393
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:08,100
and you can remove yourself from them.

394
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,850
That, of course, I have to give you a push,
no doubt,

395
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,450
and I am working hard on that to give you
a push.

396
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,749
But you should also know that mythical things
must be dropped out,

397
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:22,039
otherwise you will not grow.

398
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:26,700
All mythical things must be dropped out.

399
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,169
And the best way to do it is to be in thoughtless
awareness

400
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:32,880
because as soon as you transcend these three
gunas

401
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,639
you become thoughtlessly aware.

402
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:36,029
You have to cross Agya.

403
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:39,090
Once you cross Agya, these three gunas,

404
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:42,919
absolutely you go into a state where you are
gunateet,

405
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:44,659
you are beyond gunas.

406
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:51,940
So you do not deliberately do anything,

407
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:57,169
but it just works out.

408
00:29:57,169 --> 00:30:01,259
But analysis is one of the diseases of the
West.

409
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:03,149
What are you analysing?

410
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:04,149
What are you analysing?

411
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:05,269
You ask yourself.

412
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:08,620
I feel like laughing at the whole analysis
that goes on.

413
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:13,809
See, they’ll sit down, take out a hair,
splitting the hair into hundred!

414
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:17,700
And great analysers are sitting down there!

415
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,210
They cannot even say how the chromosomes

416
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,289
have that spindle action

417
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:29,320
and, I mean at that minute level the things
are worked out.

418
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,450
They cannot say how a cell divides.

419
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:41,080
What are they analysing sitting down here?

420
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:47,970
Now, they have analysed for a purpose – also
done for God.

421
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:52,669
Through their analysis now my things are recorded.

422
00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:55,129
Through their analysis I can go to the TV,

423
00:30:55,129 --> 00:30:58,380
if they allow me any time, because of analysis
[it] doesn’t fit into me,

424
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:05,350
they won’t allow, they may not, it might
be expedited.

425
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,149
But say, for example, if you had not discovered
these things –

426
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:09,460
for example take it like that –

427
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,720
and the science was not discovered,

428
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:20,889
your attention would have been at least better
off.

429
00:31:20,889 --> 00:31:24,659
Because of science, your attention is also
very much in confusion.

430
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:33,359
So I don’t know which one to praise, whether
the science or the primitiveness.

431
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,210
When you raised yourself to science also,

432
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,580
you got to another extreme as usual.

433
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:44,129
Till you burnt out your complete attention,
you were not satisfied.

434
00:31:44,129 --> 00:31:46,481
I mean if you had kept your balance in science
also

435
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:47,481
it would have helped, but the balance was
lost there.

436
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:56,360
Give anything to human beings and they know
how to make the worst out of it.

437
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,490
They will go to the extreme.

438
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,440
You give them a horse,

439
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,190
they cannot go ordinary trotting or galloping,

440
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,239
they must have a double gallop, till they
fall and die!

441
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:12,210
Everything you see, they just are on the run
all the time.

442
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,950
So first thing is needed is to steady down
yourself

443
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:18,090
and tell yourself that, “Now all these mythical
things

444
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,139
I am not going to allow to come to my attention.”

445
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:26,389
All these things are nothing but myths.

446
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:30,730
But you are giving too much importance to
myths.

447
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:33,110
You are taking them bit so seriously.

448
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,270
They are just mythical.

449
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:38,299
Now, I mean, when you are realised now you
laugh at people

450
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:42,470
who just go mad over say, a moonlit night.

451
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,470
Alright?

452
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:48,419
But ask the fellow who is doing that,

453
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:54,513
he’ll say, “You are heartless, you have
no feelings!” (laughter)

454
00:32:54,513 --> 00:32:57,830
He’ll give you a big poetry out of it.

455
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,989
You go and see anyone of these people who
are riding a high horse,

456
00:33:00,989 --> 00:33:02,590
who are at the helm of affairs,

457
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:06,259
and you will feel like laughing at them.

458
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:10,190
But they will think that, “You are useless,
you are doing no work,

459
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:13,450
you are good for nothing, you are just wasters.”

460
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:20,970
So now for you, because you are enlightened
now, is to understand

461
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:29,100
that our attention has to move higher and
higher, at a higher space.

462
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,730
Now actually what has happened in Realisation?

463
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:37,879
Your Kundalini has risen and has come up,

464
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:48,019
just like, you can say, a small, thin hair,
one hair,

465
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:54,549
and that has broken your Sahastrara

466
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:58,039
and now the grace is flowing into you.

467
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:02,549
But it’s a very small movement that has
taken place, of course

468
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:09,090
which is a very difficult movement no doubt,
but it has taken place.

469
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:14,570
Now you have not expanded like this.

470
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,250
Your chakras are only pierced in the centre,

471
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:21,100
but the rest of the attention is still intact.

472
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:26,510
Actually it is so intact, that you don’t
even feel that it is pierced.

473
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:33,670
Now you have to expand that, open it out,

474
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:42,700
so that more strands of Kundalini can rise
and your attention,

475
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:49,320
which is in these centers, expands.

476
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,000
By expansion it drives out all that is mythical
on the sides.

477
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,880
On every centre we have our attention,

478
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,880
which is being enlightened in the centre

479
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,640
through this Light passing through.

480
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:12,940
But the Light is too small for the darkness
that you have collected.

481
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,650
Specially for the people of the West, I would
say,

482
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:21,160
your confusions, you must get rid of them.

483
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,070
But still you identify.

484
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,590
Because if I ask you anything [like], “How
are you?”

485
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,500
Means what?

486
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:37,930
Means you are still confused.

487
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,690
Alright?

488
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,590
Confusion should go.

489
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,930
One confusion was there that,

490
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,270
“This is Realisation or not?”

491
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,190
I hope that’s over now with you people.

492
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,060
At least now you believe it is Self-realisation.

493
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,280
I had to tell people, “No, you are self-realised
now, you are!”

494
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,860
Still they would jump up like [a] jack-in-the-box,
you see.

495
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,440
They’ll say, “No, we’re not Mother!

496
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,950
How do you say this is Realisation?”

497
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:08,130
“We expect this out of Realisation and that
out of Realisation

498
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,940
– that we’ll be flying out of the door
if we are Realised,”

499
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,870
or something nonsensical like that.

500
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,350
Thank God, these ideas have gone away.

501
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:20,970
But when we are Realised, there is Light that
has come in us,

502
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:25,290
we have to grow it only by separating our
attention

503
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,240
from the myths.

504
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:32,010
It’s all mythical.

505
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,840
I also play with you,

506
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:39,550
because unless and until you are sure,

507
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:47,840
I am not going to give you a wrong idea about
yourself.

508
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,360
I want to see how far still your attention
is moving,

509
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,910
and I know [that] still you are not sure,

510
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:02,030
still you are not sure of yourself,

511
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:09,170
that’s why the confidence is not there.

512
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:16,940
First of all you have to learn how to drive,
then you are tested.

513
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:21,160
There will be five stones put together,

514
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:25,510
the distance will be only that hardly a car
can pass through

515
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,810
and the fellow will say, “You bring it zigzag!”

516
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:32,440
And you cannot do it.

517
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,500
Why?

518
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:39,960
That’s how he makes you a master.

519
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,210
The mastery of your attention

520
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:48,950
will come when you will start seeing that
it is all a myth that upsets you.

521
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,830
It’s all a myth that upsets you.

522
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:57,990
Just throw it away.

523
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:02,340
Just throw it away and understand that you
are

524
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:10,960
the eternal attention, that you are the eternal
life,

525
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:19,730
that [the] only thing that keeps you away
from it is ignorance,

526
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:24,150
and the ignorance is too simple to understand:

527
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:29,650
that you have accepted myth as Truth.

528
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,760
Just drop it!

529
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,050
It’s all myth!

530
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:40,360
You’ll be amazed how your attention will
rise

531
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,520
and you’ll see all these nonsensical things

532
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,350
which used to frighten you or to elate you,

533
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:52,790
will drop out, and you will just smile at
it.

534
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:57,730
And then only you are going to enjoy yourself
fully

535
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:01,630
because your attention will be completely
drenched

536
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,060
into the bliss of Self.

537
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:14,110
I am saying you will, I say you are

538
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,780
already drenched into that bliss.

539
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,850
Keep it up.

540
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:25,390
Now, how to do it?

541
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:37,630
Actually, in every day-to-day life, how to
kill the memory of the past?

542
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:45,050
To kill the memory of the past is to have
new memories.

543
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:49,590
You must remember when you got your first
Realisation

544
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:52,780
– always think of it.

545
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,141
Whenever any such memory comes to you,

546
00:39:55,141 --> 00:40:01,530
you [should] try to think how you got your
Realisation.

547
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:06,920
Any memory that is troublesome or even so-called
elating,

548
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:15,510
you just try to remember how Realisation has
come to you.

549
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:22,800
When you feel aggressive about something or
angry [about] something,

550
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:31,080
just try to remember how you felt the joy
of surrendering.

551
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:36,070
Just think of that joy of surrendering, of
dissolving yourself.

552
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:41,090
So the new memories must be built up.

553
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:43,860
If you start building up new memories,

554
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:49,180
then you will start collecting moments

555
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:57,990
to establish other moments which have such
memories.

556
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:04,060
Like a memory when you tried to help somebody,

557
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,380
you raised the Kundalini of someone.

558
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,800
Now the problem would be

559
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,830
when you will be raising the Kundalini of
others,

560
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:14,220
you will be in thoughtless awareness – there
won’t be any thought –

561
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:19,030
and thought is the only thing which impresses.

562
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:24,950
But [at] that time you can record the joy
of raising the Kundalini.

563
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:31,910
If you could record the joy of raising the
Kundalini

564
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:42,650
of others, you will feel [that] a new wealth

565
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:47,350
of these beautiful moments will be accumulated.

566
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:54,440
And all those moments which were giving you
confusion

567
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:00,540
or fear or so-called unhappiness and happiness
will drop out

568
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,610
and pure joy will remain.

569
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:07,260
Because now most of the experiences you have
had

570
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:11,180
are more of joy.

571
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,420
Joy has no thoughts.

572
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:18,800
It’s just an experience, a pratyaksha.

573
00:42:18,800 --> 00:44:50,550
That’s why I said you keep your eyes open.

574
00:44:50,550 --> 00:47:40,840
I hope 

575
00:47:40,840 --> 00:49:21,520
you will understand what 

576
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:39,900
I mean 

577
00:49:39,900 --> 00:56:22,660
by that.

578
00:56:22,660 --> 00:57:03,760
May 

579
00:57:03,760 --> 01:15:01,639
God bless you all.
