1
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,860
Pranava Mardini Ki!

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,840
Pranava Mardini Ki!

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,960
Pranava Mardini Ki!

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,060
Jai Shri Mataji!

5
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:47,400
I’m sorry what has happened yesterday, but
I think the war has begun between the evil

6
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,960
and good, and after all the good prevails.

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:07,580
In these modern times, evil used to prevail
on good but now in this Kruta Yuga the evil

8
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:30,060
will be completely conquered by good, and
not only that, but good will spread all over.

9
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:42,740
The evil has the capacity to go to extremes
and then to fall out of the evolutionary process

10
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,950
completely.

11
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:59,009
Because they are blind they cannot see the
good that’s why they are evil.

12
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:08,330
If they could see the good they would give
up their evil.

13
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:14,760
In our country which is a country of yoga,
especially Maharastra which is the country

14
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:22,189
of the saints, I was amazed to hear what people
are up to.

15
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:30,930
One of the real source of this nonsense seems
to be Rajneesh, the horrible fellow, because

16
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:39,489
he has made an exhibition here absolutely
denouncing all the deities and saying all

17
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:46,129
kinds of dirty things, and I think the chief
minister of this place is also hand in glove

18
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:53,920
with him and they are all trying to prove
that there is no God, there is no spirituality.

19
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:03,959
They want to establish that science is everything.

20
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:12,650
We have no heritage of science in India, we
have the heritage of spirituality.

21
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:21,860
I mean nobody is known as such a great scientist
in this country.

22
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:31,530
Nobody has made any special inventions and
the way people are organising it in the name

23
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:37,340
of science, there is hardly anyone who has
done anything of science.

24
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:44,639
So it’s the evil which has taken this new
form of talking about science and denouncing

25
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,769
God.

26
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:50,180
Of course in the West also the same thing
has happened to a great extent but not to

27
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,660
that extent.

28
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,569
They have not discarded everything that was
spiritual.

29
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:01,689
But here they have gone headlong, those few
people who are there, very very few, but they

30
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:04,120
are there.

31
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:12,270
So it’s a very bad growth in this country,
it won’t survive I know, it cannot survive

32
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,819
because this country is so full of spirituality.

33
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:23,250
In the West, because people took to science,
they have lost all culture of society.

34
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,760
There is no culture of society.

35
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,120
The etiquettes are limited to fork and spoon
or how you wish each other.

36
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,160
There is no other culture.

37
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:42,910
It’s so outside, there is nothing deep in
it because they have taken absolutely to the

38
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:52,720
modern or we can say that is the industrial
evolution of the people, they have taken to

39
00:04:52,720 --> 00:05:02,449
all that and have lost contact with reality.

40
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:12,270
The culture of any country can only survive
on spirituality.

41
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:19,979
Science cannot talk of this and it has so
many limitations that it cannot even answer

42
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:24,430
simple few questions that are facing them.

43
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:37,819
Above all they have no idea what is love,
they have no idea what is the all pervading

44
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:40,509
power.

45
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:47,100
Now you all have felt it, and you know what
it is, and you know how to use it.

46
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:54,450
So under these circumstances I find that those
people who are mediocres in Sahaja Yoga cannot

47
00:05:54,450 --> 00:06:01,970
help much for establishing goodness.

48
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:07,740
You have to be very clean within yourself,
you have to be very powerful within yourself

49
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,440
and you have to be extremely sensitive.

50
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:18,090
So, we are not to waste our energy, our attention
onto superficial and nonsensical things.

51
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:25,259
We have to get out of it and we have to become
people who are detached, detached from any

52
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,500
things which create problems.

53
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:41,900
If you take a detached view of everything
you will have a kind of a life that will nourish

54
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:48,090
your society which is now sick, is a sick
society, is a decadent society.

55
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:55,569
And for that decadent society you need people
who are very morally strong, who are tremendously

56
00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:00,479
pure and who know everything about Sahaja
Yoga.

57
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:07,970
The mediocrity in Sahaja Yoga is very common
in the West, very common.

58
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:14,889
And so much involved into their personal problems
that I cannot understand how will they rise

59
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:22,199
above this nonsensical, personal viewpoint
of view.

60
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:30,129
So, one has to realise that the whole tree
that has grown outside so much due to industrial

61
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:38,849
revolution has to seek its own nourishment
from spirituality which is in India.

62
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:41,080
No doubt.

63
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,180
Spirituality without development has no meaning.

64
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:52,780
Spirituality has to have development outside
otherwise it is lost in the Mother Earth.

65
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:59,229
It has to sprout and it has to show results,
which we are showing no doubt, in so many

66
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:05,509
ways Indian Sahaja Yogis are trying to show
that, though they are rather slow about that

67
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:06,509
point.

68
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:12,729
So it’s something funny that in the West
people are rather slow, Sahaja Yogis are rather

69
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:22,349
slow about their spirituality, and in India
people are rather slow about their manifestation

70
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:28,500
outside.

71
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:36,070
Unless and until we really do some dedicated
effort it’s not going to work out.

72
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:46,310
So I hope as we have circulated letters that
we have come here not for fun but for dedication

73
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:52,980
and for our ascent and it’s a pilgrimage.

74
00:08:52,980 --> 00:09:02,070
Talking loose, talking about small things,
quarrelling with each other is out of question

75
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:12,280
of course, but domination, terrible domination
of falsehood, just to think that you are leaders,

76
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:19,530
or why is he leader, shows that we are not
yet worthy.

77
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:27,730
So the worthiness of a ship is very important
if it has to fight the turbulence of the sea.

78
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:34,730
If it cannot fight the turbulence of the sea
then it is definitely not seaworthy and it

79
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:39,440
is absolutely useless because it cannot go
across.

80
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,020
In the same way if you have to be something,
you have to work it out in such a manner that

81
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:50,450
you really become worthy of crossing this
ocean of illusion and that many could cross

82
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:55,230
with you.

83
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:00,960
As in India they have started at every place,
at every home, at every family, a center.

84
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,700
If they invite people, they talk about nothing
but Sahaja Yoga.

85
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,970
Now you can go all out to talk about it, I
give you permission to tell them that I have

86
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,180
come, there’s nothing to hide.

87
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:29,510
And you have to go and open the doors of many
churches and many temples and many organisations

88
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,260
and tell them that I am there.

89
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,170
Now the time has come, you can see it so clearly,
it’s so obvious.

90
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:41,160
First I used to say I would not go to the
newspapers, this not good that’s not good,

91
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
let us work it out.

92
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,650
But it has come now so much, that I have to
say things and I am going to say them, very

93
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,690
openly, I am going to say them.

94
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:56,660
But I want all of you to be such that nobody
should point out a finger at you to say, “Oh,

95
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:09,040
this is a Sahaja Yogi and how this Sahaja
Yogi is behaving."

96
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:16,080
If somebody is stupid and not working it out
is better to get rid of such a person.

97
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:23,070
Or else help that person and tell him that
“you have to come out, you can’t be here,

98
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,620
we don’t want mediocre people here.

99
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:32,690
We want some very extraordinarily, pure people.“

100
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,420
The purity is the main point which we have
to have.

101
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,740
Once you are pure you don’t have to worry,
then I look after you.

102
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,920
But the purity of mind, purity of heart and
the purity of your attention, these three

103
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,940
things are very important.

104
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:52,610
When it works out, you’ll be surprised,
collectivity will grow in no time.

105
00:11:52,610 --> 00:12:00,320
Is a tendency among Sahaja Yogis also, still,
to go back to the same materialism and to

106
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,690
try to have your own house, your family, your
children, this sort of a nonsense.

107
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:12,400
We have to be in the ashrams, we have to work
it out, we have to work it out very beautifully

108
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,130
that we all live very happily in the ashram.

109
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:22,070
But I find still people cannot work it out
that way.

110
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:27,270
They are more concerned about their jobs,
concerned about their things.

111
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,080
Once you live in the ashram I’ll see that
you get everything.

112
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:39,500
But if you do not want to have the blessings
of God, how can anybody help you?

113
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,100
So tremendous sacrifice is needed.

114
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,950
Of course as you know in Sahaja Yoga I don’t
need any money from you at all, but sacrifice

115
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:54,100
is very important, and sacrifice of nonsensical
ideas that you have.

116
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,970
In every way we have to show that we Sahaja
Yogis: the way you dress up, the way you live,

117
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:03,320
the way you think, the way you behave, the
way you have relationships with each other

118
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:13,000
and the way you lead your married life and
the way you look at your children.

119
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,470
Unless and until you have purity the light
of love will not shine, the light of love

120
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:27,910
will not shine.You have to absorb the light
of love within yourself, but you cannot unless

121
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,850
and until you are a pure personality.

122
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:37,020
And that pure personality has to develop by
your meditation, by working hard, it’s a

123
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,020
question of few years.

124
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,870
In 10 years we can change the whole world,
in 10 years!

125
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,320
But you have to be really very dedicated.(applause)

126
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:55,750
It is you who has to change, not Me.

127
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,560
You have to work it out, not Me.

128
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,970
I have done my level best but within 10 years
it should be possible that every Sahaja Yogi

129
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,820
should become a tremendous force of Sahaja
Yoga.

130
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,340
So please try to avoid all those who are mediocres.

131
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:20,330
If you find mediocrity, the leaders must go
all out to correct them, all out to tell them

132
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,330
off.

133
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,330
Don’t tolerate.

134
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:28,180
You don’t have to be very mild on this point,
you have to tell them frankly that “See

135
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:36,740
now you are an extremely mediocre person for
Sahaja Yoga, is not meant for mediocres, is

136
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:42,200
not meant for foolish people, is not meant
for stupid people, it’s meant for something

137
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,790
who are ready to sacrifice anything for the
sake of truth.“

138
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:52,170
These people are saying that “Why don’t
you go the way of science?”

139
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:57,710
I say “Why don’t you go the way of truth?”

140
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,920
Take to truth.

141
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
Science is not truth.

142
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,770
Today it might appear, tomorrow it disappears.

143
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:10,931
Today you may think it is correct but every
hypothesis is challenged, every law is challenged,

144
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:14,040
that’s no law.

145
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,590
You have to use Sahaja Yoga in every practical
life everywhere.

146
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,220
But in no way you have to be fanatic about
it.

147
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:30,670
Like I have seen some people start giving
vibrations or they start moving their hands

148
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,770
for bandhans, even if I am sitting they are
doing like that.

149
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:41,710
There is no stupidity about it, it has to
be very dignified, decent and decorous.

150
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:52,330
But for that we need really people of quality
and a complete obedience is needed I must

151
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,330
say.

152
00:15:53,330 --> 00:16:00,700
I have told Indian people that time that they
must have a proper case done for them, they

153
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,550
just didn’t listen to Me that time, they
said “Mother, why do you want, you’ll

154
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,070
be in trouble”, and all that.

155
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,660
If they had listened to Me there would have
been no trouble today.

156
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:17,120
But you must listen to Me what I say, don’t
give Me explanations, don’t give Me logic,

157
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,910
but I know everything you know that.

158
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,830
I know everything.

159
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,040
Now we have something good for you is the
list of the marriages.

160
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,710
But marriage is not such an important thing
that you think about.

161
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:39,790
It’s not such an important thing for you
that you dedicate all your attention to that.

162
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,270
It’s just by the way, because you have to
have a marriage, that’s why.

163
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,140
There’s no need even to have sometimes.

164
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,660
But you have to have it, and then letters
after letters about your marriages, about

165
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,110
your children, I just don’t want to read
that.

166
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:01,010
Nothing about Sahaja Yoga.

167
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:05,990
If you are detached, whatever may be the quality
of your wife, you will not fall, whatever

168
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,220
may be the quality of your husband, you will
not fall.

169
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:18,709
So one has to be little concerned that: What
are we doing?

170
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:21,240
What have we achieved?

171
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,009
What are we going to give to the world?

172
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:34,049
For Me, you are My instruments.

173
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:36,530
I don’t have to ask anybody else.

174
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:42,250
You are My instruments and you have to work
it out.

175
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,899
You are not for Me useless people, I worked
very hard with you, very hard.

176
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:53,620
So please don’t waste My energies also and
try to become very good Sahaja Yogis in every

177
00:17:53,620 --> 00:18:02,389
way that is possible, in every way you should
be dedicated, in every way try to be something

178
00:18:02,389 --> 00:18:04,639
of very great qualities.

179
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:09,210
Now you have seen how people have becoming
violent and there is a violence on.

180
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:14,659
Of course, this may not continue but it’s
one of the signs that we have to be prepared

181
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:22,230
to be very strong people, very strong, and
that will work out I’m sure.

182
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:29,279
They threw about 400 stones at least, maybe
more according to the police report and very

183
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:31,559
few people were hurt.

184
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,120
What does that mean?

185
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,299
That there is somebody who is avoiding all
these troubles.

186
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:48,159
Regarding our tour further, now I have decided
we will not go to Atith because the commissioner,

187
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:54,100
the ESP, has told Me that it is better not
to go, that these people are very bad that

188
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,100
they are criminals.

189
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,000
So now until the election comes in they will
be behaving like this manner.

190
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,510
After the election of course they will be
put down.

191
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:10,429
So you should go by the understanding of the
time and directly to Sangli, so we’ll go

192
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:14,190
to Sangli, we will have a puja there, you
can do shopping whatever you like and then

193
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,750
from there will be going to Ganapatipule.

194
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:23,690
But it’s not fun, it’s not fun.

195
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,460
It is our development.

196
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:34,399
Otherwise you will be coming to India, going
back the same empty handed.

197
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:40,620
I want you everyone to be extremely active
in your own sphere of life, to talk about

198
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,620
Sahaja Yoga.

199
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:47,139
You must wear my badges, you must wear my
rings, you must wear my necklaces so that

200
00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:48,850
people ask you “Who is this?”

201
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:54,180
Then you should say, “She is the Holy Ghost”,
you can say!

202
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,170
“We think she is the Holy Ghost”.

203
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:01,170
Let us see what happens.

204
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:07,820
So, it’s a serious thing that I felt that
I have to talk to you and that we have to

205
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,830
be very, very careful about how we look at
ourselves.

206
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:17,139
We have to be aware, we have to be aware about
ourselves and what is happening.

207
00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:21,299
I’ve been telling you this many a times,
we have to be aware as to what we are and

208
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:22,360
what is happening.

209
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,789
But if your jobs are important, everything
else is important how are you going to work

210
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:30,899
out Sahaja Yoga?

211
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:35,009
So there has to be awareness and with your
awareness the light will spread.

212
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:38,389
But it’s not silent, you have to talk about
it.

213
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:46,630
Eloquence is needed, it has to be eloquent,
all your light has to talk, the light has

214
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:53,110
to say, the light has to express and has to
be very confidently done.

215
00:20:53,110 --> 00:21:00,870
Let us see now after going from this tour
how far people establish new things.

216
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:08,610
So far, what My own opinion is that there
are 50% of Sahaja Yogis in the West are still

217
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:14,630
quite mediocre and 25% of them are just there
to take advantage.

218
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,600
If they can get something free they would
like to do it.

219
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,429
25% people are like that.

220
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:24,289
It’s very sad but it is so.

221
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:29,909
But I must say Indians are poor people but
they will not do anything, they will never

222
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:32,090
take anything free from Me, nothing.

223
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,769
They will not, they are very self respecting.

224
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:38,210
And that is what we have to develop, that
self respect.

225
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:44,100
Like I have seen I had a house in Hounslow,
everybody went there and stayed there free.

226
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,030
Now we have a house there in Shuddy Camp where
everybody who has no job goes and stays there.

227
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,470
It’s such a nonsensical thing.

228
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:56,740
So I’m even afraid to start any ashram in
London because same thing will start.

229
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,139
If they can take advantage they would like
to be there.

230
00:22:00,139 --> 00:22:02,860
Even a spoon they would like to carry like
that.

231
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,389
It’s a shameless thing for a Sahaja Yogi
to behave like that I think.

232
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:13,610
We have to have full self respect and we must
understand that we have to sacrifice, to do

233
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,679
something about it.

234
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,309
Because this is the last leg I would say when
I will be talking to you about all these things

235
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:31,160
in the beautiful atmosphere here on the bank
of Krishna river.

236
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:39,730
We have to understand that the river flows,
it makes a sound, it makes a sound to show

237
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,049
that she/it exists.

238
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:49,379
But we are not only rivers, we are all the
mountains, rivers, everything of the universe

239
00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:57,470
we are, and our manifestation is like a big
zero as if the Mother Earth has been emptied

240
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,470
out.

241
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:06,559
It is time that we should watch ourselves,
see ourselves, what’s wrong with us.

242
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,130
Very important.

243
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:16,340
I had to say this once again and again, but
I don’t like to say these things because

244
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:22,610
I love you so much and I care for you so much
and you people also love Me, but loving Me

245
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,720
is not sufficient, you have to love yourself
and respect yourself.

246
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,129
Only yourself is going to work out.

247
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:37,769
As Shivaji Maharaj said “You must develop
the religion of your Spirit”.

248
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:43,289
That’s what we have to do, is to develop
the religion of our Spirit.

249
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:51,580
And once it happens we can get the whole world
completely emancipated.

250
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:58,769
This is our work and if we fail then it is
the responsibility of Sahaja Yogis and nobody

251
00:23:58,769 --> 00:23:59,769
else.

252
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:05,110
So for everyone I have to tell you that I
don’t have to please you, you have to please

253
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,580
me.

254
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:15,110
For a small thing people react, for a small
thing they feel bad.

255
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,049
If I don’t smile at somebody they feel bad.

256
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:21,889
In little, little things they feel bad and
they react.

257
00:24:21,889 --> 00:24:25,179
If I say anything, they react.

258
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:27,419
So how can anything go into you?

259
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:31,649
If it is such a convexity, how will you absorb
it?

260
00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:36,700
It is important that we should try to absorb
with humility, with understanding.

261
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:42,649
Now you are Sahaja Yogis, you know I am Adi
Shakti, you have had photographs, you have

262
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:46,049
known that I am Adi Shakti – but how much
are we absorbing?

263
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:48,580
How much we are taking within ourselves?

264
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:54,230
This work is much more than any one of the
incarnations had to do, is much more than

265
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:58,630
Christ, is much more than Rama, much more
than Shri Krishna’s.

266
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:06,320
So create such great people among you, because
I have the power, only thing, you have to

267
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,259
have the absorption power, the acceptability.

268
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:16,100
But if you run after something very cheapish
and something very frivolous, it’s impossible.

269
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:25,789
You have to ask for your depth and you have
to take in whatever is emitting from My being.

270
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:31,279
I hope now you all will take it up seriously,
do your meditation every morning whatever

271
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,669
maybe the time.

272
00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:37,840
Every morning you have to do the meditation
and we have to see that we finish our work

273
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,619
in the night and then we do little meditation
and then sleep off.

274
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:47,249
Without meditation you cannot grow and that’s
why everything doing you have to know that

275
00:25:47,249 --> 00:25:53,080
you have to get up in the morning, do your
meditation and then you can take to your work.

276
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,809
Daytime if you want you can rest for a while.

277
00:25:55,809 --> 00:26:00,769
Now we are in such a place that we have time
to rest for a while, but morning time you

278
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:02,840
have to get up whatever time you sleep.

279
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,610
You have to conquer your sleep a little bit,
it gives you lot of lethargy.

280
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:12,570
Last night I don’t think I slept before
3 o’clock or something like that and then

281
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,559
the whole day I’ve been busy writing reports,
this, that.

282
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,149
If I can manage at this age, at your age you
should be able to manage something like that.

283
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:27,210
We have no time to sleep, we have no time
to discuss, argue or to eat our food.

284
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:32,880
We have only time to meditate, that’s all.

285
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,831
I wish all of you absorb My saying and understand
it without reacting to it.

286
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:40,831
Please do not react.

287
00:26:40,831 --> 00:26:43,220
Don’t think “Mother is trying to chastise
you”.

288
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:48,929
No, I’m trying to help you to grow, this
is the way you grow sometimes very fast.

289
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:51,950
So it’s just your growth I am worried about
and nothing else.

290
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,379
May God bless you all.

291
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:58,740
I was very happy the way you were singing
all the songs and the way you expressed yourselves.
