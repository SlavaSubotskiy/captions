00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:01,920
Birthday Puja
Calcutta, India

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,920
21 March 1994

3
00:14:04,262 --> 00:14:20,884
Every year we have birthdays of various people,
and every year we make a vow that this year

4
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:28,904
I will not do this or I will not do that.

5
00:14:28,904 --> 00:14:40,154
This is a very good way of seeing how far
we have come in life.

6
00:14:40,154 --> 00:15:00,704
Many people who really have achieved a very
great height in their spiritual life did not

7
00:15:00,704 --> 00:15:22,964
need a birthday, but every day they felt it's
a birthday to start, to go ahead, to understand,

8
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,314
to learn.

9
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:32,153
Every day is a new year for them.

10
00:15:32,153 --> 00:15:41,143
In our own life we see that our surroundings

11
00:15:41,143 --> 00:15:47,214
change very slowly.

12
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:59,264
Sometimes it is shocking; sometimes you are
surprised how the surroundings are not changing.

13
00:15:59,264 --> 00:16:16,044
But, in a subtle way, there is a tremendous
change that is happening within us and without.

14
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:20,743
The whole atmosphere today is governed by

15
00:16:20,743 --> 00:16:25,154
human beings.

16
00:16:25,154 --> 00:16:38,004
I don't know how far Paramachaitanya works
it out, but it is for us to open ourselves

17
00:16:38,004 --> 00:16:44,434
to new dimensions in our lives.

18
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:56,184
For example, if we find we still have – through
our introspection – we locate that we have

19
00:16:56,184 --> 00:17:04,954
these old, subtle, nonsensical things still
hanging around us, we don't have to vow for

20
00:17:04,954 --> 00:17:07,064
it.

21
00:17:07,064 --> 00:17:18,133
You have to just witness it, and the destructive
path it is taking you to.

22
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:22,104
Immediately you will give up.

23
00:17:22,104 --> 00:17:32,863
You don't have to worry as to put a vow upon
yourself, because now you are samarth, meaning

24
00:17:32,863 --> 00:17:45,803
now you are absolutely empowered.

25
00:17:45,803 --> 00:17:57,193
Whatever you think is wrong, your attention
itself on it will slowly, gradually remove

26
00:17:57,193 --> 00:18:14,443
the doubts
about having those problems, those connections,

27
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:23,194
conditions and ego that are lingering still.

28
00:18:23,194 --> 00:18:27,534
Definitely you will drop them.

29
00:18:27,534 --> 00:18:37,254
With your attention, it will run away.

30
00:18:37,254 --> 00:18:47,304
Then you will realize that every day your
attention is getting purified, getting powerful,

31
00:18:47,304 --> 00:18:51,384
getting compassionate.

32
00:18:51,384 --> 00:19:04,894
Normally, whatever reaction you have in your
attention just disappears, and you start witnessing

33
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:21,214
the whole thing, and your power of attention,
through that witnessing force, acts and it

34
00:19:21,214 --> 00:19:22,724
works.

35
00:19:22,724 --> 00:19:33,484
It works not only on you, but on everything
that surrounds you.

36
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:38,604
Firstly, through your meditation, in that

37
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:46,944
state of meditation, you expand within yourself.

38
00:19:46,944 --> 00:19:51,244
You stay in the present.

39
00:19:51,244 --> 00:19:55,894
The other day, somebody asked Me, "Where was
Your last birthday?"

40
00:19:55,894 --> 00:20:01,574
I just forgot where it was.

41
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:07,274
Otherwise My memory is very good, like an
elephant.

42
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:11,564
But this I forgot.

43
00:20:11,564 --> 00:20:28,824
Perhaps, every time, every day, you live in
the present, and you grow, so you forget when

44
00:20:28,824 --> 00:20:35,824
and where this growth has taken place.

45
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:46,754
My own growth has been like this, that every

46
00:20:46,754 --> 00:21:05,084
time I go to a place, I find very nice new
people coming in and some of the horrible

47
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:10,234
ones from the old lot disappearing.

48
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:23,304
It's something like, when the tree grows,
the leaves go on falling and new leaves start

49
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:25,244
coming.

50
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:38,884
But in Sahaja Yoga, it's something different
I find, that on the tree of Sahaj Yoga very

51
00:21:38,884 --> 00:21:52,204
few, very, very few leaves fall off, and you
sometimes face a lush garden of beautiful

52
00:21:52,204 --> 00:21:54,984
people.

53
00:21:54,984 --> 00:22:08,004
To Me, it's like a miraculous fireworks.

54
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:20,544
It starts like a small line and then opens
up into several beautiful patterns.

55
00:22:20,544 --> 00:22:35,504
It is impossible to envisage or to visualize
what will happen to us, to Sahaj Yog and to

56
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:41,324
all of you.

57
00:22:41,324 --> 00:22:55,244
I have never learned to imagine things, but
the vision that you see is really remarkable,

58
00:22:55,244 --> 00:23:10,304
is very remarkable, that I see all Sahaja
yogis drenched in divine love and expressing

59
00:23:10,304 --> 00:23:27,994
themselves in a very beautiful and very deep
manner.

60
00:23:27,994 --> 00:23:45,054
This, when comes in, that really makes your
attention absolutely enwrapped in such divine

61
00:23:45,054 --> 00:23:49,234
bliss that you forget that moment.

62
00:23:49,234 --> 00:23:53,724
One of those moments are when you celebrate

63
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,624
My Birthday.

64
00:23:55,624 --> 00:24:02,874
I even forget how many years I have lived
on this Earth.

65
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:09,424
Sometimes I say I am seventy-three, sometimes
I say I am seventy – I just don't know.

66
00:24:09,424 --> 00:24:24,484
Because, as I told you, it does not leave
any mark of time, of date, of years, in that

67
00:24:24,484 --> 00:24:25,934
blissful state.

68
00:24:25,934 --> 00:24:35,794
As if sometimes you can think that you went
to see something very beautiful, like Taj

69
00:24:35,794 --> 00:24:46,594
Mahal, without knowing what it is, and suddenly
you find such a beautiful building, unexpectedly.

70
00:24:46,594 --> 00:24:54,194
You just get blindfolded, as they say.

71
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:55,194
In Hindi, say awak.

72
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:59,264
You don't know how to express.

73
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:02,024
You become speechless.

74
00:25:02,024 --> 00:25:09,114
And invariably you'll find, that time you'll
forget the time.

75
00:25:09,114 --> 00:25:13,824
You will forget how you came there.

76
00:25:13,824 --> 00:25:23,073
All the story behind all that finishes off
as soon as you see the reality of the vision.

77
00:25:23,073 --> 00:25:30,744
This reality of the vision is something beyond

78
00:25:30,744 --> 00:25:39,014
even My thinking and imagination.

79
00:25:39,014 --> 00:25:51,884
I cannot, even now, sometimes, believe that
there are so many Sahaja yogis who have got

80
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:57,134
this subtle knowledge.

81
00:25:57,134 --> 00:26:04,054
I never knew that there are so many seekers,
to begin with.

82
00:26:04,054 --> 00:26:08,654
I never knew that there are such subtle people
on this Earth.

83
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:25,894
All over the world, wherever I went, whether
I went to Nepal or to Brazil, suddenly I find

84
00:26:25,894 --> 00:26:33,754
facing so many beautiful seekers.

85
00:26:33,754 --> 00:26:36,994
If you ask Me, "When did You go to Brazil?"

86
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:39,674
I won't be able to tell you the dates.

87
00:26:39,674 --> 00:26:46,754
I have very bad memory for dates for the same
reason, I think, because every time I see

88
00:26:46,754 --> 00:26:48,964
a vision.

89
00:26:48,964 --> 00:26:56,834
And the time also just stops for that moment.

90
00:26:56,834 --> 00:27:01,194
It doesn't express itself.

91
00:27:01,194 --> 00:27:06,554
Nothing is recorded, except for the experience.

92
00:27:06,554 --> 00:27:14,384
And this experience is in an abstract form.

93
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:17,924
You cannot describe.

94
00:27:17,924 --> 00:27:26,844
It is beyond words and beyond any description.

95
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:44,974
At that time you really become thoughtless,
and that is the time we have to really enjoy.

96
00:27:44,974 --> 00:27:48,064
The greatest curse of modern times is the

97
00:27:48,064 --> 00:27:53,374
watch, all the time that we keep.

98
00:27:53,374 --> 00:28:07,534
And all the time we are just seeing the time,
what time it is now, and after two seconds

99
00:28:07,534 --> 00:28:14,034
again also you want to see what is the time.

100
00:28:14,034 --> 00:28:18,994
We have crossed the limits of time – kalatit.

101
00:28:18,994 --> 00:28:25,654
Try to understand why we have crossed, because
time moves according to us.

102
00:28:25,654 --> 00:28:31,094
You can experience it.

103
00:28:31,094 --> 00:28:39,164
The other day I was coming from Delhi, and
in My household everybody seems to be very

104
00:28:39,164 --> 00:28:42,104
particular about time.

105
00:28:42,104 --> 00:28:44,434
So they were after My life, "Come along, come
along.

106
00:28:44,434 --> 00:28:45,574
Getting late, getting late.

107
00:28:45,574 --> 00:28:50,634
Now, you can't just get into the plane," this,
that.

108
00:28:50,634 --> 00:28:52,824
All right.

109
00:28:52,824 --> 00:28:57,044
And when I reached there, they said that "The
plane is still waiting.

110
00:28:57,044 --> 00:29:00,844
It's not … it's not necessary for you to
hurry up.

111
00:29:00,844 --> 00:29:06,294
It will take at least fifteen, twenty minutes
for you to go."

112
00:29:06,294 --> 00:29:12,414
So, also this name of "airport" makes people
really jumpy, I should say.

113
00:29:12,414 --> 00:29:18,414
They have to go to the aeroplane means as
if some war is there or I don't know what

114
00:29:18,414 --> 00:29:22,144
it is.

115
00:29:22,144 --> 00:29:28,574
So far, luckily, I have never missed a plane,
never missed a train in My lifetime.

116
00:29:28,574 --> 00:29:32,864
Though I travel, I think, quite a lot.

117
00:29:32,864 --> 00:29:42,703
I have every time found, invariably, that
the plane itself is waiting for Me.

118
00:29:42,703 --> 00:29:44,494
It won't leave.

119
00:29:44,494 --> 00:29:52,044
Like, I'll give you a very interesting example
today, if you are relaxed.

120
00:29:52,044 --> 00:30:12,573
We were in Prague, and we were supposed to
go to Poland via – again same thing happens

121
00:30:12,573 --> 00:30:17,354
to Me with experience I had – via Vienna.

122
00:30:17,354 --> 00:30:23,294
And we had a very great Sahaja yogi with us
who told Me that the plane will be leaving

123
00:30:23,294 --> 00:30:26,094
at eleven o'clock.

124
00:30:26,094 --> 00:30:29,754
And from the airport he rings Me up, "No,
the plane is leaving at 9:30."

125
00:30:29,754 --> 00:30:37,194
If I want, I can be ready in five minutes
or I can take two hours, depends on.

126
00:30:37,194 --> 00:30:38,194
So I was ready.

127
00:30:38,194 --> 00:30:39,254
I just jumped into the car.

128
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:46,314
We reached the airport, but we were late by
fifteen minutes, and the ground lady started

129
00:30:46,314 --> 00:30:53,504
shouting at Me at the top of her voice, "You
people, you are VIPs, you are this, you are

130
00:30:53,504 --> 00:30:54,504
that."

131
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:56,794
All kinds of things she said to Me.

132
00:30:56,794 --> 00:31:00,263
And this Sahaja yogi could not bear it.

133
00:31:00,263 --> 00:31:07,394
And he felt that it was his mistake – he
told Me a wrong time, “That's why this lady

134
00:31:07,394 --> 00:31:10,263
is shouting at my Mother.”

135
00:31:10,263 --> 00:31:16,374
He couldn't bear it.

136
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:22,484
He was very unhappy.

137
00:31:22,484 --> 00:31:36,603
So, we went into the aeroplane with this lady
shouting behind, and we saw that the pilot

138
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:41,664
and engineers, they were busy with some correction
of the machinery.

139
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:44,724
They said, "It is little bit out of order.

140
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:45,724
It will be ready."

141
00:31:45,724 --> 00:31:46,854
So we sat down.

142
00:31:46,854 --> 00:31:55,184
Now this Sahaja yogi could not bear it, and
his tears started rolling down his eyes.

143
00:31:55,184 --> 00:31:59,094
The another Sahaj yogini, she said, “Brother,
it's all right.

144
00:31:59,094 --> 00:32:00,664
Don't cry."

145
00:32:00,664 --> 00:32:01,674
They were sitting behind Me.

146
00:32:01,674 --> 00:32:03,004
I just turned round.

147
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,484
I said, "It's all right.

148
00:32:06,484 --> 00:32:07,484
Don't worry."

149
00:32:07,484 --> 00:32:10,864
He said, "No Mother, because of me she could
say all these things, you know.

150
00:32:10,864 --> 00:32:12,504
I can't bear it."

151
00:32:12,504 --> 00:32:15,654
And he couldn't stop crying.

152
00:32:15,654 --> 00:32:28,114
Within one minute, the sky which was absolutely
open was covered with big clouds like huge,

153
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:33,044
big elephants walking into the whole area
– very big.

154
00:32:33,044 --> 00:32:43,034
All the Sahaja yogis who were standing also
– on the other side, on top of the airport

155
00:32:43,034 --> 00:32:45,124
– saw it happening.

156
00:32:45,124 --> 00:32:47,684
The whole thing became absolutely jet-black.

157
00:32:47,684 --> 00:32:50,974
"Oh, My God," I said.

158
00:32:50,974 --> 00:32:55,974
"See, the tears of this gentleman has such
powers."

159
00:32:55,974 --> 00:33:03,794
And then the airport people told us that this
plane is out of order, so we have to get down.

160
00:33:03,794 --> 00:33:06,084
So we got down.

161
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,814
We came back.

162
00:33:07,814 --> 00:33:15,764
Then he went to this ground hostess and told
her, "Now, whom should we shout at?

163
00:33:15,764 --> 00:33:19,154
Now the plane is not going, should we shout
at you?

164
00:33:19,154 --> 00:33:23,014
How dare you shout at my Mother and all those
things you said?"

165
00:33:23,014 --> 00:33:34,504
But all the people there at the airport, who
were still in … under the same regime style,

166
00:33:34,504 --> 00:33:36,664
got such a fright.

167
00:33:36,664 --> 00:33:39,414
The manager himself walked to Me.

168
00:33:39,414 --> 00:33:45,294
He said, "For your plane there's still five
hours and if you want out we can give you

169
00:33:45,294 --> 00:33:47,254
permission, all of you can go out."

170
00:33:47,254 --> 00:33:49,733
And he took Me by a special way.

171
00:33:49,733 --> 00:33:53,164
I couldn't understand this reaction.

172
00:33:53,164 --> 00:34:00,424
So I went out and we did some shopping or
something, and when we came back we were surprised.

173
00:34:00,424 --> 00:34:07,454
All the airport was rather stunned by us and
when I walked – that was the only plane

174
00:34:07,454 --> 00:34:12,884
that was leaving – all the traffic had stopped
except for this plane.

175
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:22,504
And when we walked down to board the plane,
the gentleman who was there said, "Mother,

176
00:34:22,504 --> 00:34:25,434
can you help me?"

177
00:34:25,434 --> 00:34:26,434
I said, "How?"

178
00:34:26,434 --> 00:34:27,634
"I have got a terrible back pain."

179
00:34:27,634 --> 00:34:30,304
I said, "How can I do it?"

180
00:34:30,304 --> 00:34:35,404
Then one lady walked in to say, "Mother, please,
I have pain in my shoulder.

181
00:34:35,404 --> 00:34:38,554
Can you put your hand on that?"

182
00:34:38,554 --> 00:34:42,574
I just put My hand on her shoulder and she
said, "I am feeling all right."

183
00:34:42,574 --> 00:34:45,284
She started lifting her arm.

184
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:53,564
Then I went – I thought I'd better now take
to the aeroplane – when I was walking, the

185
00:34:53,564 --> 00:34:55,214
same gentleman came to Me.

186
00:34:55,214 --> 00:34:57,884
He said, "Why not put hand on my back?"

187
00:34:57,884 --> 00:35:00,284
I said, "I have to board the plane."

188
00:35:00,284 --> 00:35:02,044
He said, "I'll walk with You.

189
00:35:02,044 --> 00:35:04,164
You just put your hand on my back.

190
00:35:04,164 --> 00:35:05,814
I'm sure I'll be all right."

191
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:08,834
And we walked together about two minutes or
so.

192
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:11,804
He said, "I'm all right."

193
00:35:11,804 --> 00:35:14,854
The whole atmosphere changed.

194
00:35:14,854 --> 00:35:22,304
It was such a tremendous effect on these people
who have been under a regime and have been

195
00:35:22,304 --> 00:35:26,754
really military-like, and the whole treatment
was so funny.

196
00:35:26,754 --> 00:35:37,944
The whole thing changed in such a short time,
and I was amazed how the tears of this Sahaja

197
00:35:37,944 --> 00:35:40,964
yogi has worked this wonder.

198
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:51,534
Now, imagine a moment when tears started rolling
his eyes, that moment just manifested a big

199
00:35:51,534 --> 00:35:52,574
drama.

200
00:35:52,574 --> 00:36:05,144
And, ultimately, what you find is that the
people at the airport became extremely humble

201
00:36:05,144 --> 00:36:10,274
and respectful.

202
00:36:10,274 --> 00:36:16,064
So when we start thinking of time and time

203
00:36:16,064 --> 00:36:24,274
and time, we have to understand that time
is our slave.

204
00:36:24,274 --> 00:36:26,554
We are not slaves of the time.

205
00:36:26,554 --> 00:36:35,514
There are thousand and one stories I can tell
you how, by delaying in a place, by getting

206
00:36:35,514 --> 00:36:44,784
late in a place, by not caring for the time,
I have seen such beautiful manifestations,

207
00:36:44,784 --> 00:36:56,634
such beautiful dramas – the art of the divine
power – that I was amazed how people worry

208
00:36:56,634 --> 00:37:01,103
so much about the time.

209
00:37:01,103 --> 00:37:14,534
If time is really necessary, if we are all
watching our time every year, as our birthday,

210
00:37:14,534 --> 00:37:20,874
and if you think that time is very important,
it is in a way.

211
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:29,714
In these modern times, we really need the
time for meditation, for collective meetings

212
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:34,504
and for Sahaja Yoga.

213
00:37:34,504 --> 00:37:43,454
I know when there was the war of independence
in this country, where My parents fought with

214
00:37:43,454 --> 00:37:49,494
all their tana, mana, dhana [trans: body,
mind, wealth].

215
00:37:49,494 --> 00:37:54,494
That time I remember how they never cared
for anything.

216
00:37:54,494 --> 00:38:05,404
They went all out, because it was very important
to get this country freed from the clutches

217
00:38:05,404 --> 00:38:09,184
of the Empire.

218
00:38:09,184 --> 00:38:15,314
And this was so important.

219
00:38:15,314 --> 00:38:22,554
They had to meet somebody at such a point:
that man, supposing, is escaping from the

220
00:38:22,554 --> 00:38:28,134
jail, or there's some sort of a thing on,
they could not afford to miss the time.

221
00:38:28,134 --> 00:38:36,894
They could not afford to just neglect that
important time, important meeting, important

222
00:38:36,894 --> 00:38:41,254
discussion, because everything had become
an emergency.

223
00:38:41,254 --> 00:38:47,494
For them, nobody told them, nobody gave them
lectures, but for them, from inside.

224
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:56,354
They were all legendary people, I should say,
the way they fought for their freedom.

225
00:38:56,354 --> 00:38:59,694
This is, today, the same situation.

226
00:38:59,694 --> 00:39:05,344
It is an emergency, a very subtle emergency.

227
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:13,344
That nothing is more important than spreading
Sahaja Yoga.

228
00:39:13,344 --> 00:39:20,794
If some people will miss it, will not know
about it, we will be responsible for that.

229
00:39:20,794 --> 00:39:28,723
At the time of Christ, Buddha, Mahavira or
any one of them, there were no aeroplanes

230
00:39:28,723 --> 00:39:31,064
to travel.

231
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:38,434
There were not these loudspeakers, also other
communications and televisions and all those

232
00:39:38,434 --> 00:39:40,674
things.

233
00:39:40,674 --> 00:39:45,534
All these things have come now.

234
00:39:45,534 --> 00:39:48,514
That has been manifested now.

235
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:56,843
It is
the work of Paramachaitanya.

236
00:39:56,843 --> 00:40:07,364
Through scientists, through other knowledge,
all this manifestation have, has taken place.

237
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:13,864
Also, these people didn't have to face people,
so many, nor did they… were supposed to

238
00:40:13,864 --> 00:40:18,494
give realization to people in such a big number.

239
00:40:18,494 --> 00:40:32,874
So all these inventions, all that you see
today as modern ventures which we have got,

240
00:40:32,874 --> 00:40:38,774
they are all for Sahaja Yoga.

241
00:40:38,774 --> 00:40:46,244
Without Sahaj Yog, you cannot imagine what
would happen to this world.

242
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:51,304
The first and foremost thing is we have no

243
00:40:51,304 --> 00:40:52,814
peace within our hearts.

244
00:40:52,814 --> 00:40:55,044
We talk of peace.

245
00:40:55,044 --> 00:41:01,024
I know of people, who have got awards in peace,
have no peace within their heart, no peace

246
00:41:01,024 --> 00:41:02,814
at all.

247
00:41:02,814 --> 00:41:11,264
Unless and until we human beings have peace,
there cannot be peace in the whole world.

248
00:41:11,264 --> 00:41:13,603
It is we who create wars.

249
00:41:13,603 --> 00:41:17,384
It is we who do all kinds of violence.

250
00:41:17,384 --> 00:41:26,074
It is we, we ruin the possibility of people
getting into the Kingdom of God.

251
00:41:26,074 --> 00:41:39,114
So, peace can be only achieved by establishing
peace in the hearts of the people.

252
00:41:39,114 --> 00:41:48,233
And that is only possible, that you achieve
the state of thoughtless awareness.

253
00:41:48,233 --> 00:41:51,264
You remain in the present.

254
00:41:51,264 --> 00:42:00,154
And there, where you'll be amazed, you will
be standing like a rock, because you will

255
00:42:00,154 --> 00:42:02,634
have reality in your hand.

256
00:42:02,634 --> 00:42:04,374
You can work out the way you like.

257
00:42:04,374 --> 00:42:09,194
Actually, I don't work out anything whatsoever,
really.

258
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,093
You may say, "You do this and You do that."

259
00:42:11,093 --> 00:42:12,093
I don't.

260
00:42:12,093 --> 00:42:16,034
It's the Paramchaitanya, which works it.

261
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,014
In the same way, it will work for you also.

262
00:42:18,014 --> 00:42:26,843
But you must have faith in yourself and absolute
faith in Sahaja Yoga.

263
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:27,843
Absolute.

264
00:42:27,843 --> 00:42:41,164
That's the only way we can achieve this, that
many, many, many people, most of the people

265
00:42:41,164 --> 00:42:45,983
of the world – I wouldn't say all of them
rather difficult to say that, but may be possible

266
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:50,874
– should enter into the Kingdom of God with
us.

267
00:42:50,874 --> 00:42:55,914
That's the most important thing, more than
all these worldly things and more than all

268
00:42:55,914 --> 00:42:57,704
these nonsensical things.

269
00:42:57,704 --> 00:43:04,213
So the attention should be, "How many people

270
00:43:04,213 --> 00:43:14,174
we are going to bring to Sahaj Yog, how many
we are going to save, what are we going to

271
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:17,964
do about it?"

272
00:43:17,964 --> 00:43:25,414
When you have to think about it every morning,
how can you remember the time and date?

273
00:43:25,414 --> 00:43:33,104
When you are in emergency now, and you know
that this emergency has to be fulfilled, then

274
00:43:33,104 --> 00:43:43,254
how can you just pay attention to all worldly
things, all worldly achievements?

275
00:43:43,254 --> 00:43:45,634
That will take its own course.

276
00:43:45,634 --> 00:43:47,704
You don't have to worry.

277
00:43:47,704 --> 00:43:49,914
That works out automatic, automatically.

278
00:43:49,914 --> 00:43:58,874
Only thing where you really need your own
diversion, or your own focusing, is Sahaja

279
00:43:58,874 --> 00:44:01,264
Yoga, in and out.

280
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:07,973
If we really want peace on this Earth, if
we want really progress for ourselves, if

281
00:44:07,973 --> 00:44:13,824
we want all kinds of physical, mental and
emotional problems being solved, all for our

282
00:44:13,824 --> 00:44:22,564
good, why not we come to Sahaj Yoga, where
we don't have to do anything except for raising

283
00:44:22,564 --> 00:44:33,144
our kundalini, except for meditating for it
for very little time and to achieve that state

284
00:44:33,144 --> 00:44:36,464
of joy.

285
00:44:36,464 --> 00:44:42,093
Today My feelings are really full of joy,

286
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:53,064
full of joy, because now I can see how things
are happening, how one person can produce

287
00:44:53,064 --> 00:44:57,314
thousands and thousands of Sahaja yogis.

288
00:44:57,314 --> 00:45:05,054
I saw one miracle, I told once that one seed
has all the thousand trees it is going to

289
00:45:05,054 --> 00:45:14,814
produce and when I saw a new technique of
tissue culture, I was amazed that on one little

290
00:45:14,814 --> 00:45:23,504
seed there were so many little, little primules
who had come out.

291
00:45:23,504 --> 00:45:30,884
In the same way, you are all capable, and
you all can do it, but what is needed is faith

292
00:45:30,884 --> 00:45:37,593
in yourself and also complete sincerity about
Sahaja Yoga.

293
00:45:37,593 --> 00:45:42,824
If that happens today, you have really celebrated
My birthday.

294
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:53,004
If you think that My birthday's important,
that for Me very important is that everybody

295
00:45:53,004 --> 00:45:54,583
gets their spiritual birthday.

296
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:57,456
May God bless you.
