1
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:28,202
Today I just thought that there are

2
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:31,077
quite a lot of people who have come for the first time.

3
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,749
And I should tell them about

4
00:00:34,563 --> 00:00:38,109
the significance of Puja.

5
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:43,966
Because, as the western style of life is,

6
00:00:44,872 --> 00:00:49,297
that they're meant to be like this.

7
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:54,666
To seek something outside, to go outside,

8
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:58,728
find out new ways and methods to grow outside.

9
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,462
Now this is the knowledge of your roots.

10
00:01:03,693 --> 00:01:08,011
Knowledge, through which you receive your nourishment,

11
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,863
this knowledge is not known to you before

12
00:01:13,294 --> 00:01:15,895
and was not deliberately told

13
00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:19,305
because you are supposed to grow outside.

14
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:24,474
Now when you have to go inside, then you have to understand

15
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:29,425
the divine laws and divine methods, how it works out.

16
00:01:30,435 --> 00:01:33,388
The Puja has a significance,

17
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:37,635
from ancient times the saints described them.

18
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:40,768
Because in India, the whole climate is such

19
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,257
that you can live under a tree,

20
00:01:44,782 --> 00:01:47,602
live in a forest no problem,

21
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:51,365
then eat fruits and very happily you could be in a forest.

22
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,416
There is no need to have bed or anything, it is so warm and nice,

23
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:59,666
you can always enjoy the bliss of a forest.

24
00:02:00,682 --> 00:02:04,074
And thus many people went into the forest

25
00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:08,486
and started thinking, looking at the whole world from that

26
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:11,759
solitude,

27
00:02:12,157 --> 00:02:13,645
what is the problem with human being?

28
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:15,243
Why are we here?

29
00:02:15,462 --> 00:02:17,159
What should we do?

30
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,037
What is the purpose of this human life?

31
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,907
Why God has given us this beautiful human life?

32
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:25,231
This time they where thinking about it.

33
00:02:25,474 --> 00:02:28,343
That is how they went into meditative position,

34
00:02:28,544 --> 00:02:32,326
meditative entry within themselves.

35
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:36,287
And when they started meditating, they found all about Kundalini,

36
00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:40,551
about chakras and the deities that resided on them.

37
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:45,152
Now, these deities have resided from eternal times.

38
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:50,173
We can say in the abode of God they have all resided there

39
00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:54,902
and then they were reflected on this Earth

40
00:02:55,397 --> 00:03:00,128
and they incarnated just to give us

41
00:03:00,328 --> 00:03:03,147
a better and better awareness.

42
00:03:03,545 --> 00:03:06,009
We could have avoided all this.

43
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:09,087
It could have been very easy

44
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:13,951
if we had listened to God at the time of Adam and Eve.

45
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:17,055
At the time of Adam and Eve,

46
00:03:17,415 --> 00:03:22,160
it was told that you should not eat the fruit of knowledge.

47
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:25,360
Now, that was not the fruit of the true knowledge,

48
00:03:25,594 --> 00:03:29,206
but the fruit of knowledge was the knowledge about the matter,

49
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:31,625
knowledge about things.

50
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:36,974
So, as you know, the story is, satanic forces worked,

51
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:40,779
they nude both of them and they started

52
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:44,966
developing themselves on the other side.

53
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:47,185
That is how you made a mistake.

54
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:50,208
That is why it is called as original sin.

55
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:53,997
And that original sin has brought us to this brain now,

56
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:55,910
and we have to go back.

57
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,281
We have to go back within ourselves to find our roots.

58
00:03:59,481 --> 00:04:01,498
And that is why to improve

59
00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:04,790
on their mistakes and to improve on their ignorance

60
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,567
that is how the first ignorance was set in.

61
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:13,269
The darkness of ignorance was setting because of that mistake.

62
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:16,942
And then from darkness we have to come to human stage.

63
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:19,688
And when we have to come to human stage, we have to pass

64
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:25,045
through all those different various stages of life where

65
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:29,357
incarnations had to take place.

66
00:04:29,575 --> 00:04:31,710
So, now, as as you know very well,

67
00:04:32,153 --> 00:04:36,287
that we have incarnations placed within our centres

68
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:39,460
which are not yet awakened.

69
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:43,167
That means they are not in our attention.

70
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:46,909
They are not to be felt in our central nervous system.

71
00:04:47,143 --> 00:04:51,199
Or we cannot feel them on our finger tips, to be very very simple.

72
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:55,901
So they are there, but they are not acting according to our desire.

73
00:04:56,101 --> 00:04:59,323
We do not know them and they do not listen to us.

74
00:04:59,523 --> 00:05:03,526
They do what is right for them or what they think is proper.

75
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:06,890
You have no connection with them so far.

76
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:11,289
So, the first thing is to connect yourself

77
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,806
with those different stages through which you have passed.

78
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:17,406
So, the first as you know is the Ganesha's stage,

79
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:20,321
it is innocence. Innocence, the

80
00:05:20,522 --> 00:05:24,448
formless of innocence was made into Shri Ganesha,

81
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,440
because some nucleus has to emit that innocence.

82
00:05:31,674 --> 00:05:34,525
Now, in the whole world

83
00:05:34,963 --> 00:05:38,857
there are eight such creations of the Mother Earth,

84
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:42,703
and luckily they are in Maharastra.

85
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,038
You will find Maharastrian people on the whole are innocent,

86
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:49,494
compared to others, they are rather innocent by nature.

87
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:54,167
And the reason is from Mother Earth only the innocence is emitted.

88
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,630
So the first thing is that within us to establish innocence

89
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,856
we have to worship Shri Ganesha.

90
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:02,258
So, when you worship Me as Shri Ganesha,

91
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,252
Shri Ganesha within you is awakened.

92
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:07,932
You see the result of that.

93
00:06:08,187 --> 00:06:09,829
So, the people who are suffering,

94
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:14,867
say, from the trouble of all these perversions,

95
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:17,673
these modern diseases that have come,

96
00:06:17,915 --> 00:06:19,774
must establish their Shri Ganesha.

97
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:23,600
If they cannot establish their Shri Ganesha, they cannot be cured.

98
00:06:23,873 --> 00:06:26,635
So their innocence has to be first established.

99
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:29,257
If he cannot establish their innocence,

100
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:31,216
we cannot cure them.

101
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,831
First and foremost thing is to establish Shri Ganesha.

102
00:06:35,074 --> 00:06:38,759
And Shri Ganesha is made out of the Mother Earth element.

103
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,597
So, by praying to Shri Ganesha we also establish Him,

104
00:06:42,797 --> 00:06:46,716
sitting in a place like this place now

105
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:51,016
is San Francisco, where I came here first we had no Puja, nothing.

106
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:54,023
That is why the whole thing was just touch and go.

107
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:55,792
I couldn't go deep into people.

108
00:06:55,993 --> 00:06:58,285
I couldn't go deep into the place and so the,

109
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,557
I didn't know how I would be able to manage,

110
00:07:00,758 --> 00:07:04,968
because there is no education on this.

111
00:07:05,248 --> 00:07:07,296
People are not educated about it.

112
00:07:07,497 --> 00:07:09,892
But in India immediately the first thing is Puja.

113
00:07:10,092 --> 00:07:11,284
They will not come to my lecture,

114
00:07:11,484 --> 00:07:13,143
they will not come to anything, first is Puja.

115
00:07:13,343 --> 00:07:16,162
If there is a Puja, everybody is getting up at 4 o'clock,

116
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:18,916
having a bath, getting ready to come to Puja.

117
00:07:19,116 --> 00:07:21,129
Because they know the importance of it,

118
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:26,680
that just your essence is awakened by it.

119
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:30,524
Essence is awakened and to awaken the essence

120
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:33,868
you have to be

121
00:07:34,123 --> 00:07:36,303
there, at a place where this is done,

122
00:07:36,568 --> 00:07:39,524
so that your essence is awakened.

123
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,649
Now, the trouble is with ego-oriented societies,

124
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,646
is very difficult to tell them about Puja.

125
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:47,164
Just find it difficult, that is why we do not allow

126
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:49,385
everyone to come to Puja for one reason,

127
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:52,157
because as soon as they see something happening,

128
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:53,678
their ego stands up, you see.

129
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,025
And instead of doing anything to them,

130
00:07:56,225 --> 00:08:01,210
the barrier is so much, that I can't just do anything about.

131
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,611
The barrier is too much in their ego, they have their own ideas,

132
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:07,072
their own conceptions, their own feelings,

133
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:12,514
and it's impossible to penetrate deep into them, so it is a waste.

134
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:14,892
And if you cannot receive the vibrations,

135
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:17,871
I feel the pain in my own centres.

136
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,395
Because the deities, you see, get so annoyed,

137
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:22,507
and they don't like it and they think that

138
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:25,339
why Mother should waste their energy with this people

139
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,994
who do not understand about Puja.

140
00:08:27,195 --> 00:08:30,859
So, I want to prepare you beforehand, that you keep yourself open.

141
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,762
Don't allow your ego to come up.

142
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:35,670
It's nothing for Me to gain. It is for you to gain.

143
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,421
Keep your minds open.

144
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:40,035
The trouble is that at the time of this Sahasrara opening,

145
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:43,187
this brain, everybody's brain is upside down.

146
00:08:43,387 --> 00:08:46,404
It is impossible, you try to turn it and they jump on you.

147
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:48,898
It is a big problem for me, it is the biggest problem.

148
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:50,859
Because, all other incarnations came,

149
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:54,656
they didn't have to do this difficult work of making you something.

150
00:08:54,856 --> 00:08:58,459
Just it was to awaken within you a awareness,

151
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,307
like Christ had to awaken your Agyna Charka.

152
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:05,052
Alright, he has crucified himself for the same reason,

153
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,643
he resurrected himself for the same reason.

154
00:09:07,843 --> 00:09:09,892
It was a very hard life for him

155
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:13,192
and, for the Mother, it was even worse, no doubt.

156
00:09:13,392 --> 00:09:18,845
But still, one should know that this is a very hazardous thing,

157
00:09:19,087 --> 00:09:22,552
to transform people and then to establish them

158
00:09:22,752 --> 00:09:28,704
and create out of these little seeds a huge big tree of a saint.

159
00:09:29,357 --> 00:09:32,940
Now, in the same way, we have got Moses, we have got Abraham,

160
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,522
all these great saints are within our, in our void.

161
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:39,373
They are the gurus. And on a Guru Puja,

162
00:09:39,574 --> 00:09:41,597
when you worship me on the Guru Puja day,

163
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:45,114
that time these are awakened within you, and you become a master,

164
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:46,558
you become yourself a Guru.

165
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:49,507
You yourself know so much,

166
00:09:49,707 --> 00:09:51,984
even I don't have to tell you, I don't think

167
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:56,545
I have talked to people very much in private, or explain to things.

168
00:09:56,745 --> 00:09:59,365
But somehow they become so much full of knowledge,

169
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,140
that is rather surprising how they understand. Like,

170
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,806
I was talking to Yogi Mahajan

171
00:10:04,006 --> 00:10:07,235
and he was telling me what's the problem is with human being and,

172
00:10:07,436 --> 00:10:10,874
you see, he was telling me how we cannot relate to them and all.

173
00:10:11,074 --> 00:10:13,795
It's very interesting, because My father did same to Me.

174
00:10:13,996 --> 00:10:18,059
I said that he is my first guru and all of you my second gurus.

175
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,026
Because I don't understand human beings.

176
00:10:21,227 --> 00:10:23,232
You see for example, this homosexual business.

177
00:10:23,432 --> 00:10:25,952
When Gregoire, with very great reluctance, you see,

178
00:10:26,152 --> 00:10:27,409
told me through somebody else,

179
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:29,718
I nearly fainted, actually could not understand,

180
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,791
what's happened to them? Now, what am I to do?

181
00:10:31,991 --> 00:10:34,544
And I couldn't eat my food for one week.

182
00:10:34,744 --> 00:10:36,741
I felt so bad about the whole thing.

183
00:10:36,941 --> 00:10:40,245
Like, My own children were nothing.

184
00:10:40,464 --> 00:10:43,612
If you have a heart of a intense Mother,

185
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:45,685
you can understand what she feels about it.

186
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:47,253
And I knew they are in for trouble,

187
00:10:47,454 --> 00:10:51,477
I knew everything was going to be very very hazardous.

188
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:53,668
But doesn't matter, by God's grace

189
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:55,953
everything will be alright. I am sure it will work out.

190
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:58,439
So, first we have to establish Shri Ganesha.

191
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:01,134
First of all, we have to establish Shri Ganesha within ourselves

192
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:05,130
and Shri Ganesha in this place called San Francisco.

193
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,622
Alright? That is why we have to first do Shri Ganesha's Puja.

194
00:11:08,864 --> 00:11:10,358
Then, secondly I told him

195
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:13,905
that if possible we should do little bit of Shri Vishnu's,

196
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:17,962
because he is the one who gives us the evolutionary power

197
00:11:18,163 --> 00:11:22,070
by which we can evolve ourselves and evolve others.

198
00:11:22,271 --> 00:11:25,598
So we have a little time for Shri Vishnu's Puja.

199
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:28,411
Also, they do Havanas all that for Shri Vishnu's Puja,

200
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:31,690
which is very good to clear the atmosphere sort of thing.

201
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,626
But we will do next year all these things, perhaps, maybe,

202
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,292
because now we don't have these arrangements.

203
00:11:37,492 --> 00:11:40,157
But that would be a very good idea, too.

204
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:45,389
And then thirdly they want to do the the Puja of Shakti, the Mother.

205
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,162
Because, unless and until you have power,

206
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:50,590
even if all the deities are there, you will be exhausted,

207
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:51,965
you wouldn't be able to work it out.

208
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:56,113
So the third is of your own power, of your Kundalini,

209
00:11:56,314 --> 00:12:01,197
of the power that is going to work out this Divine work.

210
00:12:01,423 --> 00:12:02,792
That is how we have three Pujas.

211
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:05,753
But none of you should get into an ego trip.

212
00:12:05,954 --> 00:12:08,330
Please, keep your ego on one side.

213
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:12,032
Just now, see for yourself how it works within yourself.

214
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,767
You start feeling good, you start feeling better vibrations

215
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:19,938
and you start feeling much better and healthier within yourself.

216
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:22,981
So, just keep your self open. It is you

217
00:12:23,184 --> 00:12:25,073
who has to achieve something, not Me.

218
00:12:25,273 --> 00:12:29,157
I don't have to achieve anything. So you better make use of Me.

219
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:33,027
Because I am here only for today and then I will go away.

220
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:34,934
So, make best use of Me

221
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:38,096
and that is why I said as many as possible try to call

222
00:12:38,297 --> 00:12:40,557
the people over here will be a good idea.

223
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,024
May God Bless you.
