1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:06,999
All this being said on My birthday,

2
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:11,751
really embarrasses Me,

3
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:16,709
because it's all being already

4
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:22,459
scheduled, it was all timed out.

5
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:25,417
It had to happen this way.

6
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:29,626
And the time has come now that

7
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:38,834
this whole world has to take to global understanding.

8
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:43,959
Human beings, I was surprised,

9
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:48,999
are how anxious in those difficult times

10
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:53,375
to get to the truth; because very difficult

11
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:58,334
to carry on with the truth, when there's untruth all along.

12
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:02,999
And the way people get after you when you talk of truth,

13
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:08,542
is also a very hazardous task to fight them

14
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:12,292
those who are just always

15
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:17,918
going to cruelties,

16
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:21,999
to untruth, to aggressiveness.

17
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,501
These are all self destructive elements.

18
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:30,999
Also we have other self destructive elements within us,

19
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:35,417
like drinking, smoking,

20
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:41,876
we can say also other things, like drug taking. But people do it.

21
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:44,918
Just they do it. Not that they don't know,

22
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:50,876
but they just do it because of the influence of the time.

23
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:53,999
And that is what is the Kali Yuga,

24
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:59,626
where we destroy ourselves and try to destroy others,

25
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:05,083
and have a kind of a funny temptation for this

26
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,999
not only that, also we enjoy all these.

27
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:15,167
All this cruelty, all this aggression we enjoy.

28
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:20,209
Now when do we say that the Kali Yuga is over, we should know

29
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,542
something about Kali Yuga.

30
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:28,959
Kali was one of the deities,

31
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:34,083
who was supposed to bring in Kali Yuga,

32
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:36,792
and all the problems of Kali Yuga.

33
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:40,999
Firstly it creates illusions, "bhranti".

34
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:45,709
It creates illusions. People will not understand

35
00:02:45,918 --> 00:02:48,999
who is a real person, who is an unreal person.

36
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:52,999
So we have many false gurus as you know.

37
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,417
We have many false propagandists.

38
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,209
We have many people who talk big

39
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,709
but there's nothing in them.

40
00:03:02,334 --> 00:03:06,876
This is one type of a "bhranti" that Kali Yuga creates.

41
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:11,999
Once it so happened, that Nala and Damayanti too

42
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,125
were in love with each other. They were husband and wife.

43
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:20,375
And Damayanti was separated from Nala,

44
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:25,792
by this horrible thing called Kali.

45
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:32,000
This Kali fellow has being doing this kind of work,

46
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:35,167
used to create problems in the minds of people,

47
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:39,459
disturbing families, disturbing nations, disturbing

48
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:44,292
all the good wishes and the good feelings among human beings.

49
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:51,209
So once this gentleman, one we call Kali was caught up,

50
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:56,459
by Nala, Nala, the one who hated him.

51
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,459
And Nala said that, "Why don't you allow me to kill you?

52
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:05,584
You should be killed because you are such a horrible person,

53
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:10,250
you create such bhranti, you create such problems for people.

54
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:14,876
He said, "If you want to kill me, you can kill me

55
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:18,584
but first listen to my importance, to my mahatmya.

56
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:21,918
"What is your mahatmaya? What is your importance?"

57
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,125
He said, "My importance is, that when I'll come on this earth,

58
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:30,250
when I'll rule on this earth, I know there will be bhranti,

59
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:33,459
there will be chaos, there will be problems,

60
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:37,292
but people will be so much fed up with that,

61
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:40,417
that they will seek the truth.

62
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:45,083
And those people today who are going to the hills and dales

63
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:48,751
to find out the truth, will be there

64
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:53,792
as ordinary human beings, as householders.

65
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:56,999
And they will find the truth,

66
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,042
definitely they'll find the truth.

67
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,876
It has been already predicted by Kali himself.

68
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:09,375
So as you see lots of chaos is there, lots of problems are there,

69
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:12,584
and when you see people you can't understand,

70
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:16,918
how such people who are educated, intelligent,

71
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,584
supposed to be at the helm of affairs,

72
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:23,250
can go about with wrong ideas, with wrong things.

73
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:26,501
The problem is this Kali Yuga.

74
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:32,042
This creates this funny situation, in our lives.

75
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:37,751
Firstly it creates a situation where a person starts thinking,

76
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:41,876
he's very insecure and he must take to some way,

77
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,626
of protecting himself.

78
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:50,209
And then where he goes to, is the place where he will be destroyed,

79
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,709
before he knows even that he'll be destroyed.

80
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:58,918
The second point is that we have

81
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:03,167
a great sense of jealousy.

82
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:09,999
That sense of jealousy is even more heighten by this Kali Yuga.

83
00:06:11,334 --> 00:06:13,792
We feel jealous for everything,

84
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:18,209
which it shows our inferiority complex, or I don't know what it is?

85
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:22,375
But we start feeling jealous and out of jealousy we start

86
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:25,167
hating people without any rhyme and reason.

87
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:27,792
So many countries have this problem.

88
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:33,000
It's at the top, politicians,

89
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:37,209
they indulge into this kind of a hatred for other people,

90
00:06:37,584 --> 00:06:41,584
without understanding what is the

91
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,626
achievement of the other person is, how he has achieved,

92
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:48,459
and "Why should I be jealous?"

93
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:54,542
Then we have, another thing is apart from that is,

94
00:06:54,751 --> 00:06:58,709
which is the worst thing as Krishna has said, is the temper.

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,209
Hot tempered people, you see, cannot see the truth,

96
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,417
because at the slightest provocation

97
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:12,792
they become hot-tempered and start hitting others

98
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,334
and beating others or saying horrible things

99
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:20,959
which should not be said. Now, this is another

100
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:25,709
criteria for every Sahaja Yogi to know,

101
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:33,417
how far he is out of this sense of "krodha", is the anger.

102
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,751
To be angry it shows that you have

103
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:46,167
no peace within and that you get angry for

104
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:50,792
just to attack another person, which is not necessary.

105
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:56,083
Even keeping quiet you can be very much effective.

106
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:01,042
There's a story about Chinese people that

107
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:04,751
in China there was a fight going on between

108
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:11,083
some people, and they said, "Let's have the cocks fight for us".

109
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:13,834
So they had a cock fight.

110
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:18,709
So one fellow took a cock to a Zen fellow and he said that

111
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,959
"What, what should I do, if this cock has to fight?"

112
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:27,709
And he said that, "Very simple,

113
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:30,709
you teach the cock to be absolutely quiet."

114
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:33,834
He said, "I can't do that." He said, "All right, give me the cock."

115
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:37,626
And he taught the cock how to be quiet,

116
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:40,918
whatever is happening, whosoever is attacking him.

117
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:46,334
When he went into the arena, many cocks started attacking him,

118
00:08:46,501 --> 00:08:49,959
and he was just standing quietly, watching at everyone.

119
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:54,542
This settled the thing because everybody ran away and they thought

120
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:57,292
he is such a powerful thing, he's not saying anything. So not

121
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:05,083
attacking not reacting that we achieve anything.

122
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:10,125
Actually reaction is a very great enemy of human beings,

123
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,459
that we react to everything.

124
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:16,167
We should not react, we should just become silent.

125
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:19,792
And then this power, which I tell you about,

126
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:24,042
is the power of Paramchaitanya, acts.

127
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:27,542
If you want to react, all right. It says, "Go ahead".

128
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:32,542
But if you leave it and you just become quiet,

129
00:09:32,918 --> 00:09:37,375
silent, it acts. It acts so well.

130
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:42,292
It can act sitting down here, it can act somewhere else.

131
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:47,792
It is such a tremendous power. It is such an effective power.

132
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:51,709
It is such an understanding, knowledgeable power,

133
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:55,792
and above all it loves, it loves you.

134
00:09:56,375 --> 00:10:00,792
So when this power comes into existence in a way,

135
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:03,250
I would say it has been always existing,

136
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:07,334
but when effective, in the Krita Yuga it is effective,

137
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:12,167
by that you'll be amazed how things happen.

138
00:10:12,334 --> 00:10:15,501
Everybody tells Me, "Mother this miracle has taken place,

139
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,834
that miracle has taken place. "

140
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:21,042
So, I know it's not miracle. It is Paramchaitanya,

141
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,626
which is doing all the work, all the beautiful things,

142
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:28,792
which is trying to help you and trying to suggest its love.

143
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:33,792
You see, it is something we can't see

144
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:37,667
something we cannot conceive with this mind.

145
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,751
But it is beyond the mind that it works.

146
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:46,334
I was surprised in Russia specially, I had to face the scientists.

147
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:51,918
Then the scientists were so, so much equipped, so much deep and

148
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:55,999
they understood so well, even in a place,

149
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:03,834
you can call it a place of great learning,

150
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,792
one of the oldest universities, St. Petersburg University.

151
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:12,584
There also I don't know, what made they gave Me

152
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:17,709
the highest reward. For what? I didn't know.

153
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:21,250
But they said, "You are even higher than science."

154
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:24,209
So this they called as cognitive science.

155
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:26,751
They gave a name as cognitive science.

156
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:30,292
"So Mother Your whole knowledge is of cognitive science."

157
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:35,375
Only thing is, if I tell you something then you can verify it.

158
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:38,417
The scientists can verify it.

159
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:42,375
Everybody can find it out if it so or not.

160
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:46,584
But if you put this test to all these false gurus,

161
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:50,876
you will see that they, they don't have any scientific basis.

162
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,125
They have no way of giving you any explanation,

163
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:59,792
as to why this is happening and what is happening?

164
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:03,792
I had to face all of them all over the world.

165
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:06,667
And I was surprised they recognized Me.

166
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:11,334
And they said, "Mother this is cognitive science" and like that,

167
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:15,042
they gave Me, everywhere they gave Me awards and things like that.

168
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:18,334
I never knew what is cognitive science is.

169
00:12:18,501 --> 00:12:22,417
But this is the knowledge that you get beyond your mind.

170
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:25,334
With your mind you get is your

171
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:30,209
biased, maybe full of jealousy, maybe full of anger.

172
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:34,999
But beyond the mind even you get this knowledge that is absolute.

173
00:12:35,876 --> 00:12:38,792
Nobody can challenge it, absolute knowledge.

174
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:44,125
For example, I'll tell you one thing and if you see this model

175
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,292
from the right side to the left side,

176
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:49,709
there it will look like a swastika.

177
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,751
I made a model for them, to show them.

178
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:56,334
And if you see it from the left side on the right side

179
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,709
it will be "aum" written down.

180
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:01,584
And if you see from down upward,

181
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:06,292
it is a cross, that means,

182
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:12,501
Shri Ganesha, who is on Mooladhara, incarnates as Christ.

183
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,292
So they made a picture, they made a model,

184
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:19,459
the scientists, and they found out

185
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:23,417
that what I said is true and this model

186
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:27,626
really can be shown. I mean one of them is like this,

187
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:31,334
that whatever you know, whatever you say,

188
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:35,459
should be verified by even scientists.

189
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:38,417
I do not discard science.

190
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:41,667
Science is amoral, whatever you may say.

191
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:45,250
But once they come to Sahaja Yoga, these scientists,

192
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:47,542
they just get transformed.

193
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:51,459
But scientists, in other countries, I don't know about our country,

194
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:56,250
in other countries have reached such a state, such a state,

195
00:13:56,626 --> 00:14:00,417
that they want to know what is beyond.

196
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,999
All of them come to India, why? Why don't they go to Japan?

197
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:08,459
Why don't they go to China, why don't they go to America?

198
00:14:08,626 --> 00:14:11,417
To find the truth they come to India.

199
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:16,250
So in India this cognitive science existed long time back,

200
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:19,334
of which we are not aware.

201
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:23,999
Like I must say, Indians suddenly became very westernized,

202
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:28,375
after independence somehow, all Gandhiji's ideas,

203
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:31,375
and everything was put on the shelves.

204
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:35,125
So, we, we didn't know what was so great in our country.

205
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:40,501
Such a great "sampada", such a great power

206
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:45,501
existed in this country and they knew so many things,

207
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:51,375
so many things about, some things that science do not know.

208
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,959
Now it is for science to find out,

209
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,626
whatever they have said it's true or not.

210
00:14:57,751 --> 00:15:00,334
I have seen this, it's very simple,

211
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:04,375
if you really know the truth and you tell a scientist

212
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:06,876
he'll get after it and he'll work it out.

213
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:11,042
It's not one example, there can be hundreds I can give you,

214
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:13,501
where I've told them something. They said, " All right."

215
00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:16,999
"You verify, you find out, by your scientific methods."

216
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:22,459
And they found it, they found it. There's so many ways

217
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:26,209
of finding it out, you have in science.

218
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:28,834
But they don't know what to find.

219
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,751
They are just going on in this one, that one.

220
00:15:31,918 --> 00:15:34,417
They are going to the moon, they are going to this thing.

221
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:38,501
That's not the way. First you find out what you have to find

222
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:41,792
and then see if it is there or not.

223
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:45,292
I was surprised in the West, though we call them

224
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:48,792
very much sort of advanced and all these things,

225
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:52,667
but as far as spirituality is concerned they are nowhere.

226
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:58,042
Their cognitive science faculty is very poor compared to us.

227
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:03,667
But our also is zero because we have all become westernised now.

228
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:06,667
All our ideas are westernised

229
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:09,250
and we take all the knowledge from outside.

230
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:12,375
And even those who want to do something

231
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:17,667
about Indian culture and all that, they are so small,

232
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:22,334
they are so incapable of

233
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:26,417
telling them what it is. It has nothing to do

234
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:30,083
with a fundamentalist idea, nothing of the kind.

235
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:34,459
But it is a fact, it's the truth. it's the reality,

236
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:37,918
which they don't know themselves. They just want to proclaim,

237
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:42,292
the Bhartiya Sanskriti, Indian culture,

238
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,334
but there is nothing like that.

239
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:47,834
Because unless and until you are a realized soul

240
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:51,209
and you have reached that state,

241
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:54,999
till then you do not know anything

242
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,792
about the mysteries of Paramchaitanya.

243
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:03,083
So for every Indian it is very important to take to Sahaja Yoga.

244
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:07,459
Also for all the people all over the world.

245
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:11,000
Everywhere as she told you about Russia, the condition is very bad,

246
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,792
but still I must say the Sahaja Yogis are very much happy there.

247
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:21,375
The way, when I was there once there was this coup was on,

248
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,167
and everybody was worried and we saw lots of

249
00:17:24,584 --> 00:17:26,167
tankers passing, this thing and all.

250
00:17:26,584 --> 00:17:29,792
So I asked these Russian Sahaja Yogis,

251
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:34,083
they are more than I think one lakh,

252
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,751
much more than one lakh, I don't know how many they are.

253
00:17:36,918 --> 00:17:39,292
So I asked them, "Aren't you worried,

254
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:41,459
what is happening in your country?"

255
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:43,792
He said, "Mother we are not". I said, "Why?"

256
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,250
"Because we are in the kingdom of God,

257
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:48,751
why should we worry about Russia?"

258
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:53,417
You see, this also is a temperament that changes.

259
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:55,584
and a person doesn't tell lies,

260
00:17:55,751 --> 00:17:58,667
but he really feels that way and that's how

261
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:02,501
he gets rid of all these nonsensical ideas

262
00:18:02,751 --> 00:18:07,417
of religion, cast, nation, this, that.

263
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:11,334
It separates human beings from human beings.

264
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:15,334
But artificially you cannot join them.

265
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:18,792
Many people start talking, "No, no, we should not have

266
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:21,792
all these different things, we should have one."

267
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:24,209
You can't, you can't have.

268
00:18:25,459 --> 00:18:29,167
Because temperamentally human beings are not made like that,

269
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:34,292
You see, we had a little discussion there in Italy,

270
00:18:34,751 --> 00:18:36,792
with other religious groups,

271
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:40,667
and they said, "We, we don't want one religion,

272
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:42,999
one global religion, we don't want."

273
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:46,250
I said, "Why? Because you want to fight, that's why?

274
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,918
Why you don't want one religion?

275
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:52,042
One religion is that you are a human being,

276
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:55,167
and you are a wonderful human being,

277
00:18:55,459 --> 00:18:58,125
and that you can be one with the Divine.

278
00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:03,834
This is your religion which is promised and has to work out.

279
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,792
And, but they wouldn't accept. But the people are changing.

280
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:11,667
They are transforming themselves so fast

281
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,250
that I am surprised in a country like Turkey,

282
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:16,918
we have two thousands Sahaja Yogis.

283
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:22,792
And they are converting so many. So all these funny ideas that,

284
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:26,125
all these priests, mulaahs and all those have created,

285
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:31,751
are going down. And what is coming up?  Even we have lots of these

286
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:36,542
people in India, panditas, and shastras and this and that,

287
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:40,334
they don't know anything I would say, because unless and until

288
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:45,459
they feel the Paramchaitanya, their all talking is baseless.

289
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:51,459
So all these problems which are created by fighting,

290
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:56,334
by aggressiveness, showing off or whatever you may call,

291
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:58,834
can be corrected with Sahaja Yoga

292
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:01,334
because your attention goes beyond the mind.

293
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,834
You go beyond the mind.

294
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:08,375
This Agnya chakra opens and you go beyond the mind

295
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,834
and then you are one with this divine power.

296
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:13,459
Once you are one with the divine power,

297
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:18,167
how it works for you in small, small ways.

298
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,167
I mean you all have experience,

299
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,417
you are all Sahaja Yogis so I need not tell you,

300
00:20:22,751 --> 00:20:27,709
but everyone can tell so many examples, by which

301
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:31,667
he knows that it's the Paramchaitanya which has worked it.

302
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:37,042
So first and foremost thing of every seeker of truth

303
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:41,375
who is a real person, is to first get Self-Realization.

304
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:45,626
That is the essence of spirituality, all over the world,

305
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:48,417
even if you read Bible, if you read Koran.

306
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:51,709
Nobody has read them that's the best part of it.

307
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:55,709
And they are trying to say things which are very shameful.

308
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:59,667
which are not there and they are fighting for that.

309
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:03,792
With all these things they have helped us very much to show,

310
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:09,209
that the essence of all these religions is one and out of that will

311
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:14,584
one day people will take to Self Realization.

312
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:20,125
Once they take to Self Realization, then they have to grow.

313
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:23,042
Once they have grown into it, they can see.

314
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:26,167
All of you know, you are all Sahaja Yogis sitting here,

315
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:29,999
you know how much you have gained and how much you have achieved.

316
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:33,501
So to give Me the credit, I don't know,

317
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:40,459
it's not really true, because,

318
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:43,792
we had great saints in some countries,

319
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:47,083
great saints in this country, in every country,

320
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:50,250
you know we had sufis in so many countries.

321
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:54,792
They all have tried to say, that take your Self Realization.

322
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,334
"Know thy Self."

323
00:21:57,667 --> 00:22:00,751
They all have said the same thing, "Know thy Self".

324
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:03,999
But nobody is doing that, that's a different point.

325
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:08,167
But actually all those who were Realized souls, whether they were

326
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:12,292
from a Muslim religion or a Hindu religion or a Christian religion,

327
00:22:12,584 --> 00:22:17,083
any religion in any country if they were Realized souls,

328
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:20,876
they said the same. Because truth is the same.

329
00:22:21,584 --> 00:22:25,334
They said the same thing, "First know thy Self"

330
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:28,250
and then you will know the truth.

331
00:22:28,542 --> 00:22:32,584
So this is the essence of our life

332
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:35,626
that we have to know ourselves.

333
00:22:35,751 --> 00:22:40,626
Once we know ourselves, you are beyond everything, because

334
00:22:40,876 --> 00:22:47,542
what happens that you become like an ocean becomes in this,

335
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:51,584
like a drop becomes in the ocean.

336
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:55,709
How it disappears... In the same thing it will happen.

337
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,292
And once it happens, you'll be surprised,

338
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:04,417
that you are really one with everyone. Who is the other?

339
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:09,584
You are one with everyone, that's how we find in Sahaja Yoga.

340
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:13,459
It's a, many people say, it's a big charisma

341
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:16,125
it's big this thing. Nothing of the kind.

342
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:19,083
You have your own Kundalini,

343
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:23,459
you have own possibility, of becoming Self Realizing.

344
00:23:23,584 --> 00:23:27,417
Now, that is the blessing of Kali Yuga.

345
00:23:27,876 --> 00:23:29,999
In the Kali Yuga, this was going to happen

346
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,709
and that's what it is happening.

347
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:34,584
That's why thousands of you are getting Realization.

348
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:37,292
Before, only one would get from one person,

349
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:40,125
and those gurus were also very strict, you know, they

350
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:42,999
would not give it to some ordinary person.

351
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:47,959
They used to take them to task and judge them first.

352
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,709
And then they would give Realization.

353
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:52,459
But in Sahaja Yoga we don't do anything.

354
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:55,834
You just have to get into Sahaja Yoga, that's all.

355
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:59,125
Now, as it is, I'm surprised that

356
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:03,250
how intellectuals and this and that try to find faults,

357
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:06,542
without knowing that they don't know anything.

358
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:10,334
They have to become Self-Realized people.

359
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:14,459
Then, whatever they will do, that will be,

360
00:24:14,626 --> 00:24:17,999
definitely very constructive, very helpful,

361
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:21,417
and peace giving, and harmony giving to the whole society.

362
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:24,792
But first of all it has to be within you.

363
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:27,999
If it is not within you, how can you give it to others.

364
00:24:28,626 --> 00:24:32,792
I've been watching how Sahaja Yoga has grown from one person

365
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:34,667
to all these, so many of them.

366
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:37,709
And we have so many others, in other countries also.

367
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,667
This all has shown that the time has come

368
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:45,250
for the whole world to change.

369
00:24:45,459 --> 00:24:50,459
And this transformation is the most important thing,

370
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,042
what we should aim at.

371
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:56,125
Forget about everything. Forget about politics, economics,

372
00:24:56,334 --> 00:24:59,709
this, that, but get transformation.

373
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:04,125
Once you are transformed, you know how to do the right thing,

374
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:07,999
how to do the things

375
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:10,792
that will help you and the society.

376
00:25:11,584 --> 00:25:14,626
All these you already have seen in your life,

377
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:19,709
and whatever is happened, is none of My only effort

378
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,792
but there have been so many who have been doing this.

379
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:27,042
Only if you can say anything is Me, is that I found out

380
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,751
a way by which en masse Realization can be given.

381
00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:34,334
Many people can get it. Because any discovery,

382
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:37,751
supposing there's electricity and if it cannot be used

383
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:39,959
en masse, it is useless.

384
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:44,292
So that's the only thing I've been able to achieve in My life,

385
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,667
that en masse Realization can be given.

386
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:52,042
And that has happen, as you know very well. It's very simple.

387
00:25:52,209 --> 00:25:55,459
And once one person gets Realization,

388
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:57,709
he can go and give Realization to others.

389
00:25:57,876 --> 00:25:59,375
Now first, they were telling Me,

390
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:02,334
"Mother, we are in seventy countries working".

391
00:26:02,584 --> 00:26:05,792
Now they are telling Me, "We are in eighty countries". How?

392
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,542
Somebody went there and he did in that country,

393
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:10,876
he went there, he did in other country.

394
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:14,584
So, just imagine how simple it has become.

395
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:18,459
How simple it is for Me. At this age I can't go

396
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:20,792
to seventy, eighty countries,

397
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:23,542
but it has passed there, it has gone there.

398
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:27,834
It has given the blessings of the Divine.

399
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:30,375
So, while you are here,

400
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:34,083
you should know here only we had Nizzamuddin Aulia.

401
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:37,792
Now Nizzamuddin was here and here we had Damdam Sahib.

402
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:40,584
All these were great saints.

403
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:44,792
And they talked of love, they talked of understanding,

404
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:48,334
but talk becomes talk for them because the others who are listening,

405
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:51,042
have no understanding about.

406
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:57,167
So we are recipients of their blessings, their beauties

407
00:26:57,334 --> 00:27:01,751
and their greatness, is only when we are Sahaja Yogis,

408
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,459
or we are Realized souls.

409
00:27:04,751 --> 00:27:08,000
So I bless you all with whole My heart and with whole My soul

410
00:27:08,584 --> 00:27:14,792
and I have been trying to work out in a way,

411
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:18,417
that I was surprised, in America, it is spreading so fast,

412
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:21,792
otherwise all the false gurus have been to America.

413
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:26,751
But now it is something great that is happening, suddenly,

414
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:29,792
so, I told them I'll come and stay in America,

415
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:35,334
for about two two months at least, for their satisfaction.

416
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:38,375
Now, staying anywhere is not so important.

417
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:44,417
What is important is that people should understand,

418
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:48,167
they should humble down

419
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,209
and they should know, "No, we still we have to know the truth".

420
00:27:51,918 --> 00:27:55,375
If once this humility comes in, it will work out.

421
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:58,459
It will work out in any person,

422
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:02,792
anyone, whatever may be the cast, religion,

423
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,375
race, makes no difference.

424
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:10,834
So may God bless you again and again, and I bless you from My heart.

425
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:14,417
Thank you very much for this felicitation. Thank you.
