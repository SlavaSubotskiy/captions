1
00:02:37,639 --> 00:03:00,039
… blessings to have such a nice place where
we all can meet and do the work of God. Sahaja

2
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:10,149
Yogis have to remember that we are here to
do God’s work and whatever blessings we

3
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:18,379
get, these are just guidelines to know that
God is creative.

4
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:25,579
I think the London Sahaja Yogis are real,
really blessed ones, really blessed ones.

5
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:33,079
The way they get one after another beautiful
places to live in. And, we all should be very,

6
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:42,379
very thankful for what God has been very kindly
suggested to us.

7
00:03:42,379 --> 00:04:02,559
I came here in the afternoon just to see the
place. As I looked at these trees and the

8
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:18,199
garden and the flowers – all of them are
here specially, very specially to tell you

9
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:34,720
that God is creative. We have to learn a lot
through them: how they grow, how they expose

10
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:50,169
themselves maximum to the rays of the sun,
how they suck their nourishment – all this

11
00:04:50,169 --> 00:05:03,659
is a great training for all of us. They are
absolutely entirely surrendered to God and

12
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:15,690
to human beings who are the epitome of this
civilization. So, it’s such a big thing

13
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:28,409
that we have a place which is unbelievably
great and that we have to be very grateful.

14
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:39,839
Count your blessings, count your blessings.
There are still so many lost, so many who

15
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:52,340
are going to be lost, but you are in the right
path. This is sort of an advanced payment.

16
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,810
[laughter]

17
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:08,889
It’s so beautiful and so sweet but one has
to know, as I told you before, that we are

18
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:14,560
not going to stay in the ashram just to make
our life convenient and leisurely. That’s

19
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:23,750
not the way we should look at things. If you
have to live in the ashram, we have to discipline

20
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:33,139
ourselves. You have to better yourself, everyday
you have to rise. Certain rules and regulations

21
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:41,849
of the ashram must be observed. There should
be no idea of a democratic government where

22
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:50,409
everybody has a right to vote and can demand
what they want. On the contrary, it is the

23
00:06:50,409 --> 00:07:03,689
great privilege that you are supposed to enjoy
the blessings. It’s a great advantage for

24
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:13,569
you that you are so fortunate to see these
things with your eyes open, that God exists

25
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:31,740
and He rewards. This understanding should
give you more and more courage and complete

26
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:39,849
willingness to improve yourself. This is the
most important thing. Sahaja Yoga is of course

27
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:46,720
as you know is for your transformation and
an ashram is for your improvement. So, those

28
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,840
people who are going to stay here or those
who are going to visit here have to relatively

29
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,840
see how they are improving and growing. There
are many things which are going to come for

30
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:09,429
us. They look material but they have an atmosphere
of spirituality.

31
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:13,469
Try to settle down with yourself. Don’t
quarrel [It seems that Shri Mataji says someone’s

32
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:20,429
name but can’t make it out] He wants you
to be comfortable. After a month you’ll

33
00:08:20,429 --> 00:08:24,960
get all the Sahaja Yogis who have to stay
here. We’ll sort it out and then they will

34
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,650
be allowed to stay here. Till then we have
to see what people are coming from abroad,

35
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:36,578
they must also have proper places to live
in. At the most a month, some people would

36
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:46,310
like to stay here, but some of you will have
to be here to look after them, to give them

37
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:55,550
all your help. Those who have car, who have
time, should come down here and start it out.

38
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:05,980
We have to organize it on proper lines. There
are three Sahaja Yogis are coming across the

39
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:17,660
oceans, and one of them also to stay here.
Try to make their stay comfortable. They are

40
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:25,600
your brothers of great achievements, and we
have to respect them and look after them.

41
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:38,800
I’m happy we have here from America another
great Sahaja Yogi. Try to help them. Whatever

42
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,870
they need, whatever they want to do, they
want to go out – make arrangements, make

43
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:55,170
it easy. If they want a car or anything, try
to help them.

44
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:05,470
Secondly, you must keep it clean, look after
it. You have entered into another arena now,

45
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:12,830
on another level where your own comforts should
not be considered, it’s the comfort of others.

46
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:18,520
Now, you are at a giving stage. So, what are
we going to give others, you have to see.

47
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,930
Not what we are going to have “Oh this is
not good, there’s no hot water, there’s

48
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:32,779
this thing.” – all you forget, you will
not need anything.

49
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:40,860
So many will be pouring down. Who else has
come for Guru Puja now? Apart from Herman.

50
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,670
You have come from where?

51
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,960
[A yogi speaks – inaudible]

52
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,260
Oh I see, good.

53
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:59,810
So, all those who are coming from anywhere
else, you see, have to stay. And those people

54
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:04,890
who want to look after them, you can have
turns.

55
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:09,730
Now today is the … what is the date today?

56
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,810
Yogi: Seventeenth.

57
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:20,409
Shri Mataji: All right! Modi is coming on
the nineteenth, I believe. He’s coming on

58
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:26,410
nineteenth. Anybody who is going to organize
here, food and all that … Michael? Who else

59
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,410
with you?

60
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,770
Is David? Where is David?

61
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:41,750
There he is. All right! So, I’ll give you
a check of thousand pounds which you can cash.

62
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:48,590
Get all the ration and everything with some
girls here.

63
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:54,089
I’m not going to pay. You have money in
the bank. Now, don’t get upset. I see some

64
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,669
people frowning [laughter]

65
00:11:56,669 --> 00:12:08,360
I’m not going to pay anymore now. Finished!
All right. So, we have money in the bank and

66
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:14,210
that money has to come handy now. So, about
thousand pounds I would like to sanction.

67
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:18,650
And, David you. Michael. Who else is here?

68
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:25,200
All right. That’s good. So four of you put
together, you decide what you want to buy.

69
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,670
And, some ladies you need here to help. Who
will be here?

70
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,670
Kay?

71
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:40,829
Who else? Those who are free. You – two.
Who else?

72
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:57,090
All right for the time being. Two of you and
four of these boys. The rest of you should

73
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:03,660
not shift here, should not stay here. But
once, you see, these people are over, finished

74
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,880
with it, then you can shift here. We’ll
see that. For now, we have two ladies who

75
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:15,850
are willing to stay here and four gentlemen.
All right? At least till the Guru Puja it’ll

76
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:21,709
be quite busy, I think, lots of people will
be coming. So, some more ladies who can spare

77
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:28,640
their time for these three-four days should
also raise their hands, I think, these three-four

78
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:39,860
days. All right? Who else?

79
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,860
What are you doing, Tanya?

80
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,860
Tanya: I’m working.

81
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:52,420
Shri Mataji: You are working, won’t be free.
All right. So about, say, three ladies are

82
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,600
there.

83
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:20,110
So, three and four – seven people. Till
the Guru Puja, we can manage somehow and then

84
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:28,850
we’ll see what happens.

85
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,029
Hello?

86
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:51,620
It’s all right. It’s all right. [inaudible]
The children are [inaudible]

87
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:59,959
So, those who are already here … who are
those who are staying here?

88
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:09,660
You are staying here and who? John, you are
there – four of you. Four. Five. Five of

89
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:23,920
you are here. Six? Six of you. Who is in Chelsham
Road now? What the girls are there? Michael

90
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,589
you are not here?

91
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:33,779
[A yogi speaks – inaudible]

92
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:44,789
No, I think you come along. Till the Guru
Puja, you see, you need here some people to

93
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:51,079
really do the job. You may go to sleep there
if there’s no room, if there are too many

94
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:54,350
people. I think we can manage.

95
00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:02,850
Guru Puja is on the twenty-fourth only. So,
hardly there are three-four days. I mean,

96
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:12,810
when will you go to Guru Puja? Evening? Friday
evening or Friday morning?

97
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,920
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

98
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:25,429
Friday? Friday. So, you see, hardly anytime.
Today is what… let Me see… Monday, Tuesday…

99
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:36,630
four-five days. All right. I may also shift
Myself. If the servants are here – no problem.

100
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,959
They will cook for Me.

101
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,459
But what the gas is working here?

102
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,449
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

103
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:51,919
Gas is not here. So, how do we cook?

104
00:16:51,919 --> 00:17:01,039
[Yogi responds – gas has been disconnected
downstairs… - inaudible]

105
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,039
Is it?

106
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,150
[Yogi responds – yes, I’ve had a look
downstairs]

107
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:13,359
So, if you get the gas, then it’s very easy.
I can get the servants here. Then, I can shift

108
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:34,840
Myself in a way. All right?

109
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,710
If there are say, five people – you five
people and three ladies – they can cook

110
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,690
for you, no problem, all of you. But gas you
must have. Without gas they cannot manage.

111
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,159
The water is running there? Hot and cold,
both?

112
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:49,880
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

113
00:17:49,880 --> 00:18:00,600
Just cold. So, how will you have hot water?
Is there an arrangement?

114
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,480
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

115
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:12,450
All right. So, gas connection if you can get
it tomorrow … is it possible?

116
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:23,970
Yogi: Yes, I can get the gas connected as
well as I can get the hot water running.

117
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,770
Shri Mataji: Without that how will you manage,
I just can’t understand.

118
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:30,169
Yogi: They’ll have to do it tomorrow night.

119
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:34,962
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course! Is there an electric
cooker here?

120
00:18:34,962 --> 00:18:37,130
Yogi: No. We only got one electric kettle
at the moment.

121
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:46,850
Shri Mataji: No, you have to have the gas.
Otherwise it won’t work out. If they connect

122
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:52,210
it tomorrow, the servants can come and start
cooking. In any case, I’ll ask them to shift

123
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:58,740
everything here, whatever is possible - vegetables
and ghee and all that. Plus, I’ll give you

124
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,250
money to buy rice perhaps we may need.

125
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:13,500
So, about four people: gentlemen would be
five and ladies would be three. Five and three

126
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,990
– eight persons. All right.

127
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,950
As soon as the gas is connected, they can
shift here. That’s the point is. Gas must

128
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:30,330
be connected. Otherwise, where will they cook?
You see, there’s no electrical cooker.

129
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:40,990
Yogini: Mother, I’ve got a smaller electric
cooker – just two rings and smaller than

130
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:45,130
oven. Perhaps it would be a start.

131
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,220
Shri Mataji: Start, we can!

132
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:56,179
Yogini: I’ve got it in the car actually.

133
00:19:56,179 --> 00:20:01,780
Shri Mataji: Is it? [laughter]

134
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:10,160
Yogini: Because, we drove it from London to
Brighton but we didn’t unload it and so,

135
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,809
we brought it all the way back but I couldn’t
understand why. [laughter]

136
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:19,880
Shri Mataji: Now, what do you say to that,
[It seems that Shri Mataji says someone’s

137
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:25,340
name but can’t make it out]. I was wondering
how is she got the thing… [laughter]. So,

138
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:32,780
we don’t have to worry about anything whatsoever.
But still we’ll need gas thing, but for

139
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:38,780
the time being it’s good. All right, you
shift it here.

140
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,190
[Yogi says something – inaudible.]

141
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,840
So, better do something with the gas also.
All right? Because without the gas, so much

142
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,540
cooking cannot be done. Partly, as she said.
So, better unload the thing and put it down

143
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,540
there.

144
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,970
[Yogi says something – inaudible.]

145
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,710
Gas, on your own?

146
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:07,210
Yogi: It will be better if we had a gas man
there. [laughter]

147
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:13,250
Shri Mataji: You better go and tell them,
“if you don’t connect, we’ll connect

148
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:24,660
ourselves [laughter].” I tell you, so many
beautiful things happening. So, we have to

149
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:30,960
have that hot water started immediately as
soon as the gas. So, tomorrow morning what

150
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,980
time, John, you think you can do for the gas?

151
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,420
Yogi: nine o’clock

152
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:41,240
Shri Mataji: So, let him come here by nine
o’clock? Then, you go ahead with him, and

153
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:52,090
get the man and get it done. All right. Douglas,
I know you can manage. Douglas is really a

154
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:57,960
daring person. The way he has fought all the
TM bhoots, you see, they’re all literally

155
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,710
frightened of him. [laughter]

156
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:07,880
You must see today’s article in The Times.
Did you read? Horrible article. Did you see

157
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:14,080
the… My God! You must see that. He was very
upset - David Krall. He came down and showed

158
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,580
Me the article. It was horrible. They are
already trying to advertise it and do all

159
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,490
kinds of things and, there’s somebody whom
they have paid perhaps for writing. David

160
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,690
can tell you. David, have you got the article?

161
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,970
[Yogi responds.]

162
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:37,870
So, we are going to work on that. Horrible
article! He was very upset – David. [laughter]

163
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:50,700
All right, he is going to get the photocopy.
Give it to Gavin. Give it to Gavin. Hold it

164
00:22:50,700 --> 00:23:04,890
with the prong. [laughter]

165
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:11,500
So shameless and so fraudulent! It’s all
falsehood they are talking; absolute falsehood.

166
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:17,840
So many people are levitating. Their guru
is levitating in the room. Everybody is levitating

167
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,600
there, you see. All falsehood, they can disappear
in thin air.

168
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:31,230
Yogi: It’s all Your work, mother. [Everyone
bursts into laughter]

169
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:37,140
And, seventeen thousand people are following…
seventeen million or something.

170
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,130
Yogis: Three hundred million.

171
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:46,620
Shri Mataji: Three hundred million. All false.
All, I tell you, all falsehood. But, I tell

172
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:55,030
you, these media people don’t understand
what they are up to. One has to write something

173
00:23:55,030 --> 00:24:04,840
to them that this all is false. Very disastrous!
Horrible!

174
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:14,940
Yogi: Media is skeptical of it … enlightenment,
world peace. They had to have metal detector

175
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,860
when they went to their head quarter. [inaudible]

176
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,780
Shri Mataji: We have our own detector.

177
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,840
Yogi: Yes.

178
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:29,960
Shri Mataji: Isn’t it? With our detector
we found that you are devils.

179
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:44,160
So, once we have this then it all came so
fast. Isn’t it? Doesn’t matter. So, you

180
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:49,299
arrange the first floor and the second floor
for all the people who want to come. You keep

181
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:57,559
the first floor for the ladies and the second
for the men. All right? Not the other way

182
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:03,600
round. Because there would be many who would
be married with children. But most of them

183
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,380
will be in Brighton – directly going to
that. But Jason, have you been able to receive

184
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:14,940
their information about when they are coming,
how they are going, what place they want,

185
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,010
how they want to be allotted?

186
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:22,700
Jason: Some of them, Mother, yes. We have
the French people, most of them arriving on

187
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:30,559
Saturday while some going directly to the
place on Friday. The Swiss people are arriving

188
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:41,990
about 3 o’clock Friday afternoon. I think
also, the Italians are coming about that time.

189
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,480
Phil Ward is in charge of organizing shuttle
and cars to bring them from the station to

190
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:52,370
the seminar. The Swiss people and probably
the Italians also would like to stay here

191
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:59,740
Sunday night because their flight goes on
Monday.

192
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,750
Shri Mataji: Oh, that’s [inaudible]. Also,
you will be surprised that this is on your

193
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:09,380
way to Brighton. So, even if they are coming
earlier you can give this address to them

194
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:14,990
so that they can come here first. And, from
here you can take some sort of a bus or something

195
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,240
to take all of them together.

196
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,760
Jason: Yes, Mother. There’s a green bus
that goes from Heathrow Airport to Gatwick

197
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:33,920
Airport that goes almost right pass the door…
[inaudible]

198
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:47,120
Shri Mataji: But why not make one place for
them to meet first of all? Some of them are

199
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,720
coming from the back doors also or what? Are
they coming from the Brighton side?

200
00:26:53,720 --> 00:27:00,960
Jason: Yes, Mother. Some of them. [Inaudible]

201
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:21,571
Shri Mataji: But if they are 
coming on a Sunday here or something, why

202
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:23,240
not they come here?

203
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,080
Jason: That will be after the Puja. [Inaudible]

204
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,809
Shri Mataji: So how many will be here actually?

205
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:36,150
Jason: On Sunday night, probably about fifty
or so.

206
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,150
Shri Mataji: Fifty here?

207
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,920
Jason: Just for the Sunday night but maybe
there will be others ….[Inaudible]

208
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:46,910
Shri Mataji: All right. So, for Friday how
many will be here?

209
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:51,790
Jason: Not sure… [Inaudible]

210
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:59,270
[Shri Mataji greets someone on the side]

211
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:07,840
Yogi: Three Italians are coming on Thursday
night.

212
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,840
Shri Mataji: Thursday night?

213
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,230
Yogi: And Friday morning seven o’clock is
arriving a group with …

214
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,530
Shri Mataji: Friday morning?

215
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,720
Yogi: Friday morning. And they want to stay
in the Ashram. I’ll bring them here.

216
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,040
Shri Mataji: All right. So, keep it Thursday.
Say so from … it’s going to be on. But

217
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:30,410
I mean gas has to be there. As soon as gas
is there I can shift here. No problem. But

218
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:38,430
gas has to be here. I’ll bring the servants
also with Me.

219
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:43,760
But after the Puja, after the thing Sunday
we should find out exactly how many people

220
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,500
are coming here, because Sunday night food
can be cooked here for them. Isn’t it? And,

221
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,160
they go on Monday morning?

222
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,160
Yogi: Yes, Mother.

223
00:28:51,160 --> 00:29:00,470
Shri Mataji: That’s it. So, we can arrange
that also. It could be arranged very clearly.

224
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:12,530
Nick, you have got this van till tomorrow?

225
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:23,470
Nick: Yes, Mother. I should be able to extend
it. [Inaudible]

226
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,970
Shri Mataji: All right. So tomorrow, why don’t
you send the van to Me?

227
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:25,970
Nick: Yes, Mother.

228
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,980
Shri Mataji: All right. Then, we’ll extend
it. I’ll pay for the extension.

229
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,000
Nick : There’s no need for that, Mother.

230
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,840
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. One day, I’ll pay
for it. All right? So, you send the van tomorrow

231
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:42,940
to Me and then extend it. Hmm? Yes, tomorrow
if you send Me the van, I can send Debbie,

232
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:48,870
and if the gas is fixed, they can start cooking
here. Even for… I mean you can cook for

233
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,549
few people on that but ten people I don’t
know.

234
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:55,799
Yogini responds [Inaudble]

235
00:29:55,799 --> 00:30:35,700
Shri Mataji: Best is to have 

236
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:57,419
the gas, you see.

237
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:49,440
He has given birth. Hello! He has given birth.
I mean not he. [laughter] His wife has given

238
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:56,559
birth to a baby boy and you know they had
very bad time with the twins that they had.

239
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,590
It’s horrible. Tenants had an effect on
the baby and the thing was delayed by about

240
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:09,970
one week but the baby is very healthy – nine
pound something and I have given him the name

241
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:19,750
Janak - Janaka. I hope you are happy with
the name. He’s a very sweet baby. All right.

242
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:28,520
Now, those who are coming from outside like
... are you come from Northampton, Southampton?

243
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:40,690
Who else? All of you. Where are you staying
now? Where are you staying tonight? You’ll

244
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:51,679
go back? You won’t come here? I mean, you
are not going to stay till Guru Puja? You

245
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,549
want to stay here?

246
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:58,110
[Yogi response inaudible]

247
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:10,220
All right. All right, you’ll go back to
Southampton and then you will come. So, how

248
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:21,500
are you? How is your wife? Same? So, she is
here or in Spain?

249
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:26,429
[Yogi response inaudible]

250
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:33,410
She is in Cambridge. How is the baby? He’ll
come round.

251
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:51,820
Boghdan, how are you? How is your wife?

252
00:33:51,820 --> 00:34:01,910
So, for you four-five people who are staying
here after getting the gas, you see – after

253
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:06,900
getting the gas, again I say, you come and
see Me tomorrow. Someone having any problem

254
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:16,589
over here you better stay with Me for the
time being till we get gas. What about his

255
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:25,429
food? Let him in Chelsham Road, I think till
then. If we get the gas tomorrow then there’s

256
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:29,520
no problem, you see. Then we will call you
from Chelsham Road. All right? Let him be

257
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,690
there at Chelsham Road. Who’s at Chelsham
Road now?

258
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:36,359
All right, Graham [We are not sure if Shri
Mataji says Graham or not] you are organizing

259
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:48,489
there. So, look after him. And, if we get
the gas tomorrow then he can shift here. All

260
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:50,049
right?

261
00:34:50,050 --> 00:35:06,309
How are you? All right? You wrote a very nice
letter to that man, that newspaper fellow.

262
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:13,450
Horrible. Just imagine I never even asked
anybody to take out the coat or anything.

263
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:21,570
In general way I said you take out your coats.
They have objection even for that. Can you

264
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:29,069
meditate with your raincoat on you? Absurd,
I tell you! How can these newspaper people

265
00:35:29,069 --> 00:35:36,940
be so stupid to write all that? I can’t
understand.

266
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:49,690
Yogini; Mother, sorry to interrupt You. There’s
been a very funny new development, because

267
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:58,420
this horrible man’s name has appeared in
the newspaper again. In Brighton, this horrible

268
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:10,010
nudist beach which makes us so sick, we heard
some very good news. By Your Grace, they want

269
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:13,200
to take away the nudist beach.

270
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,289
Shri Mataji: Nudist?

271
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:31,970
Yogini: The horrible naked beach they want
to take away. But, the man who would not take

272
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:46,940
off his shoes before You, has written to the
newspaper saying “Nudist beach is very good,

273
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:51,430
everyone should take out all their clothes.”

274
00:36:51,430 --> 00:37:01,930
Shri Mataji: Except for the raincoat! Look
at this stupidity! [laughter] Now, what do

275
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,319
you say to these real stupid people, you know.

276
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:08,549
Why not write a strong letter to editor of
this?

277
00:37:08,549 --> 00:37:10,260
[Yogi response inaudible]

278
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:20,559
Why do they give him so much importance? Who
is he? He is the Managing Director of what

279
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:21,700
company? Better…

280
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,420
[Yogi response inaudible]

281
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:40,390
Better write to them. All of you should do
it. Stupid fellow! Stupid people live here,

282
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:50,019
I tell you. What were you saying? John was
telling Me something about you.

283
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:59,950
Yes, you communicated something to John? John,
didn’t you say?

284
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:04,369
[Yogi response inaudible]

285
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:05,839
Paste?

286
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:10,269
[Yogi response inaudible]

287
00:38:10,269 --> 00:38:16,430
That is sandalwood paste to be made with a
stone, that one. John, you know what he told

288
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:24,210
Me he wants to know the name of the stone
that is to sit on his head. [laughter]

289
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:28,049
I said, “Stone!” I mean I’m quite strange
but not to that extent. [laughter]

290
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:35,630
I couldn’t understand. I’m sorry for that.
All right, this is the stone I was saying

291
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:41,990
or any stone like this, anyone which you can
rub. This is the thing – chandan, you can

292
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,430
put it. [Shri Mataji talks in the side]

293
00:38:44,430 --> 00:39:03,460
All right. So, with just this thing I said,that
on the stone is I’m rubbing it. Show him

294
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,430
that, Gavin.

295
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:24,039
Because of the heat, you see. Chandan is the
best for heat. If you get blisters due to

296
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:39,239
heat or anything – just rub this and put
it on the thing – very good. Have you heard

297
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:42,980
of any famous astrologer called M. K. Gandhi,
anyone of you?

298
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,680
Yogi: Yes.

299
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:55,119
Shri Mataji: Have you? I’ve never heard.

300
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:04,560
Yogi: I’m sure I’ve seen his advertisements.

301
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:14,390
Shri Mataji: He’s telling others good things
about Me.

302
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:30,609
That’s Athena. Athena, now, what’s happening?
Now, slowly. What happened? One chana. I only

303
00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:40,349
had three of them just now. All right, how
many do you want? As soon as I eat the chana,

304
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:47,269
the Ganas are standing there. [laughter]

305
00:40:47,269 --> 00:41:04,920
The Ganas are waiting to have some. That’s
their share. All right.

306
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:45,769
Now, we will have the puja and then we will
have more chana. All right, sit down. It’s

307
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:56,859
all right.

308
00:41:56,859 --> 00:42:19,029
[Yogi says something – inaudible]

309
00:42:19,029 --> 00:42:21,519
Have you read the letter of Patrick?

310
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:41,519
What can I say? Very uncertain. Only good
news is that one Mr. Marwah who was going

311
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:50,930
to do all our publicity work has been elected
as the Mayor, Mayor of Los Angeles. That’s

312
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:58,890
a very big news and this may do something
good, I think. So, first I’m going to do

313
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:03,329
all this in Los Angeles. Actually, I’ll
go to New York only to meet the Sahaja Yogis

314
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:10,099
there. And, then I will… as the program
is… you know the program, everything…

315
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:16,819
I’m happy you could come because they are
really worried about American tour. How they

316
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:25,219
will take it, whether it will be successful
or not? It will be!

317
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:36,170
Lets look at these nice Yogis people… just
look at them. Not worse person has seen them

318
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:45,959
levited. But they are telling all lies, you
see. “There is very much better coordination

319
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:52,890
of the body and the mind.” Can you believe
such a false story?

320
00:43:52,890 --> 00:44:00,150
So, I told him that you should meet this Dr.
Fredick or what was his name? Fredick? Ah,

321
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:05,359
Frenny. You go and see him. Show him this
article. You should say that we all want to

322
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:11,220
protest. He himself will be very happy. That
this is how he is going to cheat us, he is

323
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:17,119
fraudulent. And, why not we all put together?
Write a letter to the editor that, “You

324
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:24,969
have no business to publicize such a person
who has ruined the lives of so many.”

325
00:44:24,969 --> 00:44:36,440
Have you got that article of Madhu Dave…
Madhu Jain?

326
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,150
[Yogi response inaudible.]

327
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:51,089
Activities in India… six thousand crores,
ah? And, what David Praul told Me is this

328
00:44:51,089 --> 00:44:56,910
that so much has been written against him
but there is no mention of it. So, you take

329
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:03,759
David Praul, you and Frenny and all these
people put together. Make a very strong letter

330
00:45:03,759 --> 00:45:10,141
about it and let Dr. Frenny put it in. And
say, there are people here who can really…

331
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:23,200
thousands of people who can say what I’m
saying. Get hold of him.

332
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:30,519
The doctor friend of Rustom, did you contact
him? John, did you give him the address of

333
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:40,170
the doctor? Did you tell them about it? I
think Pamela was there. Pamela?

334
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,309
[Pamela response inaudible]

335
00:45:41,309 --> 00:45:49,630
What about that doctor? Did you tell him that
he should come for the Puja? Then what did

336
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:51,039
he say?

337
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,160
[Pamela response inaudible]

338
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,979
What did he say?

339
00:45:55,979 --> 00:45:58,089
[Pamela response inaudible]

340
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:09,959
Hmm… See, all such like that Di, Lady Di
or whoever she is… how is she now?

341
00:46:09,959 --> 00:46:15,660
[Yogi response inaudible]

342
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:22,059
So, why not take her help also in writing.
Now, you see, Warren is coming, all these

343
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:27,549
people are coming – you can all put facts
together. See this Dr. Frenny – all of you.

344
00:46:27,549 --> 00:46:32,309
And, tell him what he’s doing and what sort
of trouble he has given to others and how

345
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:38,140
he has taken the money. You go and tell him
very strongly. You, especially, we have to

346
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:43,930
save others now. It’s very important. Another
thing he says that Atlanta someplace somewhere

347
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:48,480
has all people have become very peaceful.
Naturally, if you make somebody into a cabbage

348
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:57,469
they will be. But the majority of the people,
I mean the greater percentage of the people

349
00:46:57,469 --> 00:47:12,029
who are in Ireland and who are in Israel have
become much more violent. One percent in Ireland

350
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:22,180
and three percent in Israel. And, you see,
how they are behaving. So, this Atlanta we

351
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:26,930
cannot find out but what about these two places?

352
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:31,549
This Madhu… if you get his thing you can
write down. He says that wherever his ashrams

353
00:47:31,549 --> 00:47:51,329
are nothing grows. Even the cows become barren.
Or you can ask Murray how it was published.

354
00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:55,220
It was sent to us, I think.

355
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:59,329
Yogi: Murray has that?

356
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:08,259
Shri Mataji: Murray has that so ask Murray
to help you there. All right? Now, one thing

357
00:48:08,259 --> 00:48:17,309
you can catch on him which you can play about
to say that he is anti-Christ. Whatever he

358
00:48:17,309 --> 00:48:23,680
preaches is anti-Christ. Because he leads
a life of licentiousness? himself and you

359
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,971
can give the example of Linda’s things that
was written. She has written it down. Then

360
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:33,150
he himself is making money out of us and has
got all the material things of the world at

361
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:46,049
the cost of his disciples. He is an anti-Christ
and there is no relationship of his work with

362
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:52,890
Christ, first of all. And, secondly you can
also put Karpur Gaurav and all that are actually

363
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:56,019
the worship of I think Shiva or something.

364
00:48:56,019 --> 00:49:21,279
[Shri Mataji asks someone in Hindi is the
Karpur Gaurav mantra is for Shivji or not.]

365
00:49:21,279 --> 00:49:30,119
It is the Shiva’s worship. So, what they
tell them is the idol worship of Shiva – put

366
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:37,940
it down. But because they don’t know any
Sanskrit they go on saying. All right? Modi

367
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:44,410
will be coming, he will give you the complete
shloka. It’s Shiva’s worship. So, that

368
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:47,430
will go in the Christian mind here.

369
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:58,819
Then, another good news is: Rustom has said
that in the Koran there is a description of

370
00:49:58,819 --> 00:50:05,289
Kundalini. They call it Assas and that at
the resurrection time, the Kundalini will

371
00:50:05,289 --> 00:50:11,339
be awakened by Mahdi. It’s all there. So
many things in the Koran, he was saying that

372
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:19,569
there are seven heavens, firmaments, through
which human beings has to pass, one has to

373
00:50:19,569 --> 00:50:21,329
ascend through this.

374
00:50:21,329 --> 00:50:26,680
But I was reading a book given to Me by one
of the Sahaja Yogis in Brighton. It’s very

375
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:38,819
clearly said in that there are angels of the
Mother and angels of the heavens and then

376
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:47,410
seven of them and seven of these and everything.
And, according to My calculation it is describing

377
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:55,569
Monday as the sabbath - Monday. Because as
you go you see, the Creator is on the third

378
00:50:55,569 --> 00:51:01,999
day or second day. It should be on the third
day. It’s the second day. First is the angel

379
00:51:01,999 --> 00:51:09,219
of the joy. And, that is Shiva. So, it is
Monday. Like that. Very clearly. And it is

380
00:51:09,219 --> 00:51:13,239
all written down, it’s preserved, and they
have just taken it out and translated. Can

381
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:18,089
you imagine? We have got now the scriptures
to go with. Those books are with Me – two

382
00:51:18,089 --> 00:51:23,609
of them. Can you get those books for Me, from
some shop?

383
00:51:23,609 --> 00:51:31,240
Who game Me that book? You gave Me, yes!

384
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,790
[Yogi response inaudible]

385
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:37,180
Only through your University?

386
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,730
[Yogi response inaudible]

387
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:48,170
You can? So, can you, two-three people buy
that and go through it. And, you’ll be amazed.

388
00:51:48,170 --> 00:52:01,190
I mean, that’s the real Bible, you can say,
about Christ. Even the Bible, which is written

389
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:05,400
now about the ten commandments, everything
this is related. Because that’s the original

390
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:15,790
one they found Out. Can you imagine? And,
these laws that were written in Bible at the

391
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:22,809
time of Moses, which are called Shariat in
the Islamic religion, are because the people

392
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:29,719
had become so bad, so bad that they had to
put such terrible, strict laws that anybody

393
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:35,900
does that must be cut – his throat must
be cut, his hands must be cut, legs must be

394
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:41,969
cut. All this is only because of these things
happening in those days. The people were so

395
00:52:41,969 --> 00:52:46,190
bad, so much on the decline that they had
to change all that and they started this.

396
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:54,459
This is very clearly written there. Better
get those two books and prepare it in that

397
00:52:54,459 --> 00:52:59,219
line. It will be good idea.

398
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:08,089
All right. You want to wash My feet? This
water – you can wash My feet. You go around

399
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:37,479
and put everywhere here. Shining these days
a bit too much. You see, when we went to Malmo,

400
00:53:37,479 --> 00:56:32,209
I said seven mantras for the sun and the sun
came out. And since that day it’s beautiful.

401
00:56:32,209 --> 00:56:43,410
All right.

402
00:56:43,410 --> 00:58:26,849
Can you 

403
00:58:26,849 --> 00:59:56,630
wash My feet?

404
00:59:56,630 --> 01:02:20,439
[Talk in 

405
01:02:20,439 --> 01:11:31,550
this CD seems 

406
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:54,920
to 
407
01:11:54,920 --> 00:00:00,000
