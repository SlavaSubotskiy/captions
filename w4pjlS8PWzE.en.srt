1
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,650
Yesterday was such a nice time we had together,
and we really enjoyed Diwali, I think.

2
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:14,409
I’ve never seen such a joyous ocean, absolutely
going in a tempest.

3
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:23,770
We have achieved the purpose of Diwali Puja,
I think, only yesterday: it’s to feel the

4
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,290
joy of God’s love.

5
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:45,200
But “diwali” word is from “deepa wali”
means the “rows of lights”.

6
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:59,540
It was celebrated firstly because thousands
of years back, Shri Rama was crowned on this

7
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,869
day.

8
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:11,900
That means the benevolence of human beings
was crowned, was accepted.

9
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:26,040
And in Shri Rama’s life, you see an ideal
personality being shown to be a king, to be

10
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:35,840
the benevolent king as described by Socrates.

11
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:44,290
So this was a great joyous thing that a benevolent
king was crowned.

12
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:51,569
That means we have to have a king who is benevolent.

13
00:02:51,569 --> 00:03:10,609
That’s only possible if 
the people who choose the king have no other

14
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:22,280
consideration but that of benevolence of all
the people.

15
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:32,840
So one has to come to the conclusion that
they have to be Sahaja Yogis, because other

16
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,150
think that: “How much money we’ll get
out of this power that we’ll have."

17
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,590
Some think: “How much power-oriented we
could be?”

18
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:55,609
Some think: “How many countries I can win?”
or any other domination.

19
00:03:55,609 --> 00:04:01,139
So we’ve got two types of theories: as we
see, is one is communism and another is democracy,

20
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:08,480
where one is power-oriented, the another is
money-oriented, and in both the cases we say

21
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,689
that it’s all failed.

22
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:18,690
And it’s a good news for all of you to know
that Russia, which was a country known to

23
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:28,690
be run in complete fear, has turned out to
be the best for Sahaja Yoga.

24
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,900
It is one of the super powers.

25
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:47,240
When the government is like that, I think
the people are better.

26
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:54,720
They do not have these false notions of individual
freedom.

27
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,360
They do not think that: “Ah, what’s wrong?”

28
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,960
I told them: “You must put oil on in your
head because you’ll become bald."

29
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,590
Next day all of them were done with the oil,
nothing doing.

30
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:20,800
So the kind of obedience they had, from very
beginning of their country, that sense of

31
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,530
obedience is so great, you tell them anything,
immediately they do it.

32
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,940
Not one, thousands.

33
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,900
One thousand were sitting in the hall; two
thousand were outside waiting for Me, on a

34
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,190
follow-on.

35
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,810
Imagine how wise and deep they are?

36
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:47,690
While in the West we are lost in our so-called
freedom idea of so-called freedom: “What’s

37
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,690
wrong?”

38
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,740
But actually we are slaves, if you see.

39
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,920
Any fashion that starts, everybody starts
doing it.

40
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,520
But why?

41
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,379
Why do we follow those fashions?

42
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:03,689
We must see how we are slaves.

43
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:06,849
Because others will laugh at us if we don’t
do like that.

44
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,700
They’ll make fun of us.

45
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,419
Because they will criticize us.

46
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:18,370
So because they have got a freedom to criticize,
we are frightened of such people who can criticize.

47
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,750
And now the criticizing people are criticizing
them.

48
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,500
Critics have critics, their critics are there,
there are other critics, and there are critics

49
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,539
after critics.

50
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:31,220
So only the critics are produced.

51
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,289
Where is the benevolence?

52
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:35,199
There’s no question of benevolence at all.

53
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:47,669
So in the freedom loving people who are supposed
to be free, the idea of benevolence is finished.

54
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:53,610
Because whatever good for you, whatever is
benevolent for you, can be only understood

55
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,699
if you have wisdom, if you have depth.

56
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:02,340
But if you have this kind of freedom is to
go amuck, do what you like: “Because everybody’s

57
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,270
doing it, I must do it.

58
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:10,199
Everybody is singing like this; so I must
do it."

59
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,629
But from where does this idea come in?

60
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:22,211
From where these ideas come in are the entrepreneurs
who want to befool you, make slaves out of

61
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:27,889
you, and this slavery is so-called freedom
for you.

62
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:33,060
But actually, I think it’s complete slavery
because you do what they tell you, behave

63
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,639
in the same manner as whatever they say.

64
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,500
There are no fashions in that country, very
few, very few women indulge into fashions.

65
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Nothing.

66
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,810
And men are also very simple.

67
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,370
They have no fashionable things.

68
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:55,270
They have only things which are convenient,
good for their climate.

69
00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:01,750
That’s what they wear, whether you laugh
or don’t laugh.

70
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,699
It’s everybody laughs here.

71
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:11,349
If anybody laughs at them they’ll say: “This
is stupid, you see, I’ll have pity for him,

72
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:12,419
that’s all."

73
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:21,440
So one has to understand that it was the king,
Rama, who was made the, actually accepted

74
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:29,389
by the public, like a crown was put on his
head to say that benevolence is the highest

75
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:30,389
thing.

76
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:39,090
And whatever is benevolent for us should be
accepted in our freedom, if we are really

77
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,880
a free country.

78
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,810
But if we are not free inside, we are bound
by what people will say; they’ll criticize

79
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,810
us.

80
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,820
Do you know as a result of that, there is
no art in this country [Italy]?

81
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,470
But I saw lot of art growing in Russia.

82
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:05,230
Because any art you produce is criticized,
so people have to be careful: “This should

83
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,610
not be so much, little this, little that."

84
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,070
Nobody can produce any art there.

85
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,050
Any musician is there is criticized in these
countries.

86
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,200
There if you go, the musicians are tremendous
musicians.

87
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:29,510
They have of a very high quality musicians
there, very high quality of dramatist, not

88
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,480
at all boring as they are here.

89
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:39,720
If you go any play in England, it’s so boring
that you feel like running away from there,

90
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,440
extremely boring.

91
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,170
There was a play, we went to see, it was called
as “Star Express” or “Express Star”

92
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,170
or something.

93
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,660
There was nothing, except on the wheels they
were moving round as ghar-ghar, ghar-ghar.

94
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:58,290
Nothing there ! So anybody would go mad with
it, I tell you.

95
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,130
We were there hardly for fifteen minutes,
came out with a headache.

96
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,870
We didn’t know where to go.

97
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,790
So with this kind of criticism that we have,
it’s only freedom we have is to criticize

98
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,620
other, make fun of others, react to others.

99
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:19,880
How can you enjoy?

100
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:25,880
To enjoy others first of all you must accept
the goodness of other people, not mentally,

101
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,889
from your heart.

102
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:37,110
And that will bring the benevolence on this
country of ours which we call the Kingdom

103
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,399
of God.

104
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:51,209
Then there is, the second day is where Narakasura
was killed.

105
00:10:51,209 --> 00:11:03,170
Now Narakasura was the one who was the devil
from the Hell, they say: very cunning, very

106
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:08,750
clever, and he was killed by the Goddess.

107
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:19,709
Actually he was killed by a, another Incarnation,
Kartikeya, but Goddess gave Him the power

108
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:21,320
to kill.

109
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:28,740
So when he was killed it was celebrated because
the evil was killed, but we don’t find that,

110
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:35,500
these days the evil people are getting peace
awards.

111
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,880
So what is the reason for this kind of a perverted
brain?

112
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,740
How is it they are using perversion?

113
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,510
Just the opposite of it.

114
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:57,930
What has worked out these things, so again
we find the same so-called freedom to become

115
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:02,779
also evil.

116
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:05,240
So we have freedom to become evil.

117
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:14,199
First of all, we have freedom not to be benevolent,
and secondly to become evil we have freedom.

118
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:20,600
So the Narakasura within us must be killed,
the one which teaches us evil, to do evil

119
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,860
to others.

120
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:28,339
If you are busy doing evil to others, you
can never enjoy.

121
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:35,209
Because you enjoy doing evil to others.

122
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:39,420
So that has to be faced within ourselves,
not in other people.

123
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:46,990
It’s very easy to say that this Sahaja Yogi
is caught up, that Sahaja Yogi is like that,

124
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,320
but very difficult to say: “Mother, I am
caught up.

125
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,519
I have got this problem within myself."

126
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:58,699
So when you start seeing yourself your heart
opens out.

127
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:04,940
Unless and until you learn how to open out
your heart how can you enjoy?

128
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,800
Open your heart.

129
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,329
Many people live on very superficial level.

130
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:13,960
All right, some of them might say that: “I
am possessed, Mother.

131
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,730
I’ve got this possession."

132
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,730
Why?

133
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,230
“I’ve got this conditioning, that conditioning."

134
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,430
But why?

135
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:26,990
You don’t want to enjoy.

136
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,300
So watch yourself, see for yourself.

137
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,610
This is my conditioning, “All right, I’ll
put you right."

138
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,610
See in the mirror.

139
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:37,079
Tell yourself: “This kind of a useless conditioning
I’ve got it from where?

140
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:39,860
Because I’m Indian, because I’m French,
because of English."

141
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:45,850
Open the heart.

142
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:51,750
And opening the heart is only possible if
Narakasura sitting on your heart is killed,

143
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,550
finished, once for all.

144
00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:00,839
In small, small things there is joy.

145
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,190
In very little things also there’s a ripple
of joy.

146
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,020
If you are sensitive you can catch it.

147
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,410
And why not enjoy?

148
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:20,360
Why to have these stupid conditioning on our
heads for nothing at all that we can’t enjoy?

149
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:27,029
Enjoyment is only possible if you take out
this one sitting on your heart.

150
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:36,399
So, that is the second part of the Diwali
that you have to open your heart.

151
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,940
Forget your nationality, forget your race,
forget everything.

152
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,590
It’s a funny kind of things Sahaja Yogis
have.

153
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:52,459
They must be respected, they must be treated
like this, or maybe that we are something

154
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,870
great and they are no good.

155
00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:01,459
If you cannot mix up with the collective,
something’s wrong with you.

156
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:02,459
Nothing wrong with others.

157
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:07,529
Easy to find faults with others.

158
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:08,690
But what’s the use?

159
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:13,100
If you start finding faults with others you
do not become clean.

160
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,100
Supposing I find that your clothes are not
clean.

161
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,610
My clothes are not going to get clean by that,
are they?

162
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:27,470
It’s so practical and simple it is that
we should see ourselves, what’s wrong with

163
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:35,870
us, and improve ourselves, so that we can
really, really, from our heart, enjoy.

164
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:42,220
Third one is a very beautiful thing is the
Lakshmi Puja, means the day they worship Lakshmi.

165
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:47,279
I’ve told you many a times, the symbol of
Lakshmi was created really beautifully.

166
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:53,790
And it was so that She came out of the water.

167
00:15:53,790 --> 00:16:03,029
Through the water, She came out so clean.

168
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:13,660
And She has no pride.

169
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,610
She doesn’t assert Herself.

170
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,810
She doesn’t put Her pressure on others.

171
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:25,259
But human beings are just opposite if they
have money, they ride on a horse all the time,

172
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:26,670
they cannot come down.

173
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,370
It’s impossible to talk to them.

174
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:39,870
So a person who has money is not the one who
is worshipping Lakshmi, who is not a “Lakshmi

175
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,790
pati” as called him, the owner of the Lakshmi.

176
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,509
Because She stands only on a lotus.

177
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:47,880
Can you imagine how light She must be to stand
on a lotus?

178
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,649
She has a big body, everything is there, but
She stands on a lotus.

179
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:58,980
That She takes all Her weight within Herself,
She just sucks in Her weight as Shri Krishna

180
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,160
has described.

181
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,910
That like a tortoise sucks in his legs inside
his body, in the same way, we have to suck

182
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:18,450
in all the weight of money, weight of your
positions, weight of your so-called education,

183
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:24,839
weight of some aristocratic family you are
born of.

184
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:36,610
This is all nonsense which makes you a heavy
person, to go down very fast.

185
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:42,390
So She stands, or floats in a way, on the
lotus.

186
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:50,390
And what a thing is beautiful, this lotus,
that She doesn’t disturb any petals of the

187
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,810
lotus, nothing.

188
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:57,340
She just stands peacefully in a balance.

189
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,550
Unless and until you have balance you cannot
stand on a lotus.

190
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,559
So She is so balanced.

191
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:09,600
Her center of gravity is so balanced that
She cannot topple down.

192
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,630
Now in Sahaja Yoga, some people, you ask them:
“How are you?”

193
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:21,720
[Shri Mataji mimes a sign that means just
ok] Ten years have passed, sometimes like

194
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,720
this also.

195
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,600
[Shri Mataji mimes a sign that means you are
up side down]

196
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
[Laughter]
Why?

197
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:35,990
Because you must be grounded in the Mother
Earth, into the practical side of it.

198
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:44,100
It’s nothing- something, we are hanging
in the air, but we are grounded in the Mother

199
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,350
Earth.

200
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:54,470
And the slightest thing happens to us, again
we come back to our balance.

201
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:58,919
So this is Her position when She stands up
in a lotus.

202
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:04,480
Now She has a hand, one hand like this [which
gives], one hand like this [which protects],

203
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,049
and there are two hands which have got again
the lotuses, the pink ones.

204
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:14,010
Yesterday, you saw the pink, pink is Her fragrance
I think is spread on the sky.

205
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:28,470
And She is pink, pink because that shows that
Her house, Her nature is pink, pink is inviting,

206
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,640
is loving.

207
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:42,080
She is a very fond hostess, that She wants
everybody to come in, in Her house.

208
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:49,010
But if you see a rich man, he’ll have ten
dogs outside and nobody can come inside the

209
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,550
house.

210
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,980
Only the dogs and he lives.

211
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,840
He can’t live with human beings.

212
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:04,230
So the house is closed, the doors are closed,
everything’s closed, money is closed permanently.

213
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:12,039
So, such a person cannot be called as Lakshmi
pati, he’s not a Lakshmi pati.

214
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:19,750
Because he must have a cozy, beautiful – cozy,
again I say, cozy house.

215
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:26,270
“Cozy” doesn’t mean like a hospital,
anything drops, you feel frightened: “Oh,

216
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,360
my God."

217
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,080
Then you’ll pick it up.

218
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,950
“Cozy” means where you are comfortable.

219
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:38,840
It’s all right, in the house, in the home,
if somebody comes and stays.

220
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,010
Then it’s little bit this here and there,
doesn’t matter, then you put it right, but

221
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,799
that doesn’t mean the lousy house also.

222
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:52,210
It should not be taken as a lousy house, but
a house which is inviting.

223
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:58,000
When people come in, you give them a place
to sit down and make them enjoy.

224
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,140
It’s not done, in India at least.

225
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:05,050
I don’t know, so far we are now quite getting
westernized, that anybody drops something

226
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:09,830
on the carpet we’ll never clean it in their
presence because it’s very bad manners.

227
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,970
Carpet is not important than the guest, is
it?

228
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:21,540
Or if we break something, say, a glass, then
we say: “Very good, it’s something has

229
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,540
gone out, some bad thing has gone out."

230
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:29,179
Or a thermometer is broken we say the same
thing.

231
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:44,970
All these things happen, in a way, just to
see how far we are open-hearted or to suggest

232
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:49,490
to you that something is going wrong.

233
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:54,940
If something falls off just see what’s going
on in your brain.

234
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,120
What are you thinking?

235
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,982
Is there something funny you are thinking
about somebody or something wrong you are

236
00:22:01,982 --> 00:22:02,982
thinking?

237
00:22:02,982 --> 00:22:05,820
Then it’s up to you.

238
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,810
Otherwise everything it’s nice and smooth.

239
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:15,510
So, another conditioning we have, which is
a very, very funny conditioning, either we’ll

240
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:23,350
have the lousiest of lousiest houses or we’ll
have houses which will just look like hospitals,

241
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:27,250
even a rat would not enter there, leave alone
human beings.

242
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,620
They’ll polish all the brass, they’ll
polish everything.

243
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,860
Husband, wife will fight on that.

244
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,529
They’ll have divorces for it.

245
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:40,909
But not even a rat will enter that house.

246
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:43,650
I have seen many houses like that.

247
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:47,950
And I’ve seen the other way round also:
those that are lousiest, where there’s no

248
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:52,570
garden, there are no flowers, nothing beautiful.

249
00:22:52,570 --> 00:23:03,760
So, we have to be not to this extreme or that
extreme, but something that will give joy

250
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,240
to others, to visitors, to people who come
to your house, we’ll soothe the sick.

251
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,220
People should feel happy to come to your house.

252
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:19,970
So there’s no showing off.

253
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:27,120
Not to show off but to make them comfortable
and very happy.

254
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,620
You can do lots of things, very interesting
things, if you have the Lakshmi principle

255
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,620
in you.

256
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,740
I’ve met once a Chinese gentleman.

257
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:41,049
He had a very beautiful house, everything,
and he was so interesting.

258
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:45,820
He had made the house very interestingly,
very nice, very beautiful.

259
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:50,799
And you didn’t feel any aggression at all
in that house.

260
00:23:50,799 --> 00:24:00,260
So, I saw his dining room done with very good,
beautiful, green marble and white lights.

261
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,230
I said: “Must be quite expensive."

262
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,520
“No, that’s the beauty.

263
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
It’s very cheap.

264
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
You know how I did it cheaply."

265
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:14,529
All the time he was telling Me how he did
things cheaply, means he has never shown off

266
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:15,529
it’s expensive.

267
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:19,159
But a person who’s aggressive will say:
“Oh, you know, this one I got it for so

268
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:22,110
much, so much, so much."

269
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:25,960
But a person who wants to give you joy will
say: “No, I tell you it’s so cheap, you

270
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,690
won’t believe what a sum."

271
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:34,510
That’s the sign of a person who wants to
give joy to his guests.

272
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:40,279
He’ll never try to say that: “It’s very
expensive, I spent so much money, this is

273
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,650
so, this that."

274
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,350
This is showing off.

275
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,770
And then ultimately you’d say: “It’s
very good,” three times.

276
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,929
“Then it’s yours.

277
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:48,929
Have it."

278
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:49,929
Of course he can’t give you the floor.

279
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:54,090
The rest of it you can take.

280
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:59,600
That’s, that’s what it is a personality
which is joy-giving.

281
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:09,590
Like a lotus, as I have told you before also,
a beetle comes, a black beetle with horrible

282
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:17,710
thorny legs, and enters into this lotus for
a sleeping in the night, you see.

283
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:25,360
And the lotus closes down its cosiness on
it and sleeps very comfortably.

284
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,399
And then next day it opens out, so it flies
out.

285
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:37,820
That’s how your homes, your ashrams, your
hearts should be.

286
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:46,970
Beautiful, so that anybody can feel that soothing
and that comforting feeling, when they are

287
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,890
in your company.

288
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,710
But not a person who was reactionary.

289
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:55,320
Like you go to somebody’s house and immediately
say: “I don’t like this carpet."

290
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:01,830
See, it’s bad manners, absolute bad manners
to say like that, to say that: “I don’t

291
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:05,830
like it,” it’s bad manners for Sahaja
Yoga.

292
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:11,220
Any music you hear, supposing there is a musician
who could be of a very high level, could be

293
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:17,480
of a very ordinary level, you should be able
to enjoy everything; otherwise you are not

294
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,980
a Sahaja Yogi.

295
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:23,409
If you are going to criticize a musician that:
“Oh, God, what a musician.

296
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:27,660
He’s no good this, that” then he’s not
going to improve.

297
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:33,230
But if you encourage the musician: “Oh,
you are very good.

298
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,830
You are very great,” he’ll play much better
next time; you’ll see that.

299
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:40,149
There’s no falsehood about it.

300
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:44,070
Some people think it’s not honest.

301
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:52,970
But this kind of useless, absolutely fatal
kind of honesty is not wanted in Sahaja Yoga.

302
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,820
You be honest to yourself.

303
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:01,190
And there’s no need to tell anybody your
opinion very honestly.

304
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:06,600
Keep it to yourself, all these honest opinions,
and direct towards yourself.

305
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,970
Like you see somebody.

306
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:13,309
Now, honestly you want to tell him that he
is wearing a funny dress, honestly.

307
00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:21,550
You better look at yourself, what sort of
a dress you are wearing.

308
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,600
And what business you have got to tell him
that he’s wearing funny?

309
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,110
On the contrary, you say: “This is very
nice.

310
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,110
I like it.

311
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,110
It’s very nice.

312
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,110
It’s good, good.

313
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,110
Nice one."

314
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,610
They’ll say: “No ” But he’ll say that:
“No, not so good.

315
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,610
Yours is nice."

316
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,240
“Oh, you can get this very cheaply, you
see, very cheaply.

317
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,570
I’ll tell you from where.

318
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,660
And you can have it if you like.

319
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,120
I can take yours.

320
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,980
You take mine."

321
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:51,309
So the basic, subtle point is that, that with
your love, you are encouraging everyone, you

322
00:27:51,309 --> 00:28:03,330
are helping everyone, you are creating a confidence
in him, [in] his personality and a kind of

323
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,570
a rapport which is very subtle.

324
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:17,549
So, a lotus is born in the pond, which is
so dirty, filthy, full of worms, everything,

325
00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:21,760
like as we see the world is today.

326
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,100
But the lotus covers with his fragrance the
whole of that pond and covers it up completely

327
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,539
and you forget the thing what is behind.

328
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:36,559
It has very big, big leaves, very big leaves,
you see, like the ears of the elephant and

329
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,350
that covers the whole thing.

330
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,870
So you don’t see any filth or dirt.

331
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:44,929
What you see is beautiful, clean, big leaves.

332
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:50,980
Sometimes they are like a “tali”[plate],
like a big tali that we use for eating.

333
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:57,580
And then all these things are covered with
you.

334
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,750
There’s no honesty about it.

335
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:07,149
They could say: “Why should we be honest,
let such say all the worms and the filth growing

336
00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:08,149
about?”

337
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:17,529
But the honesty lies in honestly understanding
what is your job as Sahaja Yogi is.

338
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:26,039
You are not there to point out the bad points
but you are there to cover all the bad points,

339
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,700
all the loopholes, with your love.

340
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:35,149
That’s your job, and there you have to be
honest.

341
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:41,940
Sense of honesty, the way it is accepted these
days, it has created only cheats and thugs

342
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,070
and thieves.

343
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,440
Even a thief can be won over.

344
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,950
You can.

345
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:53,620
I’ll give you an example.

346
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,490
I met one boy in Delhi market.

347
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:01,100
Poor thing, he was all wounded, he was suffering
so I brought him in the car home.

348
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,340
So in the family, My brother and My husband
both got very worried.

349
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,840
He said: “Who is this brother-in-law you
have brought in?”

350
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,580
I said: “He is My nephew.

351
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,020
All right, let it be.

352
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,340
Doesn’t matter, whatever you say, I’ll
keep him."

353
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,760
So I looked after him.

354
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,090
I treated him.

355
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,860
He got all right.

356
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,630
These two persons got after him: “We could
send him to the police, send him to the police,

357
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,630
this.

358
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,679
I said: “Let’s try now, let us see, he’s
a good man, he’ll be all right."

359
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:26,679
“No, send him to the police."

360
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:30,470
Might have been, I don’t know, might have
been.

361
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:35,960
And they were after his life; till ten days
he was all right, I soothed him down.

362
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,870
After tenth day, he was so fed up with these
two persons, he ran away.

363
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:44,210
And he ran away, and he ran away with what,
do you know?

364
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:50,720
He ran away with all the things that belonged
to My brother and My husband.

365
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,610
And he left My necklaces, My watches, everything
nicely.

366
00:30:54,610 --> 00:31:00,130
[Laughter] He didn’t touch that; he didn’t
touch that.

367
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:05,269
Shri Mataji to someone: Hello, see when I
am talking, don’t talk to each other.

368
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:06,780
This is a new Sahaja Yogi?

369
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,700
Tell him not to talk.

370
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,800
When I’m talking don’t talk.

371
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,380
That’s not the way.

372
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,210
So he just ran away.

373
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,120
And imagine, he left – I had a necklace,
a very nice, beautiful, expensive necklace,

374
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,049
I should say, given by My mother – he didn’t
touch it.

375
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:30,080
He didn’t touch anything and he took away
whatever was possible from their purse, from

376
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,100
their things, whatever were left, everything
he took away.

377
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,100
“Now,” I said, “now go to the police."

378
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,230
[Laughter] “Fine.

379
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,790
What?”

380
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:50,669
So, this is how one has to know that the honesty
is for yourself, not for others.

381
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:54,150
Don’t try to be honest with others.

382
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,700
Be honest to yourself.

383
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,889
Keep that honesty to yourself because maybe
it’s rational and maybe that it is just

384
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:06,360
a matter of habit that you are trying to hurt
others.

385
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,000
So first check on your mind and find out if
you are trying to hurt others or you are trying

386
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
to please others.

387
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,010
Otherwise don’t talk; just keep quiet.

388
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:20,750
If you are going to say something to please
others, talk; otherwise just don’t talk.

389
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:29,140
And you’ll be surprised, when you say nice
things to others, how niceness comes to you.

390
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:33,110
Like supposing somebody comes and tells Me
that: “Mother, he is very bad.

391
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:37,269
He has troubled me so much, this thing, that
thing.

392
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:39,990
I don’t like him,” so I tell him: “No,
no, he was praising you a lot."

393
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,720
It’s, it’s not honest, but I tell him.

394
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,120
“He was praising you.

395
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,639
He was so much in love with you.

396
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:47,649
He’s so kind to you.

397
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:49,929
He was telling Me he loves you very much."

398
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:50,940
He said: “Really?”

399
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,460
“Yeah, he did say."

400
00:32:52,460 --> 00:33:00,059
Next day you find them going together.

401
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:05,200
So in Sahaja Yoga, once you come in there’s
very little, is left out, very little here

402
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,200
and there.

403
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,870
And some of them are really very superficial
but most of you have very little things left

404
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,210
here and there.

405
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:18,510
And only if you can watch that part you can
throw it away and you can really become very

406
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:24,750
joyous people.

407
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:34,850
Now there are some people who never smile,
who never laugh.

408
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,500
So then you are allowed to tickle them.

409
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,420
[Laughter] It’s absurd.

410
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:50,159
It’s said that you have to be like children;
you have to be like children.

411
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,860
You play with something, finished; then you
play with another, finished.

412
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,860
You don’t get involved into anything.

413
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,940
You don’t get attached to anything.

414
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:02,679
Unless and until you’ve that child-like
heart you cannot enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

415
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:03,679
It’s useless.

416
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:09,000
You will be here for years together; you will
be useless, absolutely.

417
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,520
Specially if you are coming from false gurus,
it’s very difficult.

418
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,460
Because what I have known of false gurus,
they never laugh, never smile.

419
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,800
They are very serious.

420
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,130
Only take your money, keep on the backside.

421
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:33,429
So it is important that we should be in a
very joyous mood, alert, aware, enjoying every

422
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:35,180
bit of it.

423
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:39,270
That’s one of the Lakshmi’s principles
is.

424
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:45,701
Now another thing is that, the suggestion
is of the left hand is like this, means She

425
00:34:45,701 --> 00:34:46,899
is giving.

426
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:54,960
A person who has money must give, not to the
Pope, I never mean that, but must give to

427
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,650
somebody who needs it.

428
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:02,820
But so secretly that this [right] hand should
not know, is so far away, this one [right

429
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,820
hand is up].

430
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,090
This [left] hand should give, just secretly.

431
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:08,100
Sometimes it’s difficult to give money to
anyone.

432
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:13,380
I find it difficult, because I find it that
people will not like it.

433
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,730
So there is a way of giving.

434
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,470
There are so sweet ways of giving.

435
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:23,310
Just try to notice what that person likes.

436
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:27,930
Sometimes even children understand.

437
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:30,440
Like I know, of My granddaughter.

438
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:36,770
She said: “This boy, Nani, doesn’t even
have any good chappels.

439
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,860
I feel so bad about it.

440
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,860
But how to give him?

441
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,370
He will not take money from me."

442
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,640
So I said: “You do one thing.

443
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,840
You go and do something to his chappel."

444
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,360
So she went and little bit spoilt his chappels
more, you see.

445
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,020
When they were walking together it broke.

446
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,850
So she said: “Ah, see now, the chappels
are broken."

447
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,200
She took him to a chappel shop and bought
him a chappel.

448
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,460
He said: “But I have no money."

449
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,830
“No, just take it.

450
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,830
Just take it.

451
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:01,830
It’s all right.

452
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,190
Just, I’ll be very happy if you take."

453
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,410
That’s how!

454
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:12,680
It’s so sweet to hear and to do it, how
beautiful it must be!

455
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:20,030
We like to hear everything, we want to see
in a film everything good, in a television,

456
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:24,430
but when it comes to us we are different.

457
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:30,400
When we see a mother-in-law torturing her
daughter-in-law, we always say: “Oh, look

458
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,670
at her, how cruel she is."

459
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:35,940
But we don’t want to see we are the same.

460
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,990
So cruelty is out of question in Sahaja Yoga.

461
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,400
Out of question!

462
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,590
Nobody has to be cruel to anyone, nobody has
right to be cruel, whether they are leaders

463
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:56,300
or non-leaders or anything they are, you have
no business anyway to be cruel to anyone,

464
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,810
hurting anyone.

465
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:02,280
We are not daggers, we are lotuses.

466
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:09,360
Ha, if you have to hit somebody, hit with
a lotus.

467
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,000
It’s such a delicate thing.

468
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,800
But it can be only understood if you go deep
into it, into Sahaja Yoga, otherwise it cannot

469
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,420
be understood.

470
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,860
Now, a saint is a saint.

471
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,860
He cannot become cruel, he cannot.

472
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,560
There’s no need.

473
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:36,600
What is the need to be cruel?

474
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,370
So then with one hand there should be “daana”
[donation], means “giving”.

475
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:44,720
Giving in a way that is secret.

476
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,010
There’s no need to give Me anything.

477
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,470
I’ve been telling you: “Don’t give Me
anything."

478
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,470
I don’t want to take anything.

479
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:51,510
If you give Me anything, gold and silver,
I’ll leave it here.

480
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,020
I cannot take it.

481
00:37:53,020 --> 00:38:00,070
The reason is not that, I mean, I don’t
appreciate that you are loving Me, this thing,

482
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:04,750
but a flower is sufficient for Me.

483
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,590
But a person who needs something you must
give.

484
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:14,080
I’m so self-contained, you know that very
well, that I can live anywhere, I can live

485
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,920
on the street, I can live anywhere, I have
no problem, I can do without food, no problem.

486
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:24,760
All right, in adoration you want to give Me
something, but I’ve been telling that: “Don’t

487
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
give Me.

488
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,770
If you give Me anything expensive, I’ll
leave it here.

489
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,810
I will not take it."

490
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:38,360
And we have now passed a law or regulation,
everything, but I hope you’ll listen to

491
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,820
Me.

492
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:47,820
So what is needed is the thing that we should
know what is the dearth of another person,

493
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,820
what will he need?

494
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:54,390
You need silver for Puja, all right, I’ll
give you silver, all right.

495
00:38:54,390 --> 00:39:00,860
But in such a sweet manner that you don’t
feel that Mother is giving us it.

496
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:10,650
So there should be a feeling of giving at
the right time, at the best opportune moment,

497
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:13,920
to give something.

498
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,900
That is also one thing, just like a cameraman
knows when to click, in the same way you must

499
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,640
know when to click when giving is concerned.

500
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:36,870
When odd times if you give, it can be a very
hurting thing, the person can feel very hurt,

501
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,830
if you give at the odd time to someone something.

502
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:45,100
You have so many stories of that kind, like
Sudama’s is that thing, when he went to

503
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,500
see Shri Krishna.

504
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:52,300
And Shri Krishna took out his procession,
in the procession there were just taking out

505
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,440
his bad eye with some pearls.

506
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,810
So, Sudama said: “Let one pearl fall in
to my lap also."

507
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,810
He was very poor.

508
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:07,970
But when he went back, he saw his house was
made of gold by Shri Krishna.

509
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:11,110
It was such a surprise!

510
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,800
So that elevates the heart.

511
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,650
So it should be elevating.

512
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:25,830
It should not be sensational, but it should
be elevating, and that helps the person because,

513
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:34,550
whatever you give for spiritual growth, is
the one that is the best thing that you can

514
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:40,500
give to anyone, even in material things.

515
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:48,360
Even in material things, you give something
in for spiritual growth.

516
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:53,500
There are so many ways, if you want to think
about it, of giving someone something that,

517
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:59,370
spiritually, he feels comforted, he feels
happy and joyous.

518
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:05,220
Then another hand [right] is like this.

519
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:12,622
This hand is showing that you have to protect,
you have to protect.

520
00:41:12,622 --> 00:41:18,090
I’ve seen Sahaja Yogis, well some of them
who are very superficial join hands with non

521
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,090
Sahaja Yogis.

522
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:22,550
Immediately, you can make out the fraternity.

523
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:27,990
If I see one woman going with another woman
whom I know is a bhootish one, I know that

524
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,170
another must be.

525
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:32,350
That’s how the combination always works.

526
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:40,170
There’s a fraternity of good Sahaja Yogis
and a fraternity of bad Sahaja Yogis.

527
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:46,460
So when you see this [right] hand is a protection
to all the Sahaja Yogis.

528
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,990
We all have to protect each other, nobody
should touch you.

529
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:54,790
Of course, I’m all the time worried about
your protection.

530
00:41:54,790 --> 00:42:00,390
If anybody comes and criticizes a Sahaja Yogi,
any one, he may be the Prime minister and

531
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:03,110
things, I’ll stand by the Sahaja Yogis.

532
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:07,420
I’ll go up to any court or anywhere and
I‘ll stand by that Sahaja Yogi.

533
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:11,620
Even, he may be wrong, still I’ll I‘ll
stand by the Sahaja Yogi because his Spirit

534
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,780
is there.

535
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:17,090
So we have to protect.

536
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:22,170
We have to protect our children, we have to
protect our wives, we have to protect our

537
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:28,690
husbands, we have to protect anaraksha [unsure]
as they call it.

538
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:34,900
Protect all the artists, protect all the people
who need protection in this world.

539
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,930
So many people need protection from Sahaja
Yogis.

540
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:44,200
Now see, the classical art is dying out, there
are having funny sort of modern art.

541
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,540
I don’t mind if it is really modern in the
sense that they are evolved people and they

542
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,020
are producing something of a spiritual value.

543
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:55,060
But one line like that [horizontal] and one
line like that [vertical] makes a drawing

544
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,060
or a painting.

545
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,250
Don’t support such nonsense.

546
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:00,870
Then poetry, which is wrong, should not be
supported.

547
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:07,570
Or literature which is talking of filthy things,
ugly things, dirty things should never be

548
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:08,680
protected.

549
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:15,520
But whatever is good, whatever is beautiful
produced, created by any one, even by a child,

550
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,470
must be protected.

551
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:25,080
Like a politician who is a honest politician
is a good politician who is benevolent, he

552
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,530
may not be a Sahaja Yogi, but he should be
protected.

553
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:31,430
In your heart of hearts you should think:
“Mother, please protect this man."

554
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,460
You must have feelings for them.

555
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:39,710
So what we have to protect here is the goodness,
is the peace.

556
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:45,960
That’s our duty, we have to protect.

557
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,510
We should not say: “All right, why should
we care?

558
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:48,820
He is not a Sahaja Yogi."

559
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,130
No, but he is a good man.

560
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:55,100
Whether he is a Sahaja Yogi or not doesn’t
matter, but he is a good man so we protect

561
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,840
him because of his virtues.

562
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:01,890
You must protect a person who is virtuous,
it’s very important.

563
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:08,380
For his virtuous sake, you must protect him.

564
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:13,280
And you should not be only limited among yourselves,
Sahaja Yogis, you are the protectors of the

565
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,510
world!

566
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:19,630
You are the kings of the world, think like
that.

567
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:24,750
You have to worry about everything, what’s
happening here and what’s happening there.

568
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:28,150
You must know every thing.

569
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:31,630
So, some people say: “Mother says, don’t
see television."

570
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:34,690
I do not say like that, absolutely.

571
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:40,010
What I was saying, you must see what is happening
in the world.

572
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,930
But all the time glued to the television,
your eyes will be spoiled, and see all dirty,

573
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:45,220
filthy nonsense, there’s no need.

574
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,520
Why should I tell you?

575
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,100
You yourself will know.

576
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:54,850
But you must see things, you must be informed,
well informed, specially the ladies must be

577
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:56,300
very well informed.

578
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:01,180
It’s very important, because what I found,
ladies in Sahaja Yoga, they come, they just

579
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,380
jump in the sea, finish there, that’s not
the way.

580
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:10,240
You must learn how to swim, you must know
how to make others also to swim, protect them,

581
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,551
You must know every thing that’s going on
in this world where you are born.

582
00:45:13,551 --> 00:45:16,490
You’re not to be just excluded from there,
you must know everything.

583
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:21,260
You ask Me, I’m a woman, I know everything
about every country, I know the problem.

584
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,680
That’s how I can solve.

585
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:31,930
In Colombia I went there, you know what has
happened now in Colombia.

586
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:35,700
In Russia, everywhere, you have to put your
attention to all these things.

587
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:43,180
Specially, the women must know they are shaktis
and they’re shaktis of love, of attention.

588
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:52,490
So this protective speciality has to be with
us and we must know we are in charge.

589
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,470
We are in charge of this world.

590
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:58,480
We are in charge of the whole humanity; we
have to look after them.

591
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,950
We are not limited Sahaja Yogis.

592
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,760
We are unlimited.

593
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,040
We are eternal beings.

594
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:10,340
And take up that personality within yourself,
then only the Diwali is completed.

595
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:14,780
You can’t have Diwali with something that
is short lived, you have to have something

596
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:19,310
that’s burning for ever.

597
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:25,620
So this is the beauty of Sahaja Yoga is that
you become really a great personality.

598
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:31,080
But, it’s not the end of it.

599
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,350
This is only the Lakshmi principle I told
you.

600
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:39,700
But once this Lakshmi principle covers you
up, then the Mahlakshmi principle starts,

601
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:47,510
is that you think of the world as a great
challenge to you, that you have to give them

602
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:52,940
Mahlakshmi principle, that you have to give
them Realization.

603
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,930
You have to raise them up.

604
00:46:54,930 --> 00:47:02,050
And this principle, once starts working in
the Mahalaksmi principle, then all the problems

605
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:04,710
are your own.

606
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:07,780
You have to start working it out.

607
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:17,470
Change he attitude, is the best way I can
say towards all other things that we have

608
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:20,170
to solve the problem, we are here to solve
the problem.

609
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:25,600
Like, I’ve seen, it’s a very commun thing,
somebody comes out with problem, I tell them:

610
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,600
“Do this."

611
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,220
They’ll say: “But, in this this."

612
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,220
“Then do that."

613
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,520
“But in this, that."

614
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,810
Like that they go on all the loops, false
loops, until I’ll say: “Now this is your

615
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,810
problem, not Mine.

616
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:41,600
I’m giving you hundred solutions and none
of them suits you."

617
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,600
But here you should know you are the one who
has to solve the problem.

618
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,190
It is your problem.

619
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:47,312
The world is your problem.

620
00:47:47,312 --> 00:47:49,530
Why were you born at this time?

621
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:54,350
Why did you get your Realization and why are
you Sahaja yogis?

622
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:56,790
Just for name’s sake?

623
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:02,840
So in every field you have to take a responsibility
to see what you can do.

624
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,610
Supposing you are an architect, all right,
have designs made!

625
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:09,440
Create designs, just try.

626
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,970
I’ll help you.

627
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:13,010
You are a musician?

628
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:18,250
Then take up ways and methods of spreading
good music.

629
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:23,540
If you are writer then write something interesting,
not boring, something interesting, something

630
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:26,260
which will elevate people.

631
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:32,680
If you are a government servant, all right,
try to show that you are acting for the government

632
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,100
that is of a much higher level.

633
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:39,300
And such a person will be respected, very
much respected.

634
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,860
Everybody’s personality will grow, not that
you run away from somewhere because most of

635
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:48,400
the people say that: “Mother, we get caught
up, this, that, you know."

636
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,750
It depends on.

637
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:54,710
Now I told you that I have to sometimes shake
hands with six hundred people who are sometimes

638
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:56,160
absolutely drunk.

639
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:02,030
So it’s all right; that’s My job.

640
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:06,341
So we are not going to run away.

641
00:49:06,341 --> 00:49:10,520
We are covered with the protection of the
spirituality.

642
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:19,940
If you can keep to the central path of Sushumna
nobody can touch you.

643
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:28,240
So out of the Lakshmi principle I hope you
get all the tatwas, all the principles, satisfied

644
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:35,170
in you, fully, and also the Mahalakshmi principle
flows through your being.

645
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:40,760
You have to be very satisfied and comfortable
people.

646
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,370
Not to find faults.

647
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:49,370
If you are finding faults, then know that
you are not Sahaja Yogis.

648
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:53,600
If you are trying to control others, then
know that you are not Sahaja Yogis.

649
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:58,510
Even the leaders, I would say, should never
try to control.

650
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:04,130
They must know how the principle is working
in the silence; see for themselves how it

651
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:05,580
is working.

652
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:11,100
It’s a trick you must learn.

653
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,300
Of course, little correction is needed.

654
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,720
That time you correct the person, at that
time, doesn’t matter.

655
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:23,410
But you must know how the whole principle
of benevolence is working itself.

656
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:28,410
The whole Paramachaitanya is doing the benevolence
part; you must know that.

657
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:37,510
As I’ve told you before also, you have to
be like the sea which receives all the rivers

658
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:38,510
into it.

659
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:41,710
If you are on top of the hill you cannot receive
anything.

660
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:50,100
So you have to be like a sea to receive everything
and you have to be at the height.

661
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:57,720
As I told you the other day, the same way,
that very close to the sea there should be

662
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,820
a personality which is above everything else.

663
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:06,030
Such a beautiful personality you should have,
is the depth of the sea and the height of

664
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:07,030
the Kailasha.

665
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,460
May God bless you all.
