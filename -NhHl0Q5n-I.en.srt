1
00:08:22,654 --> 00:08:30,574
Today is a very important day for all of us Sahaja Yogis,

2
00:08:32,194 --> 00:08:37,194
because today Shri Ganesha was born.

3
00:08:37,994 --> 00:08:42,614
Shri Ganesha is whom we worship

4
00:08:43,874 --> 00:08:48,594
and because of whom we got our awakening (jagruti).

5
00:08:52,894 --> 00:09:01,754
However much you may remember Him, until you do not know His special qualities, you cannot attain Him.

6
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:12,874
His special quality is that He is the embodiment
of purity (shuddha swaroop)

7
00:09:16,394 --> 00:09:37,974
and complete Master of the Universe. He is the incarnation of the Supreme, of Brahman.

8
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:52,734
By coming into this world He has created music (sangeet), rhythm (taal) and notes (sur).

9
00:09:53,674 --> 00:10:00,494
By His Grace only people become one with music
(talleen).

10
00:10:01,214 --> 00:10:06,634
A small boy who came into the world and did such great work!

11
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:17,274
He has given so many things to everyone and even today He is active.

12
00:10:18,614 --> 00:10:35,374
Shri Ganesha’s Puja, no matter how much
you do it, it is not enough.

13
00:10:41,114 --> 00:11:00,214
A lot of people say we don’t see Shri Ganesha, even after worshiping Him so much, we do not attain Him.

14
00:11:00,954 --> 00:11:11,034
He is omnipotent, omnipresent and in everything, but you cannot recognize Him until you are Realized.

15
00:11:11,034 --> 00:11:21,174
After your realization you can recognize what Shri Ganesha is. Shri Ganesha is Purity, the Pure Spirit.

16
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:31,814
When He is awakened within us, then we have no questions left.

17
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:39,974
Then we are successful, in whichever task
we undertake.We find joy in everything we do.

18
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:52,274
He is the embodiment of joy and gives joy to everyone.

19
00:11:53,274 --> 00:11:58,274
To serve Him is the ultimate dharma (paramdharma).

20
00:11:59,614 --> 00:12:07,814
To serve Him means to look after small children, to serve them, to make sure there is no cruelty towards them.

21
00:12:08,714 --> 00:12:14,514
This pleases Him very much.

22
00:12:15,414 --> 00:12:26,643
Such an embodiment of love, such a pure-hearted

23
00:12:27,374 --> 00:12:31,374
Shri Ganesha was born today.

24
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:36,754
This is the importance of this day.

25
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:45,934
Today if you ask for any wish, then Shri Ganesha will fulfill it.

26
00:12:49,928 --> 00:12:58,548
It is His right to fulfill all your desires,
because you are all realized.

27
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:06,468
Ask Him with all your heart and He will help you

28
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:13,648
in every way, every moment, every instant.

29
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:17,548
Today is a very big day,

30
00:13:18,888 --> 00:13:24,208
because the actual
pure spirit has taken birth today.

31
00:13:25,564 --> 00:13:41,328
And He already had such an eternal state,
that many people could not comprehend it

32
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:45,408
or write about it.

33
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:51,928
They wrote only what they understood, but now that you are realized you can understand

34
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:58,868
that by the power of Shri Ganesha’s name
you can get your realization.

35
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:06,168
By taking His name alone any disease or any pain will disappear.

36
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:13,588
He is eternal.

37
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:24,348
He is always present within us, when you get your Realization, you can feel Him.

38
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:31,608
And if you are not realized, you cannot understand Him.

39
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:41,028
That is why people get misled and do wrong things.

40
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:57,968
But with Shri Ganesha’s blessings you can
do so many things and neither you will feel greedy, nor will you have any problems.

41
00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:06,288
Because He does all the work for you. He takes care of you.

42
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:11,868
Though He is a little boy, He looks after
you.

43
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:19,008
Shri Ganesha is a very great power by which so much work is getting done.

44
00:15:19,008 --> 00:15:22,468
For Me, He is the purest and My own.

45
00:15:24,228 --> 00:15:37,008
I trouble Him a lot, when somebody tries to trouble Me, I ask Him to handle this fellow and to make him all right.

46
00:15:37,948 --> 00:15:48,808
When this fellow is unmanageable for Me, when
there is a difficult person and it is possible

47
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:56,028
for Me to handle him, then He does the job.

48
00:15:56,048 --> 00:16:05,168
So today’s day is very auspicious as today
He is born.

49
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:13,088
Secondly today is Panchami (the Fifth Day).

50
00:16:13,908 --> 00:16:25,648
This Panchami is recognized because on this day we wear a dress,

51
00:16:25,648 --> 00:16:35,128
whatever we wear today is so that our body is properly covered.

52
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:52,808
The sense of shame and chastity that our body
has is because of Him.

53
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:57,288
Lajja Rupena Samstitha.

54
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:07,388
So if you have any sense of chastity and shame, it is because of Him.

55
00:17:07,388 --> 00:17:12,908
That will benefit you immensely.

56
00:17:14,348 --> 00:17:21,928
You cannot feel joyous until you worship Shri Ganesha.

57
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:28,208
By worshipping Shri Ganesha, your joy increases,

58
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:34,548
you become joyous, because He is the personification.

59
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:44,428
Because of this, both things are today, His
birthday and His help.

60
00:17:44,428 --> 00:17:55,728
We take His help in any work what we do.
Such is our way. In that direction our attention does not go.

61
00:17:56,428 --> 00:18:05,768
But we don't see what we have to do to awaken Him.

62
00:18:07,488 --> 00:18:12,648
We do not feel that we should become like
Him, that we should have a state in which

63
00:18:12,828 --> 00:18:20,368
Shri Ganesha is awakened within us.

64
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:25,488
With which we may never venture on the wrong path.

65
00:18:26,508 --> 00:18:31,888
Those who are rooted in Ganesha are special,

66
00:18:31,888 --> 00:18:40,788
they despise all the wrong things in this
world and they do not do anything wrong

67
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:45,517
because Shri Ganesha stops them.

68
00:18:45,768 --> 00:18:49,568
They cannot enjoy any wrong activities.

69
00:18:49,811 --> 00:18:55,563
This is Shri Ganesha's great blessing that
you have come into such a joyous life.

70
00:18:55,588 --> 00:19:15,288
So today in His service you sing His praise
and glory, so that He may be pleased.

71
00:19:16,328 --> 00:19:19,368
My Eternal Blessings to all of you.

72
00:19:30,428 --> 00:19:33,858


73
00:19:33,858 --> 00:19:41,888


74
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:51,538
