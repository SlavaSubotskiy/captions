1
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:30,750
Today is a very important day for all of us Sahaja Yogis,

2
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:37,375
because today Shri Ganesha was born.

3
01:08:38,166 --> 01:08:42,791
Shri Ganesha is whom we worship

4
01:08:44,041 --> 01:08:48,791
and because of whom we got our awakening (jagruti).

5
01:08:53,083 --> 01:09:01,958
However much you may remember Him, until you do not know His
 special qualities, you cannot attain Him.

6
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:13,041
His special quality is that He is the embodiment
of purity (shuddha swaroop)

7
01:09:16,583 --> 01:09:38,166
and complete Master of the Universe. He is the incarnation 
of the Supreme, of Brahman.

8
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:52,916
By coming into this world He has created music (sangeet), 
rhythm (taal) and notes (sur).

9
01:09:53,875 --> 01:10:00,666
By His Grace only people become one with music
(talleen).

10
01:10:01,416 --> 01:10:06,833
A small boy who came into the world and did such great work!

11
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:17,458
He has given so many things to everyone and even today He is
 active.

12
01:10:18,791 --> 01:10:35,541
Shri Ganesha’s Puja, no matter how much
you do it, it is not enough.

13
01:10:41,291 --> 01:11:00,416
A lot of people say we don’t see Shri Ganesha, even after 
worshiping Him so much, we do not attain Him.

14
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:11,208
He is omnipotent, omnipresent and in everything, but you 
cannot recognize Him until you are Realized.

15
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:21,375
After your realization you can recognize what Shri Ganesha 
is. Shri Ganesha is Purity, the Pure Spirit.

16
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:32,000
When He is awakened within us, then we have no questions 
left.

17
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:40,166
Then we are successful, in whichever task
we undertake.We find joy in everything we do.

18
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:52,458
He is the embodiment of joy and gives joy to everyone.

19
01:11:53,458 --> 01:11:58,458
To serve Him is the ultimate dharma (paramdharma).

20
01:11:59,791 --> 01:12:08,000
To serve Him means to look after small children, to serve 
them, to make sure there is no cruelty towards them.

21
01:12:08,916 --> 01:12:14,708
This pleases Him very much.

22
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:25,625
Such an embodiment of love, such a pure-hearted

23
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:31,541
Shri Ganesha was born today.

24
01:12:32,166 --> 01:12:36,958
This is the importance of this day.

25
01:12:37,541 --> 01:12:46,125
Today if you ask for any wish, then Shri Ganesha will 
fulfill it.

26
01:12:49,208 --> 01:12:57,833
It is His right to fulfill all your desires,
because you are all realized.

27
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:05,750
Ask Him with all your heart and He will help you

28
01:13:06,958 --> 01:13:12,958
in every way, every moment, every instant.

29
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:16,833
Today is a very big day,

30
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:23,500
because the actual
pure spirit has taken birth today.

31
01:13:29,208 --> 01:13:40,625
And He already had such an eternal state,
that many people could not comprehend it

32
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:44,708
or write about it.

33
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:51,208
They wrote only what they understood, but now that you are 
realized you can understand

34
01:13:51,958 --> 01:13:58,166
that by the power of Shri Ganesha’s name
you can get your realization.

35
01:13:59,083 --> 01:14:05,458
By taking His name alone any disease or any pain will 
disappear.

36
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:12,875
He is eternal.

37
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:23,625
He is always present within us, when you get your 
Realization, you can feel Him.

38
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:30,916
And if you are not realized, you cannot understand Him.

39
01:14:30,916 --> 01:14:40,333
That is why people get misled and do wrong things.

40
01:14:43,416 --> 01:14:57,250
But with Shri Ganesha’s blessings you can
do so many things and neither you will feel greedy, nor will
 you have any problems.

41
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:05,583
Because He does all the work for you. He takes care of you.

42
01:15:06,291 --> 01:15:11,166
Though He is a little boy, He looks after
you.

43
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:18,291
Shri Ganesha is a very great power by which so much work is 
getting done.

44
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:21,750
For Me, He is the purest and My own.

45
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:36,291
I trouble Him a lot, when somebody tries to trouble Me, I 
ask Him to handle this fellow and to make him all right.

46
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:48,083
When this fellow is unmanageable for Me, when
there is a difficult person and it is possible

47
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:55,333
for Me to handle him, then He does the job.

48
01:15:55,333 --> 01:16:04,458
So today’s day is very auspicious as today
He is born.

49
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:12,375
Secondly today is Panchami (the Fifth Day).

50
01:16:13,208 --> 01:16:24,958
This Panchami is recognized because on this day we wear a 
dress,

51
01:16:24,958 --> 01:16:34,416
whatever we wear today is so that our body is properly 
covered.

52
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:52,083
The sense of shame and chastity that our body
has is because of Him.

53
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:56,583
Lajja Rupena Samstitha.

54
01:16:57,875 --> 01:17:06,666
So if you have any sense of chastity and shame, it is 
because of Him.

55
01:17:06,666 --> 01:17:12,208
That will benefit you immensely.

56
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:21,208
You cannot feel joyous until you worship Shri Ganesha.

57
01:17:22,416 --> 01:17:27,500
By worshipping Shri Ganesha, your joy increases,

58
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:33,833
you become joyous, because He is the personification.

59
01:17:35,625 --> 01:17:43,708
Because of this, both things are today, His
birthday and His help.

60
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:55,000
We take His help in any work what we do.
Such is our way. In that direction our attention does not 
go.

61
01:17:55,708 --> 01:18:05,041
But we don't see what we have to do to awaken Him.

62
01:18:06,791 --> 01:18:11,958
We do not feel that we should become like
Him, that we should have a state in which

63
01:18:12,125 --> 01:18:19,666
Shri Ganesha is awakened within us.

64
01:18:21,166 --> 01:18:24,791
With which we may never venture on the wrong path.

65
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:31,166
Those who are rooted in Ganesha are special,

66
01:18:31,166 --> 01:18:40,083
they despise all the wrong things in this
world and they do not do anything wrong

67
01:18:40,958 --> 01:18:43,958
because Shri Ganesha stops them.

68
01:18:45,041 --> 01:18:48,875
They cannot enjoy any wrong activities.

69
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:53,625
This is Shri Ganesha's great blessing that
you have come into such a joyous life.

70
01:18:54,875 --> 01:19:14,583
So today in His service you sing His praise
and glory, so that He may be pleased.
