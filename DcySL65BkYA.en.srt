1
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:15,100
Warren’s words have really moved my heart,
and if England is my heart, England should

2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:30,270
also feel moved: that’s the spirit of Shri
Ganesh.

3
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:43,170
And I must say that I have seen so many things
in Warren, which are very heartening.

4
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:58,130
Whenever I have felt desperate about things,
you see, seeing him I felt I must do something

5
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:15,369
more, because he really loves me very much,
I have seen that, with complete selfless dedication.

6
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:30,140
But dedication is a word which doesn’t have
that beauty of love.

7
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:39,920
I mean if I’m sitting down he’ll immediately
worry if I have got the tea, or if I need

8
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,719
some heating, or little things here and there,
and I watch — I’m surprised.

9
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:55,399
Like any other Sahaj Yogi he’ll be jumping
up here and there and finding out things to

10
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:57,560
adjust.

11
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:09,649
And even if I really once say that, “Maybe,”
he just doesn’t do it, just doesn’t do

12
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:10,649
it.

13
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:11,860
He said, “That’s it, settled!”

14
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,970
I have never seen him asking me to give him
time to meet him, never.

15
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:23,569
Not even once he said, “Mother I must come
and see you!” nothing, never!

16
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:33,650
I have not known how much money he spent all
throughout his trip.

17
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,290
I don’t know, really.

18
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:42,340
And I was wanting somebody to say that, “Mother
we must pay for his travel!” because he’s

19
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,590
really spent all his money.

20
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,150
And I was happy that David brought this point
to me, I was very happy.

21
00:02:52,150 --> 00:03:07,569
One thing I feel [is] that you cannot ask
for love, that’s something you cannot do.

22
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:17,000
It’s a very difficult thing to ask somebody
to love, but that, I think, is the point one

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,159
should see.

24
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:29,099
When you think of Shri Ganesh, you just have
to know that He loves the Mother so much that

25
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:36,152
even a slightest hint, He knows what I want,
He knows.

26
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:40,890
He knows me too well.

27
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:54,980
He’s not at all so compassionate as myself,
because He cannot forgive those who try to

28
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,640
insult me, He cannot.

29
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,000
Those who try to cheat me, those who try to
be arrogant or egoistical.

30
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,439
He doesn’t, he doesn’t believe in that,
He cannot.

31
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,439
He wants to punish.

32
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,090
He’s ready to punish, very anxious to punish
such people.

33
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,590
But if I say, “No.

34
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,750
Spare him,” He listens to me.

35
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:28,330
That’s His quality: He cannot bear anything
against me, cannot bear!

36
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:36,030
And left to Him, I think I don’t know how
many Sahaj Yogis would have been there.

37
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,940
Even to say, “No Mother!” itself, He cuts
you out on that point.

38
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:49,660
But I don’t want that it should happen,
because He doesn’t know that you are still

39
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:56,720
needing help, and attention, and tremendous
compassion.

40
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,170
But you can only know your Mother through
shraddha, through faith.

41
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:07,120
And what he says is true.

42
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,820
And why this faith?

43
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:15,730
I mean you see miracles every day, not only
today: such games, such play, such things

44
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:22,260
going on; how I have been able to express
myself slowly.

45
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,340
I don’t want to give you any shocks.

46
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:39,560
So in a very beautiful manner I have tried
to bring forth the play of the Divine.

47
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:47,590
But I feel that, even now, people get into
arguments: if I say, “No, this won’t work

48
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,590
out.

49
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:53,520
That’s not good,” I have to spend at least
four, five hours going round and round and

50
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,110
bringing the point to the heads of people
that, “No, that’s not good, that won’t

51
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,460
help you."

52
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,520
But once I asked him, “How is it you are
so obedient?”

53
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,030
I mean, whatever I say he, just he gets a
hint, he’ll agree.

54
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:12,070
He said, “Mother I once learned a lesson:
that’s my own marriage.

55
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:17,660
And you didn’t say no, but you did say to
me that, ‘If it makes you happy.’

56
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,360
you didn’t say, ‘It will make you joyous,’
and I have learned a lesson from that."

57
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,800
But we don’t learn our lessons is [what]
the point is.

58
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:34,080
We don’t learn our lessons.

59
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,800
We argue: that comes from ego.

60
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,970
If we have superego we, we make others mad!

61
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:52,120
Like somebody came from America and he was
just mad that he must come and see me.

62
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,200
And I’m so busy, I have no time, you know
that.

63
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,470
I have to correct this book, I have to correct
that book.

64
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,980
Now we have to do this Advent, and that is
to be done.

65
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,460
I have to look after my household, and this
and that.

66
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,110
I am so busy.

67
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,270
But the person really made them mad, that
he must see me!

68
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,080
Now if you come from America, that doesn’t
mean that you must see me, because you never

69
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,270
took time with me.

70
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,370
I am busy here now.

71
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:24,690
When I went to America, it’s all right,
which is true.

72
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:31,410
And we do not realise that what we are doing
[is] that we don’t love Mother, we don’t

73
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,410
love Her.

74
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:38,170
We think of our needs, our impressions, our
talking, it’s a fact.

75
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:43,190
Like somebody I asked, “All right you speak,
you are a good speaker."

76
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,290
All right, the person starts speaking, and
he becomes egoistical.

77
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:52,700
How can you be?

78
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,460
If you just start giving a good speech, you
become egoistical.

79
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,320
Somebody made good photographs, so I said,
“These are good photographs."

80
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,320
He becomes egoistical!

81
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,830
You cannot praise anyone in this country — it’s
the worst thing [for them].

82
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,840
He says, “Agnya is clear."

83
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,520
I don’t know what sort of an Agnya is clear
here! you cannot praise.

84
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,700
I mean I try to be nice.

85
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,870
I say, “Oh your photographs are very nice."

86
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,130
Immediately the person becomes egoistical.

87
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:19,140
You give some work to someone, “All right
you do this work, postering."

88
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,050
Somebody is doing that: his ego goes up!

89
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,050
What is this?

90
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,900
Like a balloon?

91
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,850
There’s no depth.

92
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,790
There’s no gravity.

93
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,090
Now why?

94
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,090
This is the question.

95
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,210
He asked me many a times, “Why it happens
Mother?”

96
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:40,519
The reason is — I told them the other day,
I think they have a tape on this; you can

97
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:46,560
go through that — a simple thing is that,
that we have lived a superficial life here.

98
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,019
We are superficial people.

99
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:57,580
Because the society is such, this machine
has made us like this, and we have read books.

100
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,779
We have pampered egos.

101
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:02,990
Our forefathers went and fought in other countries
thinking no end of themselves.

102
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,339
Then we had this war.

103
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:11,040
With the war we became also nonsensical, either
aggressive, or we have become with superego.

104
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,290
We have bhoots.

105
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,399
We have conditionings.

106
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,639
All these things are there.

107
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:19,449
We are not our genuine self, is the point.

108
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:28,470
So I think the being that is going to be enlightened
by your Spirit is covered with ego, and on

109
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,220
top of that is a sheen of that superficial
being that you are.

110
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,360
So Mother says [something] — “All right!”

111
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,399
Mother did this — ”All right!”

112
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,770
Nothing goes inside I feel.

113
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,029
There’s no love.

114
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:49,870
If you are in love with someone, even if the
person is in that vicinity anywhere…you

115
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,639
know Mother is in London, just think, “Mother
is in London."

116
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,639
Just think!

117
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,680
If you love me, just think.

118
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:03,330
What a happy thought it is: “She’s in
England!”

119
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:10,490
It’s a happy thought.

120
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,490
Think on those lines.

121
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:17,529
But it does not work out because that genuine
thing, the genuine thing that is inside, is

122
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:20,110
covered with ego or superego.

123
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,910
your bhoots are in between.

124
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:28,589
So what happens [is] that you live with that
superficial nonsense.

125
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:29,589
Nothing goes inside.

126
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:34,740
It’s all [at] that level.

127
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,630
You ask anyone, they’ll say, “I’m all
right.

128
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,560
I’m like this."

129
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
Why?

130
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,639
Nothing goes inside, why?

131
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,990
Because, the genuine self is lost.

132
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,410
What is going to enlighten you is not your
artificial thing.

133
00:10:53,410 --> 00:11:03,040
You know artificial fibre, if you have artificial
fibre, it doesn’t penetrate anything.

134
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,100
It can penetrate into everything, but nothing
can penetrate into it.

135
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:15,220
Like that, that artificial thing on us, and
we live with it, all the time.

136
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,449
Now why he said about Maharashtra [is] because
Maharashtrians are not exposed to artificiality,

137
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:21,880
they don’t know what is artificiality.

138
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,660
People think they are stupid, they are foolish,
they are no good for business, they are not

139
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,189
good for this, they are not good for that.

140
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:35,589
But the main thing is that their genuine being
is not covered with any nonsenses: “I am

141
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:37,730
something!”

142
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,160
I have never seen Warren feeling that way,
and that’s something surprising.

143
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,899
I have never seen him feeling that he’s
important, that he should be near me, he should

144
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,210
be in my company — never!

145
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:56,029
Never even I have heard him anywhere around.

146
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:59,709
I have to call for him.

147
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:05,309
Unless and until I call him, he’ll never
come before me.

148
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:11,449
He wants to see if I need him, otherwise he’s
not bothered.

149
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:16,820
He just feels that I’m around, “Mother
is somewhere."

150
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,350
Unless and until [I call him].

151
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,930
But if I tell him, “Warren I want…”
wherever he may be, he’ll just rush and

152
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,930
come.

153
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:25,930
It’s a very good example for you.

154
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,839
I am happy there are some examples of this
kind.

155
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:35,110
There are many others; I am not saying it’s
only Warren.

156
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:41,300
And then, if you take up any responsibility
in Sahaj Yoga, then you start thinking you

157
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,579
are great, you are a great Sahaj Yogi: you
have done this, you have put the postering,

158
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:47,149
you have done this.

159
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:54,579
This shows the calibre, shows the calibre.

160
00:12:54,579 --> 00:13:02,740
People from absolutely dead conditions have
risen so high, and while people from quite

161
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,490
normal conditions are nowhere there, just
they are just there, why?

162
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,490
The Calibre.

163
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,610
Now everybody has that calibre.

164
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,189
What I am trying to say: every one of us have
the calibre.

165
00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:25,600
But it is not evident in everyone because
the amount of covering they have.

166
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,040
Everybody has capacity to love, everyone has
capacity.

167
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,540
But if you have covered yourself completely
with artificiality you cannot love.

168
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,860
Now if you ask me, “Mother, how to love?”

169
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,610
what am I to tell you?

170
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,769
I love you, no doubt.

171
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:47,230
I love all of you.

172
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,290
I love you very much.

173
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,130
I am bothered about you.

174
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:58,240
But what I find then, when I am bothered about
somebody, that person starts taking advantage.

175
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:06,540
I don’t mind [if you] take advantage, but
by taking advantage that person goes down

176
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,730
completely.

177
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:15,300
If I am bothered about something, then [that]
one immediately starts thinking they are very

178
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:21,990
important, that, “Mother is so much bothered
about me!”

179
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:32,829
Now try to understand that this is a country
which is my heart, is my heart itself.

180
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:39,069
And Sahastrara is nothing else but it’s
heart.

181
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:45,980
Have you noticed how it is nicely managed
already that, if Kundalini has to break, it

182
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,009
has to break through the heart chakra?

183
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:55,709
If your heart is not all right, it cannot
break, your Kundalini at Sahastrara.

184
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:57,899
Have you seen that?

185
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:10,319
That the Brahmarandhra, the last opening,
is on the heart chakra.

186
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:12,630
I know everyone very well.

187
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,110
There are people who are mediums with us.

188
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,940
I know that.

189
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,269
But they don’t know they’ll go to Hell.

190
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:26,410
It’s a very dangerous time you are in — be
careful!

191
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:36,600
And that makes me feel even worse when I think
that they don’t know on what horrible times

192
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:43,300
your feet are dangling.

193
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,180
So don’t play games!

194
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:55,079
I know English language has its own styles
and things, English mannerism has its own

195
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,850
ways, methods.

196
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:02,630
Forget that you are English!|

197
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:09,639
That’s the best way.

198
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:15,009
English think that, “We are different people.

199
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:20,490
We are of the heart you see — great people!”

200
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,189
In Italy I told one journalist lady who had
come, very good lady.

201
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:28,369
She said, “Mother one thing I didn’t like
the sentence you said that, ‘England is

202
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:29,399
the heart.’

203
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,100
Agh, how can it be?

204
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Horrible?”

205
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,790
She couldn’t believe it.

206
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,589
She said, “Only because you said I tolerate
it, but anybody else saying it I would not

207
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:42,790
tolerate!”

208
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:56,149
So how far we have gone down as English, you
must see the reputation of English abroad.

209
00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:01,480
And advancement we have made is to reach the
status of punk rocks!

210
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:14,490
So when there is such a situation in a country,
how serious we have to be about it.

211
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,850
Because this country is going to save the
world or is going to mar the world, because

212
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,780
it is at the Sahastrara.

213
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,400
Where Mother is to be accepted.

214
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:31,500
Whether Mother is to be settled and worshipped
and adored.

215
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:41,010
But do we have that seriousness of understanding
that we are born at a time when the responsibility

216
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,650
is much more on us?

217
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,620
We don’t realise that we are born in the
heart, means our responsibility is much, much

218
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:52,240
more than other people have.

219
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:59,610
On the contrary, “We are born on the heart,
so we are great people!” — finished!

220
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:08,610
There are certain things which you follow,
simple things, is going to help you.

221
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:15,070
The other day I met somebody who had a nonsensical
thing like a Hamsa [catch].

222
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,130
I said, “Hamsa, how can you have?

223
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,510
Are you putting oil everyday?

224
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,020
Are you putting ghee everyday?”

225
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,050
He said, “No!”

226
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:25,160
I said, “Why?

227
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:31,230
Is a simple thing like that, why don’t you
do everyday?”

228
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,580
“Mother is here.

229
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,610
She’ll look after us."

230
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:43,250
The responsibility is not felt because there’s
no seriousness about it! you don’t know!

231
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:52,030
The job is great, you can do it, you have
the calibre.

232
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,150
face yourself up, every one of you.

233
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,740
It’s not facing others.

234
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,070
face yourself up!

235
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:10,460
And I find, really I must say Italians, really
I must say what Warren says, is true, it’s

236
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,110
true.

237
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:19,640
We have Antonio with us in the house, I see:
He’s very different from all other English

238
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,790
people.

239
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,240
He’s very different.

240
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,580
He’s so balanced, he’s so much there.

241
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,950
Then, then there are some people, funny people,
I have seen, they have been with us, so far,

242
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,550
so: They will go and do this course, they
will go to this, that.

243
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,860
It’s nonsense going on all the time!

244
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,870
And one person like that can spoil all of
them.

245
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,880
We have so many stupid people on the periphery
in Sahaj Yoga in England.

246
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,500
We do not have so many numbers anywhere else
on the periphery.

247
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:57,170
We have tremendous people, as well as some
people who are really horrid.

248
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:04,930
I was trying to make a black list everywhere,
and we had the maximum number in England!

249
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:11,090
Maximum number in England.

250
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:16,400
Now when I am going and leaving you here,
you see my heart wrenches really sometimes,

251
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,410
because I know you are not yet matured enough.

252
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,880
But why not mature?

253
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:28,920
Because there’s no seriousness about it.

254
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,840
Then they will come, “We need a leader,
somebody."

255
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
Why?

256
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,740
Why do you want somebody to hit you on your
head all the time, to tell you things like

257
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,740
that?

258
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,620
With your own dignity, why not come up?

259
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:47,840
Now I am going, you all have to work it out.

260
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:53,970
So when you go to India, even Indians say
that English are the worst.

261
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,900
There’s the certificate.

262
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:01,770
And you have to be the best people, better
than even Australians!

263
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:06,810
They’re so simple.

264
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,650
Because now we are at Sahastrara, working
at Sahastrara.

265
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,890
Do you see?

266
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,890
Why I have to say all these things?

267
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:23,530
Because you are born, you are born in this
country.

268
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:27,110
You are the people.

269
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,430
But whatever I say is, “Mother speaks very
well.

270
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,220
Let’s have a tape.

271
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,190
All right, very nice to hear!

272
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,790
It’s a great entertainment you know, Mother
is talking!

273
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,250
She talks very well."

274
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,180
[But] it doesn’t go inside, anything!

275
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,180
It doesn’t go.

276
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:53,170
It’s like a plastic on top, complete plastic
cover.

277
00:21:53,170 --> 00:22:01,810
So one has to learn certain things, a few
things, like Vishuddhi Chakra: now English

278
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,880
don’t talk, but they move their heads too
much.

279
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:12,010
If they say yes, they’ll go on saying yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

280
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,590
All the time their necks are moving.

281
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:19,170
I mean they have long necks, and they must
go on moving their necks all the time.

282
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,940
There’s no need.

283
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:27,600
Why to bend your neck so much?

284
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,590
Even if they say something, “Yes, yes, yes,
yes."

285
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:37,660
Like they’ll say, “Today’s programme
went very well."

286
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,700
“Yes, yes, yes!”

287
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,640
Themselves certifying it.

288
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:49,920
But they don’t see, because they don’t
want to see it, that’s Vishuddhi Chakra.

289
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,400
You don’t talk, because when you talk, horrible
things come out, so you’re so afraid of

290
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,160
talking that you just don’t talk.

291
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,860
But talk to yourself on the mirror, talk to
yourself.

292
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:06,350
See how you can respect, how you can be kind,
how you could be nice.

293
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:17,700
But no, the practice is more of sarcasm, more
of saying harsh things, horrible things, and

294
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,920
that’s it.

295
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,850
It should have, I know is a flair, it should
have a beautiful thing.

296
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:28,500
It should not be serious sermon, no.

297
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,270
But say something sweet and nice.

298
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:40,800
It’s so evident when I say something sweet.

299
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:53,270
Like the other day, we were in France, and
I asked Guido, “You’d better speak in

300
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,510
Italian and somebody should translate you."

301
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:03,070
On the way I was just thinking, “Who will
translate Guido, because somebody who knows

302
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:08,950
French and Italian well, who will do that?”

303
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:14,200
And when I entered the hall I saw Ruth you
see, standing there with her.

304
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,461
I had not seen her.

305
00:24:15,461 --> 00:24:17,560
I didn’t know she was there.

306
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,750
She had come all the way.

307
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:24,450
And all the way she’s run from there, and
now she’s holding in her hand this mic,

308
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,310
and she is holding fort.

309
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:32,360
You know, my heart became so large, and I
really felt like embracing her.

310
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,660
And the eyes you see, spoke what I felt.

311
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,770
The way she came round you see, she was there.

312
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,980
I was worried who will translate and there
she was.

313
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:52,650
you see I also get help like this, when people
love me I know I get help.

314
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:57,750
But if they don’t love me there are obstructions,
problems, this, that.

315
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:03,920
You get so fed up you don’t want to see
them, sometimes it happens.

316
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,600
But if there is love, you know the whole communication
works through love, this subtle love.

317
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:14,700
The whole ether has got this subtler love,
every matter has got this subtler love, everything

318
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,700
has.

319
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,710
And the whole thing goes into waves and you
just get the message.

320
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:25,370
But if you are not on that reception point
or if you are not there nothing works: neither

321
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,690
you nor me.

322
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,990
It’s a mutual thing.

323
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,050
I help you, but you help me too.

324
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,570
What’s me is you.

325
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,040
But you are not at that level because you
are on superficiality.

326
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,630
And because of this superficiality, also,
you are not collective.

327
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:47,990
But the sense of collectivity is very, very
tricky also, one must understand.

328
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:55,860
Some people start forming groups and they
think they have been collective.

329
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:03,350
Forming a group is a sign of most uncollective
behaviour.

330
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:08,780
But they think, “We have been very collective,
we have been very nice, you see!”

331
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,200
Very happy people!

332
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:18,260
So what I have to tell you is that you [should]
understand your responsibility.

333
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:24,630
you are in the head office, in the head office.

334
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:34,480
And the people who are not in the head office
are doing much, much better than you.

335
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:44,670
Then the whole office has to collapse

336
00:26:44,670 --> 00:27:11,940
(break in recording)

337
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:24,200
It 

338
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:34,660
gives you a feeling of joy, but there is awe.

339
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:42,290
You love that awe, enjoy that awe.

340
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,290
Mother is around.

341
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,810
What are we doing?

342
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,790
Where are we?

343
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:56,110
And that’s the first sign, that’s the
first sign, that you are realising who is

344
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:05,660
your Mother — first sign is.

345
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:15,420
It is very easy just to jump into it, just
like your Kundalini awakening, I can tell

346
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,790
you.

347
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,600
And Americans you know are speedy people.

348
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:26,560
I knew if they start, they have to just start
that’s the point.

349
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,880
I know that.

350
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,960
Americans have to just start, and they’ll
shoot off, and they shoot off very fast.

351
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,260
They have speed.

352
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:43,360
If they take the speed you must know then,
what they are capable of.

353
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:49,960
There’s another one that’s coming up very
well, which I must tell you, is Munich.

354
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,210
I didn’t want to go there.

355
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:56,550
There was a Polish, stupid, woman, she told
me all wrong about Munich people.

356
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:00,940
So I thought, “If this is the sample, I’d
better not go."

357
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:05,460
Then I felt the vibrations: and tremendous
vibrations!

358
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:12,450
And the seriousness with which they were hearing
me, the intensity, as if there was a mathematical

359
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:17,900
class or some sort of a science class I was
talking about, with complete attention, not

360
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,970
even blinking.

361
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:29,260
Absolute absorption of every word I was saying.

362
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:32,770
I was amazed at these people.

363
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:39,080
And once the Germans get to Sahaj Yoga, God
save you all!

364
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:44,660
I can assure you, you cannot come up to their
levels, because they have built up themselves

365
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,660
like that.

366
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,040
They are built up people.

367
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,740
They are people of discipline.

368
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:56,400
And when they will come to Sahaj Yoga you
will see what will happen.

369
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:02,770
So all this lovey-dovey business, and this
kind of a what you call this, I don’t know

370
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,070
in English word what you call.

371
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,070
Sahaj Yogi: Wishy-washy.

372
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,070
Shri Mataji: Wishy-washy is different.

373
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:13,040
What I am saying is a person who is neither
here nor there: all the time bending like

374
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
this.

375
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,430
Lecha-pecha as we call in Hindi language.

376
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:20,040
And also telling me, “I am like this!”

377
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,500
All this nonsense!

378
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,520
How many will be left out?

379
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,720
I don’t know.

380
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:35,620
So, if I say anything, just know that I know
what it is.

381
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:39,820
I know what is going to happen.

382
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:43,380
But you won’t learn your lessons, I know.

383
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,789
If I told somebody, “Don’t.

384
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:52,030
Go back!” or, “Stay back!” that person
learns ultimately that, “This was the thing,

385
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,030
correct.

386
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,030
Mother said it."

387
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,030
But how many times?

388
00:30:55,030 --> 00:31:02,570
Is the point now.

389
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,620
So now, I am going away.

390
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:12,120
I want to tell you that we all have to be
serious people.

391
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,730
Whatever mistakes you have committed, forget
it.

392
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:18,960
Be serious people!

393
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,570
Those who are egoistical, trying to form groups,
are mediums, they talk like stupid people,

394
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:30,450
trying to organise programmes in a stupid
way, giving big lectures, should come down

395
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,000
to normal now!

396
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,990
Nothing doing!

397
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:37,670
Be serious!

398
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:40,530
We have to be alert.

399
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:49,660
Those who will sleep now will lose completely.

400
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,510
I must warn you.

401
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,620
It’s important.

402
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,290
Time is short.

403
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:58,910
You are important people, no doubt about it.

404
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:05,410
But if you are no good, you will be losing
your position completely.

405
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:17,750
[On] the day when I am thinking of going to
India, for a Mother, she’s more worried

406
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:21,180
about people who are still not there.

407
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,700
She is always worried.

408
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:29,990
Like a boat is going, has got many people
in the boat quite settled down, even from

409
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:37,360
England, but there are many still half way
in the water, coming up, going down.

410
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,370
You are not worried about the people who are
on the boat, but you are worried about the

411
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:43,580
people who are still halfway.

412
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:50,500
And that worry is on my head.

413
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,750
I am serious.

414
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,080
The climate is serious.

415
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,740
The weather is serious.

416
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:02,600
How it rained and rained and rained today.

417
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,470
The whole nature is bothered.

418
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:16,150
Don’t think that only if you are educated,
uneducated, you come from this sort of a life

419
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,110
or that — that’s nothing important.

420
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:22,020
Spirit is above all these things.

421
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:30,280
But to make the Spirit shine, to work on your
nerves, that sheen has to go away, otherwise

422
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:35,810
it will never work.

423
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:41,120
Whatever you do, it should please me, is one
of the ways.

424
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,340
It should please me.

425
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:51,470
That’s one of the signs.

426
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,730
So how do we do it?

427
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,690
Put me in your heart!

428
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:58,390
Just try to put me in your heart, it’s very
simple.

429
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,110
I am before you now.

430
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:06,100
I am in person.

431
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:12,109
I was trying to give Realisation to one of
my relations just today.

432
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:14,060
And I said that, “You don’t close your
eyes."

433
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:20,290
He said, “No, I’m not looking at your
face because when I see you, I feel you are

434
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,309
my aunt.

435
00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:27,940
But I am just looking at your feet so that
I shouldn’t feel anymore that you are my

436
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,940
aunt.

437
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,559
You are very great.

438
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:35,879
And your face is the one that puts me into
illusions."

439
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,169
He could see it’s a Mahamaya.

440
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:40,500
He said, “Only at your feet I look.

441
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,829
And through your feet only I can get over
this barrier, this feeling."

442
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:57,570
In the same way when I am a Mahamaya, I know
I am, I had to be, but you have to put my

443
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:14,390
feet into your heart, just my feet into your
heart.

444
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:22,740
Because photo, face, everything might be an
illusion.

445
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:35,289
Might be by seeing my face you do not get
over your barriers.

446
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:37,170
To say, “I must see Mother."

447
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,450
“I must do this."

448
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,510
“Mother must come to my house."

449
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,529
“She must have food at my place."

450
00:35:43,529 --> 00:35:45,329
“She must visit my home."

451
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:56,079
All this is so stupid, I cannot understand
what’s the matter with these people!

452
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,930
Mother, please come in my heart.

453
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:02,530
Let me clean my heart so that you are there.

454
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:05,260
Put your feet into my heart.

455
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:12,130
Let your feet be worshipped in my heart.

456
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:17,210
Let me not be in delusion.

457
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:20,880
Take me away from illusions.

458
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,520
Keep me in reality.

459
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,539
Take away the sheen of superficiality.

460
00:36:28,539 --> 00:36:31,920
Let me enjoy your feet in my heart.

461
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:38,180
Let me see your feet in my heart.

462
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,329
Only such people.

463
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:44,450
Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha have done that.

464
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:51,049
So don’t you think you have to do it?

465
00:36:51,049 --> 00:36:54,339
So humble down yourself!

466
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:57,630
Humble down yourself in your heart.

467
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,460
Humble down in your heart.

468
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,019
Enjoy your humility.

469
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,740
Enjoy your virtues.

470
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,980
The greatest virtue of a Sahaj Yogi is humility.

471
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:15,829
Now, so many things you have seen to convince
you.

472
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:24,650
But in no way it can mean any kind of subjection,
because what subjection you can give me?

473
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,029
Think of that.

474
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:35,940
When every subjection is a blessing, what
subjection you are giving?

475
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:41,970
Every feeling in the heart is a blessing.

476
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:51,119
Just now you feel it and you feel the joy,
in your heart.

477
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,690
Then what is your subjection?

478
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,910
About what?

479
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:59,680
I can understand people who are just newly
come, who are good for nothing.

480
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,240
But you are not on the periphery.

481
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,010
But some of them do go into periphery in no
time.

482
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,499
You give them some work — finished!

483
00:38:08,499 --> 00:38:10,539
If I am sweet to someone — finished!

484
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,109
If I see someone — finished!

485
00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:13,599
I mean, this is too much.

486
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:25,380
I can’t even be nice to you.

487
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:31,790
If you do any mistakes or anything, then you
get your left Vishuddhi.

488
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:35,430
You’ve done your mistake, all right, finish
it.

489
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,690
You love me.

490
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:41,160
Maybe there’s something wrong in the love
or maybe something has happened, doesn’t

491
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,160
matter.

492
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,499
“Now, I’m going to be cautious.

493
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:46,839
I’m not going to make any mistakes.

494
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:48,869
How could I do this mistake?

495
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:51,499
Because I was not fully in love.

496
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:54,800
If I had loved something, I would have not
done such a mistake!”

497
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,350
All right, so develop your love.

498
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,350
No.

499
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:04,910
your will do, “I feel guilty because I have
done such a thing."

500
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,720
So you miss this and that both.

501
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,390
So your mistake becomes a barrier again.

502
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,710
Don’t feel guilty about it.

503
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,240
We have to progress further.

504
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,430
Forget the past.

505
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,430
Forget the past.

506
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,430
Forget the past.

507
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,430
We have to go further.

508
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,300
We have to be serious people.

509
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:27,270
When we talk, we should talk with that dignity
of that awe.

510
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:38,609
That’s very important and once you develop
that awe your Ekadasha will disappear.

511
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,670
Ekadasha will disappear.

512
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:48,440
Just think of the awe.

513
00:39:48,440 --> 00:40:06,490
See the silence and the joy, and the joy of
the awe is deep, very deep, like a sea.

514
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:14,369
The sea on superficial level is very turbulent,
but inside is silent, absolutely silent.

515
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:16,430
Feel that depth.

516
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:25,259
Without awe, you cannot go down.

517
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:32,989
I have sometimes even said little loudly some
things to Warren, I know, but it’s never,

518
00:40:32,989 --> 00:40:34,779
never felt with him.

519
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:42,150
But with some people I have never said because
I know the person won’t take it from me.

520
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:55,859
But he never feels that I have said anything
wrong or to hurt him in any way, that’s

521
00:40:55,859 --> 00:41:06,019
the sign of complete awe.

522
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:14,650
And it’s just a wee bit of penetration,
a very little bit of penetration [that’s

523
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,900
needed].

524
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,099
Forget the self-importance.

525
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:20,810
Forget the greatness that you think about
yourself.

526
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:28,349
When you become the zero then you become nirmala.

527
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:35,989
As long as you are like a cup, you are small.

528
00:41:35,989 --> 00:41:43,960
When the boundaries of the cups are broken,
there’s no more a cup.

529
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,730
And this is what today I have to tell you.

530
00:41:47,730 --> 00:42:00,170
Today is the eleventh day and ten days, out
of which nine days were the periods of fights.

531
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:05,049
Tenth day is the period of victory.

532
00:42:05,049 --> 00:42:10,749
Now eleventh day is of enjoyment.

533
00:42:10,749 --> 00:42:14,809
But how can the people who do not have the
awe, enjoy?

534
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:21,309
I cannot understand.

535
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:28,200
Because Ekadasha forms the barrier.

536
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,480
And the barrier of Ekadasha, you know what
it is.

537
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:42,490
Feel the awe and you’ll go deep into your
heart, deep into your heart.

538
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:49,920
Because you are at a point where just you
have to have the gravity to go down.

539
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:58,650
[It’s] working out: try to keep that.

540
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:06,420
Slowly and slowly you all have come up to
a point only thing is now develop your depth.

541
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,529
Go deep down.

542
00:43:08,529 --> 00:43:13,650
I know there are frivolous people but they’ll
all be dropped out in no time.

543
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,859
Don’t worry about them.

544
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:18,739
I know what people are doing, how they are
behaving.

545
00:43:18,739 --> 00:43:29,020
I know every one of you very well, each one
of you.

546
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:37,769
So, respect your body, respect yourself, keep
your hamsas all right at least.

547
00:43:37,769 --> 00:43:45,180
And I am sure, if you become serious about
it…you need a serious understanding of the

548
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,770
whole thing, that’s what is lacking.

549
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:54,819
Because if you love someone, the whole thing
becomes an entire possession sort of thing,

550
00:43:54,819 --> 00:44:04,890
the entire being is so seriously involved
into it that you cannot afford to miss anything.

551
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:12,910
And that’s what is going to help you.

552
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:20,609
But seriousness never means you are not enjoying.

553
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:25,549
Enjoyment is so deep: it’s pouring into
the heart.

554
00:44:25,549 --> 00:44:28,309
I play with you.

555
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:31,890
I always try to say things that will please
you.

556
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:36,799
And it should please you much more that I
have said — what today is that — how to

557
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:44,150
reach your depths, to reach that gravity that
will make you the gurus.

558
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:53,400
Today I had to talk to you like a guru, because
I feel that now the time has come for all

559
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:59,150
of you to become gurus of the right type.

560
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:08,609
Not with egos or talking big and creating
a big sort of a show out of you.

561
00:45:08,609 --> 00:45:20,430
But a definite depth within you that people
see that, “Here is a beacon of Mother."

562
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:24,700
And it is so fantastic!

563
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:32,520
The whole thing is so great, to be that.

564
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:39,599
This is what the gurus used to do, first of
all, is to cleanse people, clear them out,

565
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:45,420
take out their barriers, make them take out
their egos, by hanging them round, putting

566
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:50,039
them on top of a well, putting them down five,
six times, dipping them down.

567
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:54,630
They used to do all this for what?

568
00:45:54,630 --> 00:46:12,630
But now you can do it because I am before
you!Because I have come.

569
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:23,050
This is the reason.

570
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:26,740
Understand what Warren has, so rightly, said.

571
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:31,289
You might say that “Mother was working through
him."

572
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,279
Maybe.

573
00:46:33,279 --> 00:46:37,970
But, I always work through you if you are
one with me.

574
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:41,769
Even when I am speaking, you are speaking.

575
00:46:41,769 --> 00:46:44,730
And when you are speaking, I am speaking.

576
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:48,869
You know that.

577
00:46:48,869 --> 00:47:00,859
But with all this, that awe is very important.

578
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:17,069
And that gives you the love that thinks: complete
integration of your heart and your brain.

579
00:47:17,069 --> 00:47:23,220
The love that thinks is thoughtful, the love
that thinks.

580
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:29,849
And then the third integration: the love that
acts.

581
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:42,979
But first this integration must be brought
in: the love that thinks, which understands,

582
00:47:42,979 --> 00:47:47,839
which feels.

583
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:55,910
And then the love that acts.

584
00:47:55,910 --> 00:48:20,430
But the basic is the love — it starts from
the heart — is the love.

585
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:27,430
I think you’d better take my tape today
and listen to it.

586
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:28,790
Meditate.

587
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:32,470
Meditate on that.

588
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:45,349
I want to see my children in England develop
the depth in language, in speech, in feelings,

589
00:48:45,349 --> 00:48:50,270
in expressions, in the personality.

590
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:57,119
It’s only the awe that will make it.

591
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:02,059
But awe which is not frightening, but awe
that’s joy-giving.

592
00:49:02,059 --> 00:49:05,249
This is the integration of it.

593
00:49:05,249 --> 00:49:14,960
Awe that is joy-giving is not frightening.

594
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,270
Open your hearts!

595
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:24,380
But it doesn’t mean you should be frivolous,
[but] with all the care.

596
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,589
Have you seen a lotus opening?

597
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:35,119
How beautifully it opens: slowly, every petal
so careful not to hit each other.

598
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,720
Slowly it opens out.

599
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:45,890
And then the fragrance starts pouring in,
in the most dignified manner.

600
00:49:45,890 --> 00:50:04,759
Such a flower only can be offered at the Lotus
feet of the Adi Shakti, isn’t it?

601
00:50:04,759 --> 00:50:14,799
May God bless you.
