1
00:03:24,308 --> 00:03:43,125
So we are all here now (UNCLEAR) in this sacred
place called Kolhapur.

2
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:57,457
The Goddess killed the asura called Kolhasura
here, who was a very bad demon, who was born

3
00:03:57,482 --> 00:04:02,711
again recently, but he died also.

4
00:04:02,736 --> 00:04:07,838
So thank God the death of Kolhasura has taken
place.

5
00:04:07,838 --> 00:04:30,961
This place specially is marked because from
the Mother Earth the Mahalakshmi energy was

6
00:04:30,986 --> 00:04:35,136
emitted specially from the deity of Mahalakshmi.

7
00:04:37,764 --> 00:04:46,531
And as you know that Mahalakshmi is the ascending
power within us.

8
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:49,388
Through which we ascend.

9
00:04:49,491 --> 00:05:00,384
It’s like the staircase which takes you
into the realm of God and so it is very important.

10
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:10,359
And Maharastra’s deity is Vittala, Shri
Krishna, because it is the ascending power

11
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:23,049
of Vishnu through Shri Krishna, then Mahavishnu
and then through Sahastrar.

12
00:05:23,049 --> 00:05:29,539
All this is possible because we have got Mahalakshmi
channel within us.

13
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:39,859
If you did not have shushumna we would have
been like animals only.

14
00:05:39,859 --> 00:05:48,299
Even animals have this channel up to a point.

15
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:58,288
As you know they come up to the Void, but
after the Void the ascent as human being starts

16
00:05:58,313 --> 00:06:02,807
through this Mahalakshmi energy within us.

17
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:15,224
So this energy is very important and that
one is very much worshipped in this country.

18
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:25,933
First this energy starts working within us
as seeking.

19
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:32,741
Seeking shelter and food.

20
00:06:33,281 --> 00:06:42,754
Once the shelter is established, which is
established through the Mahakali shakti, I

21
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:51,268
mean when it is in the heart of an animal
a sense of security is established.

22
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:54,867
Then he starts seeking food.

23
00:06:54,867 --> 00:07:06,527
In the same way human beings also, once he
is established in his security, then he starts

24
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:11,516
thinking of feeding himself, looking after
himself.

25
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:19,837
So at the very primitive state the human beings
first tried to establish their security by

26
00:07:19,837 --> 00:07:28,877
getting into some caves or some shelters where
they could abide without fear to life, because

27
00:07:28,877 --> 00:07:32,907
if there is no life you don’t think of food.

28
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:37,826
For example if there is an emergency, we had
a very bad floods in Patna and it was such

29
00:07:37,826 --> 00:07:50,296
a bad flood that people had to go in the upper
storey and look after their security, that

30
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:52,020
was the first thing.

31
00:07:52,989 --> 00:08:03,396
Which is such an innate feeling in human beings
to preserve life and that comes from the Mahakali’s

32
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:05,020
powers.

33
00:08:05,045 --> 00:08:10,469
And when they went up there, they told me
that they didn’t have food for three days

34
00:08:10,494 --> 00:08:12,414
but they had never thought of food.

35
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,101
They never even thought they were hungry,
they were only worried that the water will

36
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:20,817
rise up to that point where they are and they’ll
all sink and die.

37
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:25,176
So the only worry was that how to exist, how
to survive.

38
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:27,367
I mean the food question did not come.

39
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:35,447
But when people starve they also start thinking
of insecurity that they may die and they start

40
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:38,467
thinking about food.

41
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:46,786
So the first security comes in, then the second
comes: the sense of food.

42
00:08:46,786 --> 00:08:53,727
In emergency the sense of food that comes
is the beginning, but later on we start putting

43
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:55,895
our attention to food.

44
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:59,687
Then the enjoyment of the food.

45
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:04,327
Then discrimination of the food and all those
things you see various things they start coming

46
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:09,142
into us and we get lost with this Mahalakshmi
tattwa.

47
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:18,307
The more we worry about the food, the more
we worry about the taste of the food, the

48
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:24,477
more we worry about the time of the food,
I mean one can live without food for two three

49
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:27,453
days very easily, there’s no problem.

50
00:09:27,478 --> 00:09:30,563
But we think that we are used to breakfast
at eight o’clock, we must have breakfast

51
00:09:30,588 --> 00:09:32,126
at eight o’clock.

52
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:38,045
Like Indians are used to their lunch at ten
o’clock, they must have lunch at ten o’clock.

53
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:44,807
This is all our slavery to time, and that’s
how our seeking which is higher, finishes

54
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:45,807
off.

55
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:49,020
Then they’ll start talking about food all
the time.

56
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:54,707
This is of course Mahakshmi’s blessings
that you think of food, but she doesn’t

57
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:57,027
say you get lost in it.

58
00:09:57,027 --> 00:10:01,355
So we get lost with it and once we are lost
with it, then our seeking doesn’t become

59
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,979
higher.

60
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:16,117
Our taste habits; we like this, we like that,
this is good, that is bad, we’d like to

61
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:21,422
have this; still if it lingers it keeps us
down.

62
00:10:21,447 --> 00:10:24,461
Whatever we get we should try to eat.

63
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:33,291
Whatever we think good, may not be good for
us.

64
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:37,581
It may be good for the tongue, but may not
be good for us, may not be good from vibrations

65
00:10:37,606 --> 00:10:38,735
point of view.

66
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,200
So whatever God gives us, whatever is there,
is good.

67
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,706
Vibrate it and eat it.

68
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:52,739
Also then the preservation sense comes in
that if you eat wrong type of food, then people

69
00:10:52,906 --> 00:10:58,567
start thinking, that this will also ruin their
security, because they may lose their health.

70
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:04,977
Then they start thinking about, up to a point
is all right, but if you do too much, then

71
00:11:04,977 --> 00:11:07,627
you get out of the circulation.

72
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:12,461
In the sense that if you are flying through…

73
00:11:12,486 --> 00:11:16,149
Will you please pay attention here, I’m
surprised that you are

74
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:19,846
sahaja yogis, how is it your attention goes
to small things like that?

75
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:29,753
There’s some ladies still looking at that
side.

76
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:37,444
(UNCLEAR) Please try to put your attention
to what I’m saying.

77
00:11:39,913 --> 00:11:43,326
Is it important that brother bringing something,
must you see that?

78
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:48,067
I mean this is really silly at this age.

79
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:56,032
Now you are sahaja yogis, your attention should
be concentrated.

80
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:12,067
So now the attention more goes towards the
acquisition of better facilities for food

81
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:17,157
or better food, whatever you may call for
‘health food’ as you call it and that

82
00:12:17,157 --> 00:12:24,133
also if you go too much, you can touch the
banks, but you shouldn’t cross over and

83
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:28,326
walk through, otherwise how will you move
on the river, that’s the point is.

84
00:12:28,326 --> 00:12:32,047
So we start building up that sort of a nonsense
also; this is good for health, this is not

85
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:35,633
good for health, that is good for health…and
health for what?

86
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,133
For what is the health?

87
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,504
Health is for having a good attention, which
you don’t have, is lost in the food.

88
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:49,446
And some people I’ve seen, they are just
still lost in food, completely.

89
00:12:49,446 --> 00:12:57,799
Though they have got a glimpse of sahaja yoga,
but still they are very much attached to food.

90
00:12:57,824 --> 00:13:06,216
So that sort of an attitude must be changed,
we should see where we go and get ourselves

91
00:13:06,216 --> 00:13:09,956
attached and lose our attention.

92
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:16,437
This is very important that we should be very
careful about our attention, where is it?

93
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:21,346
So now the attention moves on with that, I
mean those who still move further and don’t

94
00:13:21,346 --> 00:13:26,797
jump on the banks, still move in the river,
further on.

95
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:32,517
Attention goes on, then they think that you
see this kind, it works all the time the insecurity

96
00:13:32,517 --> 00:13:33,786
part of it in it.

97
00:13:33,786 --> 00:13:40,156
So that this food will be lost, so what should
we do to have better food.

98
00:13:40,156 --> 00:13:43,766
So they start thinking of money.

99
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:47,757
So you know that the barter system became
a system of money.

100
00:13:47,757 --> 00:13:49,956
People started having money.

101
00:13:49,956 --> 00:13:57,797
But then apart from food, clothing, other
things started and people started moving with

102
00:13:57,797 --> 00:14:01,617
it to the Mahakali power more and more.

103
00:14:01,617 --> 00:14:04,843
And the creative power more and more.

104
00:14:04,868 --> 00:14:09,066
The banks are also becoming subtler and subtler,
the movement is also becoming subtler and

105
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:10,091
subtler.

106
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:18,627
So as the man started moving higher and higher,
arts developed on the right side and the idea

107
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:22,761
of quality of life or quality of security
changed.

108
00:14:22,848 --> 00:14:30,937
So the both the sides becoming subtler and
subtler and the growth becoming subtler and

109
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:36,785
subtler, man gets again lost into those subtler
banks, on the right and the left.

110
00:14:36,817 --> 00:14:39,194
Still you have to move further.

111
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:42,436
So the Mahalakshmi power takes you higher
and higher.

112
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:46,456
That time then you think you must express
yourself.

113
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:49,877
And the expression starts in arts, culture.

114
00:14:49,877 --> 00:14:58,786
It starts also in your living, in your institutions
of security, like political advancement, political

115
00:14:58,786 --> 00:15:06,716
institutions and that’s how human being
reached a point where now they think they

116
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:15,632
have done that was all possible, but still
in a subtler way they are still lost.

117
00:15:15,657 --> 00:15:23,222
So the Mahalakshmi tattwa went up to say Christ,
up to that point and still people have not

118
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:26,404
gone into the subtler side of that.

119
00:15:26,713 --> 00:15:35,177
They are still on the banks, moving towards
the banks, not in the centre of it.

120
00:15:35,177 --> 00:15:46,107
In sahaja yoga, what happens is that the pure
desire, that is kundalini is kept at the beginning

121
00:15:46,132 --> 00:15:51,177
of the life, just at the beginning of the
life.

122
00:15:51,202 --> 00:15:55,607
When you were not even a human being.

123
00:15:55,607 --> 00:16:08,297
Even below is carbon and all the journey from
carbon onwards is to be recrossed again through

124
00:16:08,297 --> 00:16:11,539
the kundalini.

125
00:16:11,697 --> 00:16:22,477
All this journey that you did on the superficial
level of this Mahalakshmi stream has to be

126
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:34,247
redone in the innermost way, to penetrate
through all these subtler centres, which are

127
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:38,121
inside the stream, not outside.

128
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:42,407
Because if you are on the outside, you always
go to the banks.

129
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:47,356
From where you cannot see any banks, there
is no attention that could be taken to the

130
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,787
banks, but you move further.

131
00:16:50,812 --> 00:16:53,642
Like a jet.

132
00:16:53,780 --> 00:17:04,708
And this kundalini is the one that’s the
true desire, but your attention has to be

133
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,486
on the target.

134
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:13,747
Even if you say that the kundalini is the
moving force, still where is your attention?

135
00:17:13,747 --> 00:17:19,917
Still your attention is on the banks, so you
come up again superficially, you come and

136
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:24,607
just float superficially and then again jump
onto some bank and then again I’ll have

137
00:17:24,607 --> 00:17:28,091
to put you down inside the water: ‘Go inside,
inside.

138
00:17:28,116 --> 00:17:31,679
’ Again go back to the kundalini, again
start your journey.

139
00:17:31,981 --> 00:17:42,197
But from the very beginning steadfast if you
move towards the target, towards the spirit,

140
00:17:42,197 --> 00:17:43,916
then I have no problem.

141
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:49,257
But it doesn’t happen with human beings,
they are so much used to the attraction of

142
00:17:49,257 --> 00:17:56,397
the banks that they always come up, float,
go to the banks and again sometimes settle

143
00:17:56,397 --> 00:17:58,416
down there or again come back.

144
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:03,036
So the journey is upward, downward, downward,
upward.

145
00:18:03,036 --> 00:18:05,608
Though the movement of the kundalini could

146
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:08,878
be such that you jump like a jet and set down there.

147
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:14,207
The day that starts I’ll be the happiest
person because it is too much sometimes for

148
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:22,867
me, to make this kind of a journey four times
up and down with everyone, because of the

149
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:25,967
so called attachments they have outside.

150
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:33,827
The inner movement with a detached mind, if
they accept the situation and they decide

151
00:18:33,827 --> 00:18:36,103
within themselves that I’m going to do like
this,

152
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:38,825
 I’ve decided on this, they can work it out.

153
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,109
But it’s not so.

154
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:45,528
Mostly the attitude should be that Mother
is like a mirror.

155
00:18:45,886 --> 00:18:49,825
And we have a mirror in front of us, so we
know how we are proceeding.

156
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:54,832
So in the mirror if I see myself like this,
better get rid of it and go on.

157
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:59,991
But on the contrary if Mother says something
to someone, that this is so,

158
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:03,329
 then they feel hurt and again float up.

159
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:05,393
The mirror has to say something.

160
00:19:05,418 --> 00:19:09,809
Supposing you have some spot on your face,
the mirror is not going to please you, it

161
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:11,375
will say it is there.

162
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,948
So you don’t hit the mirror and you just
don’t get angry with the mirror, do you?

163
00:19:15,973 --> 00:19:20,041
You see that you clear yourself because you
don’t want to have any spots.

164
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:21,951
But just the other way round.

165
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:26,472
What happens with people I have seen, that
if you tell them anything or you just tell

166
00:19:26,497 --> 00:19:32,742
them this is wrong, they’ll first explain,
argue, this thing and if it doesn’t work

167
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:36,309
out then they will just get angry with sahaja
yoga and you.

168
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:41,493
As if they are obliging sahaja yoga, as if
they are obliging Mother.

169
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:44,438
Actually you are obliging yourself.

170
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:51,417
You are not obliging anyone or if you take
up that kind of an attitude, then only you

171
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:56,720
will realize that you have to move forward
without looking left or right.

172
00:19:56,752 --> 00:20:02,423
So we have had many experiences, quite funny
if you look back you can see that you have

173
00:20:02,543 --> 00:20:09,293
been sometimes Romeo Juliets, sometimes you
have been money minded people, sometimes you

174
00:20:09,318 --> 00:20:12,560
have been quarrelling, fighting, arguing type.

175
00:20:12,585 --> 00:20:14,447
All kinds we have had.

176
00:20:14,472 --> 00:20:22,887
But those who forget all this and shoot off
towards the goal

177
00:20:22,912 --> 00:20:25,975
are the best and the most   sensible.

178
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:30,817
They are the most selfish people, because
they know what selfishness is, all the rest

179
00:20:30,842 --> 00:20:34,133
are stupid because they are losing their time.

180
00:20:34,158 --> 00:20:39,718
There are some people I’ve seen who also
try to use sahaja yoga for making money or

181
00:20:39,743 --> 00:20:44,681
making something for sahaj yog sort of thing

182
00:20:44,706 --> 00:20:47,769
and making some money out of it or sort of a thing.

183
00:20:47,794 --> 00:20:57,058
You better make yourself is the best way and
enjoy it in a way that makes you happy and

184
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,890
makes others happy in the sahaja stream.

185
00:21:00,915 --> 00:21:06,542
But getting out of the sahaja stream and doing
something is again coming out of that innermost

186
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:13,665
channel of Bramha nadi, outward, again floating,
going to the banks, again going down, because

187
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:18,315
every time you go down like that you have
to start your kundalini again back.

188
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,776
It’s a very difficult thing.

189
00:21:20,808 --> 00:21:24,337
And the force of the kundalini gets spent.

190
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:29,472
So one has to understand that if you have
to do this journey,

191
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:32,337
you have to be a determined person.

192
00:21:32,362 --> 00:21:35,231
You have to be a disciplined person, yourself.

193
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:39,026
Nobody should tell you that discipline yourself,
do this do that.

194
00:21:39,051 --> 00:21:39,971
You have to do it.

195
00:21:39,996 --> 00:21:44,517
What others are doing, first is the attention
is there, I mean if somebody brings it here,

196
00:21:44,563 --> 00:21:46,088
everybody’s attention must go there.

197
00:21:46,113 --> 00:21:48,063
What is there to see?

198
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:57,631
But this is nothing, this is very, very superfluous
thing, but even serious things should not

199
00:21:57,656 --> 00:21:59,513
attract your attention.

200
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:06,907
Your attention should be on the solution of
all the solutions.

201
00:22:06,932 --> 00:22:14,767
Blessing of all the blessings.

202
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,259
The emancipation of all the emancipations.

203
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:25,003
You shouldn’t worry about anything else,
you just worry about that connection, which

204
00:22:25,028 --> 00:22:27,516
is being established and nothing else.

205
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,873
Everything is looked after.

206
00:22:30,414 --> 00:22:33,296
It is as simple as that.

207
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:38,181
If this connection is broken the simple thing
is to keep the connection on.

208
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:41,350
What’s the use of polishing this, doing
this, doing that?

209
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,675
Are you going to get the connection back?

210
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:51,150
This is a simple, practical thing we find.

211
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:59,979
And once we start forgetting that practical
side, we become retarded in our progress.

212
00:23:00,082 --> 00:23:03,289
And what we find, wherever we are, we are
there.

213
00:23:03,322 --> 00:23:07,020
Like in this Kolapur I would say, when I come
you’ll see tonight, there will be a huge

214
00:23:07,045 --> 00:23:09,332
crowd, very huge crowd.

215
00:23:09,332 --> 00:23:10,704
Always we have.

216
00:23:11,617 --> 00:23:15,086
Out of them how many really take up this journey?

217
00:23:15,111 --> 00:23:16,111
Very few.

218
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:19,941
Doesn’t matter.

219
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:21,277
You shouldn’t mind it.

220
00:23:21,302 --> 00:23:23,802
Because they are not wise yet.

221
00:23:23,993 --> 00:23:30,031
But those who become wise, who take up the
journey, also in between ‘jack in the box’

222
00:23:30,062 --> 00:23:31,322
they come out.

223
00:23:32,084 --> 00:23:34,635
Suddenly I find somebody floating.

224
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,833
We are going through the submarine.

225
00:23:36,858 --> 00:23:39,606
And they just jet out.

226
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:43,578
This is how it has happened with all our journey.

227
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:52,305
And at this place when we are, we have arrived
here not by plane, not by car, not by roads,

228
00:23:52,704 --> 00:23:58,992
but through the innermost core of our heart,
you have arrived, the bramha nadi.

229
00:23:59,017 --> 00:24:06,065
We have arrived at Kolapur at Mahalakshmi’s
point, through the most innermost part and

230
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,618
that’s how we are here.

231
00:24:08,643 --> 00:24:12,869
So we look at this place in a very gross manner.

232
00:24:12,894 --> 00:24:16,898
That’s our old habits.

233
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:21,635
But the new habit should be vibration wise,
where are we?

234
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,737
What is it?

235
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:29,542
Once you develop this, we I can definitely
completely transform this Kolapur in (UNCLEAR)

236
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:32,389
You are like my channels.

237
00:24:32,414 --> 00:24:37,641
When you go with me, I use you as my channels.

238
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:42,479
But what I find is that the channels are sometimes
crooked, sometimes broken, sometimes there

239
00:24:42,504 --> 00:24:46,015
are holes and the energy is wasted.

240
00:24:46,015 --> 00:24:50,265
So it is the duty of all the sahaja yogis
who are travelling with me specially, is to

241
00:24:50,265 --> 00:24:53,235
be the channels.

242
00:24:53,235 --> 00:24:59,205
But if you take an attitude that you are here
as guests, you have to be looked after, the

243
00:24:59,205 --> 00:25:05,223
arrangement should be good, that should be
good, then you have, there is no meaning.

244
00:25:05,248 --> 00:25:06,778
You are travelling.

245
00:25:08,396 --> 00:25:11,296
You are travelling like saints who travel
with Buddha.

246
00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:13,849
Even much more, because they did not do anything.

247
00:25:13,874 --> 00:25:15,596
But you are the channels.

248
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:21,030
As you are the channels, you have to keep
your channels open, efficient and you should

249
00:25:21,055 --> 00:25:23,124
work it out.

250
00:25:23,124 --> 00:25:32,895
Today is a special day for all of you, is
called as mahabij, the day of mahabij, means

251
00:25:32,895 --> 00:25:38,372
all the mantra’s have a bija and mahabija
of that is Omkara himself.

252
00:25:38,397 --> 00:25:39,854
Omkar.

253
00:25:39,879 --> 00:25:47,678
And it’s the first place, this Omkara was
like an egg, Bramhand, they call it Bramhand.

254
00:25:47,773 --> 00:25:51,725
The whole Bramha becomes a anda (egg).

255
00:25:51,725 --> 00:25:54,235
Because when they say Bramhand even Sanskrit

256
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,506
people don’t know that they are talking of an egg.

257
00:25:56,531 --> 00:25:57,685
Bramhanda.

258
00:25:57,991 --> 00:25:59,661
The anda of Bramha.

259
00:25:59,686 --> 00:26:01,175
That is the first bij.

260
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,085
And how this Bramha, this vibrations, how
they were created.

261
00:26:06,085 --> 00:26:15,805
In the first place, when the Devi separated
from Shiva, before that she had gone around

262
00:26:15,805 --> 00:26:19,134
him as you know.

263
00:26:19,134 --> 00:26:26,535
And then Shiva told her, Sadashiva told her
that you have to now create.

264
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:29,875
And the separation took place.

265
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:42,375
So he came out of that pradakshina or you
can call it elliptical form and when he came

266
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:50,497
out of it that created a kind of a sound.

267
00:26:50,522 --> 00:26:58,798
A sound that had this Bramha in it.

268
00:26:58,941 --> 00:27:04,710
So that Bramha was left in that area.

269
00:27:05,314 --> 00:27:14,555
As I have told you that first the Devi went
round Sadashiva and created a garland.

270
00:27:14,555 --> 00:27:21,582
That garland had covered Shiva in it.

271
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,476
Like the nucleus inside.

272
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:29,359
But when Sadashiva went out of it created
a sound.

273
00:27:29,557 --> 00:27:43,555
And that sound filled the whole of that andakruti,
means the form of an egg and that is the mahabiija.

274
00:27:43,555 --> 00:27:47,024
That is the Omkara.

275
00:27:47,699 --> 00:28:02,499
And that is reborn as Shri Ganesh and later
on as Jesus Christ.

276
00:28:03,334 --> 00:28:07,796
That’s why at Mahalakshmi’s place you

277
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:12,090
come with mahabija day, is a very significant thing.

278
00:28:12,678 --> 00:28:22,556
Because Mahalakshmi was the mother of Jesus,
Mary and her son was the incarnation of mahabija.

279
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:28,761
So to come here on such and such day, and
to do Mahalakshmi’s Puja, is a very big

280
00:28:28,786 --> 00:28:32,290
privilege, is a great privilege for all of
you.

281
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:44,862
And with that privilege you should humbly
do this puja and try to get into that mahabija,

282
00:28:45,084 --> 00:28:50,882
become one part of that mahabija, which is
this Bramhand.

283
00:28:50,907 --> 00:28:53,956
The whole Branhand, Bramha’s anda.

284
00:28:53,956 --> 00:29:05,765
Anda means egg is created, be part and parcel
of that and not to create any angularity or

285
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:12,781
any kind of a misrepresentation but be homogeneous
with the whole Bramha.

286
00:29:12,806 --> 00:29:21,255
One has to put attention to your Bramha Shakti
which is manifested as vibrations.

287
00:29:21,255 --> 00:29:27,028
Today the vibrations are so great, that I
didn’t think I would be able to speak on

288
00:29:27,053 --> 00:29:28,877
this, but somehow I have managed.

289
00:29:28,902 --> 00:29:33,361
I hope you all have been able to understand
the subtlest of subtle

290
00:29:33,386 --> 00:29:35,265
that I have talked to you today.

291
00:29:35,265 --> 00:29:40,226
So when you travel with me you should not
think you have come here to see the whole

292
00:29:40,226 --> 00:29:41,460
land and all that.

293
00:29:41,476 --> 00:29:42,722
Or to enjoy life.

294
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:48,973
You have come here to become the channel of
your Mother’s work.

295
00:29:48,998 --> 00:29:55,119
If you understand that, then you will be able
to realize that God has given you a

296
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:57,235
very appointed place.

297
00:29:57,616 --> 00:30:01,369
So I would request you, be deserving.

298
00:30:01,394 --> 00:30:02,732
Deserve it.

299
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:09,128
Assume your seats, coveted places where God
has put you.

300
00:30:09,153 --> 00:30:12,138
May God Bless You.
