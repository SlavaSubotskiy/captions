1
00:00:00,992 --> 00:00:05,226
Everybody was feeling very nice when
they came here,

2
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:09,390
happy and they felt, their vibrations
were all right.

3
00:00:09,415 --> 00:00:13,922
But it was not so.

4
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:20,186
So be on the alert, you see - ask
each other to check you,

5
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:23,879
be humble about it. You must go on
checking.

6
00:00:23,904 --> 00:00:26,077
Unless and until you check yourself,
how will you know

7
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:29,736
what's the thing you are catching?

8
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:33,683
Ask others to check you and be humble,
very humble about it.

9
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:41,454
Do not take things for granted because,
unless and until we transform ourselves,

10
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:47,029
Sahaja Yoga has no meaning to you.
You see, it could be very

11
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:52,786
material way of expression of Sahaja Yoga

12
00:00:52,827 --> 00:01:00,367
like this radio or this transistor
or this loudspeaker

13
00:01:00,392 --> 00:01:06,914
are just radiating.

14
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:19,799
We have to know that Sahaja Yoga is not
just to pass energy through us

15
00:01:19,823 --> 00:01:24,106
like all other material things are passing
energy.

16
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:30,456
This mike is passing the energy, this
transistor is passing the energy

17
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:36,789
and all other such things are just passing
the energy. Nothing goes into them.

18
00:01:36,814 --> 00:01:44,477
Like a... an artist is singing and the,
nothing passes into the radio.

19
00:01:44,502 --> 00:01:49,684
In the same way, if our power starts
flowing because somehow

20
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,133
the Kundalini has been connected
with the mains;

21
00:01:53,158 --> 00:02:01,356
it has not done its job neither you have
done any justice to yourself.

22
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:07,124
So you have to absorb that flow
of the Ganges within you

23
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:13,167
and assimilate it and transform yourself.

24
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:19,562
The Ganges would be flowing, but if it is
flowing through the

25
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:26,907
 stony area, the stones are not going
to absorb anything from the river Ganges.

26
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:30,084
But if it is flowing through fertile land,

27
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:33,667
everybody will be making use of that water.

28
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:39,496
 So you have to make use of your Kundalini
by transforming yourself.

29
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:42,813
Try to transform. See that how much
you transform.

30
00:02:42,838 --> 00:02:47,848
Now, the expectation about Kundalini
becomes,

31
00:02:47,873 --> 00:02:52,430
becomes so, so

32
00:02:56,253 --> 00:03:00,541
Sahaja - they call it in the very funny
manner -

33
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:04,777
that people think that Kundalini should
work it out itself

34
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:09,198
while we are stones on both the sides,
and the Kundalini is going to work it out,

35
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:13,340
which is very, very wrong idea.
If the river Ganges is flowing,

36
00:03:13,365 --> 00:03:16,579
you have to go to the river. You have
to fill your pitchers,

37
00:03:16,604 --> 00:03:20,715
you have to have beautiful pitchers;
you have to carry them;

38
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,102
you have to bring them home
and then use the water

39
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:30,778
for enrichment of your food, of your
household.

40
00:03:30,803 --> 00:03:34,244
In the same way, if you cannot transform
yourself,

41
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:36,641
if you do not, cannot change yourself,

42
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:40,770
then this Kundalini will be just going
like a thin line

43
00:03:40,795 --> 00:03:46,130
and you'll be catching all the time
and there won't be much progress.

44
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:49,225
The progress must be shown outside.

45
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,841
Those who think that by saying mantras
morning till evening

46
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:59,030
they are going to achieve much, they are
sadly mistaken; it's all mechanical then.

47
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:04,689
So many people have a habit of all the time
shouting mantras. It's not habit.

48
00:04:04,714 --> 00:04:08,654
Mantras should open your chakras,
otherwise, it has no meaning.

49
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:13,171
They should be used properly at key points,

50
00:04:13,196 --> 00:04:19,093
with great respect, with a great
understanding, and then allow them

51
00:04:19,118 --> 00:04:23,548
to open your chakras, by which you take
the water in

52
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:27,213
of that great thing known as Kundalini.

53
00:04:27,238 --> 00:04:31,417
The greatest blessing will come to you
through Her love.

54
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:36,072
But not the way, people are just taking
there should be no transformation.

55
00:04:36,097 --> 00:04:39,173
If you are identified with your ego
and think oh, you are all right,

56
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:41,931
you are sadly mistaken.

57
00:04:41,956 --> 00:04:45,296
You have to transform completely within
yourself.

58
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:48,298
Some people if their circumstances
are changed,

59
00:04:48,323 --> 00:04:51,933
then they feel very well and they think
oh, they have achieved the highest.

60
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,770
It is not so, is only the circumstance
that has changed,

61
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,492
only the atmosphere that has changed
and that makes you feel

62
00:04:59,517 --> 00:05:02,846
that you have achieved something great.

63
00:05:02,871 --> 00:05:05,942
You have to achieve it wherever you are.

64
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:09,621
It should be retained and must be there.
But by coming

65
00:05:09,646 --> 00:05:14,393
to a quieter place, you can pay more
attention, that's why you are here.

66
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:17,297
But by coming here, if you just feel nice

67
00:05:17,322 --> 00:05:19,867
and think that oh, you have achieved
everything, then it's...

68
00:05:19,892 --> 00:05:23,795
you are sadly mistaken. You have to grow
in this atmosphere;

69
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,206
you have come here to grow and to be
changed, to be different person altogether.

70
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:32,684
Do not be identified with your ego and
do not get satisfied

71
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:36,134
with something that you feel...
"feeling nice and good."

72
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,245
That's not the way to look at things.

73
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,944
You have to transform yourself and see
for yourself: How are you behaving?

74
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:48,525
How are you feeling about things? Are you
taking a new view of things or not?

75
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,686
Now, the worst thing that comes in the way
of ego is obstinacy,

76
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:56,607
of your own obstinacy.

77
00:05:56,632 --> 00:06:01,473
Obstinate people are extremely difficult
and they find pride in their obstinacy

78
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:06,083
and they'll go on saying that, "Yes,
I'm obstinate." What to do?

79
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:08,886
If you take pride in all such nonsensical
things,

80
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,044
then you carry the load of these stones
on your head

81
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:16,106
- this life, next life and many lives
to come that you are going to live.

82
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,557
All such stones must be dropped
immediately

83
00:06:18,582 --> 00:06:24,694
and should shake them off because
you have to achieve your beauty.

84
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:30,892
You have seen how a flower shakes off
all that is not needed,

85
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:34,215
blooms out, pierces its head outwards,

86
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,198
opens out just to give fragrance to others.

87
00:06:37,223 --> 00:06:40,714
If you want to give fragrance to others,
how far fragrance within you?

88
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:45,059
Is there fragrance within you that you
are going to give fragrance to others?

89
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:49,200
So that is what one has to find out
and has to do it.

90
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:52,507
First and foremost thing: How far
you can love others?

91
00:06:52,532 --> 00:06:55,795
How far you can fulfill your duties

92
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:01,713
as a husband, wife, child, father,
mother - everything?

93
00:07:01,738 --> 00:07:04,510
It is not the way people understand
Sahaja Yoga

94
00:07:04,535 --> 00:07:09,402
- is that you hang in the air somewhere
and then you say that, “I am all right”.

95
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:13,695
Of course, there are difficult people
and difficult relationships,

96
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,783
but a sahaja yogi must have a very
detached view of the whole thing

97
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:24,561
and should be able to correct all those
problems that exist

98
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:29,432
and should take a very strong and stern
view of the people who are not

99
00:07:29,457 --> 00:07:33,866
Sahaja in their family and around and tell
them off that, “What are you doing?

100
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:38,078
Are you going to carry on like this
all your lives and are going to die

101
00:07:38,103 --> 00:07:42,727
with this... all this load on your heads
or are you going to get rid of it?”.

102
00:07:42,752 --> 00:07:46,135
But first of all, you have to be all right.

103
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,690
Now in our being, we have manas on the,
from the left-hand side

104
00:07:51,715 --> 00:07:55,007
it comes to the right hand and goes
backwards,

105
00:07:55,032 --> 00:07:59,967
and we have also got ahankara, which is
the ego,

106
00:07:59,992 --> 00:08:03,248
which goes - comes up on
the right-hand side...

107
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:05,927
from the right-hand side to the left-hand
side

108
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:10,246
and in the brain it comes forward,
on the left-hand side it moves.

109
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:15,063
So with these two things, two - ego
and superego,

110
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:18,136
manas and ahankara we have got

111
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:22,498
- in between these two is the buddhi,
is the intelligence is in between.

112
00:08:22,523 --> 00:08:29,839
But this intelligence if it is not, if it
is not balanced by wisdom

113
00:08:29,864 --> 00:08:34,660
- by subuddhi - it can be very dangerous,

114
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:40,705
and it records all that you are doing.
It knows what you are doing.

115
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,372
But if you are identified with your ego
or superego,

116
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:47,482
the buddhi cannot go too far.

117
00:08:47,507 --> 00:08:50,218
In the beginning, it may try to tell you
that, "This is wrong,

118
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:52,512
you should not go there, you should not
do that,"

119
00:08:52,537 --> 00:08:54,714
but then it becomes silent.

120
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:58,023
So you have to be very careful about
your intelligence also.

121
00:08:58,048 --> 00:09:01,762
Your intelligence becomes suddenly silent;
it doesn't help you.

122
00:09:01,787 --> 00:09:04,918
Then, the ego takes over or the superego
takes over.

123
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:08,669
Then all your thinking, all your
understanding

124
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:13,344
goes according to the...according to the
lines of ego, and you go ahead with it,

125
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:18,124
 and you just don't know where you are
going, what you are doing.

126
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:23,647
So when we are in this place, we are...
decided to have a very good

127
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:28,944
session of Sahaja Yoga, it is important
for all of us to know

128
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:32,607
when we go from here, how much changed
are we going to be.

129
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:37,039
Otherwise, there's a puja, there's a havan,
there's this... every time;

130
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:41,036
and what is the progress within ourselves
- we should see.

131
00:09:41,061 --> 00:09:45,621
Is it as much as a little ant moves

132
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:50,194
in one minute or is it something much more?

133
00:09:50,219 --> 00:09:53,986
The progress is slow because we do not
want to transform ourselves.

134
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:57,552
Every moment try to see that you transform
yourself.

135
00:09:57,577 --> 00:10:02,189
I have seen people who have been
living like

136
00:10:02,214 --> 00:10:05,651
hippopotamus - have been living like
hippopotamus.

137
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:13,243
Those who are living like hyenas
will remain like hyenas.

138
00:10:13,268 --> 00:10:18,304
They go on remaining with their own
identification,

139
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:22,555
feeling very happy about it, which is
a very wrong thing.

140
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,674
You have to bloom out, bloom out
like flowers.

141
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:32,612
Change yourself, transform yourself!
This transformation is going to help you.

142
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:37,879
This is like triggering into a new
dimension of life.

143
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:42,721
Unless and until this triggering shows,
your life has no meaning,

144
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:47,638
Sahaja Yoga has no meaning to you.
So try your level best

145
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:53,129
to trigger this transformation - every
minute of your life -

146
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:56,602
then you will be amazed at the enrichment
of life.

147
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:59,949
Whatever I may try, just now I've cleared
you out quite a lot, I think.

148
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:03,919
I have cleared you out up and down
- quite a lot, isn't it?

149
00:11:03,944 --> 00:11:07,799
But despite that, now it is for you
to keep it there.

150
00:11:07,824 --> 00:11:11,571
First of all, your attention, I don't
think, is that all right.

151
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:15,494
That's why you catch on the right Nabhi
and on the liver.

152
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,502
Attention has to be on one side, but if you
go on moving your head,

153
00:11:19,527 --> 00:11:22,865
moving your attention, then you cannot be
on Nirvichara.

154
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:28,185
So to keep on Nirvichara, you have to keep
your attention first steady,

155
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,803
and once this steadiness is achieved,

156
00:11:30,828 --> 00:11:36,098
then you just have to see that you are
Nirvichara.

157
00:11:36,123 --> 00:11:39,646
Put all your thoughts in that stream
of Nirvichara

158
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:42,206
and it will solve your problem.

159
00:11:42,231 --> 00:11:45,576
But transformation is definitely
a positive stage

160
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:48,626
where you see yourself. You see, you see
yourself; you call yourself,

161
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:51,593
say, you call yourself Nirmala. Then
you say,

162
00:11:51,618 --> 00:11:55,945
"Oh, Nirmala, now, is this the way
to look at things?"

163
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:01,953
Transformation is identifying yourself
with that Self which sees you.

164
00:12:01,978 --> 00:12:05,960
So that, once you start identifying
with that Self

165
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:10,258
and expressing something to this self,
which is Nirmala,

166
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:13,856
then you are separated; then
the transformation takes place.

167
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:18,522
Because first, you should see and then
you should be identified with that self,

168
00:12:18,547 --> 00:12:20,763
so there's a transformation within
yourself.

169
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:25,212
Otherwise, only you'll be carrying some
energy within you,

170
00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:28,858
by which you may do little miracles
- you may raise Kundalinis.

171
00:12:28,883 --> 00:12:34,817
But what about you? You will be where
you were.

172
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:38,169
So it is important when we come to a place
like that,

173
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:43,596
that we must not be carried away
by something very outward

174
00:12:43,628 --> 00:12:48,295
and absolutely of no value to Sahaja Yoga.

175
00:12:48,663 --> 00:12:54,269
Now in the later day, I will tell you
how to raise your

176
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:59,352
different powers, but just now, I think,
we must decide,

177
00:12:59,377 --> 00:13:03,452
we'll go from here absolutely transformed
into new persons.

178
00:13:03,477 --> 00:13:06,444
May God bless you.
