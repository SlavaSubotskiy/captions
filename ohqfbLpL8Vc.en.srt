00:00:05,436 --> 00:00:10,502
SHRI ADI SHAKTI PUJA

2
00:11:31,177 --> 00:11:40,902
Today we are going to do the puja 
of Adi Shakti.

3
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:54,079
It’s a difficult subject to talk about 
Adi Shakti

4
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:05,233
because it’s not easy to understand

5
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:11,727
that Adi Shakti is the power of Sadashiva.

6
00:12:11,973 --> 00:12:17,975
Sadashiva is the God Almighty.

7
00:12:18,998 --> 00:12:23,150
She is His breath, as they some people 
call it.

8
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:27,750
Some say She is the desire

9
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:39,549
and some say that She’s the entire power 
of Sadashiva,

10
00:12:39,856 --> 00:12:49,496
and Sadashiva cannot do anything without 
Her powers.

11
00:12:53,288 --> 00:13:02,101
This subject has been described by many 
people in various books in different ways.

12
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:09,181
But actually we need not go

13
00:13:09,382 --> 00:13:13,640
to the background of the creation 
of Adi Shakti,

14
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:20,670
for that at least you’ll need seven 
lectures. But we’ll come to the point

15
00:13:20,871 --> 00:13:26,463
where Adi Shakti started working on this 
Mother Earth.

16
00:13:28,077 --> 00:13:30,675
The first thing is we must know,

17
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:36,623
that She created a Kundalini in the Mother 
Earth itself

18
00:13:37,658 --> 00:13:46,559
and She created Shri Ganesha out of 
the Mother Earth, it’s very interesting.

19
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,283
So the Mother Earth becomes a very 
important thing for us.

20
00:13:52,484 --> 00:13:56,844
If we do not know how to respect the Mother 
Earth,

21
00:13:57,315 --> 00:14:03,030
we do not know how to respect ourselves.

22
00:14:03,411 --> 00:14:08,727
The expression of Adi Shakti within you 
is the Kundalini, no doubt.

23
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:13,786
That is the reflection of Adi Shakti 
in you.

24
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:20,158
But the reflection in the Mother Earth is 
also expressed,

25
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:29,573
as you all know, in different places, 
different countries, different cities,

26
00:14:29,774 --> 00:14:38,794
as the manifestation of chakras and 
Adi Shakti’s creations.

27
00:14:38,995 --> 00:14:47,724
It was very important first to create 
a very holy Mother Earth

28
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:52,077
for human beings to be born on that.

29
00:14:52,958 --> 00:15:03,872
So the reflection of the Adi Shakti as 
Kundalini first was on the Mother Earth.

30
00:15:04,073 --> 00:15:12,458
Kundalini is a, we should say, is a wee 
part of the Adi Shakti,

31
00:15:13,104 --> 00:15:21,797
or we can say that She is the desire, 
pure desire of the Adi Shakti.

32
00:15:21,998 --> 00:15:28,116
So Adi Shakti is the desire, complete 
desire of Sadashiva

33
00:15:28,317 --> 00:15:41,388
and Kundalini, Adi Kundalini, is the desire, 
complete desire of Adi Shakti.

34
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:46,048
Now this one was first expressed

35
00:15:47,622 --> 00:15:53,166
in the Mother Earth, inside the Mother 
Earth.

36
00:15:54,602 --> 00:16:00,340
Inside the Mother Earth, the Kundalini 
came up

37
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:08,214
in such a way that it cooled down the inner 
part of the Mother Earth

38
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:11,839
as much as it could,

39
00:16:12,925 --> 00:16:25,175
and then it manifested on the surface 
of the earth as different chakras.

40
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:34,920
So it’s tremendous similarity that we have

41
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:43,190
with Virata, the Mother Earth and the human 
beings.

42
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:56,913
If all of them are being reflected by 
the Adi Kundalini,

43
00:16:57,114 --> 00:17:03,097
so there has to be a great connection 
between them.

44
00:17:03,963 --> 00:17:13,705
It is not understood by human beings how 
they are connected to this Mother Earth.

45
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:19,170
This Kundalini passed through different 
centers, creating different centers

46
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:26,859
in the Mother Earth and ultimately broke 
through Kailasha.

47
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,718
And I don’t know how many have you been 
to Kailash you’ll see

48
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:36,915
tremendous vibrations flowing out 
of Kailash.

49
00:17:37,738 --> 00:17:42,870
Now the way we insult our Mother Earth,

50
00:17:43,164 --> 00:17:50,839
what we are doing is we are insulting 
the Adi Shakti.

51
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:57,167
So many ways there are we should respect 
the Mother Earth.

52
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:05,318
I mean it was an Indian custom to begin 
with, when you got up from your bed

53
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,399
and you touched the Mother Earth with 
your feet,

54
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,424
you have to say, “Oh Mother Earth, please 
forgive me

55
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:19,130
because I’m touching you with my feet”.

56
00:18:21,265 --> 00:18:30,276
All the movements of Mother Earth are 
controlled by this inner Kundalini,

57
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:34,317
which is the reflection of Adi Shakti.

58
00:18:34,518 --> 00:18:40,395
The gravity that it has also is 
the manifestation

59
00:18:40,596 --> 00:18:46,326
of the Kundalini of the Mother Earth.

60
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:55,910
Now, why we are suffering in this beautiful 
planet,

61
00:18:56,111 --> 00:19:02,559
because we do not respect what we have 
to respect the most.

62
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,950
Mother Earth is to be respected, meaning 
what?

63
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:17,166
Meaning that whatever is created on this 
earth, by the movement of the earth,

64
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:24,525
by the sea, by all the elements, has to be 
respected.

65
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:33,448
Today’s problem is pollution, all kinds 
of things people talk of.

66
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:38,603
The reason behind it, people never 
understood the importance

67
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:46,496
of all these five elements which are 
supportive of our life.

68
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:51,539
So to respect the Mother Earth people do 
Bhumi Puja.

69
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,066
Many people, when they are building 
a house,

70
00:19:55,267 --> 00:20:00,062
they will do the Bhumi Pujan, means they 
will respect the Mother Earth,

71
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:06,289
because if She is not being respected maybe 
there could be an earthquake,

72
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:16,606
which means that this Mother Earth 
understands, knows and acts.

73
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:25,524
It acts in such a manner that human beings 
don’t understand why such things happen.

74
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:32,207
Now, we can say that, in a place called 
Latur,

75
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:43,379
it was Shri Ganesha’s fourteenth day and 
they had to submerge

76
00:20:44,124 --> 00:20:53,424
the statues into the sea or into the river, 
so they went all out, singing, dancing.

77
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:58,763
After coming from there they all started 
drinking,

78
00:20:59,122 --> 00:21:06,365
and drinking is not liked by Mother Earth 
at all.

79
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:12,222
If you are drunk and you are walking 
on the road you’ll fall down.

80
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:22,735
It so happened with their drinking that 
a big earthquake broke in,

81
00:21:22,936 --> 00:21:27,805
and all those who were dancing, were 
drinking, all of them

82
00:21:28,006 --> 00:21:33,272
were engulfed into that earthquake by 
Mother Earth.

83
00:21:33,473 --> 00:21:41,267
Only our center, which is there, was 
surrounded by a big gap

84
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:50,627
but nothing happened to our center and not 
one single Sahaja Yogi was ruined by that.

85
00:21:50,828 --> 00:21:56,723
We can understand because we are Sahaja 
Yogis, how the Mother Earth has acted

86
00:21:56,924 --> 00:22:01,500
to save those people, who were Sahaja 
Yogis.

87
00:22:01,701 --> 00:22:08,606
So the understanding of Mother Earth about 
saints is very great.

88
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:17,333
She knows who is a saint, She knows 
the feet of a saint

89
00:22:17,534 --> 00:22:23,687
and that’s why, you know so many things 
were created, like Moses,

90
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:29,931
He went to the sea and the Mother Earth 
came up, for them to walk through.

91
00:22:30,132 --> 00:22:37,499
If all the Jews had walked, it would not 
have worked, but it was Moses

92
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:44,493
and His saintliness that the Mother Earth 
Herself came up and helped.

93
00:22:44,694 --> 00:22:55,213
In the same way when Rama was building 
a big bridge between Lanka and India,

94
00:22:55,414 --> 00:22:59,588
the Mother Earth came up as a bridge.

95
00:22:59,881 --> 00:23:07,511
So we should not try to curse the Mother 
Earth for any mishaps on this Earth.

96
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:13,548
If people are saintly they will be always 
protected by Mother Earth.

97
00:23:13,749 --> 00:23:19,446
She will always try to give them whatever 
they want.

98
00:23:19,647 --> 00:23:26,284
You can see in the minute way, that 
supposing now, in our Cabella here,

99
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:32,033
the roses are of such a big size, such 
a big size roses,

100
00:23:32,242 --> 00:23:38,768
you won’t find such big size in the whole 
world. But we have here, such big ones.

101
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:43,844
In Pratisthan we had

102
00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:51,167
flowers of sunflower so big as that. 
One man could not lift it.

103
00:23:51,368 --> 00:23:56,714
Now, how is it all this is happening 
in particular places?

104
00:23:56,915 --> 00:24:02,159
Is the Mother Earth who knows who is living 
here,

105
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:11,552
who is walking on Her back we should say, 
or on Her soil,

106
00:24:11,753 --> 00:24:16,543
because Mother Earth understands 
vibrations.

107
00:24:16,744 --> 00:24:24,102
Now, certain places we say that are very 
holy.

108
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:37,574
How have they discovered that these places 
are holy, because of magnetic forces.

109
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:42,781
The magnetic forces in England I was 
surprised, were crossing each other

110
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,912
at a place called Oxted where we lived.

111
00:24:46,113 --> 00:24:50,706
They were crossing since long, but we lived 
there later on.

112
00:24:50,907 --> 00:25:00,093
So Mother Earth also organizes and arranges 
things for saintly people.

113
00:25:00,294 --> 00:25:06,903
It's very interesting to see how the Mother 
Earth guides you in a proper way.

114
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:10,054
I mean, I don't know how many instances 
I can give you.

115
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:15,780
But we don’t understand the value of 
the understanding of this Mother Earth

116
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:22,054
and Her loving protection for all 
he saints.

117
00:25:22,275 --> 00:25:29,102
In the same way, we have to understand how 
the whole atmosphere, the rain,

118
00:25:29,303 --> 00:25:33,344
comes in at the right time, the moon, 
the sun,

119
00:25:33,545 --> 00:25:40,418
everything works out in such a beautiful 
manner because they know it’s a saint.

120
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:47,742
They know these are saintly people sitting 
here. They know that they are pure people,

121
00:25:47,943 --> 00:25:54,551
that they are the essence of life and they 
should be looked after,

122
00:25:54,752 --> 00:25:59,000
they should be cared for, they should be 
bothered for.

123
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:05,444
It is not bothered about people who are 
of no use.

124
00:26:05,645 --> 00:26:12,142
For example now for Haj, so many people 
went and so many were killed.

125
00:26:12,343 --> 00:26:17,200
Some went to Amarnath and they were killed 
because they were not saints,

126
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:22,978
just ritualistic people, going for a ritual 
which,

127
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:32,360
in the discretion of the Mother Earth, was 
of no avail and of no advantage to them.

128
00:26:32,561 --> 00:26:35,899
But nobody learns from this, nobody learns.

129
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:40,086
When so many people were going to say, 
Amarnath were killed,

130
00:26:40,287 --> 00:26:44,627
Pakistan said, “See, they should not have 
gone to this Amarnath,

131
00:26:44,828 --> 00:26:50,896
it’s a false place, why did they go there? 
And by going there

132
00:26:51,097 --> 00:26:55,541
what has proved is that it’s not a holy 
place”.

133
00:26:55,742 --> 00:26:59,487
But when the Haj thing took place, they had 
nothing to say,

134
00:26:59,688 --> 00:27:02,738
they didn’t know how to explain this 
Haj business

135
00:27:02,939 --> 00:27:07,712
and the killing – dying of so many people.

136
00:27:07,913 --> 00:27:15,437
The reason is this, that these people have 
been going to Haj all the time.

137
00:27:15,638 --> 00:27:19,460
Once there was a stampede with thirty-two 
thousand people being

138
00:27:19,661 --> 00:27:24,118
injured and troubled and killed. Now this 
is it.

139
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:32,429
Now, what is Mother Earth suggesting, that 
going to these places,

140
00:27:32,635 --> 00:27:39,305
holy places, they are really holy, no doubt; 
going to these places,

141
00:27:39,506 --> 00:27:43,671
you are not doing any spiritual ascent.

142
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:51,098
You are not achieving anything by going 
to these places, which are really holy.

143
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:55,157
That cannot be challenged. They are holy 
places.

144
00:27:55,358 --> 00:28:00,210
You must be knowing that I was born 
in Chindwara, and Mecca and Chindwara

145
00:28:00,411 --> 00:28:05,852
are on the same Cancer line. How is it?

146
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:13,022
What is about Mecca? Mecca is 
Makkeshwarashiv – it’s a Shiva.

147
00:28:13,223 --> 00:28:19,803
Why did Mohammed Sahib ask people 
to worship a stone?

148
00:28:20,004 --> 00:28:24,752
He didn’t believe in stones, He was against 
all kinds of idol worship;

149
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:29,765
then why did He say this black stone, 
which is there, has to be worshipped,

150
00:28:29,966 --> 00:28:33,582
for that people have to go there. What was 
the reason?

151
00:28:33,783 --> 00:28:38,924
Because He could feel the vibrations, He 
could feel that it’s a swayambhu,

152
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:42,977
so He said it. So all the Muslims like mad 
are going there.

153
00:28:43,178 --> 00:28:49,620
By going there nobody has improved, I have 
not seen anybody improved by going to Mecca.

154
00:28:49,821 --> 00:28:53,996
It's just a kind of a ritual. They think 
if they go there,

155
00:28:54,197 --> 00:28:58,186
when they will die tomorrow they will tell 
God, “See now, we have a certificate,

156
00:28:58,387 --> 00:29:01,316
we have been to Mecca.”

157
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:09,149
Like our pope once upon a time used to give 
certificate, that when you go to heaven,

158
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:15,383
you can show the certificate that now you 
are a real Christian.

159
00:29:15,584 --> 00:29:22,536
In this way, all these artificial things 
came up, but there is reality behind it.

160
00:29:22,737 --> 00:29:29,108
The difference is the reality is for 
the real people and not for false people.

161
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:32,444
But this ritualism has grown too much.

162
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:39,655
Like in India we have many swayambhus 
created by the Kundalini again I would say,

163
00:29:39,856 --> 00:29:43,053
and which are really worshipped.

164
00:29:43,254 --> 00:29:49,974
I’ve been to most of them and I was 
surprised that most of the pujaris

165
00:29:50,175 --> 00:29:55,244
were suffering from some sort of a serious 
disease. Like one was a paralyzed fellow.

166
00:29:55,445 --> 00:29:59,669
He said, “We are serving this God here, 
and You said this is swayambhu;

167
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:03,393
then Mother, how, why is it we are 
suffering from this disease?”

168
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:08,389
I said, “Because you are just making money. 
You can’t make money out of God.

169
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:12,981
If you don’t want to serve God, you don’t 
stay here, but if you want to serve God,

170
00:30:13,182 --> 00:30:18,170
then you can stay here, but don’t make 
money out of this”.

171
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:25,450
It’s very common, I have seen, those people 
who make money get paralysis, I’ve seen it.

172
00:30:27,515 --> 00:30:35,210
It’s a very deep understanding all these 
elements, Mother Earth,

173
00:30:35,411 --> 00:30:40,162
everybody has about everything.

174
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:46,369
Because their Kundalini is not like your 
Kundalini,

175
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:56,727
which is, though in itself is pure, but 
because of your human endeavors,

176
00:30:56,928 --> 00:31:02,376
human mistakes, ego, superego, all sorts 
of nonsense,

177
00:31:02,577 --> 00:31:11,058
the Kundalini is not so sensitive, nor does 
it tell you what is happening.

178
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:20,505
It has to be very alert, sensitive 
spirituality within you,

179
00:31:20,706 --> 00:31:27,759
by which you can say immediately what you 
think,

180
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,743
what you know, what you understand about 
anything.

181
00:31:32,944 --> 00:31:38,597
But the problem is that this doesn’t exist.

182
00:31:38,884 --> 00:31:43,830
Why is it you should not be so sensitive?

183
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:48,503
On the contrary, I have seen, if their 
mind works against somebody,

184
00:31:48,704 --> 00:31:51,341
then they start saying, “You are catching 
on this, you are catching on that,

185
00:31:51,461 --> 00:31:56,960
you are catching on that”. Actually 
the person who’s saying that is catching.

186
00:31:57,662 --> 00:32:03,140
So with this thing one has to understand 
that if we are the true reflection

187
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:14,652
of Adi Shakti, then we should be pure, 
absolutely pure, like the white snow.

188
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:19,847
Even one black drop – that’s why I wore 
today the white sari -

189
00:32:20,048 --> 00:32:23,866
falls on the white, it shows.

190
00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:34,580
You should be so white that anything, 
any minute black spot

191
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:44,430
also should be seen by you, and in others 
also to be felt by you.

192
00:32:45,057 --> 00:32:59,538
If that height is achieved by pure life, 
by pure thinking, by pure heart,

193
00:32:59,739 --> 00:33:05,654
it is not necessary to manipulate anything; 
no, no need at all.

194
00:33:05,855 --> 00:33:12,944
It’s all natural like the Mother Earth is. 
Does She manipulate anything? Nothing.

195
00:33:13,145 --> 00:33:18,162
Just see how spontaneous She is. You put 
a seed in the Mother Earth

196
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:22,274
and see how it sprouts.

197
00:33:22,475 --> 00:33:28,298
She is so spontaneous, Her activity is so 
spontaneous, we never wonder about it.

198
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:32,542
See different types of flowers, different 
types of fragrance,

199
00:33:32,743 --> 00:33:36,885
different types of shrubs and trees,

200
00:33:37,086 --> 00:33:42,372
how She grows with such balance in every 
place.

201
00:33:42,573 --> 00:33:51,906
In every minute atom and molecule of that 
Mother Earth there is sense.

202
00:33:53,886 --> 00:34:01,716
So before us is the best reflection of the 
Adi Shakti and that is this Mother Earth.

203
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:05,097
So first we must respect the Mother Earth.

204
00:34:05,298 --> 00:34:08,942
I like you people because you are sitting 
on the ground, it’s very good.

205
00:34:09,143 --> 00:34:13,886
For meditation if you can sit on the Mother 
Earth it will be extremely good

206
00:34:14,087 --> 00:34:19,131
because the special quality of the Mother 
Earth, which also I have unfortunately,

207
00:34:19,332 --> 00:34:26,440
that I suck your problems. She too sucks 
your problem

208
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:32,174
and when She sucks your problem you get 
rid of them without any difficulties.

209
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:39,536
So, if you cannot, say, sit on the ground, 
then you take a stone, better is,

210
00:34:39,737 --> 00:34:45,963
or you can have a marble, or something which 
is natural on which you should try to sit.

211
00:34:46,164 --> 00:34:50,404
But if you sit on the plastic and do your 
meditation, I don’t know

212
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:54,286
what is going to help you – the plastic?

213
00:34:54,522 --> 00:34:59,050
That’s why I request you always, that use 
natural things,

214
00:34:59,251 --> 00:35:06,437
because natural things can absorb your 
problems very well.

215
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,185
Unnaturally also we live otherwise.

216
00:35:10,386 --> 00:35:14,217
You see it is on the physical line, also 
on mental line.

217
00:35:14,418 --> 00:35:23,509
On mental line what do we do, that we go on 
arguing, explaining,

218
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:28,650
it’s going on and on and on and on! There’s 
no end to it.

219
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:34,227
One should get headache, you see, actually 
with all that. But if you are spontaneous,

220
00:35:34,428 --> 00:35:38,569
if you are very spontaneous, immediately 
you will know

221
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:44,204
what the other fellow is trying to do or 
to say or to communicate.

222
00:35:44,405 --> 00:35:46,694
You don’t need much thinking about it,

223
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:51,367
because you can absorb even the thought 
of another person.

224
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:56,413
Absorb doesn’t mean that you take the bad 
thing of that person,

225
00:35:56,614 --> 00:36:02,773
but it’s like the sieving out. You absorb 
what another person is saying

226
00:36:02,974 --> 00:36:05,840
and you sieve it out.

227
00:36:07,672 --> 00:36:14,039
Now the problem of this Adi Shakti is this, 
that I decided

228
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:21,928
that I will have all of you enter into 
My body, absorb all of you.

229
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:26,215
It’s a very dangerous game I know, but 
I did play,

230
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:31,072
because I’m supposed to do at this stage 
of time,

231
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:35,018
that I should absorb you all in My body.

232
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:39,255
So with you, all your problems are also 
gone into Me,

233
00:36:39,456 --> 00:36:42,438
all your troubles also have gone into Me.

234
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:46,977
But by absorbing it, see, it’s like ocean 
into which you are put

235
00:36:47,178 --> 00:36:56,341
and you are cleansed. But what about 
the ocean?

236
00:36:56,738 --> 00:37:03,477
Ocean has got still your problems and things 
lingering and they are very troublesome.

237
00:37:03,678 --> 00:37:09,157
So the best thing would be for you 
to cleanse yourself.

238
00:37:09,403 --> 00:37:14,543
Cleansing is very important through 
introspection.

239
00:37:14,744 --> 00:37:18,009
But doesn’t mean thinking, never means 
thinking.

240
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:23,684
But introspection means meditation and that 
you all should meditate.

241
00:37:23,885 --> 00:37:28,415
I must tell you, we had a meeting 
of the leaders

242
00:37:28,616 --> 00:37:32,278
and they came out and sat in the drawing 
room.

243
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:36,986
As soon as they assembled I had such 
a severe pain in the stomach

244
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:42,902
and I had such a bad diarrhea that you 
can’t believe.

245
00:37:43,103 --> 00:37:47,731
Now, who has got those problems, I don’t 
know.

246
00:37:52,251 --> 00:37:55,287
Who has brought these problems, I don’t 
know.

247
00:37:55,488 --> 00:38:02,353
But as a Mother, as a Mother, I don’t mind 
anything,

248
00:38:02,554 --> 00:38:06,590
as long as you all get well and purified.

249
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:11,575
Just like as the Mother Earth cares for you, 
I also care for you.

250
00:38:11,776 --> 00:38:15,936
And just like as the Mother Earth loves you, 
I also love you,

251
00:38:16,137 --> 00:38:19,356
whether you are bad or good is not 
the point.

252
00:38:19,557 --> 00:38:26,474
But to be kind to Me if you could try to be 
really good Sahaja Yogis,

253
00:38:26,675 --> 00:38:32,178
not a showoffs, not business-like, not only 
thinking type,

254
00:38:32,379 --> 00:38:36,060
not argumentative, not criticizing others;

255
00:38:36,261 --> 00:38:41,049
if you just try to meditate every day ten 
to fifteen minutes,

256
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:47,021
I tell you, My health will be first class. 
Because I have taken your injections inside

257
00:38:47,222 --> 00:38:51,533
and they start torturing My life for nothing 
at all.

258
00:38:51,734 --> 00:38:57,422
See so, now, it’s a risk I have run, and 
I am sure you are all very sensible people,

259
00:38:57,623 --> 00:39:01,817
and you will understand that your Mother 
shouldn’t suffer.

260
00:39:02,018 --> 00:39:05,158
This is every-day crucifixion for Me 
sometimes you know,

261
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:11,030
and I don’t know what to say. For example, 
the other day in Delhi,

262
00:39:11,231 --> 00:39:14,929
one gentleman who is a leader, came to Me, 
to see Me,

263
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:19,430
and My one foot started going like that 
and paining so much.

264
00:39:19,597 --> 00:39:22,507
I mean I didn’t know what to tell him that, 
“You get out now,”

265
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:24,899
because I just can’t hurt him, you know.

266
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:28,979
But I said, “What’s the matter, where have 
you been, what did you do?”

267
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:34,459
And so he realized and he went out, and 
really it improved.

268
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:40,527
Nearness also, I think, has an effect, 
because if a man like that is,

269
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:45,745
or a lady like that is full of problems and 
she comes

270
00:39:45,961 --> 00:39:53,972
very much closer to My attention, then I 
have to take up the cross, it’s like this.

271
00:39:54,173 --> 00:40:00,235
A very simple understanding should be that, 
“Why are we in Sahaja Yoga?”.

272
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:07,705
We are in Sahaja Yoga to ascend, to go 
higher and higher, as you sang yesterday.

273
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:13,720
It was very entertaining yesterday the way 
you talked about your

274
00:40:13,921 --> 00:40:21,717
ambition to be higher and higher. Really 
it was very joy-giving, no doubt.

275
00:40:21,918 --> 00:40:27,999
But what are we doing about it, what are 
we trying about it, we should see.

276
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,325
Seriously we must think, are we meditating,

277
00:40:32,526 --> 00:40:37,768
are we all doing something to elevate 
others also,

278
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:41,806
to give realizations to others? Specially 
women I have seen,

279
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:46,836
don’t do much of this, which is very bad, 
because you are the mothers.

280
00:40:47,037 --> 00:40:51,255
You have to go all out to give realizations 
to others.

281
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:57,117
But men are more active that way and women 
are not. So it works the other way round.

282
00:40:57,318 --> 00:41:03,232
Now on one side the men are, I think are 
active but don’t meditate.

283
00:41:03,433 --> 00:41:08,759
Women meditate and men do the outside work, 
it’s sort of a part-time,

284
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:16,924
or you can call it a good labor division 
that, “You meditate at home

285
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:20,328
and we’ll go all out”. It’s not going 
to work out.

286
00:41:20,529 --> 00:41:27,542
So one has to meditate and one has to also 
go out

287
00:41:27,743 --> 00:41:33,037
to spread Sahaja Yoga.  Both things have 
to be done.

288
00:41:33,238 --> 00:41:39,615
Supposing now you meditate and you don’t 
spread Sahaja Yoga, you will never ascend.

289
00:41:39,816 --> 00:41:45,499
Because after all this Kundalini, you see, 
She’s a sensible woman, na,

290
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:52,660
She’s very sensible. She thinks, “Why 
should I make her a saint?

291
00:41:52,861 --> 00:41:58,171
What is the use?”. Sahaja Yoga is not 
individualistic,

292
00:41:58,372 --> 00:42:04,601
it’s not for one person to become a saint 
and sit somewhere, it’s not like that.

293
00:42:05,129 --> 00:42:09,160
It’s not meant for one person, for oneself,

294
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:13,670
it’s not individualistic. It’s a collective 
happening.

295
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:16,937
So if you are not helping to 
the collective,

296
00:42:17,138 --> 00:42:21,647
Kundalini says, “All right, you are 
all right as it is”, just like our body.

297
00:42:21,848 --> 00:42:26,099
See, in our body if one organ says, 
“All right, now I am all right,

298
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:31,004
I am not going to work out”, or one cell 
says that, “I am not going to now grow,

299
00:42:31,124 --> 00:42:35,066
it’s all right. Why should I worry about 
the whole body?”, it won’t work.

300
00:42:35,267 --> 00:42:39,780
It’s a living, it’s a living organism, 
I have told you hundred times,

301
00:42:39,981 --> 00:42:48,277
when it is a living organism it has to grow, 
it has to grow and also to absorb.

302
00:42:48,478 --> 00:42:52,254
To have energy you have to meditate and 
you have to grow.

303
00:42:52,455 --> 00:42:56,795
If you don’t grow, you are finished. You 
are no more a Sahaja Yogi.

304
00:42:56,996 --> 00:43:03,923
I wouldn’t call a person a Sahaja Yogi who 
has not even given one person realization.

305
00:43:04,403 --> 00:43:09,702
Cannot be a Sahaja Yogi, Sahaja Yogi has 
to give realizations to others.

306
00:43:09,903 --> 00:43:13,733
Apart from other activities, the main 
activity should be

307
00:43:13,934 --> 00:43:16,923
how we give realizations to others.

308
00:43:17,124 --> 00:43:22,556
Unless and until we really look after that 
side of life

309
00:43:22,757 --> 00:43:27,164
we can never, never grow in Sahaja Yoga.

310
00:43:27,742 --> 00:43:35,501
For example now, take My position. I’m 
all right, I’m complete, I have no problem.

311
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:44,142
But why did I work so hard and wanted 
so many Sahaja Yogis, why?

312
00:43:44,343 --> 00:43:48,335
What was the - I don’t have to grow either, 
I’m overgrown already.

313
00:43:48,536 --> 00:43:51,900
I don’t have to do it, but why? What is 
the need?

314
00:43:52,101 --> 00:43:56,176
The need is like this, the need is of love.

315
00:43:56,377 --> 00:44:00,477
I have so much love that I have 
to channelize it.

316
00:44:00,678 --> 00:44:05,554
If I don’t I’ll suffocate, I can’t love 
Myself.

317
00:44:05,762 --> 00:44:10,617
So this love has to spread. For that I have 
to have you people,

318
00:44:10,818 --> 00:44:14,916
who can take this love to others and make 
them happy.

319
00:44:15,117 --> 00:44:20,239
This is a kind of a vision I have,

320
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:27,832
and in this special time, it was promised 
by many people, by many saints,

321
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:34,788
and it is so obvious that you are all 
specially chosen for this kind of thing.

322
00:44:34,989 --> 00:44:40,689
Now how far you understand your importance 
is a different point.

323
00:44:45,164 --> 00:44:52,047
You do for your emancipation, all right, 
you meditate.

324
00:44:52,248 --> 00:44:59,250
But if you are not channelizing the love, 
the Divine love, what is the use?

325
00:44:59,451 --> 00:45:03,118
Now supposing I repair something very 
nicely:

326
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:08,219
I repair this machine nicely, put it right, 
everything, and I don’t speak,

327
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,697
what’s the use of having this?

328
00:45:12,229 --> 00:45:16,951
In the same way, if you work very hard, 
I know people who get up at four o’clock,

329
00:45:17,152 --> 00:45:20,194
have their baths, do meditation,

330
00:45:20,395 --> 00:45:24,916
sit down, in the night again they sit down 
for meditation.

331
00:45:25,117 --> 00:45:31,211
But they never go out, they never talk 
to others, they never spread Sahaja Yoga.

332
00:45:31,412 --> 00:45:38,901
They do not give Divine love to others, so 
how can this great problem of this world

333
00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:45,121
be solved, that it has no love? It has 
never known Divine love.

334
00:45:45,302 --> 00:45:51,255
It has to be given to them.

335
00:45:51,456 --> 00:46:00,783
They have to feel this Divine love, this 
power of Adi Shakti.

336
00:46:00,984 --> 00:46:06,045
They have to know it. Otherwise you have 
been selfish, I would say,

337
00:46:06,246 --> 00:46:12,641
that you had a nice time having all this 
and you have not given it to others.

338
00:46:12,879 --> 00:46:17,275
This is the reason why Sahaja Yoga 
sometimes fails

339
00:46:17,476 --> 00:46:22,912
to create a proper balanced personality 
in a human being.

340
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:27,187
Some people are like this, that now 
supposing

341
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:31,984
a Sahaja Yogi has married another Sahaja 
Yogi, take a position like that.

342
00:46:32,185 --> 00:46:37,558
Now My desire is that they should develop 
a complete understanding of each other,

343
00:46:37,759 --> 00:46:45,092
love for each other, but love for Sahaja 
Yoga and for others.

344
00:46:45,293 --> 00:46:53,122
This is the only way we can justify 
marriage in Sahaja Yoga,

345
00:46:53,323 --> 00:46:59,230
otherwise why should they marry? But 
doesn’t happen like that.

346
00:46:59,431 --> 00:47:05,807
What happens is once they are married then 
either they will quarrel,

347
00:47:06,008 --> 00:47:10,691
they will ask for divorce; if that doesn’t 
happen luckily,

348
00:47:10,892 --> 00:47:14,261
because in Sahaja Yoga so easy to get 
married, you know.

349
00:47:14,462 --> 00:47:20,522
If that doesn’t happen, then they start 
having their own family,

350
00:47:20,723 --> 00:47:29,065
their own homes, they are again becoming 
very small, very, very small, very limited.

351
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:33,217
Did you come to Sahaja Yoga for that?

352
00:47:34,627 --> 00:47:37,154
You have to realize your responsibility.

353
00:47:37,274 --> 00:47:42,163
See this Mother Earth, how She knows 
Her responsibility.

354
00:47:42,364 --> 00:47:48,904
She’s just made out of nothing but soil, 
some mud, but look at Her.

355
00:47:49,105 --> 00:47:55,089
How She is conscious, how She is 
particular, how She..., how She is careful.

356
00:47:55,291 --> 00:48:00,656
While you, though you have been blessed 
so much by everything

357
00:48:00,857 --> 00:48:05,728
you are, are you thinking of giving it 
to others?

358
00:48:05,929 --> 00:48:12,285
With twelve disciples, whatever was 
the problem of Christianity, I mean

359
00:48:12,486 --> 00:48:20,481
it was nothing good job, I must say, but 
still Christianity spread out.

360
00:48:21,054 --> 00:48:25,139
Islam was not a very good job either, 
it spread out.

361
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:32,281
All those bad jobs have spread out so much, 
so why not the good job of Sahaja Yoga?

362
00:48:32,482 --> 00:48:36,695
It has to spread, it has to go to various 
places.

363
00:48:36,896 --> 00:48:41,064
Try and find out where you can go and talk 
about it

364
00:48:41,265 --> 00:48:46,196
and do something good to others and help 
them somehow

365
00:48:46,397 --> 00:48:56,667
to rise above this common existence 
of misery, unhappiness and destruction.

366
00:48:56,898 --> 00:49:02,022
The time is very short and I think if you 
see the time,

367
00:49:02,223 --> 00:49:06,866
the rate at which we are moving is not 
proper.

368
00:49:07,067 --> 00:49:10,523
We have to be much faster, we have to go 
much ahead

369
00:49:10,724 --> 00:49:16,121
and we have to create much more Sahaja 
Yogis

370
00:49:16,322 --> 00:49:24,565
through our consistent, very intensive 
effort.

371
00:49:24,766 --> 00:49:30,807
But we - it’s a side issue, you see, it’s 
by the way, Sahaja Yoga is by the way.

372
00:49:31,008 --> 00:49:34,941
And this is where we are failing in our 
responsibility.

373
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:37,637
We have to learn from the Mother Earth.

374
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:43,086
You might say that, “Mataji, how can we be 
like you? After all You are Adi Shakti”.

375
00:49:43,287 --> 00:49:46,302
Many people say that. “You are Adi Shakti, 
so what,

376
00:49:46,503 --> 00:49:49,578
you see, with one finger You can move 
things like that”.

377
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:55,731
But why should I? Why should I, what 
is the need?

378
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:01,359
So in that reflection that you are Me,

379
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:06,374
in that reflection that the Mother Earth 
is Me,

380
00:50:06,575 --> 00:50:11,321
in that beautiful creation within you,

381
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:19,630
you have to become very sensitive 
to the need of the world.

382
00:50:19,912 --> 00:50:24,318
What is the need of the world? Today, 
if you fail,

383
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:29,721
the whole thing will fail forever. Only 
very few will be there.

384
00:50:29,922 --> 00:50:36,981
So the need for you is to spread Sahaja 
Yoga, because this love

385
00:50:37,182 --> 00:50:42,666
is not only for you. Is not to be enjoyed 
by you,

386
00:50:42,856 --> 00:50:50,619
but is to be enjoyed by as many possible 
in the whole world.

387
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:56,890
So today we have to decide that, as 
the children of Adi Shakti,

388
00:50:57,091 --> 00:51:02,426
we have to go all out, everywhere, every 
corner,

389
00:51:02,627 --> 00:51:12,068
we have to shout and we have to tell loudly 
what is the time in which we are living,

390
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:24,261
and what is the responsibility that you 
have to fulfill as Sahaja Yogis.

391
00:51:24,462 --> 00:51:28,471
There must be some reason why you are here.

392
00:51:28,672 --> 00:51:34,524
Like in the beginning, Sahaja Yogis used 
to ask Me, “Mother, was I this last life,

393
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:39,548
was I Shivaji last life?” I said, “What’s 
the use?

394
00:51:39,749 --> 00:51:42,962
You might have been anything, but what are 
you today is much higher”.

395
00:51:43,163 --> 00:51:47,975
Try to understand. You might be, say, 
Napoleon,

396
00:51:48,176 --> 00:51:55,067
you might be, say, one of the kings say, 
or maybe the queen from somewhere.

397
00:51:55,268 --> 00:52:00,939
So what, what did they do? Did they raise 
anybody’s Kundalini?

398
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:05,662
Did they have any power? Even the disciples 
of Christ

399
00:52:05,863 --> 00:52:11,325
or even Mohammed Sahib’s disciples, anyone 
- did they do it?

400
00:52:11,526 --> 00:52:16,373
Did they have any understanding 
of Kundalini?

401
00:52:16,574 --> 00:52:24,461
Did they have any love for others, that 
they should give them realization?

402
00:52:24,662 --> 00:52:28,449
There were some Sufis, they never gave 
realization to anyone.

403
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:32,101
There were so many saints who never gave 
realization to anybody.

404
00:52:32,302 --> 00:52:35,093
Mohammed Sahib never gave realization 
to anybody.

405
00:52:35,294 --> 00:52:39,422
Gautam Buddha never gave realization 
to anybody, think of it.

406
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:43,433
Christ never gave realization to anybody. 
Anybody.

407
00:52:43,634 --> 00:52:50,001
Krishna did not do it, Rama did not. Nobody 
- but you can do it!

408
00:52:51,645 --> 00:52:56,972
You can do it and you know everything about 
Kundalini.

409
00:52:57,173 --> 00:53:03,602
It’s a very big thing because you are 
children of the Adi Shakti.

410
00:53:03,803 --> 00:53:08,045
You are here and your Mother is here.

411
00:53:08,246 --> 00:53:15,185
It’s a very, very fortunate thing for Me 
that you are here.

412
00:53:15,386 --> 00:53:21,097
I’m very proud of you, but again and again 
I have to tell you that

413
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:27,564
the work has to be with a faster speed, 
we have to move with a faster speed

414
00:53:27,765 --> 00:53:30,846
and get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

415
00:53:31,047 --> 00:53:37,799
It is rather, rather difficult for Me to say 
something forcefully,

416
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,529
that’s not My nature you know. Can’t get 
into tempers and cannot get angry,

417
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:50,840
and I cannot forcefully say something 
to you, but if you fail,

418
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:56,573
then only thing will be that you have 
failed Me completely.

419
00:53:56,783 --> 00:54:02,078
It means that, nothing less than that, and 
if you don’t want to do it,

420
00:54:02,279 --> 00:54:07,674
then I would request all of you to take a 
vow today that you will spread Sahaja Yoga

421
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:11,273
and you will talk about Sahaja Yoga, know 
about Sahaj Yog.

422
00:54:11,474 --> 00:54:14,045
There are many who don’t know anything.

423
00:54:14,246 --> 00:54:17,946
Also it’s very surprising they are Sahaja 
Yogis, they don’t know anything.

424
00:54:18,147 --> 00:54:21,917
And don’t create problems for Me, like 
marriage:

425
00:54:22,118 --> 00:54:25,156
“We can’t now live now with the wife, 
we can’t live with the husband”.

426
00:54:25,357 --> 00:54:30,907
All sorts of nonsensical problems people 
create for Me in Sahaja Yoga.

427
00:54:31,108 --> 00:54:35,766
Are you here to create problems, or 
to remove problems of people?

428
00:54:35,967 --> 00:54:41,527
So on the whole we have done well I must 
say, but it’s not the final.

429
00:54:41,728 --> 00:54:47,753
We have to work faster with more enthusiasm 
and joyfully.

430
00:54:47,954 --> 00:54:51,963
You don’t know what joy you get when you 
give realization to somebody.

431
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:58,014
It’s the most joyful moment is when you 
give realizations to others.

432
00:54:58,215 --> 00:55:02,149
Just try, you must try once, you’ll 
enjoy it,

433
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:06,552
then you’ll want more and more and more. 
Now after Sahaja Yoga really

434
00:55:06,753 --> 00:55:12,618
the want disappears into this desire that, 
“My God, this man is going,

435
00:55:12,819 --> 00:55:14,752
should I call him and give him 
realization?”

436
00:55:14,953 --> 00:55:17,280
On the street you will feel like calling 
him, “Come here, come here,

437
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:22,459
I want to give you something”, then make 
him sit down, give realization.

438
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:27,238
This will be your style, like mad - you’ll 
say, “Oh no, no, look at this,

439
00:55:27,439 --> 00:55:32,316
this gentleman is without any realization, 
let us give him”.

440
00:55:32,517 --> 00:55:35,098
You’ll have to go to churches, you’ll have 
to go to universities,

441
00:55:35,218 --> 00:55:37,503
you have to go to all such congregations

442
00:55:37,704 --> 00:55:40,834
where they have no idea about what they 
can achieve;

443
00:55:41,035 --> 00:55:45,115
and then tell them without any fear, 
without any malice.

444
00:55:45,316 --> 00:55:47,735
You can talk to them and you should tell 
them,

445
00:55:47,936 --> 00:55:50,371
“Now we are here to help you, for your 
good.

446
00:55:50,572 --> 00:55:54,191
We have not come for our good but for your 
good, now listen to us”.

447
00:55:54,392 --> 00:56:00,480
And I am sure, very sure, that the Kundalini 
within you will be very happy.

448
00:56:00,681 --> 00:56:05,910
She is not happy you see, She is not happy 
with people who are not using her fully.

449
00:56:06,111 --> 00:56:10,839
So She will be very happy to help you and 
to do the needful

450
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,238
for the emancipation of the whole world.

451
00:56:14,373 --> 00:56:17,253
May God bless you.
