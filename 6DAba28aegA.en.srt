1
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:30,504
Today we have gathered here to do Puja to Bhairavnath.

2
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:35,557
I think we have not understood

3
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:41,205
the significance of Bhairavnath

4
00:02:41,365 --> 00:02:51,048
who runs, and up and down on the Ida Nadi.

5
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:27,934
Ida Nadi is the Nadi of Chandrama, is of the moon.

6
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:43,800
So, this is a channel for us to cool down.

7
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:58,494
So the work of Bhairavnathji is to cool us down.

8
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:08,867
For example, people have a hot temper,

9
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:13,300
with their ego, with their liver, whatever it is.

10
00:04:21,768 --> 00:04:28,787
And if a person is in a big temper,

11
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:34,799
then Bhairavnath plays tricks on that person

12
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:37,555
to cool him down.

13
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:52,904
He organises everything under his own control

14
00:04:53,064 --> 00:04:56,398
with ganas help, with Ganapati's help,

15
00:04:56,558 --> 00:05:01,424
to cool down your temperament, to give you a balance.

16
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:17,896
So, if somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

17
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:24,077
and he crosses all the limits of his temper,

18
00:05:24,237 --> 00:05:26,842
then somehow or other,

19
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:30,092
Bhairavnath will organize,

20
00:05:30,252 --> 00:05:33,369
also with the help of Hanumana,

21
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:39,769
to show that this stupidity of anger is no good.

22
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,406
So, for example, people who are depressed

23
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,201
or who become left-sided,

24
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:15,327
Hanumana tries to help them to come out of it.

25
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:21,687
No doubt, but also Bhairavnath helps them

26
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:25,806
very much more to come out of it.

27
00:06:38,212 --> 00:06:46,170
Now, a person who is left-sided cannot be collective.

28
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:54,189
It is very difficult for a person

29
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:58,074
who is very left-sided,

30
00:06:58,234 --> 00:07:03,987
who is all the time feeling very sad,

31
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:07,423
unhappy and worried,

32
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:11,628
cannot enjoy the fun of collectivity.

33
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,656
While a hot-tempered person, a right-sided person,

34
00:07:27,816 --> 00:07:30,093
does not enjoy any collectivity,

35
00:07:30,253 --> 00:07:32,746
doesn’t allow anybody to enjoy collectivity, no doubt,

36
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:37,974
but tries to be in the collective that it can assert.

37
00:07:52,476 --> 00:07:55,706
Because such a person tries to show the superiority,

38
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:57,729
is something superior.

39
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:03,193
Naturally he cannot enjoy the collective.

40
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:15,909
On the contrary, the person who is depressed,

41
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:18,056
all the time thinks,

42
00:08:18,216 --> 00:08:20,813
"Nobody loves me, nobody cares for me,

43
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:23,063
I'm so depressed,” this, that,

44
00:08:23,223 --> 00:08:26,367
all the time expecting from others something,

45
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:31,820
also cannot enjoy the collective.

46
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,892
Such a left-sided person will find

47
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:58,475
everything is something unhappy.

48
00:09:06,694 --> 00:09:09,348
Like the other day, I went to Moscow.

49
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:13,574
There was a lady with us who was a Sahaja Yogini,

50
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:17,140
left-sided Sahaja Yogini.

51
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:27,555
So, we went to have our food

52
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:32,661
and it started raining and they couldn't get a taxi,

53
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:44,485
but then a car came in and we went there.

54
00:09:48,774 --> 00:09:51,587
Then they said that

55
00:09:51,747 --> 00:09:54,875
“You are very late so you have to sit on the other side,

56
00:09:55,035 --> 00:09:59,000
you have to take the seats which were more expensive.”

57
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,121
So this lady started saying,

58
00:10:10,281 --> 00:10:15,404
"What all problems, no taxi, it is raining

59
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:18,796
and we can't get a seat."

60
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:30,699
I said, “This is all fun;

61
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:33,288
this is not something a problem.”

62
00:10:33,448 --> 00:10:37,017
This 'problema’ word should be given up.

63
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,487
This is a new word I have learned,

64
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:52,996
because 'problem' we used to use only for geometry

65
00:10:53,156 --> 00:10:55,420
in our young age.

66
00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:09,437
Now, this sort of a attitude, negative attitude,

67
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:12,386
to find everything negative

68
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:18,867
is the way we really spoil our left side.

69
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,514
But then a gentleman who had invited us came

70
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:36,241
and he said, “We are sitting on the other side waiting for you.’

71
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,677
So we went to the other side, enjoyed nice food,

72
00:11:48,837 --> 00:11:50,247
everything was fine.

73
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:52,671
I said, “See now, you were only counting

74
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:57,063
how many negative things there are,

75
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,301
and you were not seeing the fun.”

76
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:15,721
So she asked Me, "What should I do?" I said,

77
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:19,009
“You take Bhairava's name,

78
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:25,596
sit with your left hand towards the photograph

79
00:12:25,756 --> 00:12:27,483
and right hand on the Mother Earth

80
00:12:27,643 --> 00:12:31,688
and that's how all your bhoots of negativity will go away.”

81
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:41,517
So, Bhairava is, always has a light in His hand,

82
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,807
always light in His hand.

83
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:53,456
And He runs up and down

84
00:12:53,962 --> 00:13:00,746
Ida Nadi to make light for you to see that there's nothing negative.

85
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:12,604
And this negativity comes to us by many ways.

86
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:20,534
One of the negativities are that,

87
00:13:20,694 --> 00:13:24,011
"This is mine",

88
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:37,377
like, "My child, my husband, my property, my …”

89
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,653
So then, you see, once you get attached

90
00:13:44,813 --> 00:13:47,992
in this manner, what you find,

91
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:54,387
that your children also become negative.

92
00:14:00,296 --> 00:14:08,125
But if you want to be positive, it is very easy.

93
00:14:11,478 --> 00:14:16,902
And for that you should see, ‘Where is your attention?”

94
00:14:20,262 --> 00:14:22,837
Are you only seeing problema

95
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:27,172
or you are seeing some fun in it?

96
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,143
There are people who cannot make fun out of anything.

97
00:14:44,295 --> 00:14:50,569
If it’s a sunny day they’ll cry, "Oh God, what a sunny day!"

98
00:14:55,513 --> 00:15:00,084
and if it is a day with clouds they will say,

99
00:15:00,244 --> 00:15:02,316
"Oh, what a day!"

100
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:09,241
Nothing can please them.

101
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:16,704
But to enjoy the positivity in every negativity

102
00:15:16,864 --> 00:15:20,429
is the capacity of a Sahaja Yogi.

103
00:15:27,712 --> 00:15:34,280
The negativity doesn't exist - it's an ignorance.

104
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:40,433
Also, it’s not ignorance, because ignorance also doesn't exist.

105
00:15:40,593 --> 00:15:43,791
If everything is the All-Pervading Power,

106
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:48,107
then how can there be ignorance?

107
00:15:54,007 --> 00:16:00,451
But supposing, in the folds of this power,

108
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:02,888
if you hide, run away,

109
00:16:03,048 --> 00:16:07,275
you will say that there is negativity.

110
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:16,764
Like, you hide yourself in a cave,

111
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:22,329
close it properly, and say that there is no sun.

112
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:31,718
So those people who cannot become collective,

113
00:16:31,878 --> 00:16:37,814
are either right-sided or left- sided but more left-sided.

114
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:52,400
But left- sided people can be collective in negativity.

115
00:16:57,152 --> 00:17:01,284
They say there is a very big fraternity of bhoots.

116
00:17:03,697 --> 00:17:10,138
Ah, you see some drunkards sitting together.

117
00:17:13,214 --> 00:17:18,361
They are saying, "See there's so many problem, ecological problem."

118
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:20,660
They are drunkards, all drunk,

119
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,666
and "There are problems of so other kinds.

120
00:17:24,826 --> 00:17:28,891
When will this end?"

121
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,835
So the another one says, "Wait, wait, wait.

122
00:17:40,995 --> 00:17:46,084
I've heard that the whole world is going to collapse very soon."

123
00:17:56,186 --> 00:17:57,522
Then the third one says,

124
00:17:57,682 --> 00:18:01,956
"Thank God! We are going to be collapsed, finished."

125
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:11,459
Then fourth one says, "But what will happen to our pubs?"

126
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:22,069
They say, "It's all right. If we are not existing, what does it matter?"

127
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:31,225
That's how the fraternity of the bhoots act.

128
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:35,315
They cannot see fun at all,

129
00:18:35,383 --> 00:18:38,668
they cannot enjoy at all,

130
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:44,511
and they become very,

131
00:18:44,615 --> 00:18:47,085
sort of think they are very meditative,

132
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:51,051
they are some higher people, they are something superior

133
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:54,181
in negativity.

134
00:19:06,203 --> 00:19:11,302
But, end of these people is that they become lunatics,

135
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:19,863
while the end of the right-sided - they become idiotic.

136
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:27,793
Once I went to a lunatic asylum,

137
00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:33,435
and while going there I met a lady,

138
00:19:33,595 --> 00:19:36,303
and she was quite all right, I mean,

139
00:19:36,463 --> 00:19:38,828
I thought she was a quite all right woman,

140
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:42,212
so I started talking to her.

141
00:19:49,895 --> 00:19:51,904
And she started talking very wisely,

142
00:19:52,064 --> 00:19:54,443
"See, my brother- in- law is there, and

143
00:19:54,603 --> 00:19:57,922
isn't it necessary that he should be helped,

144
00:19:58,082 --> 00:19:59,789
and we should not do this, that..."

145
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:04,046
All kinds of things she was telling Me,

146
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:15,177
showing Me, as if she was very nice and kind

147
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:18,794
and no one loves her.

148
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:28,788
And she said, “I'm very insecure” and this and that.

149
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:36,316
Suddenly the doctor came in

150
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:40,327
and she started abusing him, shouting at him.

151
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:43,673
I said, “What's this?”

152
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:53,111
So the doctor sent for people that,

153
00:20:53,271 --> 00:20:54,820
"Catch hold of this woman!"

154
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,154
He told Me, “She's the most violent lunatic

155
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:08,297
and why are You talking to her?”

156
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:14,821
I did have a headache but I didn't know she was a lunatic.

157
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,705
Maybe in My presence, as bhoot might have little bit

158
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,923
run away and were playing tricks,

159
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:28,652
but you can see that, clearly.

160
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:37,149
So, this emotional attachment is too much,

161
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:41,199
and to emotionally, to worry about somebody, that

162
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:45,877
you see, “This is my child, this is my this thing,

163
00:21:46,037 --> 00:21:47,713
this is this and this is that,”

164
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,521
and all the time wasting your precious life

165
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:55,812
in these things is not the way a Sahaja Yogi should live.

166
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,058
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot become collective,

167
00:22:09,218 --> 00:22:12,998
then know that he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

168
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:21,155
So, one has to know that

169
00:22:21,315 --> 00:22:25,502
this is the work of Bhairavnath within us.

170
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:32,521
Another work that He gives us light in darkness is that,

171
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:39,821
that He, He destroys all the bhoots within us.

172
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:49,281
And all kinds of bhootish ideas

173
00:22:50,806 --> 00:22:55,560
and funny ideas about attachments

174
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:02,332
and also the depressiveness.

175
00:23:03,987 --> 00:23:05,542
So, today we are, I am very happy

176
00:23:05,702 --> 00:23:09,442
that we are worshipping Shri Bhairava

177
00:23:09,602 --> 00:23:14,970
because He is very much connected with Ganesha.

178
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:24,360
As you know Shri Ganesha is at the Mooladhara

179
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,629
and while Bhairava moves onto the left side

180
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:32,813
and goes to the right side.

181
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:43,725
So, all kinds of conditionings, all kinds of habits,

182
00:23:43,885 --> 00:23:50,578
can be conquered through the help of Bhairavnath.

183
00:23:58,168 --> 00:24:03,305
In Nepal we have a very huge, big Bhairavnath statue

184
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:07,366
which is really Swayambhu.

185
00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:13,644
And people are more left-sided,

186
00:24:13,804 --> 00:24:17,370
so they are afraid of Bhairavnath.

187
00:24:21,449 --> 00:24:25,334
So, if somebody has a bad habit, say, of stealing,

188
00:24:25,494 --> 00:24:28,201
they take him to the, to in front of Bhairavnath

189
00:24:28,361 --> 00:24:33,746
and put His light there, make a flame.

190
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,578
I mean, the police takes them,

191
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:51,070
and then they ask them, "Now, say before Bhairavnath, confess it."

192
00:24:56,393 --> 00:25:01,459
And they confess what wrong they have done.

193
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:11,311
So, He protect us, also from doing wrong things,

194
00:25:11,418 --> 00:25:14,972
sly things like thieving.

195
00:25:22,445 --> 00:25:25,507
Whatever we think we can do secretly, can be hidden,

196
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:29,900
but you cannot hide it from Bhairavnath.

197
00:25:36,232 --> 00:25:41,310
If you don't change, then He exposes you completely.

198
00:25:43,974 --> 00:25:49,858
That's how He has exposed  all the horrible false gurus.

199
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:57,779
So, today we are here to worship

200
00:25:57,939 --> 00:26:00,381
this great Deity of Bhiaravnatha

201
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:05,114
who incarnated on this earth later on,

202
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:16,581
ultimately as Mahavira also.

203
00:26:17,715 --> 00:26:22,473
So, He stands on the gate of hell

204
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:29,519
and stops people from falling into hell.

205
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:36,441
But if you want to go to hell,

206
00:26:36,601 --> 00:26:39,729
if it is your desire, is your willpower like that working,

207
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,436
that I should go to hell,then He says,

208
00:26:41,596 --> 00:26:45,485
‘All right, you can go.’

209
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:58,196
But as you know, now the hell is also full of people,

210
00:27:02,015 --> 00:27:08,097
so is better that we should try to fight our negativity

211
00:27:08,257 --> 00:27:15,161
and become fun-loving, enjoying others, loving others,

212
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,482
not worrying about what others are doing to you,

213
00:27:31,642 --> 00:27:36,906
but only thinking what good you can do to others.

214
00:27:45,936 --> 00:27:53,388
So today's special Puja for Bhairavnath we offer,

215
00:27:56,421 --> 00:28:03,551
to give us a sense to laugh, to enjoy, to have fun.

216
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:15,679
May God bless you all.
