TC BC 2017-0317

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,179
So first of all we’ll start talking about energies.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,900
These energies are moving

6
00:00:20,586 --> 00:00:23,779
within us and how they activate

7
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,180
and we’ll talk about the third energy

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,380
which is the one which has evolved us

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,580
and that’s how we are here.

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,820
And we’ll talk about your Self, the controlling part,

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,899
which is controlling you, the Spirit.

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,740
So if you go on an abstract line,

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,460
it will be very appealing [?]  with it.

14
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:57,780
Then afterwards, you see,

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,320
when we have talked about energies, this, that,

16
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:02,540
once the people- that is within you- you see,

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,500
sort of they’ll feel ego, this ego: “we have these energies

18
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,540
we can utilize these energies, do this, do that”

19
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,602
and then you’ll bring them down to Sahaja Yoga, later on.

20
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:15,660
But to begin with, better talk of abstract.

21
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:20,020
Because Indians are different, Western people are different,

22
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,779
they are fed up of religion, they are fed up of all this.

23
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:30,860
So if you talk of religion, it gives, creates a problem.

24
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,180
That’s why in the beginning, you see, Vedas, they were written down.

25
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,580
They didn’t talk of God or Deities at all.

26
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,660
They talked about God, God the Creator,

27
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,340
but just about Brahmadeva,

28
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,940
throughout Hiranyagarbha, Brahmadeva, right side they talked, you see.

29
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,779
And the all thing is said, mantra is like :

30
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:58,980
“Bhur, Bhuvah, swaha”. 3 things. Now, Bhur is actually

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:05,580
the Mooladhara, is the earth upper it, the Mooladhara.

32
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,860
Mooladhara chakra and Mooladhara itself.

33
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,060
Then Bhuvah. Bhuvah is the one which is called the antariksha

34
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,779
[atmosphere, intermediate space], is the one which is all created,

35
00:02:16,899 --> 00:02:20,620
in talks of Brahmadeva.

36
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,580
Then swaha. Swaha is capacity to burn out,

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,820
of the agny [fire] you see?

38
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,780
It is so surprising and then they talk of mahatapa,

39
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:44,820
tapaha and maha. “Bhur, Bhuvah, swaha, maha tapa”.

40
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,779
So when they talk of swaha, they talk of maha.

41
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:58,620
Maha is what you call the great, Allah Hou Akbar, and of tapa.

42
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,380
Tapa is the one where you have to become a tapasuy,

43
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,780
means a person who is going into penance, that of Christ.

44
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,540
And they say that you have to penetrate through the Surya,

45
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,023
that is this. And the all thing is such an obstacle,

46
00:03:21,144 --> 00:03:23,038
and then you get your moksha.

47
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,260
So they have talked of all the chakras.

48
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,660
But if you talk about the abstract part of it,

49
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,860
people have no objection, they listen to it,

50
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,820
listen as [inaudible] there’s no religion as such.

51
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:46,020
Today specially I'm talking about the Vedas

52
00:03:46,899 --> 00:03:50,660
and these havanas we do.

53
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,940
When we do the havana it is a Yagnya.

54
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,460
Yagnya means "by which you know". ‘nya’ means to know. Yagna.

55
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:10,420
And this is done where you use 'Svaha' as the word.

56
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:18,780
That means you use the principle of fire

57
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:25,340
to burn off all that is wrong in you, 'Svaha'.

58
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,300
And you awaken it by taking the different names of the God.

59
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,220
And it started at the time of Rama.

60
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,540
Today is Ram Navami.

61
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:41,100
I should say it was not started, we should say,

62
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,220
but it was very much invoked when Rama lived

63
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,300
and they used to do Yagnyas at that time.

64
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:54,740
The reason was, the people had just started realizing

65
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,980
that there is something higher

66
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,300
and you have to worship that higher Self, the seers said,

67
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,900
and they thought that the best thing is to do Yagnyas.

68
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,100
On the left side, of course, the people started the worship of God

69
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,779
and the dedication to God and all those things,

70
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:21,779
that is Bhakti , but mainly what they did

71
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:28,180
before Rama was the Yagnyas, the Vedas,

72
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,779
with which they prayed to different elements

73
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,779
- elements have made our chakras –

74
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:39,020
and tried to evoke the deities of the Elements.

75
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,899
But actually it amounts to the same.

76
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:56,540
So as a child, Rama was studying with a very great saint,

77
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,899
and when he was studying with him,

78
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,180
Vashishta was the name of the great saint.

79
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:16,779
And Vashishta had an ashram where Rama and his brothers studied.

80
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:19,500
Shri Mataji to a lady: come along, come in, come forward.

81
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,779
Give her a chair to sit down. Can you, is there a seat here?

82
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:28,340
I think Gavin can go, lots of seats are there.

83
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:49,140
Rama was studying with this Vashishta

84
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:54,340
and they used to come for holidays to father's place.

85
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:04,860
Then, he had the capacity to kill a demon with only one arrow.

86
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,780
It’s called as ekabani. One arrow was sufficient of Sri Rama.

87
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,220
And he was a small little child, say about seven, eight years of age.

88
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,899
And people were surprised how he could do it.

89
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,140
So whenever they had a yagnya

90
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:27,620
– now these yagnyas were created to awaken, evoke, the Deities

91
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,260
inside the spinal chord – actually.

92
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,820
And for these yagnyas they used to sit down

93
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,300
and do all these havanas the way we do it.

94
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,620
But at that time, the rakshasas would come and try to spoil the yagnyas,

95
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,900
because yagnyas are to be done with pure heart

96
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,540
and with cleanliness and with purity, it should not be insulted,

97
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,780
there’s a protocol about it.

98
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,779
While they thought that, “If we insult the Deities there,

99
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:02,779
then the Deities will disappear and their yagnyas will be spoiled.”

100
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:08,780
Now these yagnyas were done, in the olden times even, even when

101
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,380
Rama was not here. But at the time of Rama also,

102
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,540
there were some rakshasas

103
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:21,220
who took a special pleasure in spoiling these yagnyas

104
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:27,580
and Rama as a child would go and protect them from the demons.

105
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,779
And the demons would take some sort of a funny form

106
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:39,940
and come like invisible creatures and put some bones

107
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,779
of animals and things like that in the yagnya.

108
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:48,180
And that would spoil the effects of the yagnya.

109
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,580
And Rama would protect that, as a child.

110
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,460
Imagine, as a child he used to do that!

111
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,779
They would be doing the yagnya and he would be sitting outside

112
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:02,460
with all his small brothers around him

113
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,300
and they would kill the demons who would try to destroy the yagnyas.

114
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:14,820
This is the early life of Rama in which you see

115
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:24,220
how, as a child also, he showed an amount of

116
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,779
expertise, you can say, in arrow and bow.

117
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:37,900
So any time you see a statue

118
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,900
– how to make out a Shri Rama’s statue, is to see if there’s an arrow

119
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,660
and a bow, then its a Rama’s statue.

120
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:58,780
Now his coming on this Earth,   gave us the development of the Right Side

121
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,580
and so the yagnyas were also on the Right Side.

122
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,620
Because first of all when human beings came on this Earth,

123
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,980
they were frightened of all the animals who would invade them

124
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,540
and all kinds of horrible rakshasas and all those people,

125
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,020
and negative forces they would trouble them.

126
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:25,780
So, in that state they needed to create a king, a ruler,

127
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:31,700
who was an ideal king and he would rule according to the laws of dharma.

128
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:38,100
So He was the one in charge of that era,

129
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,620
what we call as Satya Yuga you can say, but actually,

130
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,660
He was here in Treta Yuga.

131
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,740
That’s the time when He as here, that’s Treta Yuga,

132
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,060
and Krishna came at the lime of Dwapar Yuga.

133
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:01,779
And today is the time, when I came it was Kali Yuga.

134
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:05,940
But now, today, the time is of Krita Yuga,

135
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,779
the Yuga where work will be done: ‘Krita’ means, “work will be done”.

136
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:14,779
This is the time where work will be done.

137
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:17,340
So how things have moved from one to another?

138
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,940
Now in the Dwapar Yuga when Shri Rama came,

139
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:30,540
the idea of kingship and rulership started.

140
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:43,100
So the greatest emphasis was on the goodwill of the people.

141
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:47,740
The people had to have goodwill:

142
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:57,700
for the people and for the king, and for the betterment of humanity.

143
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,779
The will, that is the Right Side.

144
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,220
So how to create the goodwill in people?

145
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:11,060
First the leader has to sacrifice and show how far he can go

146
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:17,420
in sacrificing to keep the moral and the goodwill of the people.

147
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,460
So the Right Side was created by the advent of Shri Rama

148
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:30,900
because he showed a path of creating among people the awareness

149
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:37,980
that they should be ruled, that they should not be anarchist,

150
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,700
there should be one head who should be able

151
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:48,660
to organize, co-ordinate and work out a collective thing.

152
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,980
You see, when we think of a king we want to oust him

153
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,899
because we don’t like the idea of being ruled someone.

154
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,060
Because he’s not a good king perhaps, o

155
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,779
or he doesn’t represent that will of the people

156
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:14,779
which is a common will which creates this king

157
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:19,180
who rules for the maintenance of that goodwill.

158
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,260
It is a symbolic expression of your goodwill.

159
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:28,180
So when you create a law, it is also the expression,

160
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,420
common expression, of all the common people,

161
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,420
of the common feeling that they should abide with law.

162
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:44,500
It doesn’t come to you that you are a slave,

163
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,779
or you are to be dominated, or you have to be put down,

164
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:51,779
but it is only your common will, which is good.

165
00:13:51,899 --> 00:14:01,899
The desire of all the people which is the good, righteousness,

166
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:10,020
incarnates as Shri Rama and He looks after that will.

167
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,940
Because, supposing an individual may start saying that,

168
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,899
“This is not good,” “This is not good.”

169
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,779
An individual might take a different attitude about things.

170
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:24,020
But you must have some symbol of that goodness

171
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,899
placed onto someone.

172
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:35,860
And those symbols were created to symbolize your righteousness,

173
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,220
your sense of good, so that you can be saved yourself!

174
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:46,899
Supposing, today, somebody comes and hits you. Alright?

175
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,540
Now you can feel how bad it is

176
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,580
to be hit by someone or murdered by someone,

177
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,900
so you decide there should be a law protecting you.

178
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,020
But tomorrow you may do the same thing.

179
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,980
So what you do is to take out your goodwill,

180
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:11,899
represent it as the kingdom or a king or a governing body.

181
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:18,340
So, the government as it is represents,

182
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,980
should represent, also – in both ways.

183
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,779
It’s not that it always represents.

184
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:27,300
It may not at all represent, may not, possibly.

185
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:32,980
But, that the government itself should represent the good in you,

186
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:38,820
the purity in you, the pure will to be good, to be protected.

187
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:45,380
And that you also should abide by it. It’s a very mutual thing.

188
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,060
But what happens that, once you start electing someone like that,

189
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,500
or making someone like that, or appointing someone like that,

190
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,140
as usual, he goes into an ego trip.

191
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:01,460
[It’s] a simple thing like that. It’s absolutely a simple ego trip.

192
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,140
The government gets into an ego trip,

193
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:09,620
people get amazed how people behave.

194
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,020
They’ll elect, supposing, a Prime Minister

195
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,791
and suddenly you find the Prime Minister behaves like a brute

196
00:16:16,912 --> 00:16:19,227
and you can’t understand – “We have elected somebody

197
00:16:19,348 --> 00:16:22,300
like a Prime Minister thinking that he will do the good to us.”

198
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,779
You see. It’s possible.

199
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:29,060
And then the revolutions take place while people revolt, fight it out.

200
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,460
Again the will of the people fights it and makes it alright.

201
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,660
So we have to have something absolute

202
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:48,740
because all these values are changing every moment.

203
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,060
Isn’t it? We think that this government did not do so well

204
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,380
– for example, we think like that –

205
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,291
so we want to demolish this government.

206
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:58,260
Then we bring another one and we find the same thing happening.

207
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:04,779
See, whether you bring a communist or you bring a socialist

208
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:09,220
or you bring a democrat or you have a monarchy,

209
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,980
whatever you may have!

210
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,660
But still, what happens actually is that,

211
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:20,020
all these things that come up and go away…

212
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:26,100
(aside: Gavin come here. Can you move forward a little bit so that everybody can be seated?)

213
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,899
All these changes that take place

214
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:39,580
go on creating a feeling in a man that we should be anarchist.

215
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:45,580
Why should we have any government? Why should we have any king?

216
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,940
Why should [we] be ruled by anyone?

217
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:53,899
Because you find the person who’s ruling is not up to the mark

218
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,900
and he is just trying to deceive you.

219
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:03,140
At that point you have to have some absolute standards.

220
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,900
If you have an absolute standard then you can always judge

221
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,220
that this king is deviating from the right path,

222
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,700
is not doing what a king should do.

223
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,500
A king has to be like Rama. He has to be like Rama.

224
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,260
Representing your will, your goodwill,

225
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:33,020
your sense of proper judgement, fair play and righteousness.

226
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,300
If the king is not righteous

227
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:41,500
then your collective goodwill will go against the king.

228
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,580
Now you go and throwing one from another.

229
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,580
Say, I’ve seen now for example in France:

230
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,500
We had one kind of a Prime Minister.

231
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,740
He did lots of things which were not good so he was thrown away.

232
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,779
So you had another one kind of one.

233
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:00,500
Now he’s doing another thing, so he’s going to be thrown away.

234
00:19:00,621 --> 00:19:02,779
And we are just going, playing games you see.

235
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:06,020
First of all we have say, Labour Government. We don’t like it.

236
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,580
So then we have another Government, Conservative Government.

237
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,540
We don’t like it. Throw it away! Go on playing with it all the time.

238
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,020
But in this relativity we are improving – definitely.

239
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:22,779
We are more aware, understanding the value of these people,

240
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:25,780
and also the public is understanding.

241
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:34,540
But then when too many such people come in who are negative,

242
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,899
they also bring down the will, the collective will, very low.

243
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:47,900
And people start identifying themselves with these autocrats

244
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:54,700
or those people who are ego-orientated, who have no moral values,

245
00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:05,020
who have no fear of God, who deny religion,

246
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,820
who deny evolution

247
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,460
and the Government starts behaving in such a manner

248
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,780
that you are amazed – how this is the Government?

249
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,700
Like in Chile and Argentina, the way the Government is behaving

250
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,100
and is putting down the people.

251
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,180
All these things are happening. You don’t know.

252
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,380
It’s such a relative terminology.

253
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,620
Like El Salvador, you don’t know what to do over there now

254
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,779
– whom to support. Whether to support the Americans,

255
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,940
or to support the Russians and all that.

256
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,980
Now, under these circumstances a Sahaja Yogi can stand and say,

257
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,100
“Now, what to do? Should we join this or that?”

258
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,340
All is a wasteful thing. It’s just a game going on.

259
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,860
Let them break their heads. They are good for nothing. Useless people.

260
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,220
So you cannot solve these problems

261
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,460
and you are not supposed to solve them.

262
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,180
They must get their Realisation and establish the Kingdom of God.

263
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:10,779
So [that] really Rama rules on this Earth

264
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:14,700
and not these horrible kings who change their morality every day,

265
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,779
who change their ideas every day,

266
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:22,300
those whose will is sometimes for something materialistic.

267
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,380
Like I would say now in our country (UK)

268
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,660
we thought that we’ll have Mrs. Thatcher.

269
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,620
Good, very good, she’s coming up well I should say,

270
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,220
certain good things she is saying, like self-restraint and all that,

271
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,300
those things she’s talking good things.

272
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,180
But what about herself following this!

273
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:45,020
Shri Rama, not only propounded what was good but he followed that.

274
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,860
He sacrificed for that and he established his own symbol

275
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,779
as a pure symbol of that righteous will,

276
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:59,020
that is within the people, which is the collective righteous will.

277
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,940
Now, for example, you can see clearly

278
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,900
how the ego oriented things work out, first of all,

279
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,220
by the misidentifications we can have.

280
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,330
Now if you are a communist, you have to be out and out communist!

281
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:13,900
You cannot have compromise between democratic methods and communism.

282
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,289
They can’t find any integration.

283
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,180
They think  if you have to be this you have to be absolutely this.

284
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,779
If you have to be that it has to be absolutely that.

285
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:26,500
But, in Sahaja Yoga, what you find is both are integrated

286
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,540
because you have the complete capital and have now to distribute it.

287
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,700
This is a complete integration here.

288
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,180
All these ‘isms’ and all that are experiments of the artificial,

289
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,580
of the mind, just a projection of the mind,

290
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,860
which is, whatever [is] man-made is artificial, you know that.

291
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,780
But what is God made is all integrated.

292
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:57,580
That, whatever you have within yourself, you must give it to others.

293
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,580
Now see for administration also, what happens after Sahaja Yoga.

294
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,340
Say, I am your Mother, here, sitting down.

295
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:13,620
You like me to guide you. You like me to govern you.

296
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,540
You like me to correct you, you like me to scold you

297
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:24,620
and to even go to a great extend to see that your life improves.

298
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,230
Supposing I say, “Alright, I give up. I don’t want to trouble you!”

299
00:23:28,351 --> 00:23:31,260
You will not like. None of you will like such a situation

300
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,300
where I say, “Alright you are a gone case,

301
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,260
I have nothing to do. You get out.”

302
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,779
Nobody will like such a situation. You want me to govern you.

303
00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:43,060
You want me to look after you. You like that.

304
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,980
Automatically you have started liking it.

305
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:50,620
There’s no domination, but you want my domination.

306
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,540
You want me to dominate you.

307
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,500
You want that all my desire should be dominated – automatically.

308
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,660
Why you feel that, “It is alright, it is very good

309
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,660
if Mother takes interest in me, corrects me. It’s a privilege”?

310
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,100
Why do you think like that?

311
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:13,740
Because by that there is a general good created.

312
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,779
It’s a general good created in you.

313
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:19,779
Because you have become integrated.

314
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:29,620
Your body, your mind and your soul, all of them think the same way.

315
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,460
They all want the same. There’s no difference.

316
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,779
Once there is integration

317
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:38,980
you will find that Sahaja Yoga is the easiest way to live it.

318
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,340
But if there is not, then it is no.

319
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,779
For example, if you are a lazy person, say for example,

320
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:47,380
or you are a very hot-tempered person

321
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:54,820
or you are a sort of a dual person,

322
00:24:55,899 --> 00:25:00,380
or you are playing tricks with yourself, you are playing games,

323
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,900
then you won’t like Sahaja Yoga.

324
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,980
As long as these situations are in you,

325
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,540
you will not like Sahaja Yoga.

326
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:15,380
But once this situation is overcome, then you will like it

327
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,740
because then you will know that whatever is good for your Spirit

328
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:27,220
is for the well-being of you all and of all the people.

329
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,300
Once this well-being comes in,

330
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:35,420
everyone feels absolutely nourished and fresh.

331
00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:43,899
So the governing part is enjoyable.

332
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,779
The correction part is even more enjoyable.

333
00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:52,660
And that you are in the attention of your Mother

334
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,100
is such a great feeling within yourself that,

335
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,899
“Yes. No, nothing will go wrong with me. She’ll look after me.”

336
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,220
“She’s there to look after me.”

337
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:08,580
But this integration part comes very late because of ego problems.

338
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,500
You have built up egos because of

339
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,540
wrong type of people administering you.

340
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,020
From your childhood you might have had bad parents

341
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,580
who never talked of God, of good things of life.

342
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,779
They themselves did not lead a life of sacrifice.

343
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:28,620
Very self indulgent parents can create a problem like that.

344
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,700
They never gave you the right type of life,

345
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,779
a proper value system which should have been there.

346
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:39,779
They never educated how to enjoy righteousness, virtues, in life.

347
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:43,420
Possibly, later on, the country in which you are born,

348
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,060
the other people who surround you also might have done that.

349
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:51,779
Also, your government, whichever you have known, must have done that.

350
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:56,820
So when these things change, when you find that you have achieved

351
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,420
that kind of integration within you:

352
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:04,740
that whatever your body likes is good for your Spirit also.

353
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,779
Like say for example, I don’t like certain things myself.

354
00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:12,430
I don’t like drinks, I don’t like it.

355
00:27:12,551 --> 00:27:14,779
I just don’t like it. Nobody can tempt me.

356
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,779
I mean, no question of temptation, I just don’t like.

357
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:21,260
I will hate the things which are really bad for my Spirit

358
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,140
– automatically. I don’t have to tell myself, it’s just there.

359
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:32,060
To tell lies I don’t like because it harms me there. I don’t like it.

360
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,860
Whatever is good for your Spirit will automatically work out

361
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,220
as soon as this integration takes place

362
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,667
and this is the work of Sahaja Yoga today.

363
00:27:40,788 --> 00:27:44,300
That’s why I said it is Krita Yuga, is to be done.

364
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:49,700
And this integration must be achieved within ourselves.

365
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:54,500
So sometimes you have to make your body come to this level.

366
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,380
Maybe you are under the influence of some bhoots

367
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,899
your body doesn’t help you.

368
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,700
Little bit of tapasvita, or penance,

369
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,900
is needed after Sahaja Yoga to make this possible.

370
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:12,899
And then once you start enjoying it then you like it.

371
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,460
Like driving a car – in the beginning it’s difficult.

372
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,860
Or swimming, anything,

373
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,700
when you try to do it’s rather difficult in the beginning.

374
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,627
If I say, “You forget it now, whatever

375
00:28:22,748 --> 00:28:24,779
you have done in the past you forget it now

376
00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:27,166
get to the new things now. You have to do it.”

377
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:34,580
So you have to put your mind to it with all your full zest.

378
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,300
That, “Alright, if my body’s not helping me – alright –

379
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,500
then I’ll try to improve the body because I’m not the body.”

380
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:45,820
“If my mind is not helping me, I must improve my mind.

381
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:51,340
If my intellect is standing in the way

382
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,580
I’ll have to put my intellect right

383
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,260
because after all I have to be integrated.

384
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,740
If I am not integrated I’m not going to enjoy anything

385
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,779
nor am I going to do anything good to myself or to others.

386
00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:07,540
So why am I here? Why am I trying to destroy myself?”

387
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,779
But when you are disintegrated, you will be surprised.

388
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:14,540
your one action will destroy your second action

389
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,620
and second action will destroy third action

390
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,100
– when you are disintegrated.

391
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,060
I’ll give you an example: Supposing now I am sitting here

392
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,779
and somebody tells me that this will burn you.

393
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:32,140
This is my own maya. But the body wants to burn itself.

394
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,020
It says, “No, alright, don’t listen to this, just burn itself.”

395
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,460
Now, when I say this it sounds absurd.

396
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:42,740
But, say, the mind says you should not take to alcohol,

397
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:49,020
but still you’ll go to the pub, then you are disintegrated.

398
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:52,779
Gradually once you start listening to your body too much,

399
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:55,779
your mind just gives in. It just gives in.

400
00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:59,020
In every thing that you do, if you are integrated,

401
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:04,140
you will be amazed that you will really become dynamic.

402
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,940
Integration is nothing but your complete connection with your Spirit.

403
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,220
The Spirit starts flowing into it.

404
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,779
In every walk of life you will be amazed how dynamic you’ll become

405
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:18,740
if you are integrated.

406
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:27,779
Just the connection is to be absolutely achieved with your Spirit.

407
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:29,580
Whenever you think of something,

408
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,899
“Is it good for my Spirit?”

409
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:39,980
Some people have a habit of thinking that spiritual life is such

410
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,540
that you hang by the shoestring somewhere, in the air

411
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,980
and there is no connection to the day to day life.

412
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,779
So many people think like that.

413
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:53,940
They think such a man should be a thin, miserable creature

414
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,620
hanging onto some tree or something

415
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:06,779
and should be absolutely in a paranoid state or something.

416
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:09,500
That he is frightened of the whole world;

417
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,340
who cannot talk to anyone,

418
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:16,740
who is so much exclusive that he becomes a recluse.

419
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,779
These absurd ideas should to be given up by Sahaja Yogis.

420
00:31:20,899 --> 00:31:26,060
You have to be very much there, absolutely there between all of them.

421
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,779
But something: you should be rare, a different type,

422
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:30,820
a unique personality.

423
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:34,540
You are to be there with all these things that are going on.

424
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,779
Now people are frightened, you know, even of Sahaja Yogis.

425
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:40,860
They are frightened of Sahaja Yogis.

426
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,300
[If] they see somebody negative, they [say],

427
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:47,460
“Oh, this thing, that thing.” Now take a fight with that person.

428
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:52,060
Take a fight. “How could you dare to do this, such a thing?

429
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,980
You are a Sahaja Yogi! Come up! What do you mean by this?”

430
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,060
You have to fight it out.

431
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,340
As long as possible you should try to salvage a person,

432
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,620
talk to him in that manner.

433
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:08,580
The other side of it is that when you talk to others,

434
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,779
when they come to you, then there has to be a kind

435
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:18,780
of a tremendous sincerity within you.

436
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:21,779
If you are doing with that sincerity

437
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:24,031
people will know you are doing with sincerity.

438
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:27,540
When you talk to a person they should know there’s sincerity

439
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,300
your heart is there.

440
00:32:31,053 --> 00:32:33,573
For example, you may talk to that person very sweetly,

441
00:32:33,694 --> 00:32:36,316
but your heart may not be there and the person might think,

442
00:32:36,437 --> 00:32:38,758
“Oh, he’s just seeking elections.”

443
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,500
Alright? But if you talk to someone with the sincerity you’ll say,

444
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:46,779
“How could you do such a thing? Can’t you see yourself?

445
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:51,140
Can’t you work it out? That’s what it is. You are here for that.”

446
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:57,700
Now in saying so, your sincerity, which is coming from your heart,

447
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:03,700
is to be seen, and that’s what is Shri Rama’s character is:

448
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,060
that he was on the right side of the heart,

449
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:10,420
means the heart put to activity.

450
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,460
Do you understand that, where Kabira has said,

451
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,060
“Mana mamata ko thira kara Lau.”

452
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:28,700
“I will make my compassion of my heart – mana – from my heart,

453
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,300
the compassion, make it steady. “aur pancha hi tattva milau,”

454
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,620
“and put them into five elements.”

455
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,779
You see, in the same way, when you are in the left heart,

456
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:44,020
that’s your sincerity. It’s your heart-felt thing.

457
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,260
But the heartfelt thing, what’s the use?

458
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,060
You see, there are many Sahaja Yogis who really feel,

459
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:52,020
this world is horrible and something must be done,

460
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,140
Sahaja Yoga must be brought in.

461
00:33:54,260 --> 00:34:00,340
But how many of you are really putting that to action?

462
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,899
Absolutely into action?

463
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:10,980
Without that, your Rama’s tattwa cannot be improved.

464
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,940
Rama’s tattwa is only improved when

465
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:19,420
you put all the things into action that exactly Shri Rama did.

466
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,460
So in the ascent of man, when he came up to Rama’s place,

467
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,900
the advent of Rama was not in the centre, but on the right-hand side.

468
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:32,779
He moved aside. So much so, that he forgot about his past.

469
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:36,779
He’s never mentioned that He’s an incarnation.

470
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:39,500
He never told His father. He never told his mother.

471
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,980
He never told anybody that He was an incarnation.

472
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,540
Of course it was evident that he was.

473
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:53,300
His brother knew about it. Now he had two brothers.

474
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,500
Very interesting. I mean he had other brothers also,

475
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,500
but Bharat and another was Lakshmana.

476
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,540
These two brothers were with him.

477
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,060
Now they show the two sides of a human being.

478
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:09,740
One was Lakshmana and he was that fiery type, you see.

479
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,779
He couldn’t bear anybody misbehaving towards Rama.

480
00:35:13,899 --> 00:35:19,779
He couldn’t bear anybody talking in a very mundane type to Shri Rama.

481
00:35:19,899 --> 00:35:23,980
And he used to get so angry with all these people

482
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,300
that he would just come out like a big thunderbolt

483
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:33,420
on anybody who tried to say anything about Shri Rama.

484
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,020
Even Parashurama, who was there,

485
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,940
a contemporary incarnation of Shri Rama Himself was Parashurama.

486
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,300
It’s a very interesting story about that.

487
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:49,660
But, he could not bare Parashurama in any way…

488
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,900
(break in recording)

489
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:58,980
…He is the Shesha as they call it.

490
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:06,020
The serpent which sleeps in the bhavasagara.

491
00:36:06,899 --> 00:36:09,820
On which Shri Vishnu rests.

492
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,380
The same Shesha had taken birth as Shri Lakshmana.

493
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:19,134
Now for a western mind, to them, snakes are sort of…

494
00:36:19,255 --> 00:36:21,459
if you talk about snakes for them, only they know

495
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,460
the Adam and Eve snake that’s all,

496
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,180
they don’t understand anything.

497
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,540
And they can’t understand why people worship snakes.

498
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:34,620
You see, snakes are, like cobra and all that, they are like the kings.

499
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,340
They are the kings of the underground.

500
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:44,540
And Shesha is the one who supports the whole Universe.

501
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,740
So this Shesha is worshipped

502
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,900
as the cobras are worshipped in many villages in India, even today,

503
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,580
because they don’t trouble anyone there.

504
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,420
Because they are like deities, are worshipped in India.

505
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:04,220
And sometimes they do, but mostly they do not bite a good religious man.

506
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:10,420
There’s a story of Sai Nath

507
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:17,180
where a snake charmer

508
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:22,460
was given a lot of money just to kill Shri Sai Nath.

509
00:37:22,899 --> 00:37:25,700
And because Sai Nath, used to, in the night,

510
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:30,180
suddenly goes up to his own swing he had made,

511
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,340
about thirty feet above the ground.

512
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,100
God knows, nobody knew how he used to go there.

513
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,940
But they would find him sleeping up there. (Laughs).

514
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:45,220
So this snake was taken by this snake charmer

515
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:50,100
and he put the snake on to Sai Nath.

516
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,340
And the snake went there, and Sai Nath talked to him and He said,

517
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:59,260
“Oh God, you’ve come here to meet me after such a long time.

518
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,900
What is your job?”

519
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,779
He said, “This horrible snake charmer has asked me to bite you.

520
00:38:04,899 --> 00:38:07,740
So I’ve come to tell you to be careful about these people.”

521
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:12,132
The snake charmer was looking with amazement that he was talking to him!

522
00:38:12,253 --> 00:38:14,580
He said, “Alright, you go now.” He talked to him.

523
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,779
These are age-old snakes, you see.

524
00:38:16,899 --> 00:38:21,380
So the snake went and bit the snake charmer.

525
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,660
But then he came down you see, from his thing,

526
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,740
and he sucked his poison and threw it away.

527
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,980
“Because, after all, you see,” he said, “the snake is angry with you

528
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,403
because you tried such a trick.” So he sucked in.

529
00:38:35,524 --> 00:38:37,820
That’s compassion. That’s compassion.

530
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:44,717
And he sucked his venom out and the fellow was completely changed

531
00:38:44,837 --> 00:38:48,859
and he said, “Now I’m going to announce it to all the people

532
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,140
what, these brahmins tried to kill,”

533
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,540
that they wanted to kill Shri Sai Nath.

534
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,940
And why? Why were they so frightened of this man?

535
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,420
He used to live outside the village

536
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,700
and they were so frightened of him because they were doing all wrong things

537
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,980
in the name of God. So they were all frightened that they’ll be exposed.

538
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,900
So, this is what it is, that He sleeps on the Shesha.

539
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:19,180
And Shesha is the one who is sometimes expressed in Sahaja Yogis,

540
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:24,779
I have seen, as anger, when you try to be non protocolish

541
00:39:24,899 --> 00:39:29,620
or when you try to be funny or you don’t behave yourself.

542
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,540
That’s the Shesha in them.

543
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,460
That is also sometimes needed.

544
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,940
You have to be a Shesha sometimes because

545
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,060
otherwise people will start misbehaving

546
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,140
and by that they will be harmed.

547
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,779
Not that I will be harmed, but they will be harmed.

548
00:39:43,899 --> 00:39:46,220
So that kind of temperament is also needed.

549
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:51,380
But the other one is very interesting, is that of Bharata, the brother.

550
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,540
He showed how Shri Rama bestowed the kingdom to him

551
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,940
because of his mother’s agitation.

552
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:05,420
And he didn’t know what to do.

553
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:09,620
So he went back to Rama and he said that, “You take back your kingdom.

554
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,660
I don’t want anything. You are the one who should govern.

555
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,860
Why should I have it?”

556
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:20,940
So Rama said, “Alright, you just be there in charge of the kingdom.

557
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:24,220
I have to obey my father, I have to obey my mother

558
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,260
because I have given them a promise.”

559
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:34,220
So Shri Rama’s another great quality was once given a promise

560
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,660
is to be kept.

561
00:40:36,899 --> 00:40:39,300
This is another quality we have to have that,

562
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,860
if you have promised anything, you have to keep it.

563
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,660
If you have said, “I will do this,”, you must do it.

564
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,180
You should not find out excuses to avoid it.

565
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,500
It’s absolutely an anti-God activity to avoid doing

566
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,620
things that you have promised.

567
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,660
Your Deities will never be happy.

568
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,860
You must see that, whatever you have promised you must do.

569
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,780
Now, when Bharata was sent back by Him

570
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,940
he said, “Alright, give me your sandals which I’ll take there.

571
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:19,779
And I’ll use them as if that’s the symbol of you being there.”

572
00:41:19,899 --> 00:41:22,260
And he put those sandals on the throne

573
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,340
and he ruled that kingdom and looked after – Bharata.

574
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:29,620
Though when he was going to see Rama

575
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,180
then Lakshmana saw him coming and he said, “Look at this!

576
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,860
He’s coming here to invade you now! He has thrown you out of the kingdom

577
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,700
and now he’s coming to invade you.”

578
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,660
So this is also, I’ve seen, among Sahaja Yogis, is there,

579
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:45,540
that the Sahaja Yogis who are like Shesha

580
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,940
cannot see also the goodness of other Sahaja Yogis

581
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:55,060
who are very good people, extremely sacrificing, nice people

582
00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:00,300
but their intentions are not understood, are misunderstood,

583
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,020
which is a very sad thing.

584
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,660
You must see the intentions of another type of people also,

585
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,779
who may not be so hot tempered, may not be so much angry

586
00:42:08,899 --> 00:42:11,420
but their intentions are very good.

587
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:16,899
They have come actually to ask for the sandals of Shri Rama.

588
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,420
So among this two type of people, I have seen

589
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:24,380
there is always a misunderstanding going on.

590
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,420
So both the types of people should try to understand

591
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,540
that we both are needed for Sahaja Yoga.

592
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,779
I cannot only do with one type of people.

593
00:42:33,899 --> 00:42:35,900
We have to have both types of people

594
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,580
who will look after both the styles of the thing.

595
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:44,700
But when you are dealing with others one should go as one.

596
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:51,779
For example, if a person is coming to Caxton Hall

597
00:42:51,899 --> 00:42:54,500
and he says something

598
00:42:55,899 --> 00:42:59,779
then you should weigh it whether he’s a new one or an old one.

599
00:42:59,899 --> 00:43:03,900
If he’s a new one then you must show all gentleness, kindness,

600
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,230
all kinds of exterior things which will please him.

601
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,412
The reason is: he’s not a realised soul,

602
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:11,173
he doesn’t see your subtle thing.

603
00:43:11,294 --> 00:43:15,779
What he sees is what you are, outside.

604
00:43:15,899 --> 00:43:21,340
How you are dressed, how you talk to them, how you behave towards them.

605
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,580
All these things they see first of all.

606
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,795
They don’t see what you have got inside.

607
00:43:27,916 --> 00:43:30,686
They can’t see your heart, they can’t feel your vibrations,

608
00:43:30,807 --> 00:43:34,460
so you have to be very kind to them, you have to be very sweet to them.

609
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:38,300
I received a letter from someone saying that “The Sahaja Yogis

610
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,620
have been very, very rude to me and have been angry.”

611
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:45,020
Like the other day, somebody came and was sitting at the back:

612
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:50,180
they are trying to salvage, salvage what you call

613
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,900
the people who are lost by the cults or whatever it is.

614
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,981
He was sitting at the back and when I said, “Come forward.”

615
00:43:56,102 --> 00:43:58,456
And and he didn’t come so you said, “You get out!”

616
00:43:58,577 --> 00:44:03,260
You should not say! Let me say. That time you should keep quiet.

617
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,860
Nobody should say, “Get out! If you are not going.”

618
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:11,220
Because the thing is if we say,

619
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,860
“We don’t care for people who are not humble!”

620
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,380
Then they are going to be lost in any case.

621
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,100
Let us give them a fair chance.

622
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,260
Let us give them a fair chance to come into Sahaja Yoga;

623
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,820
first by your behaviour.

624
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:28,779
Now, some people have a habit of, sort of talking to them

625
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:33,140
a bit too much. They should not talk. That’s one thing I feel,

626
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,420
that, while giving vibrations and all that,

627
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,738
at the most you should ask, “Are you feeling any cool breeze?”

628
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:53,420
in a very humble way. And this is another quality of Shri Rama,

629
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:57,300
is a sankoch. There’s no word in English language

630
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,260
because you have ‘formality’

631
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:02,779
which is a very insipid word to describe ‘ ‘sankoch’.

632
00:47:02,899 --> 00:47:06,500
Because, there is no integration between your heart and formality.

633
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:09,380
But if you can think of a ‘formality of the heart’

634
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,380
then what do you call that?

635
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,899
What will you call in English language?

636
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:23,020
The formality of the heart.

637
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,220
Yogini: Sincerity.

638
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:29,900
Shri Mataji: No, sincerity is different. It’s an action.

639
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:35,860
Sincerity is an abstract thing. But formality, from the heart.

640
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,899
You see, how to say such a thing?

641
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,899
Yogini: ‘Honestly’ Mother. ‘Honestly’.

642
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,779
Shri Mataji: No, no. Not ‘honesty’. These are all abstract words.

643
00:47:50,899 --> 00:47:52,780
In action.

644
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,820
You see, say for example, now, I am sitting.

645
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,980
Now if they bring me a cup, alright?

646
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,779
It’s a broken cup, for example, you go to somebody’s house,

647
00:48:01,899 --> 00:48:03,660
and it’s a little broken.

648
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,500
So, if an Indian is there -I don’t know about Western style

649
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,420
– he will drink it off.

650
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:12,100
He will not say anything, “It’s broken,” or anything.

651
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:16,500
But maybe somebody might say, “It’s a broken cup!”

652
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:21,300
Or say, you go to somebody’s house

653
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:26,700
and you don’t like a colour scheme or something.

654
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:31,779
So for an Indian person it would be not proper

655
00:48:31,899 --> 00:48:38,140
to immediately say like that – for an Indian person.

656
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:41,540
You see, “formality of the heart”.

657
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:46,940
Not to say something in such a way that

658
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:54,340
you touch the wrong side of the person is sankoch.

659
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:59,300
Now to such an extent Shri Rama had that there’s a good story

660
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,779
– I think I had said it before also, but again I’ll repeat it to you –

661
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:07,300
which is described in another Ramayana written by Tulsidasa.

662
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,740
Although Tulsidasa was not a Realised soul,

663
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,660
but some points he has brought out very well.

664
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:13,780
He says that:

665
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:24,180
Shri Rama was putting the arrows

666
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:30,180
against the heads of Ravana.

667
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,700
And he had ten heads. And he had a boon that,

668
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:37,779
every head that falls off, another head will come up.

669
00:49:37,899 --> 00:49:40,500
He had a boon like that. So his brother says,

670
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:44,260
“What are you doing? You know that he cannot die

671
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:47,580
by putting the arrows across his head.

672
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,580
You have to put it in his heart otherwise he will not die.”

673
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,860
So the sankocha comes in Him and He said,

674
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:57,620
“See, in his heart he has got my wife

675
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:00,540
because he loves Her and She’s sitting in his heart.

676
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,540
How can I hit him in the heart? She’ll be hurt.”

677
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:07,900
See the delicacy of his understanding.

678
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:12,020
So he said, “Then by hitting his head is he going to be killed?”

679
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:16,779
He said, “You see, attention, once it going towards his head,

680
00:50:16,899 --> 00:50:19,899
his attention will be withdrawn from his heart.

681
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,500
And once the attention is withdrawn,

682
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,260
my wife will not be there any more,

683
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:27,780
then Ill hit him and I’ll kill him.”

684
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,700
So see, the sankoch! You see, then you will understand that

685
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,660
how we are rude and arrogant.

686
00:50:36,899 --> 00:50:45,060
This kind of arrogance and rudeness comes to us because we have no sankoch.

687
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,820
We should not say everything to everyone. We need not.

688
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:54,500
Should we say everything? Say, for example, in your puja

689
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:57,572
maybe you are doing something which should not be done.

690
00:50:57,693 --> 00:51:00,420
I know it’s wrong. Unless and until it’s absolutely wrong,

691
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,788
I will not tell. I said, “Gradually they will learn.”

692
00:51:02,909 --> 00:51:05,918
Because otherwise you become like this, you see, tensed up.

693
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:12,260
You must see Linda’s face if I tell her anything! She goes into…

694
00:51:12,899 --> 00:51:18,700
So that sankocha, that understanding comes if you love someone

695
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,981
and understand. Now, you have to love all the seekers of the world.

696
00:51:22,102 --> 00:51:24,779
They have done wrong, they have done all kinds of ego-trips,

697
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,879
they have done all kinds of mistakes but your Mother loves them

698
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,319
and you have to love them.

699
00:51:30,899 --> 00:51:34,020
If they are to be corrected I’ll do that.

700
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,780
You just don’t do that way that they feel hurt.

701
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,180
Put a sankocha.

702
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,740
While talking to each other educate yourself,

703
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:48,820
train yourself to say things which are sweet and nice,

704
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:53,779
which will make another person feel

705
00:51:53,899 --> 00:51:58,740
that this person is a properly brought up person

706
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,380
in Sahaja Yoga tradition.

707
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,860
So we have a Sahaja Yoga tradition also,

708
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,420
in which, when we speak to each other,

709
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:09,180
we have that sankocha within us of Shri Rama.

710
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,300
And if you do not have that sankocha

711
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,780
you get the Right Heart.

712
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:19,420
And that Right Heart is a very dangerous thing in a country like England,

713
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,260
where the climate is so bad,

714
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:26,660
because it gives you a horrible thing like asthma.

715
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:31,140
I’m not frightening you, but it’s true.

716
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,779
You get asthma if your Right Heart is caught.

717
00:52:34,899 --> 00:52:37,460
Not necessarily that asthma comes from Right Heart only

718
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,140
– can also come from centre heart –

719
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:43,779
but [if] you get Right Heart you definitely get asthma.

720
00:52:43,899 --> 00:52:47,500
So the attitude you see, like your father.

721
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:51,180
I’ve heard people talking to father also in such a funny way.

722
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,620
You can’t talk to your father like that.

723
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,420
They talk to me also very rudely.

724
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:59,540
I mean, I have seen people, Sahaja Yogis, shockingly sometimes

725
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:05,380
– on a very mundane level or you can say in a very unprotocolish way.

726
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,500
you will get into Right Heart.

727
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:10,140
So this sankoch one has to learn,

728
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:15,500
the maryada: means the boundaries of your relationships.

729
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,580
You see, “we love each other,” doesn’t mean

730
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:22,779
that we go on aggressing other’s privacies.

731
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:26,300
To what extent you love each other doesn’t mean

732
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:30,220
that you go on in way that you try to transgress

733
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:35,580
all the beauties and all the privacies of another person.

734
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,940
You see, [if] someone walks into the bedroom directly

735
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:42,220
is not the way Sahaja Yoga should be. I need not tell.

736
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,940
But you must knock if you have to.

737
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,779
And knock at a time when you need it!

738
00:53:45,899 --> 00:53:51,060
All the time to knock or to hang onto someone all the time is not proper.

739
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:55,260
The sankocha is a complete cultural stuff.

740
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:02,620
So we have a cultural tradition which we have to learn from Shri Ram.

741
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,380
He’s known for his sankocha. Every time, how to say this,

742
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:12,380
I cannot say that. We have this very much engrained within us.

743
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,540
The children are to be educated in that way,

744
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:22,180
and once they are educated that way they will learn the sankoch,

745
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:29,260
and that will give them a proper understanding of social life.

746
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:33,700
Like you now see, this light is here: if you put your finger to it,

747
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,900
it might burn and you may remove your finger.

748
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,520
But if you are with another person

749
00:54:38,641 --> 00:54:41,020
and if you try to take liberties with that person

750
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:44,580
a day may come when that person will misbehave

751
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:48,380
or will harm you or do something to you. But still you will not realise

752
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:52,580
[that] it is because you have no sankoch [that] it has happened.

753
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:57,820
So this sankoch has to be worked out very beautifully in every way:

754
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:02,060
in thanks-giving, in accepting some body’s gratitude,

755
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:05,300
in expressing your love to another person

756
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:09,780
– in a way that is a sankoch.

757
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:15,300
Now Shri Rama is known for his boundaries.

758
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:20,260
He doesn’t cross the limit. Yesterday, the other day I told you about

759
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:23,580
food, that you don’t cross the boundaries of food,

760
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:28,100
like being compassionate to the bugs and to the mosquitoes.

761
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:34,780
In the same way in every thing discretion of the heart should be there.

762
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:39,220
Now, there is no word for “discretion of the heart”

763
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:42,460
in the English language, which is maryada.

764
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:52,420
Discretion of the heart is, to understand, say, example,

765
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:55,540
that if you are rude to your father what do you gain?

766
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:59,220
You gain nothing. But if you are humble you might gain over,

767
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:03,860
with your father alright. Even if he’s a bad man!

768
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:07,860
Because what happens in reaction, if you say psychologically:

769
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:12,779
Supposing you are the son of a father who is doing something wrong

770
00:56:12,899 --> 00:56:15,779
and you are obedient to him,

771
00:56:15,899 --> 00:56:21,060
he will always have a fear that he will lose you if he falls in your ideals.

772
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:26,140
So by that humility you will raise him.

773
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:33,020
If you are humble, if your behaviour towards your parents

774
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,140
is like Shri Rama’s, there’s nothing to lose.

775
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,780
You don’t compromise in your principles or anything.

776
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,260
In day to day things, like that, [if] your father is sitting…

777
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,380
I mean in India if the father is there,

778
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:49,300
you won’t sit down before him, you won’t sit, at any cost.

779
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,940
Till he tells you ten times, you won’t sit before him.

780
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:55,779
It helps, you know. Then it reacts on the father

781
00:56:55,899 --> 00:57:00,060
that,  “Supposing I misbehave much my son will not respect me.”

782
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:04,980
So the sense of respect also comes from your heart.

783
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:12,300
That’s only possible if you know that maryada from your heart

784
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:15,779
how far to go. What is the need to be rude to your father?

785
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:19,700
No need at all, at any cost! What is the need?

786
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:22,260
Or to your husband or to your wife?

787
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,980
Why to say anything harsh to anyone? What is the need?

788
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,340
What are you going to gain out of it?

789
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:30,420
By saying anything harsh I have not seen people have improved.

790
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:34,580
Only when a guru is harsh or,

791
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,980
I mean, the mother or father are harsh to the children it helps.

792
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:41,660
Nowhere else it helps you in common relationships.

793
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:47,180
Like brothers and sisters, it does not, and higher and lower.

794
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:50,379
The lower person have to bear the harshness of the elders

795
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,637
if they want to improve. There’s nothing!

796
00:57:52,758 --> 00:57:54,833
After all they’re not going to throttle you.

797
00:57:54,954 --> 00:57:58,260
Supposing even if he says something bad to you – doesn’t matter.

798
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,820
You try to. And there, what one has to remember [is]

799
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:04,860
what Christ has said that, you must put another cheek.

800
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:10,100
So use the heart’s discretion – how far to go to a person.

801
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:15,300
In the effect of it you will be a very, very powerful person,

802
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:19,700
in your family, in Sahaja Yoga, anywhere.

803
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:24,940
Those people who are obedient to me are very powerful Sahaja Yogis.

804
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,980
You know that.

805
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:31,460
And those who are not go down very fast.

806
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:35,779
I try to save them, by everything, but I have seen

807
00:58:35,899 --> 00:58:39,340
– those who are disobedient, who don’t listen to me,

808
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:42,420
who are rude to me, who do not understand the protocol,

809
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,500
go down very much in Sahaja Yoga.

810
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:46,779
Absolutely (clicking fingers) like that!

811
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:53,460
In a second I find they are going hundreds of feet down. It’s true.

812
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:57,779
Because what is lacking in you is the discretion, the maryada

813
00:58:57,899 --> 00:59:01,500
– how far to go. And that’s another thing we have to learn

814
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,220
to educate ourselves.

815
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:07,380
So the education of Shri Rama as it was, I told you, that

816
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,779
he could kill a demon with one arrow.

817
00:59:10,899 --> 00:59:14,180
You don’t have to beat them a hundred and eight times,

818
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,899
one beating should be sufficient.

819
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:20,700
But you have to be powerful people

820
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:25,260
and the power of a person increases by putting maryada.

821
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:29,820
Supposing you have wheat, and you just spread it,

822
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:33,820
it will spread all over, anybody will, birds will come and eat it off,

823
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:37,620
it will be finished. But if you put them in a sack

824
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:44,420
it will have a weight, it will have a size, it will rise in height

825
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,940
and it is useful. It will have respect.

826
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:51,900
But the thing that is all spread all over, which has no maryada,

827
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,779
will never be respected.

828
00:59:53,899 --> 00:59:59,700
Nothing works out without maryada. Even the light keeps to a maryada.

829
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:04,900
You have to keep your maryadas. That is part of our training, you see.

830
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:08,060
Say, for example, an aeroplane is there

831
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:10,900
and it is not bound by any maryadas.

832
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:14,020
You see, it is not bound. When it goes in the air

833
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:15,980
it will be all finished!

834
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:22,620
All our ideas of freedom are to be bound by maryada.

835
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:26,380
If the freedom has no maryada it is abandonment,

836
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:30,100
it is nonsense, it is not going to help us.

837
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:34,779
So we have to create out of Sahaja Yogis great politicians.

838
01:00:34,899 --> 01:00:40,020
It has been predicted that if Sahaja Yoga does not spread

839
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:43,340
then the third world war is inevitable.

840
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:46,700
People will suffer a lot with a third world war.

841
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:53,300
It is possible to avoid it if people take to Sahaja Yoga in a big number.

842
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:56,660
But if they do not, there will be a third world war

843
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:59,779
and the effects of that will harm people so much

844
01:00:59,899 --> 01:01:04,100
that ultimately it is the Sahaja Yogis who will be called for a conference

845
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:06,340
and not the diplomats.

846
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,536
The Sahaja Yogis will be consulted,

847
01:01:08,657 --> 01:01:11,407
and they will decide what is to be done for the world

848
01:01:11,528 --> 01:01:15,779
and they will become the rulers of tomorrow’s world.

849
01:01:15,899 --> 01:01:21,220
So we must have a full idea [of] how to be rulers like Shri Rama.

850
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:25,700
We have to go too far with ourselves, to training up ourselves,

851
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:28,940
educating ourselves, getting rid of our egos

852
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:32,220
and understanding that we have to grow.

853
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:36,779
It’s a very big task, it’s a great task and sometimes you might think,

854
01:01:36,899 --> 01:01:39,351
“How can Mother expect us to do it?”

855
01:01:39,472 --> 01:01:42,100
But I think you are the people who are chosen for it

856
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:44,580
and you have to get to it and work it out.

857
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,780
So we have to train up ourselves to be first good rulers of ourselves

858
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,779
and the rulers of others.

859
01:01:50,899 --> 01:01:53,060
First we must learn to rule ourselves. You see,

860
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:58,100
here in this body only you’ll learn how to rule yourself.

861
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:01,060
Comfort, if you get fond of comfort,

862
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:05,899
make your body work it out that there’s no comfort needed.

863
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,100
If your body indulges into too much eating or anything,

864
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:13,537
make your body learn that it’s not good to indulge into it.

865
01:02:13,658 --> 01:02:16,354
If you speak too much, talk too much, if you are rude,

866
01:02:16,475 --> 01:02:19,778
just say that, “I’m not going to say a word from morning till evening.”

867
01:02:19,899 --> 01:02:24,620
Take to mauna (silence). So the tapah, is the penance time,

868
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,260
is now ahead of us.

869
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:30,900
With that penance, the greatest thing that is going to help you

870
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:37,460
is to go and talk of Sahaja Yoga – give the message of my advent –

871
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:42,340
and also talk about how the transformation, the blossom time has come.

872
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:47,300
This you have to do, plus you have to learn how to rule yourself

873
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:51,620
and then how to rule others through your heart, not through your mind.

874
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:54,779
You have to rule through your hearts by learning all the qualities

875
01:02:54,899 --> 01:02:57,540
of the heart which I have told you.

876
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:01,420
And I must congratulate you for the article you have written on Blossom Time.

877
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:04,380
I have gone through it. I have really enjoyed it, thoroughly.

878
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,460
He’s done very well. May God bless you!

879
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:08,620
And I think it will have a good [effect]…

880
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:10,500
I’m surprised how they published it:

881
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,580
have they changed their mind or what happened?

882
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:16,820
It’s amazing! Have you seen that article?

883
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:18,500
It’s great.

884
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:28,140
And thank you very much for the nice creepers you have sent me.

885
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:31,820
They are so beautiful you see, they still are under a shock

886
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:35,340
because I removed them from your gentle care to mine.

887
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:38,060
And mine is a little sort of flippant one now.

888
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,300
But today we tried to do some justice to them.

889
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:44,140
I’m sure they’ll. We gave them a bandhan.

890
01:03:47,725 --> 01:03:50,318
Shri Mataji: You mean you want to be more intelligent?

891
01:03:50,439 --> 01:03:52,779
Yogi: No, to get rid of the rubbish Mother.

892
01:03:52,899 --> 01:03:55,340
Shri Mataji: Rubbish that is in the head?

893
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,700
You see, the best one, in Sanskrit it is said,

894
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:00,780
“Ya neti neti wachane nigamor avochus.”

895
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:05,100
means, you go on telling your mind, “This is not, this is not, this is not.”

896
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,940
Any thought that comes to your mind, you go on telling,

897
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:12,020
“this is not the thought. Not this, not this, not this.”

898
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,260
Then the inspiration starts coming.

899
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:20,100
You see, what I feel, people are not inspired.

900
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:23,140
They have got fear on one side.

901
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:26,779
Suddenly, you do something to them they go into a fear, a trauma.

902
01:04:26,899 --> 01:04:32,180
Or else, if you try to be good to them, they go into an ego-trip.

903
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,860
So to stay in the centre, what you have to do,

904
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:37,860
is to go on saying “Not this thought,” and, “not this thought.”

905
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:41,260
Then you will be a deep Sahaja Yogi.

906
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:44,820
Best is this. Because intellect is nothing – so-called intellect.

907
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:50,540
Only God has intelligence, nobody has! To be very frank.

908
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:57,660
It’s a big joke, isn’t it?

909
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:01,420
Every one thinks they are intelligent but they are not, they are stupid.

910
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:04,980
You see, all stupidity is considered as intelligence these days.

911
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:08,779
For example, cunningness – it never pays you dividends.

912
01:05:08,899 --> 01:05:13,180
What is intellect? Is the only understanding of intellect

913
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:18,580
as Adi Shankaracharya had put it –

914
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,500
“Na yoge, na sankhya,”

915
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:22,779
All these things are good for nothing.

916
01:05:22,899 --> 01:05:27,220
Only service to your Mother is the best way.

917
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:31,660
Ask your intellect, “Is it serving my Mother?”

918
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:36,620
Intellect will tell you, the so-called intellect of human beings,

919
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:41,700
to cheat yourself. It cheats you. It gives you escapes. It cheats you.

920
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:44,380
All the time the intellect is working by saying,

921
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:47,779
“This may be good, that may be good” you see,

922
01:05:47,899 --> 01:05:50,900
but the real good, it never sees.

923
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:54,300
It’s a trick of the ego, trick of the ego.

924
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:57,779
Is the choices. Ego likes choices, you see.

925
01:05:57,899 --> 01:06:01,780
So, “This is good, this is bad, this I don’t like this, this.”

926
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,620
All ‘I’ business should be given up and say that,

927
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:06,940
“Not this, not this, not this.”

928
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:13,540
“We” should come in, “we”, not “I”.

929
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:18,380
Now you are not anymore ‘I’s, you are ‘we’ now.

930
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:23,670
That’s how the intellect will go away.

931
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:26,492
Because this intellect has gathered all kind of nonsense

932
01:06:26,613 --> 01:06:28,900
and it doesn’t exist! That’s the biggest maya!

933
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:32,660
It doesn’t exist! There is no intelligence at all!

934
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,500
What is the intelligence, is just to understand

935
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:41,460
that there is nothing like this intellect – you are nothing.

936
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:44,580
You see, to explain His intellect would be something

937
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:47,140
like explaining human civilisation to an ant!

938
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:52,340
Even that is easier! It’s like that – His intellect.

939
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:04,980
And He’s innocent. So simple. I mean, anybody is amazed how can that be.

940
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:12,180
So the most intelligent person is the one who knows

941
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:17,620
that our intellect is just a ego-trip.

942
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:24,740
This is the sign of pure intelligence,

943
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:31,779
is the sign of pure understanding

944
01:07:31,899 --> 01:07:37,940
that the heart is the ruler, there resides the Spirit

945
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:42,260
which is the most intelligent thing within us.

946
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:47,420
And the inspiration of the Spirit is the manifestation

947
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:50,860
of the pure intellect of God.

948
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:57,899
And what I told you today is the intellect of the heart.

949
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:03,580
But of the brain – zero!

950
01:08:06,899 --> 01:08:09,420
But then, what’s the use of the brain?

951
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:13,340
Why have brain? Why not only have heart? It would be alright.

952
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:16,940
But the brain is the one which acts.

953
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:21,300
Heart gives the inspiration but the brain acts on it,

954
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,260
it’s communicating.

955
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:28,460
But the inspiration, the source, is the heart, is the Spirit.

956
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:31,899
Again connect yourself to the Spirit.

957
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:43,780
Intelligently, how will you explain Kundalini awakening?

958
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:47,300
Leave alone Kundalini, how can you explain sprouting of the seed

959
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:51,060
intelligently, through your intellect?

960
01:08:51,180 --> 01:09:00,940
Explain, means, explain why, how.

961
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,780
Sprouting of the seed, a simple thing

962
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:06,899
which you see thousand and one times.

963
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:15,220
How will you explain? Intellect is that says, “I cannot explain.”

964
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:21,940
A very limited thing. It’s ego, nothing but ego.

965
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:30,700
And once you get rid of it then the pure intellect starts coming in.

966
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:34,779
You see, with [Mr.] Yoga Singh, you will be amazed, you see, who is,

967
01:09:34,899 --> 01:09:38,580
I mean he came to us as a bhoot absolutely. He’s so much changed.

968
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:41,779
Now he speaks, I tell you, he speaks like a saint.

969
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:44,020
I was amazed!

970
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:49,140
He speaks so well sometimes that I want to quote him sometimes

971
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:51,422
– the way he speaks about certain things.

972
01:09:51,543 --> 01:09:55,543
I am amazed how he has started talking like that.

973
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:02,779
So whatever you have to say relate it to the Spirit

974
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:04,940
you will talk like saints.

975
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:08,540
Relate it to Spirit, not to anything else,

976
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:12,140
relate it to Spirit and you will be amazed.

977
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:23,740
He told me that, “There are many people in this world who are absurd.”

978
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:25,580
I said, “How do you know?”

979
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:29,899
He says “Because they don’t want to know anything about you.

980
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:37,020
I don’t know why are they here and why have you created them!”

981
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:43,540
You see, he was a person with so many bhoots on his head.

982
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:50,779
He’s such a beautiful man, I tell you.

983
01:10:50,899 --> 01:10:53,260
He says this, “This is your servant is alright,

984
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:57,779
but he has to learn certain things if he has to live well.

985
01:10:57,899 --> 01:11:02,660
He doesn’t have neatness. Because his mind is not neat.

986
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:08,980
He has to be a cleaner person. But his mind is not clean.

987
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:13,899
His heart is alright. But the mind should be clean.”

988
01:11:14,899 --> 01:11:16,899
I was amazed at him.

989
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:22,580
He’s not an educated man or anything, just an ordinary person.

990
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:25,126
But they start talking like prophets.

991
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:27,416
I think you’d better read some of the prophets

992
01:11:27,537 --> 01:11:30,337
you will also start talking like them.

993
01:11:30,899 --> 01:11:35,020
You read Kabir, Khalil Gibran, all these people.

994
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:38,660
What is Blake? He was a prophet too.

995
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:43,260
You can talk like him. Why not?

996
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:48,380
He talked through his Spirit isn’t it? Pure intelligence.

997
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:53,900
Then you’ll become Shri Rama if you can do that.

998
01:11:55,899 --> 01:11:59,780
So today’s a great day. I’m happy you all could come.

999
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:03,620
And it has worked out so well that this is,

1000
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:08,460
I was going to come here and talk about Shri Rama

1001
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:13,900
and wish you all that you follow Him up.

1002
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:15,820
Respect yourself!

1003
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:20,620
And it’s your responsibility to be good, to be like that,

1004
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,899
to work it out that way.
