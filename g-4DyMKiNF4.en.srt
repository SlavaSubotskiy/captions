1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:09,640
Today, it’s a great day that you are here
to worship your Guru in the realm of the heart

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,640
of the universe. If we can do that in our
domain of the heart, we don’t have to do

3
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,150
anything else.

4
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:42,150
Today, also, I feel I have to tell you about
Sahaja Yoga and its value, which is related

5
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:06,970
to other Yogas which were accepted in the
olden days all over the world. They called

6
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:20,900
it, one, as the Yoga – not Sahaja Yoga,
Yoga. It started with various types of practices

7
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,520
of ‘Ashtanga’ [Sanskrit/Hindi meaning
‘having eight stages/parts’] Yogas – eightfold

8
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,520
yogas – with a Guru. And one had to go through
lots of hardships. Nobody who was married

9
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:55,230
was allowed into that Ashtanga Yoga, and they
had to give up their families, give up their

10
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:06,799
relationships. They had to become
absolutely without any attachments, to go
to a Guru. All their property, all their possessions

11
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,760
were given up. Not to the Guru as is done
in modern times, but given away. And this

12
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,129
was called as Yoga.

13
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:48,129
The another style was called as Sankhya. Sankhya
is where all your life you have to gather

14
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:05,989
things with detachment, and then to distribute
them completely and take to a Guru, in a way

15
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,280
completely surrendered, and then get realization.
Sankhya was the left-sided behavior. And the

16
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:45,299
Yoga was the right-sided. Where the Gayatri
Mantra was used was the Sankhya. Because they

17
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:58,239
were left-sided, they used to use Gayatri
Mantra. They went so much to the left side

18
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,879
- that is to gather things, to gather possessions,
to gather properties, to gather all kinds

19
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:20,210
of friends and relations and societies - that
they were afraid that they may be completely

20
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:32,010
lost into all those things. They would go
to Gayatri, the Mantra of Gayatri which teaches

21
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:45,350
you the essences of all our Chakras – the
centers. I have told about this before also

22
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:56,500
– ‘Bhu’, ‘Bhurv’, ‘Swaha’. ‘Bhu’
stands for the essence or the ‘Bija’ of

23
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:04,410
the ‘Mooladhara’; ‘Bhuv’ for the universe
that is created that is Swadisthana’s ‘Bija’;

24
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,240
‘Swaha’ is the ‘Bija’ of the Nabhi;
‘Manah’ is the essence of the Heart Chakra.

25
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:31,589
Then, ‘Janah’ is the people, collectivity,
is the essence or the ‘Bija’ of the Vishuddhi

26
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:41,279
Chakra. Then, ‘Tapah’ is the one where
you go into ‘tapasya’, into renunciation,

27
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:52,100
into hardships – is the essence of the Agnya
Chakra. And then the ‘Satya’ is the truth,

28
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:04,940
is the essence of the Sahasrara – not the
truth that we think as truth, but the truth

29
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:16,619
that is expressed in our central nervous system.
So, this is discovered at the seventh stage

30
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:31,330
of the Sahasrara. So the people who did Sankhya
were, sort of, not so much respected as spiritual

31
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:41,929
people, because they thought these are all
involved into worldly things and worldly possessions

32
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:49,360
and worldly happenings. So, they were regarded
as something secondary. Or those who were

33
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,480
yogis of the Gurus were regarded higher, because
they had already given up everything, and

34
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,880
they have gone to a Guru giving up all the
things that they have. But here, these Gurus

35
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:21,309
had a problem within themselves because they
found that those who came to them gave up

36
00:07:22,739 --> 00:07:29,739
everything – no doubt – but still there
was lurking attachments. In their own ‘Ashramas’

37
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,760
[Hindi/Sanskrit meaning hermitages] they found,
these people had their own attachments to

38
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:42,700
things. Though outwardly they had given up,
but inside they had not given up. So, they

39
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:49,700
were still sticking on to these ideas that,
‘Oh, its all right. But still we can have

40
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:58,250
little things like that, doesn’t matter.’
Like that, there was little compromises going

41
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:03,100
on. Like, as we have here nunneries and all
that. So both, in a way, were artificial.

42
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:10,100
The one side, is the Sankhyas, were trying
to ascend with all the luggage they were carrying.

43
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:29,980
And another were trying to descend with all
the ambitions of ascent.

44
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:38,559
So, it was a very funny thing in every aspect,
in both these styles of Yoga. As you can see

45
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:53,780
that now, if you go to America you’ll find,
‘Oh God, what is this America? It’s not

46
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,800
democracy, it’s demonocracy.’ But if you
go from that in the realm of another country

47
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:10,900
like Russia, you find - what is this? You
are working here under complete pressures

48
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:20,030
and fears. But as soon as a Russian comes
out of that country, he can become worse than

49
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:27,030
an American. So what is this? One theory works
here, another theory works there. So which

50
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:34,800
is the theory that is all right? Same you
find about religion. Say, a religion, which

51
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:43,580
believes in many Gods, like the Hindus, they
are also believing now into the ‘Bhoots’.

52
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:50,580
And they are also following the path of possessions.
If you go to a temple, every temple has got

53
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:03,490
nice arrangement for you to get possessed.
Or even a church, or a mosque – where God

54
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:14,870
has to reside, you find suddenly you get attacked
and you come out absolutely puzzled about

55
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:23,039
yourself, ending up into lunatic asylums.
So what sort of worshipping places are these,

56
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:30,039
where you go to find God and you get the horrible
satanic forces acting on you? That’s why,

57
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,240
in the modern times, people have become so
very confused. We do not find truth in anything

58
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:51,540
– in any ideologies, any philosophies, anything
that started… say, Confusius started humanism,

59
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:02,140
Socrates started another thing, Mohammad Saheb
started another thing. Like Mohammad Saheb

60
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:09,190
said let us not worship God as an idol; let
us worship Him in the ‘Nirakara’, in the

61
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:17,580
formless God. But you see the formless? How
they are killing each other now? I mean, after

62
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,419
seeing the Muslim countries, you can’t believe
there could be any formless or formful God

63
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:32,419
existing anywhere – all must have run away
- the way they are fighting. Then you see

64
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:39,620
the Christian countries. Wherever they have
gone, they have tried to dominate other people

65
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:53,780
who were not Christians, just as if they had
a right to do it because they were Christians.

66
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,200
The Disciples of Christ, who said, “Forgive
them for they do not know what they are doing.”

67
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,200
And I have to say the same for all the Christians,
“Forgive them for they do not know what

68
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:23,539
they are doing.” And when you are shocked
at all these things, one must sit down and

69
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:30,539
think what is to be done, what’s the problem
is.

70
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,680
So, it is neither Sankhya nor Yoga; then what
is it you have to achieve? That is Sahaja

71
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:48,740
Yoga. Sahaja Yog is a system in which first
you are not given a theory, but the light

72
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:57,760
in your hand to see for yourself in which
both things look the same. For example, now

73
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:05,159
you have got this beautiful house made for
your Mother, while your Mother doesn’t know

74
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,810
how to get attached to even a pin. It’s
a funny situation.

75
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,460
Everybody has to remind Me, “Mother it is
Your house.”

76
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,659
“Oh I see.”

77
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:28,659
And I have to be reminded I must thank you
all, specially the English, specially the

78
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:45,320
leaders of English Sahaja yogis, for making
full effort to get this house. But then, I

79
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:55,650
think why should I thank? It’s not mine,
it’s theirs – and that’s what it is.

80
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:09,330
So a new type of confusion starts, and that’s
what I felt that this confusion is very sweet

81
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:22,979
and beautiful. It’s a fact that nothing
belongs to us, but every thing belongs to

82
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:35,490
us. When I think about how beautifully you
have done this place, it belongs to Me, all

83
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:42,490
right; this house belongs to Me; England belongs
to Me and above all, the whole world belongs

84
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:06,310
to Me. That’s how we see Sankhya and Yoga
become one in Sahaja Yoga. And it’s said

85
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:35,440
that when you see Sankhya and Yoga as one,
then only ‘Sapashyati’ – that’s the

86
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,880
one who sees; that’s the one is the witness.

87
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:45,880
So, for normal people it could be that how
is it your Mother is supposed to be a Guru

88
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,770
and She wears all ornaments? But what to do?
She’s also a Mother and She is also a Goddess.

89
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:06,770
Another confusion. How to make these two things
be? You see a Guru has to be a very angry

90
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:19,610
person, wearing only single dress either upwards
or downwards, I don’t know how, with a big

91
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:26,610
thick rod in the hand, never smiling – laughing
no question – smiling. And the Gurus have

92
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:41,599
to be very long faced, developing big, big
beards, and no ladies allowed. In such a situation,

93
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:50,149
where the women are not to be seen at all,
I mean I shouldn’t even see My face - it’s

94
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:08,870
like that. There is a big discussion in all
the scriptures - not scriptures, I would say

95
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:19,179
the critiques, whether a woman should be allowed
to do the spiritual practices or not – imagine.

96
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:33,939
Not only among Christians, you’ll be surprised,
even in Indian scriptures - whether is woman

97
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:41,110
is allowed or not to do spiritual practices.
Now when your Mother is a woman and She is

98
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:52,510
your Guru, what will you do? This is another
confusion because it is wrong, the whole thing

99
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:06,400
is falsehood, based on no basis at all. You
may try anything to say that women are not

100
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:20,380
meant for spiritual life, try any argument,
it fails. The other day I met one big John

101
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:34,620
in a University, big fellow, I might say really
hard nut, and he started saying, “We Christians

102
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:47,020
cannot accept a woman to be God.”

103
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:55,059
I said, “Why?”

104
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:57,900
“Because…”

105
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:04,900
So to put all these upside-down stories right,
your Mother had to come on this earth as a

106
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:25,860
Guru. I got to this point out of one little
confusion I had about Myself. The other day,

107
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:35,380
somebody was after My life that I should buy
a bracelet. I said, “I have no money anymore;

108
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:35,630
I don’t want to buy.”

109
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:37,260
“All right we will give it in Puja.”

110
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,900
I said, “But now there is only Guru Puja.”

111
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,280
Said, “All right, we will give it in Guru
Puja.”

112
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:50,140
I said, “To buy a bracelet in Guru Puja
is something funny I have done.”

113
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:57,140
After all, in a Guru Puja you don’t give
a bracelet to your Guru, do you? You can give,

114
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:05,069
say, a big rod; or you might give him a sandalwood
‘Khada’ - what is it called - ‘Chappals’,

115
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:16,270
or you may give him a shawl. But here it is…
I have asked… all right give it in Guru

116
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:24,420
Puja. What was the reason? And I became aware
of My own confusion and I thought of it. I

117
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:36,170
said, “This is what it is, that it has to
happen this way that, on a Guru Puja you have

118
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:44,150
to give a bracelet to your Guru.” Let us
change it over. The whole thing has to be

119
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:53,970
brought up this way that everything faces
reality. All these false ideas have to be

120
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:05,090
given up. Like, if you have a carpet upside-down,
the whole design is upside-down. But, if you

121
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:12,720
put the carpet right, everything falls in
line. And that’s why you needed a Mother

122
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
to give you realization, and a Guru as a Mother
to teach you that for ascent of God nobody

123
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:29,850
can be prohibited.

124
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:36,850
That is how the Sahaja Yoga today is working
out. In all directions, if you find, to put

125
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:43,890
all upside-down things into right direction,
to expose it to reality, to bring all real

126
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:55,179
values, to abolish all rotten value systems,
all political, economic systems, all spiritual

127
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:14,920
theologies, all psychological and all such
nonsensical ideas into its proper direction.

128
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:29,059
How in one incarnation it has worked out,
you can imagine. How in one incarnation all

129
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,689
these ideas have been put right.

130
00:22:41,689 --> 00:22:48,689
Another idea exists, among Hindus, that if
you are a religious people, you should be

131
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:56,270
a vegetarian. All the Brahmins believe this,
and even the non-Brahmins. But we had a Brahmin

132
00:22:57,699 --> 00:23:04,380
working in one of the places where I was living,
and they said that for Mother we have to give

133
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:11,380
meat, She doesn’t eat anything else. She
has to eat proteins. She said, “Yes,yes,

134
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,000
Of course. For a Mother, She must have.”
Whether it’s a Brahmin or a non-Brahmin,

135
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,000
all understand that Mother has to eat proteins.
Because She has to drink the blood of all

136
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:27,920
these ‘rakshasas’ [Hindi meaning demons],
how can She be vegetarian? And if She has

137
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:34,920
to kill so many devils, how can She be non-violent?
So the contrast that you see in the description

138
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:53,600
of the Mother - that She is the one who is
the most furious personality when it comes

139
00:23:56,439 --> 00:24:03,439
to the killing of the people who are of the
negative land, who are trying to destroy Her

140
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:12,330
creation, Her own children; and She is the
sweetest and the mildest person for Her own

141
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:20,350
children. These two contrasts should be seen.
Even in animals you’ll find the same contrast,

142
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:27,580
but very evident in an incarnation like this.
And today, through Sahaja Yoga, we have been

143
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:35,569
able to prove that Sankhya and Yoga are the
same.

144
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:42,220
Whether you collect things, whether you have
possessions or whether you give away, makes

145
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:49,220
no difference to a person who is detached
from within. If you collect them for others,

146
00:24:53,870 --> 00:25:00,870
even better. But if you collect for yourself
and then give away, that’s even much better.

147
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:07,120
Because first you collect for yourself then
you think, “Oh it’s good for me, I will

148
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:14,069
use this one for myself, will be a good idea”
- so the self is there - but then, that you

149
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:18,460
give away. That means your detachment is complete.
Or the third personality could be liking [not

150
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:25,460
clear]… which just goes on collecting and
just goes on giving. Without thinking it collects

151
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:34,429
and without thinking it gives because thinking
is not My job. That is one thing I have given

152
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:41,429
up – is to think. I don’t want to think
– that’s your work, not Me. And without

153
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:49,819
thinking, how many things we have achieved
through Sahaja Yoga. Yoga and Sankhya both

154
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:57,910
are products of thinking, not products of
spontaneity. This house itself is a product

155
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:08,280
of spontaneity. I mean, as we call the English
as ‘Saablogs’, you see. So I took some

156
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:13,500
‘Saablogs’ with Me around to see some
houses and they wanted to (see) some houses

157
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:20,140
with some character – means something must
fall out, something must be crooked, this

158
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:27,140
should not be straightforward. I said, “Now
please, I can’t bear all this crookedness.”

159
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,520
So, “No, no, but it has character.”

160
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,980
I said, “Now, this kind of a crooked nose
I don’t want.” Straightforward it should

161
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:42,980
be. So they were rather disappointed at Me.
And the ‘Saablog’ had some other ideas

162
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:51,309
also that, say for example, if you go to,
say, to a place called Windmere, it’s a

163
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:58,309
posh place; if you go to the Northside, little
less; then if you go to the east, it’s useless

164
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:08,820
– like that. I said, “Let’s go the north,
northest as far as we can go.” Because,

165
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:17,199
you know, the Godess has to be ‘Dakshinamurthy’.
She has to be on the north side to be on the

166
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:24,580
- Her eyes on the south. That’s the reason
She has to be… I mean we could not have

167
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:29,309
been in Scotland – that would have been
too much for you. But that would have been

168
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:36,309
the ideal for all of us because then our ‘Drishti’
is towards - our vision is towards the south

169
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:44,980
and we see the whole universe under our own
beautiful visions. So that’s how, spontaneously,

170
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:57,449
we found this place. And ‘Saablog’ were,
“Yes, No, No, Yes.” But spontaneously

171
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:05,929
we got it. And then we found out it has a
history; then we found out its beautiful vibrations;

172
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:16,799
then we found out the potential about it.
Whatever you get spontaneously, it is full

173
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,260
of potentials.

174
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:26,260
On this point, I have to say a few words,
is important. I had to get - few points I

175
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:36,910
have to say about spontaneity part which is
quite interesting – the way people think

176
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:49,860
spontaneity works. Like, it’s mostly ego
part which says, ‘This is spontaneous,’

177
00:28:53,100 --> 00:29:00,100
with so many people. Specially the very old
Sahaja Yogis think they are authorities on

178
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:11,250
spontaneity. Like, we had a land in Vaitarna.
So one of the older ones went there and he

179
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:18,250
said, “This land is vibrating and this is
not vibrating.” So everybody accepted, ‘All

180
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:25,569
right, all right, all right.’ Then they
said, “In this part of the land nobody should

181
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:32,569
eat their food.” Now, from where does this
knowledge come? Eating food is not a sin,

182
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:41,799
is it? As if it is a sin that you are eating
food in there. Then religiously they follow

183
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:50,809
a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, z and again a, b,
c, d of Sahaja Yoga to such an extent, ‘ki’

184
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:58,809
[Hindi meaning ‘that’] I start thinking
now they have become another fanatic Sahaja

185
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:05,809
Yogis. Fanaticism is against Sahaja Yoga – absolutely.
Now they will ask, “How many times we should

186
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:13,169
say this ‘Mantra’?” Then I say, “Zero
times.”

187
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:23,870
“How many drops we should put, the ghee,
in our nose?” Then I say, “A full jug.”

188
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:43,620
Then, “Oh, I should not have gone from the
left side, I should have gone from the right

189
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:48,480
side.”

190
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,539
Then, I would say, “You just jump up.”

191
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:59,539
You have to be like children. But the ideas
are so settled down in Sahaja Yoga, now it’s

192
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:07,760
so many years of course, but they should not
settle down. If they settle down, it’s not

193
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:14,970
Sahaja; it’s not spontaneous. ‘If you
do this way, then it is wrong; that way, it’s

194
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:23,299
wrong’ – nothing of the kind. Nothing
is wrong for you people. If you do anything

195
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:29,049
wrong, your vibrations will be lost, finished.
What is there to be so cautious? Like, somebody

196
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:31,960
said, “I don’t want to look at the cigarette.”
I said, “Why?”

197
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,480
“Looking at it also is sinful.”

198
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,780
I said, “Looking at it what happens?”

199
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,100
“Then I feel like smoking.”

200
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,189
So I said, “Better smoke once for all.”

201
00:31:42,189 --> 00:31:49,189
Or, “I cannot hold a wine bottle in my hand.”

202
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,539
“Why?”

203
00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:57,010
“No, holding the wine bottle is sinful.”

204
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:04,010
I mean, you can swim in the wine. So this
kind of understanding should be there. Though

205
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:20,760
I have always said that if I say one thing,
you will clinch on to it. So I always say

206
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:27,330
the other side of it - that don’t stick
on to something; Sahaja Yoga is not for sticking

207
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:32,630
on to something. Like somebody who had learnt
certain say, lessons about Sahaja Yoga in

208
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:39,630
the beginning of it, certain Mantras they
had learnt, and still they are sticking on

209
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:46,580
to the same step. No, no, no, no – you have
to go ahead. This is just a staircase. Don’t

210
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:53,580
get stuck at a point. We have had so many
such cases here. People get really outworn

211
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:04,110
as they say. They will go on telling you so
many nonsensical ideas – “You see, if

212
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:11,010
you do like this, then this happens.” First
of all, you don’t give ideas to others.

213
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:13,470
That’s one thing - if you decide that we
don’t give ideas about what’s wrong with

214
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,710
another person, half of your job is done.
Because you don’t have to do any job, as

215
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:22,710
I don’t do. Anybody who comes, “You are
a ‘bhoot’.” You better have it. I get

216
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:32,460
reports from others. They say that your Sahaja
Yogis are wicked people. I said, “Why?”

217
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:38,199
“Oh, they tell you, ‘You are evil.’
They tell you, ‘You are possessed’, they

218
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:44,949
tell you, ‘You are this, you are that’;
they are very wicked people.”

219
00:33:44,949 --> 00:33:51,949
I am really shocked to hear that Sahaja Yogis
- how can they be wicked? If somebody is suffering

220
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,390
from something, in the phone they say, “Oh
you better have it. It’s good for you.”

221
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:04,390
That’s not the way. We have to be not only
humble, very tactful and sweet to new people

222
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:14,170
– if you want any more to come in. But if
you have decided not to have anymore, because

223
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:20,019
you will have to put another marquee, then
I have nothing to say. But if you want others

224
00:34:20,019 --> 00:34:27,019
to come in, then it’s important that you
talk to them in a very sweet and beautiful

225
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:34,870
language, the way they understand. Rudeness,
arrogance, showing off, is of no use. One

226
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:42,180
should understand Sahaja Yoga is where you
are in complete enjoyment about it; you are

227
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:49,700
just lost into that enjoyment. Where is the
time to remember how many times to give a

228
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:56,700
‘Bandhan’ to yourself? What is the need
to give ‘Bandhan’ to yourself? It’s

229
00:34:58,489 --> 00:35:05,489
all a joke now for you, should be. A little
child sucks the milk from the bottle, all

230
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:14,660
right, because it has no teeth. But what about
you people having that kind of a thing? It’s

231
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:26,380
very childish and shows no growth at all.
Sahaja Yoga must grow within. You should not

232
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:39,180
be, anymore, regarded as immature Sahaja Yogis.
I would say: a person who is a matured Sahaja

233
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:50,710
Yogi is the one who can combine so many things
together, with all beautiful lines, thin lines,

234
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:53,560
thin ‘Maryadas’ [Hindi/Sanskrit meaning
code of conduct] maintained. But, you cannot

235
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,540
do the other way round.

236
00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:02,540
For example, you shouldn’t say, “All right,
now I will be sweet. Then I will be angry;

237
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:11,210
then I will be sweet; then I’ll be like
this; then I’ll be like that.” It will

238
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:20,870
be a hotchpotch. It is a funny personality
you see - suddenly I get angry, like that

239
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:36,140
[facial expression?], and then I [presumably
Mother demonstrates with facial expression].

240
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:45,420
People will think you are doing ‘Bharatnatyam’
[a form of Indian classical dance] or something

241
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,160
like that. Showing all your moods – in five
minutes you show ten moods. This is the growth

242
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:55,160
within you, which will show. So, we have to
have our growth, and for growth, let us be

243
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:03,690
silent within. Let us not react to others
- “This person is like that, that person

244
00:37:04,249 --> 00:37:11,249
is like that.” What about yourself? Also
there… other ways. Like, I tell somebody

245
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:19,979
that, you see, you have this problem. So that
person immediately goes to the second person

246
00:37:19,979 --> 00:37:23,509
and says, “You see, Mother told me that
you too have this problem, better look after

247
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:28,360
it.” I didn’t tell that person; I told
you. Keep it to yourself. So, ‘Mother says’

248
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:35,360
is to be given up, absolutely. If Mother has
to say, She’ll say it. Why should you communicate;

249
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:42,370
why should you say? I never asked you to say
that.

250
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:49,370
Understanding Sahaja Yoga is very simple,
extremely simple, when you understand one

251
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:04,530
thing - that you have to have your innocence
intact. Now, “How to get to innocence?”

252
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:14,950
people will say. How to get to innocence?
It’s a vicious circle. How to get to innocence?

253
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:18,080
– It’s a very vicious circle. We have
to get to innocence, through what? Your ego

254
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,290
or superego? How will you get to innocence?
Mother says, “Don’t raise your Kundalini.”

255
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:27,160
I mean, I am sitting here - people are just
doing like that. What’s happening? I am

256
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:34,160
sitting here - your Kundalini is up there
on your head. What are you raising? Now how

257
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:43,940
to manage is the problem. Very simple it is.
In the beginning I said, “Let your Guru

258
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:56,910
reside in your heart.” How to manage – why?
Let Mother manage. Mother is managing me.

259
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:07,180
Keep it at that. Your right side will clear.
Your left side will clear when you say, “Nobody

260
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:22,290
can manage me but Mother can manage me”
- two things together. Things will work out.

261
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:27,469
Thank God you have somebody like Me, who is
sitting here, who can say so. Think of those

262
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:32,800
who never had anyone to tell them, or to be
in their presence to say that I can manage

263
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:39,800
this, or you can manage that. That now you
can balance. Allow your Kundalini to grow.

264
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:52,060
Everything works out. Like this house when
I purchased, or when they purchased, or who

265
00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:02,650
purchased - So many questions and complications
– How, how, how? But it’s worked; it’s

266
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:10,550
there, quite intact; nothing has fallen off;
nothing has gone wrong. I had to shout once,

267
00:40:12,229 --> 00:40:19,229
all right. But let Me shout, you don’t start
shouting. As soon as I finish, they will take

268
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:33,440
a loudspeaker, shout even louder. “Mother
said so, you are this, that.” I am saying

269
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:41,290
about you, (to) whom are you preaching? But
only, you must know that when I tell you something,

270
00:40:42,459 --> 00:40:49,459
please do it; please do it. See because I
know quite a lot. Because I am Guru, your

271
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:58,880
Guru; because I am the Guru of all the Gurus.
And those who is a real Guru, knows that my

272
00:41:00,969 --> 00:41:07,969
Mother knows everything. She is knowledge
Herself. If She says something, it means something.

273
00:41:13,989 --> 00:41:20,989
And even I may test you sometimes, doesn’t
matter. That’s how you become the Guru.

274
00:41:24,459 --> 00:41:31,459
Shivaji had a Guru called Ramadasa. In those
days, Gurus used to take lot of test of their

275
00:41:36,749 --> 00:41:42,330
disciples. I never took your test or anything.
But you are testing yourself, that’s all.

276
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:49,330
And his Guru one day said that, “I think
I need the milk of a tigress. I have to drink

277
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:56,440
the milk of a tigress.” Half of them died
and most of them didn’t hear it. Shivaji

278
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:08,160
said, “All right. I’ll get you.” He
went in the jungles. He saw a tigress and

279
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:20,900
there were little little, small little children
she had, and those cubs were lying on the

280
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:31,930
side. He went and he just said ‘Namaskar’
[Hindi word meaning salutation] to her. (He)

281
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:38,820
Said, “My Guru wants your milk,” that’s
all – because Gurus are ‘Parabrahma’

282
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,979
[Hindi/Sanskrit meaning God Almighty], their
orders are listened to by the ‘Parabrahma’.

283
00:42:42,979 --> 00:42:49,979
“My Guru, Shri Ramadasa, wants your milk.
So please, will you give me your milk?”

284
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:59,100
So nicely she got up, stood up before him.
He milked her and took that milk for his Guru.

285
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:13,219
This is what it is. Have you understood the
meaning of ‘Gurupada’ [Hindi/Sanskrit

286
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:17,380
meaning the status/position of Guru]?

287
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:24,380
When you become absolutely one with the desires
of your Guru, you achieve the position of

288
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:34,380
a Guru. But if you still have certain ideas
about it, then Shri Ramadasa has said that

289
00:43:39,469 --> 00:43:43,940
then God ‘Alpadhrishtapaye … [not clear]’
sees your little courage [?] - “All right,

290
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:50,940
go ahead. Break your heads and then come back.
I’ll fix them up.” So it is important

291
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:59,300
that we should do one thing seriously – is
to take your Mother very seriously when it

292
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,110
comes to some request.

293
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:09,540
Of course, in English language I always say,
“Please, will you do it?” Or I may even

294
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:15,610
say, “I am afraid will you do it?” But
that should make no difference. Other day

295
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:20,540
only, when we were coming for Cardiff, I said
that the first class will be coming on the

296
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:24,950
other side. But everybody at the platform
said, “No, it is coming on the other side.”

297
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:30,800
I said, “All right.” We sat down, and
then they announced that the first class is

298
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,170
coming on this side. So we all again walked
back. It’s all right for those people, but

299
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:44,170
what about you? Many a times you have seen.
And at the asking of a Guru, if something

300
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:52,370
goes wrong also, it should be always accepted
as the law of the Divine - because, Guru is

301
00:44:53,880 --> 00:45:00,880
the giver of the law of the Divine, not the
worldly laws. The law of the Divine He gives

302
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:06,780
you. The law of the Divine you understand,
then you have to surrender to that law of

303
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:13,780
the Divine, and that’s how you will become
masters of that law.

304
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:20,660
Today, for a Guru Puja, I can go on talking
to you. But today, I would request you to

305
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:27,660
understand that whilst surrendering, as Islam
is called, was so important -
that if God is your Guru, let Him guide you;

306
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:52,700
Thy will be done. Let us not guide ourselves
and also, sometimes they try to guide the

307
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:06,070
Guru as well. Then the Guru plays tricks,
and then you fall into the trap of tricks,

308
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:10,979
and then you find it’s too much.

309
00:46:10,979 --> 00:46:17,979
It is better to listen to what the Guru is
telling you, and better to do it. Whatever

310
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:27,940
the Guru says is all right. Gurus can ask
you anything. I mean, I am quite a nice Guru.

311
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:37,150
Like, this Ramadasa himself asked his disciples
that, “I have got a very bad, septic, big

312
00:46:42,749 --> 00:46:49,749
boil and please try to suck it out because
it is full of pus.” Imagine. So they didn’t

313
00:46:55,259 --> 00:47:01,739
know what to do, you know. How to suck the
pus of the Guru is too much. But Shivaji came

314
00:47:01,739 --> 00:47:07,370
forward. He took down his hat, sat down next
to him, started sucking. People said, “How

315
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:14,370
is it?” Said, “It’s very sweet, very
nice.” Actually, he had tied a mango there.

316
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:25,670
That is how the Gurus took lot of tests. I
have never taken your test, and you do not

317
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:47,840
take the tests of others. Leave them to Me,
I’ll manage all of them one by one. Whatever

318
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:54,840
has to happen happens. In Sahaja Yoga, to
think that 100% will be rich, healthy, wealthy

319
00:47:56,699 --> 00:48:03,699
and on top of the world, is a nonsense. If
we become very wealthy, then there will be

320
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:15,800
recession because others will be very poor.
If we become very healthy then nobody will

321
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:26,540
come near us; if we all look like wrestlers,
who will come near us? If we become very wise,

322
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:35,440
then people will be frightened of such wise
people; nothing will… they cannot understand

323
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:42,440
anything, it will go over their heads. So
let us be in the center. We should be wealthy,

324
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:49,850
but not too much; we should be healthy, but
not too much; we should be wise, but not too

325
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:58,360
much. So far, so good – that’s how we
should move.

326
00:48:58,499 --> 00:49:05,280
So we keep to our ‘Maryadas’ and we become
beautiful Sahaja Yogis, who will be congenial

327
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:12,280
to others, who will be able to get others
to us, who will be able to project an image

328
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:24,390
of magnetic personalities. And this is what
we have to do. If we try to show off in any

329
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:33,040
way - like I have seen people try to show
off unnecessarily – there is no need. Just

330
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:40,040
be in the background. If you are very much
in the background, just be in the foreground.

331
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:51,270
Try to balance yourself. Try to watch yourself
and guide yourself and tell yourself, “Become

332
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:59,630
your own Gurus.” Judge yourself how far
you are in the center, how far you are growing,

333
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:07,199
how much growth have you achieved. Are you
still attached to small things here and there?

334
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:14,199
Are you still bothered about small things?
– “Mother, I should have got 80% marks,

335
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:22,420
I have got only 75% marks.” Oh God. Because
he got 75% marks, there is something good

336
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:31,070
has to come out. He has to learn a lesson,
maybe. Or maybe that he has to take some other

337
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:38,070
course. Maybe something that is good for his
ascent has to work out – is to be seen if

338
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:45,540
you have to be Gurus. If you can’t see that,
how can others see that? This is to be realized.

339
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:54,699
Not to be put in the mind, but to be realized
in the heart. In the realm of your heart you

340
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:07,640
have to realize it; you have to understand
it in the realm of your heart. Nice that we

341
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:17,180
are in England, the heart of the universe,
that we are talking about opening our hearts.

342
00:51:21,699 --> 00:51:28,699
If you have to put Me there, is the ocean
of love, and to contain this ocean of love,

343
00:51:28,729 --> 00:51:35,729
you have to have a very, very large heart
– bigger than your personalities, bigger

344
00:52:07,989 --> 00:52:14,989
than your countries, bigger than this world,
bigger than this universe.

345
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:57,600
May God bless you.

346
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:13,090
End of transcript.
