1
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:17,761
Yesterday’s experience was that 
the whole day I had to spend it

2
00:00:17,786 --> 00:00:23,206
with police people explaining to them.

3
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:30,805
And now I feel that in Maharashtra, 
there is a rule of Mafia.

4
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:38,952
And that it is for us to face it 
and we have to prove it.

5
00:00:38,977 --> 00:00:42,270
I am sorry some people were hurt 
so badly

6
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:45,160
and I'll think after Puja they’ll take 
you to the hospital.

7
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:50,831
Here there is a very nice hospital where 
we have very good doctors.

8
00:00:50,856 --> 00:01:04,950
And then I would request you 
to know that,

9
00:01:05,805 --> 00:01:14,868
the evil and the good, always has 
to struggle and fight.

10
00:01:14,893 --> 00:01:24,226
Formerly in this great country of 
Maharashtra all the saints were tortured,

11
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:31,531
to such an extent that it is amazing 
how despite all that

12
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:38,773
they kept the banner of spirituality 
so high.

13
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:48,945
They are still existing, the same people,

14
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,428
who have tortured the saints and I think 
they are the same people

15
00:01:53,453 --> 00:02:00,653
who have behaved in such a bad manner 
towards you all.

16
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:10,219
This kind of ego-trip builds up 
in everyone

17
00:02:10,244 --> 00:02:14,265
– even in among sahaja yogis, it does 
build up.

18
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:20,777
And they are all the time 
on a different scene.

19
00:02:20,802 --> 00:02:30,072
This is like Hitler's style of behavior 
that you pick up some sort of an issue.

20
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:33,388
An issue could be anything, like they 
are saying that

21
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:36,410
“we are trying to remove all the blind 
faiths”. I mean,

22
00:02:36,435 --> 00:02:41,795
I've done this for eighteen years, 
what can they do more than that?

23
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,227
And I have removed all your blind faiths 
in all kinds of stupid things

24
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:48,799
that the religion, so-called, was teaching 
you.

25
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:53,082
In every religion, there is no question 
of only Hindu religion.

26
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:55,708
But here they dare not say anything 
about the Muslims

27
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:58,540
because the Hindus are very mild people.

28
00:02:58,565 --> 00:03:02,386
They (the muslims) want that 
all the temples must be removed,

29
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:06,243
all the deities must be thrown away.

30
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:12,490
This is all I think Rajneesh is their guru 
because he made a...

31
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:23,830
he made an exhibition where he tried 
to show

32
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:28,002
that Ganapati was something very funny 
and all that.

33
00:03:28,027 --> 00:03:30,732
Now medically you know in Sahaja Yoga,

34
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:35,975
that without Ganesha we cannot cure 
many diseases. Is a fact.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,158
So a stupid fellow talking like that, 
has become now the guru of these people

36
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:43,731
who are discarded all over the world 
and who have been insulted.

37
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:48,936
So these few newspapers have made 
him as a guru, perhaps that

38
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:53,290
they are following his methods of saying 
that we should be,

39
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:56,793
we should be rid of all these ideas 
and this and that.

40
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:04,210
But they have gone to the extent that 
all the spirituality is an illusion.

41
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:09,790
It's such a joke. And that we should 
give up

42
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:16,611
all the, all readings and all understanding 
about spirituality.

43
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:21,173
But they do not know that their heritage 
is spirituality.

44
00:04:21,198 --> 00:04:24,636
And the whole world depends on that.

45
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:29,129
The whole world, because when the people 
took to industrial development,

46
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:32,304
you know how far they have gone 
and how much they are lost.

47
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:36,142
And how far you were in that mess. 
And how you came back

48
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:38,924
because of Sahaja Yoga’s spirituality.

49
00:04:38,964 --> 00:04:46,732
Now if this nourishment from the roots 
of spirituality

50
00:04:46,757 --> 00:04:51,591
does not reach the West, the real 
knowledge, as it is in Sahaja Yoga,

51
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:56,405
the West will be finished. West will be 
finished, you know that very well.

52
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,934
There is no joy, there is no love, 
there is no poetry,

53
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,230
there is no music, there is no culture.

54
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:13,210
But as you have understood that now 
these people have now started

55
00:05:13,235 --> 00:05:16,126
talking about “no religion” 
“no religion”,

56
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:19,259
like many of your western countries 
have also done,

57
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:21,762
specially Russia has done that way,

58
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:24,706
that there is nothing like God, 
there is nothing like this and that.

59
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:28,745
And now after all that now they 
are coming to God.

60
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,139
So now we’ll have to go through 
another circle.

61
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:35,734
But they are only hardly twenty people.

62
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,172
So even one fellow who is like Hitler, 
can destroy the whole thing.

63
00:05:42,197 --> 00:05:48,546
This is a very important thing - to destroy 
something you need only one person.

64
00:05:48,571 --> 00:05:56,814
But to sustain and to construct 
you need many people.

65
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:03,904
To drown a ship, you need only 
one hole in it.

66
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:10,075
But to build the ship, you take months 
together.

67
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,257
So the work that is done for these 
last eighteen years

68
00:06:14,282 --> 00:06:17,965
of Sahaja Yoga, is really tremendous.

69
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,165
And the truth about it, you know 
for definite,

70
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:26,252
that it has helped so many people. Though 
we have been going from ups and downs

71
00:06:26,277 --> 00:06:29,874
and all that, we've been doing wrong 
things, no doubt about it,

72
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:36,353
but still, now we are quite established 
and we know what Sahaja Yoga is.

73
00:06:36,378 --> 00:06:43,564
The experience of Sahaja Yoga you all 
have had. We have seen so many,

74
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:47,590
(towards someone…) “What is she doing? 
Please be seated”.

75
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:53,096
Miraculous photographs you have seen, 
so many miracles in your life day to day.

76
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:58,319
Every day there are miracles. Now to say 
there is no God

77
00:06:58,344 --> 00:07:02,285
is impossible for you because you have 
felt the miracles

78
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,669
of this All-pervading Power, 
the Paramchaitanya.

79
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:10,115
And also all the religions are explained

80
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:15,650
and the complete integration of them 
has been brought in.

81
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:21,113
But for that we have to know, as I told 
you in Brahmapuri,

82
00:07:21,138 --> 00:07:25,586
that the sahaja yogis have to know that 
they have to become dynamic.

83
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:32,698
Whatever energies you have got, whatever 
you have achieved within yourselves,

84
00:07:32,723 --> 00:07:37,798
is not sufficient enough. You have 
to manifest.

85
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:42,185
And in that dynamism, I think people 
get lost.

86
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,538
I have seen that some leaders become 
horrid.

87
00:07:45,563 --> 00:07:50,348
I mean, sometimes their Vishuddhis could 
be horrible, then their heart goes out.

88
00:07:50,384 --> 00:07:57,563
So you should not allow anybody (to be) 
a leader for more than one month.

89
00:07:57,588 --> 00:08:02,765
It goes off. I have seen it. Because your 
balloon has been already bloated

90
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:08,441
and again it gets re-bloated in no time. 
(speaking in Marathi…).

91
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:18,546
They have religiously kept all the Indians 
outside, I think. (speaking in Marathi…).

92
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:24,477
I mean, he is the organizer here.

93
00:08:26,536 --> 00:08:29,803
(speaking Marathi)

94
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:37,800
So the heritage of our country is 
spirituality.

95
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:44,340
And this is the nourishment.

96
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:53,619
Only the one-sided growth in the West, due 
to machinery or whatever you may call it,

97
00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:58,413
has ruined it completely.

98
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:01,705
And one-sided growth in this country, 
and all such countries,

99
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:08,938
where religion has become a blind faith, 
has also ruined it.

100
00:09:08,963 --> 00:09:13,726
But in the center lies Sahaja Yoga.

101
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:20,821
Now your wisdom, your sense, 
is so apparent.

102
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:26,597
I mean, people have been to all kinds 
of gurus here and have been to everyone,

103
00:09:26,622 --> 00:09:31,068
but they don’t know anything about 
anything. Except for remembering by heart

104
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:35,464
- some these Hare Ramas, talk about, 
“Rama” “Rama” – like that.

105
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:38,419
While you know everything about Kundalini. 
You know how to raise it.

106
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,799
You know how to give Realization. You know 
what are the diseases are caused,

107
00:09:41,824 --> 00:09:45,916
how to cure it and everything and 
everything and everything.

108
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:52,003
I mean, it has come to such a stage 
that nobody asks Me any questions.

109
00:09:54,381 --> 00:09:58,094
Otherwise, in the beginning in London, 
My lecture was for five minutes

110
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:03,651
and the questions were for the rest 
of the time.

111
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:08,282
So now you know so much.

112
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:17,086
And you accept which cannot be explained 
also, because you know that.

113
00:10:17,111 --> 00:10:22,164
For example, somebody will ask Me, 
“Mother, how do you get these photographs?”

114
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:25,763
Why are we talking about it?

115
00:10:25,788 --> 00:10:32,410
I know how it happens, who is doing 
this trick. But I don’t want to tell you.

116
00:10:35,606 --> 00:10:37,760
Moreover, if you demand something, 
I’ll never tell you.

117
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:39,997
That’s one of the characters I have.

118
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:45,045
Ah, if you come with humble thing 
and honest desire to know,

119
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,974
then I can tell you about everything, 
that you want to know.

120
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:50,991
But if you just want to force Me and say 
that, “I challenge you”,

121
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:53,909
I said, “I also challenge you. 
Get out of here”.

122
00:10:53,934 --> 00:10:57,075
Like that. You see, it doesn’t react, 
that way.

123
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:03,328
So it is just the temperament 
of the Divine

124
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:10,292
that if you are convex, the Divine 
becomes convex also,

125
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:15,634
and fights and says, “No, get out”. 
If you become concave,

126
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:24,194
then it emits and gives knowledge, 
or receives knowledge.

127
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:30,185
So one has to be humble. That’s very 
important part of it. One has to be humble.

128
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:38,465
So the awareness, again I talk about 
awareness,

129
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,537
within you should be that, how much 
we have come to know about ourselves.

130
00:11:43,562 --> 00:11:47,016
How much we have to come to know 
about others?

131
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:54,635
How much we know about our own being? 
How much we know about chakras?

132
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,501
In such a short time, how did we come 
to know about it?

133
00:11:58,526 --> 00:12:02,550
Like we should know, if you are dealing 
with a computer,

134
00:12:02,575 --> 00:12:09,809
and you know how computer works, how 
it acts, how it is programmed, everything

135
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:15,749
without programming it, without working 
it out, without building it up.

136
00:12:15,774 --> 00:12:19,026
I mean, if you build it up, you know 
how it works. But without doing that

137
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:23,098
just to know a computer how it works, 
and all the machinery about it,

138
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:26,722
is a tremendous knowledge.

139
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:30,399
And this is what has to be there 
for all of us

140
00:12:30,424 --> 00:12:34,595
to know what we are there as human beings, 
and what we have to do

141
00:12:34,722 --> 00:12:39,685
to emancipate the other human beings.

142
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:44,700
Of course, I shouldn’t say that every 
sahaja yogi is of that level, no.

143
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:50,037
Or comes up, but everybody is trying. 
Nobody has denied Sahaja Yoga.

144
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:54,423
Nobody has said it’s not true. Everybody 
is trying to get

145
00:12:54,448 --> 00:13:00,824
higher and higher in his state 
of spirituality which doesn’t speak.

146
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:07,447
It acts. It doesn’t manipulate. It acts.

147
00:13:07,472 --> 00:13:11,896
And we've seen it acts in so many 
miraculous ways.

148
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:17,514
So first to know about all these things, 
after feeling that Paramchaitanya,

149
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:21,791
is different from just to talk about it.

150
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:25,897
Many have talked about it, but you have 
never felt it.

151
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:30,826
Now you have felt it, you have verified it, 
you have experimented it.

152
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:36,277
And you have found it that, this is 
something absolutely real.

153
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:44,741
In science, as Dr. Khan was telling Me, 
that in science,

154
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:51,415
the one theory which is established today 
might be refuted tomorrow.

155
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,953
Another theory that is established, 
may be refuted.

156
00:13:55,978 --> 00:14:00,181
It goes on. So that no theory is 
an absolute theory.

157
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:04,979
But in Sahaja Yoga for the last eighteen 
years, whatever I have been saying

158
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:11,240
is the truth. And is absolute. It cannot 
be challenged again.

159
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:14,619
Nobody can say, “No, Mother, 
it is not so”.

160
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:20,073
A simple thing is, somebody comes to you 
and you say, the other day it happened,

161
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:26,561
one doctor was there in Aurangabad, 
and he said that,

162
00:14:29,876 --> 00:14:35,103
“I have never had any guru”. But his left 
Swadhistana…

163
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:38,652
and he was looking very disturbed. He was 
a sahaja yogi in a way,

164
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:43,385
not looking normal. “I have pain 
in the stomach,” and this and that.

165
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:48,858
I asked him, “You had no guru?”, 
he said, “No”. (speaking Marathi).

166
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:07,984
So now as science has progressed 
we can see clearly

167
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:13,076
that it has not got the theory 
which is absolute.

168
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:18,953
But in Sahaja Yoga, as I told you, 
there was a gentleman, a doctor,

169
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,403
who was denying, he said, “I had no guru”. 
I asked him, “Do you read books?”,

170
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:28,693
“Yes – he said - I read Vivekananda”. 
I said, “That’s it”.

171
00:16:28,718 --> 00:16:32,425
He said he was reading the book 
of a particular guru.

172
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:37,935
We gave a bandhan to that guru 
and this fellow felt alright.

173
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,649
There are so many things one has to know 
about.

174
00:16:44,674 --> 00:16:52,359
Little, little things are there, which must 
be understood in Sahaja Yoga.

175
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:59,039
And one should do it according to them, 
because it is for your benevolence.

176
00:16:59,064 --> 00:17:06,832
Now supposing I say, “Just do these 
things”. If you don’t accept Me,

177
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:10,509
why am I telling you? I am not telling you 
because I have to gain anything.

178
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:15,857
But is for your good. Now if you don’t 
want to accept me or if you react,

179
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:19,865
is not going to help you. Sahaja Yoga 
is not for Me, is for you.

180
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:24,094
Now if you are, truthfully, honestly, 
if you are seekers,

181
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:29,334
then you must know that "My aim 
is to rise spiritually".

182
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:32,035
Now in science you have risen quite a lot, 
you are fed up with it.

183
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,054
Now you’re back into spirituality

184
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:38,827
and for spirituality you have to be 
a subtler person.

185
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:43,199
And for these subtleties you have 
to give up all your conditionings.

186
00:17:43,224 --> 00:17:47,157
All funny conditionings are to be given 
and the worst that you have,

187
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:53,212
is the ego part. It just jumps up. I have 
seen that appointing people leaders

188
00:17:53,245 --> 00:17:58,210
has been the greatest harmful thing 
I have done to them.

189
00:17:58,235 --> 00:18:02,459
So many of them just got lost, because 
they became leaders.

190
00:18:02,484 --> 00:18:07,428
I mean, a kind of a Hitler, enters 
into them.

191
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,677
So this is one of the worst conditionings 
we have.

192
00:18:10,702 --> 00:18:17,369
We have to be very careful that we don’t 
try to assert our ego on others.

193
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:20,863
When we become leaders or a some position 
is given to us,

194
00:18:20,888 --> 00:18:29,970
or ask something is to be achieved 
through your authority.

195
00:18:29,995 --> 00:18:32,837
Only we have the authority of God.

196
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:39,265
Unless and until we become humble 
like that, nothing is going to flow.

197
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:46,193
You can see that, that the sea lies 
the lowest in height.

198
00:18:46,218 --> 00:18:50,336
And all the rivers and everything flows 
to the sea.

199
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:54,809
And from the sea only rises the rain.

200
00:18:54,834 --> 00:19:00,373
Supposing sea was somewhere on top 
of Himalayas,

201
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:10,843
we would have been all living 
in the Sahara desert.

202
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:17,525
Is a very simple thing, is to be humble 
- that’s first sign - is to be humble,

203
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:26,492
is to be non-violent, because we depend 
on the All-pervading Power.

204
00:19:26,517 --> 00:19:31,498
It is a power which is completely 
integrated within us.

205
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:38,065
Only we are not the ones, we want 
to be aware of it.

206
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:43,508
So this ignorance, this blindness, 
if it disappears from us,

207
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:48,654
that Divine Power will manifest.

208
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:53,891
But our styles are so complicated.

209
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:57,645
Sometimes I just don’t understand,

210
00:19:58,243 --> 00:20:03,808
why we have complicated ourselves 
so much.

211
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:10,430
I mean, look at the flowers, look at 
the leaves; they are on a tree, supposing.

212
00:20:10,455 --> 00:20:16,709
Automatically they will open out 
to the sun. Automatically.

213
00:20:16,734 --> 00:20:20,147
You don’t have to take a leaf towards 
the sun, not at all.

214
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:22,951
Automatically it opens out. You have 
seen it every day.

215
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:26,209
Automatically. Because it requires sun.

216
00:20:26,234 --> 00:20:32,446
Now you want to have spirit in yourself. 
You want to get to spirit.

217
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:37,632
So automatically you should, really 
automatically, if that is your desire,

218
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:45,672
you should, with your own desire only, 
should get to the light of the spirit.

219
00:20:45,697 --> 00:20:53,419
And should grow in that spirit to know 
that this is what you have to achieve.

220
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:59,409
But small things disturb you,

221
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:03,791
like somebody doesn’t get married. Next 
day you see the face of that person,

222
00:21:03,816 --> 00:21:08,913
as if somebody has died in the family 
he is sitting there.

223
00:21:08,941 --> 00:21:15,956
Really, I have seen it. Immediately I make 
out who has not been yet engaged.

224
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:22,932
Then after marriage I find again 
the same sort of nonsense.

225
00:21:22,957 --> 00:21:28,284
Because they are analyzing, “I want 
this kind, I want that kind. I want”.

226
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:33,515
I mean, whatever is available here 
is available.

227
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:43,663
Like on the ship, you don’t have any 
problems, because you have no solutions.

228
00:21:43,688 --> 00:21:46,106
If you are moving on a ship and you 
just ask for something,

229
00:21:46,131 --> 00:21:50,346
“Oh no, not available here,” finished.

230
00:21:53,985 --> 00:21:58,324
But then you lose all the fun of Sahaja 
Yoga for a small little nonsensical thing.

231
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:03,985
If not this, next year. What is 
so important?

232
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:10,437
I mean, certain there are limitations 
of age, height, this, that.

233
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:15,285
Then even if you arrange their marriages, 
is very interesting,

234
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,140
then they come and tell you, “No, no, 
I would not like to marry this girl”.

235
00:22:18,165 --> 00:22:21,138
Why? “Because I want such and such”. 
All right, then we find.

236
00:22:21,163 --> 00:22:24,075
“No, no, no, she is no good. She has 
these things,” so move that.

237
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,663
I mean this is not the way. You are not 
here to choose a girl for yourself.

238
00:22:28,688 --> 00:22:32,511
Then there is another one who can say, 
“All right, I came down, I saw one girl

239
00:22:32,536 --> 00:22:39,449
and fell in love”. So you fall in love 
and get out. This nonsense going on.

240
00:22:39,474 --> 00:22:46,282
See, you must have certain amount 
of dignity. You are all sahaja yogis.

241
00:22:46,314 --> 00:22:49,384
And when I see all this kind 
of stupid attitude,

242
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:54,824
I say these people can never gain 
in Sahaja Yoga.

243
00:22:55,789 --> 00:23:01,513
In India you will be surprised. I mean,

244
00:23:02,251 --> 00:23:07,033
even I was married to a man who was 
from another, another place.

245
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:11,732
Absolutely different country, different 
religion, different everything.

246
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,890
And a different person.

247
00:23:13,915 --> 00:23:18,348
So one can say that it was a very 
unconventional marriage, one can say.

248
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:24,251
But I would never touch this man 
or he would never touch me.

249
00:23:24,276 --> 00:23:28,943
And if he would talk to me, 
in the presence of others only.

250
00:23:30,264 --> 00:23:35,304
And despite that, our marriage is very 
strong and we are very happy couple.

251
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:38,088
With all these nonsense you go on doing, 
bringing it to the level

252
00:23:38,113 --> 00:23:41,833
of physical appearances, physical 
understanding, your ego,

253
00:23:41,858 --> 00:23:47,434
“I want this, I want that”, you find that 
just after the marriage you get off.

254
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:50,486
You start analyzing. That’s why 
I am telling you today.

255
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:56,062
I may not able to talk to you about 
marriages later on. That be careful.

256
00:23:56,087 --> 00:24:00,320
And that’s how you have brought 
problems to Me.

257
00:24:01,603 --> 00:24:05,564
You see, once you accept that in Sahaja 
Yoga you are going to marry,

258
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:09,553
then you must accept that Sahaja Yoga 
has its own norms and styles

259
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:14,527
by which it will marry you and will look 
after your marriage and will bless you.

260
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:19,120
But if you start analyzing 
and misbehaving,

261
00:24:19,145 --> 00:24:23,164
it’s not going to work out, and you 
will have lots of problems.

262
00:24:23,189 --> 00:24:30,650
Either you believe in the All-pervading 
Power and surrender your ego to it,

263
00:24:30,675 --> 00:24:35,161
or else you have your ego.

264
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:42,429
Sahaja Yoga is decided by Me, 
by Paramchaitanya.

265
00:24:42,454 --> 00:24:49,950
Now sometimes in Sahaja Yoga it may 
happen that, maybe, it may not work out.

266
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:58,456
But invariably I have seen, invariably, 
is none of My faults. None of My faults.

267
00:24:58,481 --> 00:25:02,005
Mostly the leaders have given wrong 
information,

268
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:07,141
mostly the leaders didn’t talk about 
the, about the background.

269
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:17,458
Or maybe that there has been some sort 
of an ego-trip with the people,

270
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:21,910
and they are the ones who are creating 
problems for us.

271
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:27,878
But things work out. Slowly, gradually 
we can improve. We must have patience.

272
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:32,133
If only on first day you start demanding 
something doing that,

273
00:25:32,158 --> 00:25:35,731
it’s not going to work out.

274
00:25:36,982 --> 00:25:42,635
We must learn to give, in marriage 
it’s an adjustment of giving.

275
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,979
It is no adjustment of demand.

276
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:52,075
We have to give. We have to sacrifice.

277
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:57,040
What is there with you to sacrifice is 
all these rubbish things.

278
00:25:57,065 --> 00:26:01,183
Your spirit you cannot sacrifice, 
so you keep to your spirit.

279
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:04,896
And live with it. What is you going 
to sacrifice?

280
00:26:04,921 --> 00:26:08,680
I mean, what do you have to give?

281
00:26:09,548 --> 00:26:13,515
And then only you will enjoy.

282
00:26:14,563 --> 00:26:22,496
Then only you will enjoy the spirit. 
I am getting cool breeze from you.

283
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:32,464
So I want you to be very great sahaja 
yogis, very great.

284
00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:39,054
And you should really manifest 
your powers of wisdom.

285
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:42,361
Now men have ego part and women 
have another side,

286
00:26:42,386 --> 00:26:46,559
is that they are very dull sometimes. 
Extremely dull.

287
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:52,541
They don’t think they have to play a very 
dynamic role, while they are the shaktis.

288
00:26:52,566 --> 00:26:57,644
Like they will not even clap hands, 
they will not even have their torches

289
00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:04,054
to see what’s happening. Nothing. They just 
think they are just a, sort of parasites.

290
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:09,379
Just coming here as wives or sisters, 
or whatever it is, wearing saris.

291
00:27:09,404 --> 00:27:13,692
No, you have to be extremely dynamic.

292
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:17,551
You must know all about Sahaja Yoga. 
You must know all about chakras.

293
00:27:17,576 --> 00:27:22,196
You should know everything. In India, 
when in the ancient times,

294
00:27:22,221 --> 00:27:25,817
they used to teach them about God, 
religion and all that.

295
00:27:25,842 --> 00:27:30,560
So many great ladies we had, Gargi 
and Maitreyi and all those,

296
00:27:30,585 --> 00:27:34,169
who were very learned women.

297
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:40,004
So in no way you should be just women who 
do not know anything of Sahaja Yoga.

298
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:43,862
Sahaja Yoga is not only meant for men; 
it’s meant for you, much more for you.

299
00:27:43,887 --> 00:27:49,192
Because you are shakti and I am your 
Mother. So I find the women lack that.

300
00:27:49,217 --> 00:27:53,008
They are more worried about the saris, 
the this and that, and I mean,

301
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:59,260
now from the hair-dressing they have 
come to saris. That’s what I feel.

302
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:03,911
Well, it’s just the same.

303
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:09,332
Of course sari is a very good dress. 
It’s nice to wear.

304
00:28:09,357 --> 00:28:12,942
By that we give lot of encouragement 
to our weavers in India.

305
00:28:12,967 --> 00:28:16,972
It’s very artistic, and good that 
represents also

306
00:28:16,997 --> 00:28:23,140
a very lady-like feminine thing. But that 
doesn’t mean you should become so feminine

307
00:28:23,165 --> 00:28:27,360
that you don’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

308
00:28:27,385 --> 00:28:34,339
I have seen women don’t know where 
the centers are of the feet.

309
00:28:35,629 --> 00:28:40,995
Indian women know. Men do know…. 
Indian women know,

310
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:45,787
but the Western women don’t know, 
so many of them.

311
00:28:45,812 --> 00:28:49,120
They don’t know about chakras. They don’t 
know how to raise the Kundalini.

312
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:51,419
They don’t know what’s the problem is.

313
00:28:51,444 --> 00:28:54,940
So once you have left that life, where 
you are wearing a sari,

314
00:28:54,965 --> 00:28:59,970
doesn’t mean now that you have become 
a woman in the gosha.

315
00:28:59,995 --> 00:29:04,042
Gosha is the one where they have to wear 
chadar; chadar, they call it.

316
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:09,102
No, sari means you can also be 
very dynamic.

317
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:13,690
The same sari that you are wearing, 
even the saris of the nine yards,

318
00:29:13,715 --> 00:29:17,982
we have had queens who fought 
the English.

319
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:22,410
You have must heard about Jhansi Ki Rani. 
She was hardly of any age.

320
00:29:22,435 --> 00:29:27,232
She jumped from eighty feet height with 
her child behind her. She was a widow.

321
00:29:27,257 --> 00:29:33,012
And she fought the English. Left and right. 
And when she was killed,

322
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:39,231
the person who was here, the Englishman, 
he said, the governor,

323
00:29:39,256 --> 00:29:45,876
he said, “We have won the war but 
the glory goes to Jhansi ki Rani.”

324
00:29:47,057 --> 00:29:53,318
Then we had another one, Chand-bibi, 
another lady, in a ...

325
00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:03,072
Ahmednagar; she fought. We had 
so many women like that.

326
00:30:03,097 --> 00:30:07,750
Tremendous type of women we had, 
though they lived like women.

327
00:30:07,775 --> 00:30:15,019
We had Padmini, we had Noorjahan, 
we had Ahilyabai, so many women.

328
00:30:15,044 --> 00:30:19,705
They were not manly at all. 
Very woman-like.

329
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:24,947
There was the last one was Shivaji’s, 
Shivaji’s daughter-in-law.

330
00:30:24,972 --> 00:30:27,787
She was only seventeen years of age, 
seventeen years.

331
00:30:27,812 --> 00:30:32,106
And she fought this Aurangzeb and she 
is the one who defeated him.

332
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:36,246
Nobody could manage this Aurangzeb 
horrible fellow, she defeated him.

333
00:30:36,271 --> 00:30:41,624
So though, you see, the Indian women look 
so docile and simple,

334
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:50,150
but when it comes to their personality, 
they are capable of tremendous things.

335
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:59,994
So this character when you are wearing 
the saris you must also know how to tie up

336
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:04,277
the backside and to fight.

337
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:11,898
Otherwise you have not got the Sahaj 
culture in you.

338
00:31:11,923 --> 00:31:19,079
Either you are very dominating or you are 
so docile like cabbages.

339
00:31:19,104 --> 00:31:26,832
You must understand that we have 
to be alert, very alert.

340
00:31:26,857 --> 00:31:30,908
And Mother depends on us. On our own 
personalities,

341
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:35,302
that the way we are going to develop 
ourselves, our children, our husbands,

342
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:39,207
our society of Sahaja Yoga, the whole 
of Vishwa Nirmal Dharma.

343
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:43,824
Is the woman who makes the society.

344
00:31:44,441 --> 00:31:53,735
The whole universe is in the hands 
of a woman who creates children.

345
00:31:54,697 --> 00:32:00,470
So the stupid ideas of romanticism 
and all this nonsense,

346
00:32:00,495 --> 00:32:03,657
has to be finished. The possession 
of husband –

347
00:32:03,682 --> 00:32:07,910
“What time you came,” “When did you go,” 
“Where did you go,”

348
00:32:07,935 --> 00:32:11,776
and here the women when Shivaji 
started his fight

349
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:18,713
they used to cut their finger, thumb, 
and used to put the tika

350
00:32:18,738 --> 00:32:21,934
on the forehead of the husbands who 
were going in the war

351
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:26,774
and they said, “Don’t come showing 
your back”.

352
00:32:28,994 --> 00:32:31,813
Such great women we have had 
in this Maharashtra,

353
00:32:31,838 --> 00:32:34,950
where you find them to be so mild.

354
00:32:34,975 --> 00:32:39,963
If it comes to their country, if it comes 
to their own personality,

355
00:32:39,988 --> 00:32:46,829
to their own chastity or anything, they are 
tremendous. Just like lionesses.

356
00:32:46,861 --> 00:32:50,723
So with this sari lots of things go 
hand in hand.

357
00:32:50,748 --> 00:32:54,071
Is not only the sari you are wearing, 
but you are representing

358
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:59,482
something very dynamic within 
yourself.

359
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:05,999
Now when we talk about our further 
programs

360
00:33:06,024 --> 00:33:10,470
people are insisting that we should have 
a program in any case in Kolhapur.

361
00:33:10,495 --> 00:33:12,933
But I told them I’ll not allow sahaja yogis 
to go there

362
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:17,791
because they were hurt so badly. But some 
of you can come, not all of you.

363
00:33:17,816 --> 00:33:20,969
I would be rather worried. I don’t think 
anybody will hurt you

364
00:33:20,994 --> 00:33:23,865
and they are saying they will make 
arrangements.

365
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:29,968
So if you want to come, if you are 
not afraid...

366
00:33:45,114 --> 00:33:50,537
But on one promise. That nobody is going 
to beat anyone.

367
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:53,879
I am saying, “Don’t beat. Don’t beat” 
and somebody heard, “Beat”.

368
00:33:53,904 --> 00:33:58,822
I mean, I mean, I have never heard such 
sort of thing, when I am saying

369
00:33:58,847 --> 00:34:02,193
on the thing that, “Don’t beat. 
Don’t beat,”

370
00:34:02,218 --> 00:34:06,158
then somebody hears that, “Beat them. 
Beat them”.

371
00:34:06,972 --> 00:34:10,586
I just don’t understand how can 
(that be).

372
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:16,562
So you don’t have to, really, you don’t 
have to beat anyone.

373
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:19,877
There is no need. You know that 
there is Paramchaitanya working.

374
00:34:19,902 --> 00:34:24,855
All this is also the work 
of Paramchaitanya. In the afternoon,

375
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,981
Yogi Mahajan was discussing with Me 
very seriously like a lawyer,

376
00:34:29,006 --> 00:34:33,112
saying that, “Mother we cannot form 
a criminal case on them,

377
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:40,826
because there is no evidence”. Afternoon. 
And in the evening we have evidence now.

378
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:55,343
And then they are writing in the other way 
round, that they were beaten up

379
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:59,985
and that you threw stones at them. 
And none of them were injured.

380
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:04,388
They must have been vibrated stones, 
I think.

381
00:35:07,826 --> 00:35:13,757
How can you? They had no injuries. They 
wrote it down they've no injuries.

382
00:35:13,782 --> 00:35:17,047
So there is no need for you to bother 
about it.

383
00:35:17,072 --> 00:35:21,819
With all that there were at least more 
than four hundred stones that came

384
00:35:21,844 --> 00:35:27,731
and only eighteen people got hurt. And 
really seriously, I think, one or two.

385
00:35:27,756 --> 00:35:33,035
So there is nothing and I can cure 
all of you, [you] know that very well.

386
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,654
On the whole, you see this country, 
especially Maharashtra,

387
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:52,620
is so full of devotion to God.

388
00:35:52,645 --> 00:35:56,010
Like these things are not going to work 
out. But they are very dangerous people

389
00:35:56,035 --> 00:36:02,171
like Hitler, you see, they start moving 
about and giving some ideas and all that.

390
00:36:02,196 --> 00:36:06,332
So it is better to finish them at the time 
when they are just prospering,

391
00:36:06,357 --> 00:36:11,098
as they call themselves Nirmulan, 
is to remove the roots.

392
00:36:11,123 --> 00:36:16,344
So we have to do the Nirmulan 
of Nirmulan.

393
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:20,714
All right. So now today we'll have 
the puja.

394
00:36:20,739 --> 00:36:28,797
Then after that if you want you can go 
to Kolhapur for your purchase.

395
00:36:28,822 --> 00:36:32,638
But it starts, the shops starts quite late 
and will keep quite late till eight

396
00:36:32,663 --> 00:36:37,708
and tomorrow the whole day is available 
for you. So you can take your buses.

397
00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:43,118
You can go down there, and you can have 
your purchase and all that,

398
00:36:43,143 --> 00:36:46,644
then come back here. Tomorrow also 
you can do the same.

399
00:36:46,669 --> 00:36:52,779
Day after tomorrow, our Mr. Govind has 
very kindly invited you all to his place,

400
00:36:52,804 --> 00:36:57,990
as it is he is an extremely generous man. 
So,

401
00:37:09,095 --> 00:37:11,515
and when I told him that, “You must 
take money from Me”,

402
00:37:11,556 --> 00:37:14,216
he was just fighting with Me, “Mother, 
give me this first chance.

403
00:37:14,241 --> 00:37:19,639
This is my great honor that…(speaking 
Marathi and Hindi to someone)

404
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:28,667
So… Let them come, if they want to come.”

405
00:37:35,694 --> 00:37:39,276
So then the program is that day 
after tomorrow,

406
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:44,259
after this thing he says it will be over 
by 12:30 or one′o clock.

407
00:37:44,284 --> 00:37:48,661
So you will have tonight and tomorrow 
full day for your shopping.

408
00:37:48,686 --> 00:37:52,203
But I think then you should not bother 
more about shopping.

409
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,785
Whatever you have to do, better finish 
tomorrow.

410
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:57,743
And then you have to come 
to the program also.

411
00:37:57,768 --> 00:38:01,521
Day after if you linger on then it will 
be very difficult.

412
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:07,396
So all of you should go there, have your 
food, and then go to Ganapatipule.

413
00:38:07,421 --> 00:38:11,451
This is the program. So you reach 
Ganapatipule in the evening.

414
00:38:11,476 --> 00:38:13,992
I hope it’s all clear to you.

415
00:38:14,017 --> 00:38:17,977
And whatever you want to buy, you have 
to buy here. But I would say

416
00:38:18,002 --> 00:38:22,443
that some of you are really, really 
do not know what is real silk is.

417
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:25,500
And I've seen some people buying 
something horrid.

418
00:38:25,525 --> 00:38:29,417
And very thin silk you should not buy 
because it will last only for eight days.

419
00:38:29,442 --> 00:38:32,498
And then it will be finished. So don’t go 
for cheap things.

420
00:38:32,523 --> 00:38:37,724
One sari which is good sari, silk sari, 
is better than ten bad saris.

421
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:42,102
Luckily now we have some saris that you 
wanted for, the printed saris

422
00:38:42,127 --> 00:38:46,955
which I can give you in Ganapatipule. 
Nice printed saris,

423
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:54,135
of the tassar and also silk. We’ll have 
them there. You can all buy, there.

424
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:58,125
Anything else?

425
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:04,633
Because I don’t think I’ll meet you any 
more perhaps till we go to Ganapatipule.

426
00:39:04,658 --> 00:39:09,885
Now also if you could get those 
bhajan things, please buy.

427
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:13,736
I have given you presents twice. But you 
never bring them on your tour

428
00:39:13,761 --> 00:39:19,306
and this time again, I don’t want to get 
this kind of a thing. (Hindi).

429
00:39:19,331 --> 00:39:26,340
Just show them. Anything of this kind, 
please get it. Is very important.

430
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:31,766
I have given you twice as presents 
but it’s very difficult every time

431
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:37,967
to go to the shop and get it for you. 
If you can get them please buy.

432
00:39:37,992 --> 00:39:44,181
Some of you should at least have them. 
(speaking marathi to someone)

433
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:56,618
He will organize, you better purchase.

434
00:40:03,298 --> 00:40:09,636
Now all the marriages practically have 
been decided. One or two are left,

435
00:40:09,661 --> 00:40:14,913
which he has also adjusted. Now those who 
were over age or something like that,

436
00:40:14,938 --> 00:40:17,508
we could not arrange their marriages. 
Doesn’t matter.

437
00:40:17,533 --> 00:40:20,274
It may work out, it may not work out. 
Doesn’t matter.

438
00:40:20,299 --> 00:40:24,650
After all, you are in Sahaja Yoga. I mean, 
you are really married to Sahaja Yoga,

439
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:29,165
that’s all. This is something sideways, 
you see.

440
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,478
So don’t make very, your life 
miserable,

441
00:40:32,503 --> 00:40:36,000
so all the way you have come, to know 
that you are not ...

442
00:40:36,025 --> 00:40:40,219
we have not been able to arrange 
your marriage. It’s not proper.

443
00:40:40,244 --> 00:40:44,000
Just enjoy. Don’t miss the point.

444
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:47,306
May God bless you.
