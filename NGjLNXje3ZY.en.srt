1
00:00:06,321 --> 00:00:10,751
“Vichara shaithilya, is the relaxation
of the thought”

2
00:00:12,071 --> 00:00:22,355
Now we are trying to transform our energies
towards the energy of the Spirit.

3
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:27,680
So you have to allow the Spirit to take
over.

4
00:00:28,824 --> 00:00:33,315
Your effort of your mind should be reduced

5
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:38,484
and the energy of the Spirit should work
through you.

6
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:41,744
Now how do you do it?

7
00:00:45,216 --> 00:00:54,047
First is detachment, detachment.

8
00:00:54,248 --> 00:01:00,729
Detachment start with the thought, let us
see the thought.

9
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,919
It’s called as vichara shaithilya –
relaxation of the thought.

10
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:10,831
But still this mind, which is quite silly,
tries to impress upon you

11
00:01:11,032 --> 00:01:20,191
that you have to use the old junky
instrument of this mind.

12
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:25,554
And it asserts that “Better use.” And when
you start using that,

13
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:29,777
ego comes in, you get attached to it,

14
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:38,562
and what you lose is your progress
and thus the joy is minimised.

15
00:01:38,763 --> 00:01:42,658
How do you detach yourself?

16
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:46,301
For a person who is absolutely detached
is very difficult

17
00:01:46,502 --> 00:01:51,100
to explain how to detach, isn’t it?

18
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,302
I’ll try! Now.

19
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:58,739
I cannot get attached. That’s the problem
is.

20
00:02:00,284 --> 00:02:07,090
So, just now if you give up your satta,
your own domain,

21
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:11,559
you get into the domain of your Spirit.

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,858
You give up your domain, that is your
ego’s domain,

23
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:21,312
or may be your super-ego’s domain.
You give up that

24
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:27,674
and try to see things how it works out.

25
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:33,552
Now, what is the testing point of it?
How do you test it?

26
00:02:33,768 --> 00:02:40,468
It works out. That’s the point of testing.

27
00:02:41,155 --> 00:02:45,654
It works out. Allow it to work out.

28
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:49,244
Don’t put your attention.

29
00:02:49,444 --> 00:02:53,431
Attention [word] has the second part of,
is the ‘tension’.

30
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:58,870
And don’t try to say, “Why not today,
it should have happened today,

31
00:02:59,071 --> 00:03:03,903
we expected it to happen. Why not
at this moment?”

32
00:03:04,104 --> 00:03:07,001
That’s your ego.

33
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:10,700
“Thy will be done”.

34
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:21,466
So the thought that starts moving
in our mind all the time,

35
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:26,688
which creates tensions is not the thought
of the Spirit.

36
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:32,386
So, what you should say [is], “Not this
thought. Not this thought.”

37
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,328
“Ya neti neti vachane nigamo avochus”

38
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:40,070
“Not this thought, not this thought,
not this thought”,

39
00:03:40,604 --> 00:03:43,844
and see how you relax. Now you are
relaxing -

40
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:46,968
“Not this thought, not this thought”.

41
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:51,970
Just go on refusing accepting any thought.

42
00:03:52,171 --> 00:03:58,656
So you go into Nirvichara. In that state
you feel the Spirit.

43
00:03:59,852 --> 00:04:05,128
Christ has done the greatest work on this,
I should say, but we do not understand

44
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:11,403
because His life was like a micro-thing,
you see, 3 years.

45
00:04:11,604 --> 00:04:16,323
So we have to open it out a little bit
and see what He did.

46
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:21,648
He has given us the greatest weapon
of forgiveness.

47
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:27,248
When you forgive a person, what do you do?

48
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:34,867
You accept the situation, to begin with,
and secondly you forgive

49
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:40,926
what you think has been done wrong to you.

50
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:46,484
But because nothing can be done wrong
to your Spirit,

51
00:04:46,685 --> 00:04:50,497
you just forgive, because you are
the Spirit!

52
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:58,778
And when you forgive, you have found
that your tension goes away.

53
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,992
So even to your thoughts if you say,
“All right, forgive this thought,

54
00:05:03,193 --> 00:05:08,719
forgive this thought,” because thought is
also not to be punished.

55
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,175
“Forgive this thought, forgive this
thought, forgive everything.”

56
00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:16,810
Not forget, forgive:

57
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:23,277
because then you will even forget that
you are the Spirit!

58
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:29,003
But “forgive all the thoughts that
are coming to me.”

59
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:33,370
Just go on saying this, is a mantra.
What is a mantra?

60
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:42,218
Is that power of the word that expresses
Spirit.

61
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:49,258
So this is a very important thing Christ
has given us: the weapon of forgiveness.

62
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:54,198
Everybody has that weapon, everyone
can use that weapon.

63
00:05:54,399 --> 00:06:00,031
You don’t have to put in any effort for it,
you don’t have to pay for it,

64
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:03,657
it’s just you have to say, “I forgive.”

65
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:09,957
You’ll be amazed your nerves will soothe
down, this tension,

66
00:06:10,158 --> 00:06:17,530
this pressure of these modern things
will be reduced

67
00:06:17,731 --> 00:06:21,685
if you go on saying, “I forgive, I forgive
them”.

68
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:27,523
For example, you go and see some sort of a…
I mean,

69
00:06:27,724 --> 00:06:34,083
if you happen suddenly to see something
very filthy according to the Spirit.

70
00:06:34,284 --> 00:06:38,297
Maybe it is very exciting according
to normal human beings,

71
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:44,498
but we are abnormal people and for us
if we find it rather ugly

72
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,699
then the best thing is, to get over,
is to say, “I forgive,

73
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,411
because they are ignorant, they are blind,
they are not yet there where I am.

74
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:58,051
I am the one who is at the Source
of enjoyment,

75
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:04,602
at the Source of peace and while these
are not, so I forgive.”

76
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:12,295
And you’ll be amazed that this forgiveness
that Christ gives you

77
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:20,160
works out vichara shaithilya, is
the relaxation of the thought.

78
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:28,473
Now this opposite movement, that you have
to move,

79
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:36,914
first of all should start at this point,
today, from forgiving others.

80
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:43,834
Now what happens when you forgive someone?
That means you do not react.

81
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:53,321
The power to react to somebody’s injuries,
insults is finished.

82
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:58,667
And when that power is finished, you become
a powerful person,

83
00:07:58,868 --> 00:08:06,040
because nobody can now overpower you,

84
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:14,638
because nobody can kill you, nobody can
hurt you, nobody can do anything to you.

85
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:17,762
But it is not, again I’ll say,
shamelessness.

86
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:23,169
You see, people can think that it is
shamelessness.

87
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:29,794
So if somebody says to you something harsh

88
00:08:30,393 --> 00:08:35,205
and something that is wrong, you do not
accept it.

89
00:08:36,152 --> 00:08:43,799
So in Sahaja Yoga one has to understand
that it is just this central path,

90
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,766
is just the balancing thing which is
important. It’s not an extreme of anything.

91
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:54,716
Like when we go to say that you must
forgive everyone,

92
00:08:54,917 --> 00:09:00,097
it’s not going to that extreme where you
have done some wrong,

93
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:05,055
and somebody says to you [and] you don’t
take that part of it, it doesn’t mean that.

94
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:10,533
Again discretion is the engine of your
movement.

95
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:18,083
So you have to see that, if they have
said it, something like that,

96
00:09:18,284 --> 00:09:21,692
“Is it? Have I gone against the Spirit?”

97
00:09:21,947 --> 00:09:28,584
It’s a very thin road on which you have
to walk.

98
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:36,880
One side is the huge, big Gibraltar,
rock of Gibraltar, of your ego,

99
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:40,161
the another side is a super-ego.

100
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:45,453
In between is a small discretion path
going,

101
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:49,264
on which you have to see both the sides,

102
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:54,095
whether you are hitting yourself with
the rock of Gibraltar,

103
00:09:54,296 --> 00:09:59,228
or falling into the valley of super-ego,

104
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:03,648
you should see that you are using
your discretion.
