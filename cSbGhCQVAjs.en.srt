[MUSIC - BHAJAN]

9
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,000
- I bow to all the seekers of Truth.
- [INTERPRETER]

10
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:13,241
At the very outset we have to know
that Truth is what it is.

11
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:20,194
[INTERPRETER]

12
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:25,092
- We cannot change it.
- [INTERPRETER]

13
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:33,513
- It is, it has been and it will be.
- [INTERPRETER]

14
00:02:36,707 --> 00:02:40,647
- Whatever I'm going to tell you,
- [INTERPRETER]

15
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:50,630
- you have to have a scientific mind towards it.
- [INTERPRETER]

16
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:56,527
- Keep your mind open.
- [INTERPRETER]

17
00:02:56,751 --> 00:03:06,291
and whatever I say to you, if it is proved,
then you have to believe in it as honest people.

18
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:12,920
[INTERPRETER]

19
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:26,831
The Truth is, that you are not this body,
this mind, these conditionings and this ego

20
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:34,692
[INTERPRETER]

21
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:40,184
- but you are the Pure Spirit.
- [INTERPRETER]

22
00:03:40,517 --> 00:03:49,537
- This is said by all the great prophets,
- [INTERPRETER]

23
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:55,280
- by Incarnations,
- [INTERPRETER]

24
00:03:55,582 --> 00:04:01,342
- by Muhammad Sahab as well as our Christ,
- [INTERPRETER]

25
00:04:01,485 --> 00:04:04,765
- as well as by Moses
- [INTERPRETER]

26
00:04:05,184 --> 00:04:11,454
- also all Indian scriptures say the same.
- [INTERPRETER]

27
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:18,048
The second Truth is, that there is a
All-Pervading Divine Power

28
00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:22,166
[INTERPRETER]

29
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:27,381
and this Divine Power does
all the living work.

30
00:04:27,381 --> 00:04:32,682
[INTERPRETER]

31
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:38,034
- You see all the beautiful flowers here
- [INTERPRETER]

32
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,130
- it's a miracle.
- [INTERPRETER]

33
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:47,919
- They have come out of one seed
- [INTERPRETER]

34
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:54,977
- Our heart - who runs our heart?
- [INTERPRETER]

35
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:59,052
We don't even bother to know
who runs our heart.

36
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:04,274
[INTERPRETER]

37
00:05:07,415 --> 00:05:12,505
This All-Pervading Power of Divine Love,
runs our heart.

38
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:18,381
[INTERPRETER]

39
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:28,414
- It's like the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost
- [INTERPRETER]

40
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:35,058
- or it is the Paramchaitanya
- [INTERPRETER]

41
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,210
- or it is the Rooh
- It's what?

42
00:05:39,313 --> 00:05:44,513
- Rooh, in Koran
- [INTERPRETER]

43
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:51,341
- It is described by many names.
- [INTERPRETER]

44
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:58,446
Those who are seekers of Truth, are
actually seeking the connection with this

45
00:05:58,448 --> 00:06:06,818
- All-Pervading Power.
- [INTERPRETER]

46
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:13,476
This connection is called as Yoga
- the real Spiritual Yoga.

47
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:17,499
[INTERPRETER]

48
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:27,723
- It is not standing on your head
- [INTERPRETER]

49
00:06:27,723 --> 00:06:32,291
- or stretching your legs
- [INTERPRETER]

50
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:37,006
- that it is a yoga
- [INTERPRETER]

51
00:06:37,226 --> 00:06:48,662
Even the taking the name of God, of 
praying to God, is not manifested unless

52
00:06:48,662 --> 00:06:54,522
and until you have the connection with 
this All-Pervading Power of Divine Love.

53
00:06:54,537 --> 00:07:00,287
[INTERPRETER]

54
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:06,899
[INTERPRETER]

55
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:12,245
- As this instrument
- [INTERPRETER]

56
00:07:12,425 --> 00:07:19,222
- when not connected with the mains,
- [INTERPRETER]

57
00:07:19,222 --> 00:07:22,031
- it has no meaning,
- [INTERPRETER]

58
00:07:22,036 --> 00:07:25,486
- it has no identity.
- [INTERPRETER]

59
00:07:25,518 --> 00:07:30,488
- In the same way, we the human-beings,
- [INTERPRETER]

60
00:07:30,488 --> 00:07:34,378
- if we are not connected,
- [INTERPRETER]

61
00:07:34,492 --> 00:07:41,052
- to the All-Pervading Divine Power,
- [INTERPRETER]

62
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:45,231
- we have no meaning.
- [INTERPRETER]

63
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:49,763
- We cannot have Self-Knowledge,
- [INTERPRETER]

64
00:07:49,763 --> 00:07:59,351
- we cannot have the Enlightenment
- [INTERPRETER]

65
00:07:59,351 --> 00:08:07,836
- and we cannot know the Absolute Truth.
- [INTERPRETER]

66
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:14,490
- Most of the human problems
- [INTERPRETER]

67
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:20,714
- are created problems of the world
- [INTERPRETER]

68
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:30,334
and most of the human problems come to us
from these centers when they go into jeopardy.

69
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:40,454
[INTERPRETER]

70
00:08:41,095 --> 00:08:47,045
- All these subtle centers are within us.
- [INTERPRETER]

71
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:52,836
In the Bible it is mentioned that, "I'll 
appear before you like tongues of flames."

72
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:59,696
[INTERPRETER]

73
00:08:59,696 --> 00:09:06,717
In every scripture it is described
the life, the Tree of Life.

74
00:09:06,764 --> 00:09:12,564
[INTERPRETER]

75
00:09:12,904 --> 00:09:17,014
but nobody has tried to find
out what is this.

76
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:20,121
[INTERPRETER]

77
00:09:21,488 --> 00:09:26,038
The civilization, in the West,
has grown very much

78
00:09:26,038 --> 00:09:31,087
[INTERPRETER]

79
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:35,358
- but it has to find out it's roots
- [INTERPRETER]

80
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:40,621
- roots of Spirituality
- [INTERPRETER]

81
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:49,421
otherwise this whole big civilization
will be completely dissolved.

82
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:54,081
[INTERPRETER]

83
00:09:54,643 --> 00:10:01,703
As it is, you can see what's happening in
the most developed countries like America

84
00:10:01,703 --> 00:10:07,195
[INTERPRETER]

85
00:10:07,304 --> 00:10:12,234
Thousands and thousands of people
are suffering from AIDS,

86
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:15,769
[INTERPRETER]

87
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:20,543
- they are suffering from schizophrenia
- [INTERPRETER]

88
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:27,035
- and the violence is at it's worst.
- [INTERPRETER]

89
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:33,039
- You can't even wear a wedding ring
- [INTERPRETER]

90
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:41,441
- and walk in the streets of New York
- [INTERPRETER]

91
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:46,726
- Such greed and such lust!
- [INTERPRETER]

92
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,840
- No morality of any kind
- [INTERPRETER]

93
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:59,241
It's not only there but you 
see it all over your world.

94
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:03,461
[INTERPRETER]

95
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:10,094
At all developing countries, who have 
taken to this modern life, like Argentina

96
00:11:10,716 --> 00:11:20,086
- also are in the same [UNCLEAR]
- [INTERPRETER]

97
00:11:20,285 --> 00:11:25,245
- but once we find our roots,
- [INTERPRETER]

98
00:11:25,245 --> 00:11:29,665
- once we find our identity,
- [INTERPRETER]

99
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:36,551
- you understand how great you are.
- [INTERPRETER]

100
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:42,535
- You understand why you were created,
- [INTERPRETER]

101
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:47,226
- what is the purpose of your life,
- [INTERPRETER]

102
00:11:47,226 --> 00:11:52,105
- what is the goal of your life;
- [INTERPRETER]

103
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:58,355
Is only possible when you have
your second birth.

104
00:11:58,355 --> 00:12:05,488
[INTERPRETER]

105
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:12,893
- Many people brand them as twice born
- [INTERPRETER]

106
00:12:12,893 --> 00:12:16,559
- Sorry, once more.
- as twice born - born twice

107
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:26,208
- [INTERPRETER]
- but they are not - but they are not at all.

108
00:12:26,498 --> 00:12:36,343
- [INTERPRETER]
- Those, who call themselves as Muslims

109
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:44,310
- and Christians and Hindus, are not
- [INTERPRETER]

110
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:50,770
If they were real Christians, they would
not have taken to this immoral life

111
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:59,740
[INTERPRETER]

112
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:08,174
- How could such immoral life exist then
- [INTERPRETER]

113
00:13:08,174 --> 00:13:13,159
- in the name of Christ!
- [INTERPRETER]

114
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:18,339
Who said, "Thou shalt not have
adulterous eyes!"

115
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,001
[INTERPRETER]

116
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:31,322
- What subtle morality! What deep morality!
- [INTERPRETER]

117
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:43,387
- That's only possible if you are enlightened
- [INTERPRETER]

118
00:13:43,594 --> 00:13:48,154
- When the light comes within you,
- [INTERPRETER]

119
00:13:48,213 --> 00:13:52,173
- immediately you give up
- [INTERPRETER]

120
00:13:52,173 --> 00:13:57,441
- whatever is destructive,
- [INTERPRETER]

121
00:13:57,441 --> 00:14:05,011
- whatever is destructive within you
- [INTERPRETER]

122
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:09,591
and also you see what is outside
is destructive

123
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:13,400
[INTERPRETER]

124
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:19,053
- Once you get your enlightenment,
- [INTERPRETER]

125
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:24,236
you can feel this All-Pervading Power, for
the first time, on your finger-tips

126
00:14:24,236 --> 00:14:30,785
[INTERPRETER]

127
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:37,861
You see also the cool breeze coming out of
your fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone

128
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:44,531
[INTERPRETER]

129
00:14:44,531 --> 00:14:52,800
- Is the actualization of your baptism
- [INTERPRETER]

130
00:14:52,800 --> 00:15:00,463
Then you start using this power and you
can give realizations to others.

131
00:15:00,463 --> 00:15:04,466
[INTERPRETER]

132
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:14,054
As a result of this, you get physical,
mental, emotional, spiritual problems solved.

133
00:15:14,851 --> 00:15:23,121
[INTERPRETER]

134
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:27,803
I don't have to tell you, don't do this,
don't do that, don't do that.

135
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:32,073
[INTERPRETER]

136
00:15:32,073 --> 00:15:37,193
With the light of the Spirit you yourself 
become your own guide, your own master,

137
00:15:37,193 --> 00:15:43,547
- your own guru.
- [INTERPRETER]

138
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:48,558
You become extremely dynamic but 
extremely compassionate.

139
00:15:48,558 --> 00:15:57,396
[INTERPRETER]

140
00:15:57,396 --> 00:16:01,276
You can feel your own centers
on your finger-tips.

141
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:07,998
[INTERPRETER]

142
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:12,741
Then you see all religions belong
to the same tree of life.

143
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:17,604
[INTERPRETER]

144
00:16:17,604 --> 00:16:21,930
- All beautiful flowers
- [INTERPRETER]

145
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,902
- of Divinity
- [INTERPRETER]

146
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:33,002
but people have taken out these flowers
and now fighting with the dead flowers.

147
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:39,332
[INTERPRETER]

148
00:16:39,592 --> 00:16:49,559
And all these religions are one; 
They have the same business

149
00:16:49,772 --> 00:16:55,272
[INTERPRETER]

150
00:16:55,296 --> 00:17:00,026
There is no need at all to fight
in the name of God.

151
00:17:00,026 --> 00:17:04,895
[INTERPRETER]

152
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:12,886
This you can know as a scientific
proof after realization.

153
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:18,699
[INTERPRETER]

154
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:26,596
You can feel on your finger-tips
the centers of others.

155
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:34,006
[INTERPRETER]

156
00:17:34,006 --> 00:17:41,764
Now if you know how to correct them, you can
correct your centers as well as the of others.

157
00:17:41,764 --> 00:17:45,312
[INTERPRETER]

158
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:54,156
- You develop a peaceful heart
- [INTERPRETER]

159
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:59,441
- and tremendous compassion.
- [INTERPRETER]

160
00:17:59,877 --> 00:18:04,897
You realize then how great your are - 
all your virtues start manifesting.

161
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:10,910
[INTERPRETER]

162
00:18:11,113 --> 00:18:15,113
- It is your own power -
- [INTERPRETER]

163
00:18:15,353 --> 00:18:19,353
- it's your own.
- [INTERPRETER]

164
00:18:19,418 --> 00:18:22,948
- You all have it within you
- [INTERPRETER]

165
00:18:23,195 --> 00:18:27,595
- and you don't have to pay for it
- [INTERPRETER]

166
00:18:27,595 --> 00:18:35,115
- God doesn't understand banks.
- [INTERPRETER]

167
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:38,575
- He doesn't understand money.
- [INTERPRETER]

168
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:42,575
- It's a human [UNCLEAR]
- [INTERPRETER]

169
00:18:42,575 --> 00:18:47,935
By reading about it, you do not
get to that point

170
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,655
[INTERPRETER]

171
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:59,172
- You have to seek and you will find.
- [INTERPRETER]

172
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:05,484
- I call it a blossom time
- [INTERPRETER]

173
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:10,184
Time when there are so many
great souls are born.

174
00:19:10,184 --> 00:19:15,754
[INTERPRETER]

175
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:24,089
- This is the fulfillment of the last judgment
- [INTERPRETER]

176
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:27,699
The dead bodies are not going
to come to life.

177
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,499
[INTERPRETER]

178
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:35,149
I mean to say, all the prehistoric people
and the dinosaurs all of them

179
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:41,469
- are going to come to life?
- [INTERPRETER]

180
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:45,848
But all those, who were dead,
their souls will take birth

181
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:52,310
[INTERPRETER]

182
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:56,310
- as human beings.
- [INTERPRETER]

183
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:04,880
- That's why we have a population problem
- [INTERPRETER]

184
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:12,672
So many great souls, we have
seen, born as children.

185
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:19,182
[INTERPRETER]

186
00:20:19,182 --> 00:20:33,352
I've seen children at the age of 6 and 10,
can play on violin or on piano like a master.

187
00:20:33,352 --> 00:20:40,787
[INTERPRETER]

188
00:20:40,827 --> 00:20:47,322
In India I've seen children below 10 years, 
singing the Indian music, which is very difficult,

189
00:20:47,322 --> 00:20:54,116
- like great masters of old times.
- [INTERPRETER]

190
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:58,116
[INTERPRETER]

191
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:03,824
Today only, I saw in the television, in 
France there were children - very small children

192
00:21:03,824 --> 00:21:14,652
- playing on the violin
- [INTERPRETER]

193
00:21:14,726 --> 00:21:20,846
- in such a, in such a mastery.
- [INTERPRETER]

194
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:25,806
So these are the times, when all these
great people are going to be born.

195
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:29,806
[INTERPRETER]

196
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:35,086
There are some people, who are frightening
to say that, this world is going to come

197
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:41,086
- to an end.
- [INTERPRETER]

198
00:21:41,086 --> 00:21:44,176
- Don't believe that.
- [INTERPRETER]

199
00:21:44,176 --> 00:21:48,176
- The One, who is our Creator,
- [INTERPRETER]

200
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:51,885
- is our Father,
- [INTERPRETER]

201
00:21:51,885 --> 00:21:59,905
- is the Supreme Being of compassion.
- [INTERPRETER]

202
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:02,873
He has not created this world
to be destroyed

203
00:22:02,873 --> 00:22:05,833
[INTERPRETER]

204
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:15,834
but He has made places, for all of you,
in the Kingdom of God.

205
00:22:15,927 --> 00:22:23,077
[INTERPRETER]

206
00:22:23,414 --> 00:22:29,874
Don't be eluded by people - some of them
are coming even from India and trying

207
00:22:29,874 --> 00:22:40,354
- to put conditionings in your heads.
- [INTERPRETER]

208
00:22:40,496 --> 00:22:44,496
The other day, I met somebody
from this Hare Rama business.

209
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:49,856
[INTERPRETER]

210
00:22:50,008 --> 00:22:55,898
- They are absolutely stupid, idiotic people.
- [INTERPRETER]

211
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:05,668
If you have to call the name of your 
Prime Minister here, near his house,

212
00:23:05,668 --> 00:23:13,948
- you'll be arrested
- [INTERPRETER]

213
00:23:13,948 --> 00:23:20,168
and you are calling the name of God
without any protocol, without any

214
00:23:20,168 --> 00:23:26,878
- permission, without any connection.
- [INTERPRETER]

215
00:23:26,902 --> 00:23:34,592
- You might only get cancer of throat.
- [INTERPRETER]

216
00:23:34,592 --> 00:23:38,932
- I don't know what other punishments.
- [INTERPRETER]

217
00:23:38,932 --> 00:23:42,612
I must say, Russians were very clever.
They said, "We had no food Mother,

218
00:23:42,612 --> 00:23:46,612
so we had nice food from them and now 
they have gone away permanently.

219
00:23:47,152 --> 00:23:56,572
- Mother, [UNCLEAR] 
- I said that Russians were very clever

220
00:23:56,623 --> 00:24:04,353
and they said that, "These people had 
brought food so we ate the food nicely and

221
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:08,705
now they have gone away completely." They
have completely gone from Russia.

222
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:12,286
- Did you follow?
- No

223
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:16,076
The Russians was very clever because 
this [UNCLEAR]

224
00:24:16,076 --> 00:24:27,249
Ah! [INTERPRETER]

225
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:31,559
- I think, the IQ of Russian is very high
- Eh...

226
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,559
- IQ.
- Shri Mataji [INTERPRETER]

227
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:41,396
They said, "Mother, we could make
out they are idiotic, stupid things

228
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:48,986
- they were telling us."
- Shri Mataji [INTERPRETER]

229
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:53,518
In you, Sahaja yoga is not meant
for stupid, idiotic people.

230
00:24:53,518 --> 00:25:03,878
- [INTERPRETER]
- So, one has to understand and think,

231
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:12,504
- we talk of God
- [INTERPRETER]

232
00:25:12,514 --> 00:25:17,249
and why all these horrible things are
happening in the name of God.

233
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:21,305
[INTERPRETER]

234
00:25:22,763 --> 00:25:26,013
- What's gone wrong?
- [INTERPRETER]

235
00:25:27,106 --> 00:25:30,436
The mistake is, that we are not
yet connected.

236
00:25:31,302 --> 00:25:41,452
- [INTERPRETER]
- This is what we have to achieve the connection

237
00:25:41,452 --> 00:25:46,510
- [INTERPRETER]
- which is sahaja - means spontaneous.

238
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:53,310
- [INTERPRETER]
- Sahaja - 'Saha' means with, 'ja' is born

239
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:59,271
- [INTERPRETER]
- What's the matter with this gentleman?

240
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:07,935
- [INTERPRETER]
- you see, you are little bit disturbing

241
00:26:10,042 --> 00:26:15,192
because they all start watching him. 
Please make yourself comfortable.

242
00:26:17,294 --> 00:26:23,524
[INTERPRETER] He's 
[UNCLEAR] Mother.

243
00:26:23,524 --> 00:26:28,544
But he's going round, putting up, everybody
looking at him; You see, the [UNCLEAR]

244
00:26:31,825 --> 00:26:40,105
- Alright! I don't know how to tell you
- [INTERPRETER]

245
00:26:42,683 --> 00:26:49,063
How the time has come for you to 
specially, to achieve this state

246
00:26:49,897 --> 00:26:54,897
[INTERPRETER]

247
00:26:54,897 --> 00:27:00,477
- through your evolutionary process,
- [INTERPRETER]

248
00:27:00,778 --> 00:27:06,758
through this awakening of this Kundalini,
the power in your triangular bone.

249
00:27:06,804 --> 00:27:11,844
[INTERPRETER]

250
00:27:12,571 --> 00:27:16,801
- This bone is called as Sacrum
- [INTERPRETER]

251
00:27:17,057 --> 00:27:25,287
- that means, the Greeks knew it is a sacred bone.
- [INTERPRETER]

252
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:37,200
- Athena, itself, means Primordial Mother
- [INTERPRETER]

253
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,220
- so, Greeks believed in all that.
- [INTERPRETER]

254
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:49,910
- and now there's a big upsurge in Greece also
- [INTERPRETER]

255
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:55,540
- to take to their ancient knowledge
- [INTERPRETER]

256
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:08,380
- because they're so restless, so frustrated
- [INTERPRETER]

257
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:14,429
So, time has come for you all also 
to have your Self-realization.

258
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:18,429
[INTERPRETER]

259
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:25,729
- Of course, I cannot force it on you
- [INTERPRETER]

260
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:30,469
- I respect your freedom
- [INTERPRETER]

261
00:28:30,469 --> 00:28:36,279
- Those, who want to have it, can have it
- [INTERPRETER]

262
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:46,689
- but you must have a very ardent desire
- [INTERPRETER]

263
00:28:50,267 --> 00:28:55,547
Those, who do not want to have, please
leave the hall - we'll be very happy.

264
00:28:55,547 --> 00:29:01,267
[INTERPRETER]

265
00:29:09,657 --> 00:29:13,647
- This person, Hare Rama fellow
- but he'll sit down

266
00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:16,423
[INTERPRETER]

267
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:24,550
- It's very critical to make them understand
- [INTERPRETER]

268
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:30,870
Such conditioning people have that
it's impossible to break free.

269
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:34,870
[INTERPRETER]

270
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:41,250
Only people, who are really introspective,
were Russians.

271
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:48,849
[INTERPRETER]

272
00:29:50,385 --> 00:29:59,275
We always had programs in a big, 
what you call, auditoriums or places

273
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:01,715
where there were 16,000 people.

274
00:30:01,715 --> 00:30:09,135
[INTERPRETER]

275
00:30:09,135 --> 00:30:13,055
They're so well read and they 
know so much about it

276
00:30:13,055 --> 00:30:17,055
[INTERPRETER]

277
00:30:17,055 --> 00:30:20,845
- and they're so introspective
- [INTERPRETER]

278
00:30:20,845 --> 00:30:23,935
- It's very surprising
- [INTERPRETER]

279
00:30:26,334 --> 00:30:34,144
- and now we have in thousands in Russia
- [INTERPRETER]

280
00:30:34,144 --> 00:30:37,728
- Also in Romania
- [INTERPRETER]

281
00:30:37,728 --> 00:30:39,938
- and Bulgaria
- [INTERPRETER]

282
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:49,308
- Czechoslovakia but Poland somehow is not
- [INTERPRETER]

283
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:55,370
- I don't know, what is the conditioning
- [INTERPRETER]

284
00:30:57,263 --> 00:30:59,493
- Why?
- [INTERPRETER]

285
00:31:05,101 --> 00:31:13,061
- So, I know you all have lots of questions
- [INTERPRETER]

286
00:31:13,814 --> 00:31:18,694
I would like you to write it down
and send it over to Me

287
00:31:18,694 --> 00:31:25,254
[INTERPRETER]

288
00:31:25,254 --> 00:31:29,834
- and I'll try to answer them.
- [INTERPRETER]

289
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:33,094
But just now, I think, you all should
get your realization.

290
00:31:33,094 --> 00:31:37,344
- [INTERPRETER]

291
00:31:37,344 --> 00:31:44,724
You see, it is such an ocean of knowledge
that in this short time I cannot

292
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:52,094
- tell you everything.
- [INTERPRETER]

293
00:31:55,348 --> 00:32:06,598
You have to understand that these lights that
are here have been brought long time back

294
00:32:06,598 --> 00:32:14,278
[INTERPRETER]

295
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:22,718
and to explain to you about all these lights
and how electricity came, is such a headache.

296
00:32:22,718 --> 00:32:31,598
[INTERPRETER]

297
00:32:31,598 --> 00:32:35,598
- It's all built-in now
- [INTERPRETER]

298
00:32:35,598 --> 00:32:43,158
- You have to just put one switch and they are on
- [INTERPRETER]

299
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:48,037
You don't have to tell them all the
history of electricity

300
00:32:48,037 --> 00:32:53,367
[INTERPRETER]

301
00:32:54,584 --> 00:32:59,874
-So, it's a headache also
- [INTERPRETER]

302
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:09,381
If you have your light because it is built-in
within you - the system is built-in within you

303
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:16,511
- [INTERPRETER]

304
00:33:16,511 --> 00:33:19,801
- It's all there
- [INTERPRETER]

305
00:33:20,151 --> 00:33:24,701
- so better to have your enlightenment
- [INTERPRETER]

306
00:33:25,035 --> 00:33:30,765
- and then talk about the rest of it
- [INTERPRETER]

307
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:38,291
- You can come here - there's some room
- [INTERPRETER]

308
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:43,981
- So, everybody should be seated down
- [INTERPRETER]

309
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:05,950
Now ask him to take away the film because
we're going to meditate and it might disturb.

310
00:34:05,957 --> 00:34:08,167
[INTERPRETER]

311
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:12,171
Some one should go and tell. 
Better to go there.

312
00:34:12,171 --> 00:34:14,873
- [INTERPRETER]
- He won't disturb you.

313
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:23,295
If he's seated, it's alright. [UNCLEAR]
he'll be a point disturbing people.

314
00:34:25,527 --> 00:34:33,207
[INTERPRETER]

315
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:37,207
Ask him to go out. I think,
he's finished - if you don't mind.

316
00:34:37,207 --> 00:34:44,657
[INTERPRETER]

317
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:56,730
- Thank you.
- [INTERPRETER]

318
00:35:12,353 --> 00:35:15,283
Very obedient!

319
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:48,010
- It will hardly take 10 to 15 minutes
- [INTERPRETER]

320
00:35:49,133 --> 00:35:56,966
- just to enter into the Kingdom of God
- [INTERPRETER]

321
00:35:57,296 --> 00:36:02,731
- which is the ocean of joy.
- [INTERPRETER]

322
00:36:03,566 --> 00:36:12,786
We come out of, like a pond into,
blossoming into a beautiful lotuses

323
00:36:12,786 --> 00:36:22,586
[INTERPRETER]

324
00:36:22,586 --> 00:36:25,996
- because you are that.
- [INTERPRETER]

325
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:34,320
- So, we have three conditions
- [INTERPRETER]

326
00:36:34,941 --> 00:36:39,261
- Want to sit down, come along - don't stand
- [INTERPRETER]

327
00:36:40,392 --> 00:36:42,672
- in the door;
- [INTERPRETER]

328
00:36:43,652 --> 00:36:46,112
There is room for you here, if you want.

329
00:36:57,387 --> 00:37:00,367
- Please be seated.
- [INTERPRETER]

330
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:07,309
- The first condition
- [INTERPRETER]

331
00:37:08,097 --> 00:37:14,917
is that you should have full
confidence in yourself.

332
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:19,320
[INTERPRETER]

333
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:26,530
You must have full faith that today, tonight
you are going to get your Self-realization.

334
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:31,940
[INTERPRETER]

335
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:40,000
- In no way you should feel tempted
- [INTERPRETER]

336
00:37:42,075 --> 00:37:45,895
- The second condition is
- [INTERPRETER]

337
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:59,792
- that you are not to feel guilty about anything.
- [INTERPRETER]

338
00:38:00,308 --> 00:38:05,658
Like yesterday, somebody told Me that, "Mother,
I have harmed somebody, so I'm feeling guilty."

339
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:11,818
[INTERPRETER]

340
00:38:11,818 --> 00:38:15,448
- What is the use?
- [INTERPRETER]

341
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:19,204
If you have harmed somebody,
then go and tell that person.

342
00:38:19,273 --> 00:38:23,333
[INTERPRETER]

343
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:26,953
- and tell to yourself,
- [INTERPRETER]

344
00:38:26,953 --> 00:38:32,673
- face your mistakes
- [INTERPRETER]

345
00:38:32,673 --> 00:38:37,713
but if you feel guilty, then the guilt 
goes here in the left side of your center.

346
00:38:37,713 --> 00:38:45,243
[INTERPRETER]

347
00:38:45,243 --> 00:38:53,263
- and you develop horrible diseases like angina,
- [INTERPRETER]

348
00:38:53,263 --> 00:38:56,803
- spondylitis,
- [INTERPRETER]

349
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:03,489
- also lethargy problems
- [INTERPRETER]

350
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:10,346
- So, no use feeling guilty
- [INTERPRETER]

351
00:39:10,346 --> 00:39:18,916
- It's like avoiding the reality.
- [INTERPRETER]

352
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:28,266
- At least at this time, please, forget your past.
- [INTERPRETER]

353
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:33,653
- Your past doesn't exist
- [INTERPRETER]

354
00:39:33,653 --> 00:39:35,903
- it's finished
- [INTERPRETER]

355
00:39:36,184 --> 00:39:42,064
- and your future also doesn't exist
- [INTERPRETER]

356
00:39:42,064 --> 00:39:47,034
- The reality is in the present
- [INTERPRETER]

357
00:39:47,034 --> 00:39:53,664
That's what will happen to you that
you will come into present.

358
00:39:53,664 --> 00:39:59,014
[INTERPRETER]

359
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:03,922
We are all the time thinking
about the past or the future.

360
00:40:03,922 --> 00:40:07,692
[INTERPRETER]

361
00:40:07,692 --> 00:40:13,562
- Jumping from past to future, future to past
- [INTERPRETER]

362
00:40:13,562 --> 00:40:19,252
- These thoughts come in
- [INTERPRETER]

363
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:24,162
but in between these thoughts there's a
little, little space for the present.

364
00:40:24,162 --> 00:40:30,192
[INTERPRETER]

365
00:40:30,192 --> 00:40:37,882
which increases in size and you
become thoughtlessly aware.

366
00:40:37,891 --> 00:40:43,411
[INTERPRETER]

367
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,930
You are absolutely aware but it's no
thought - complete peace

368
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:52,900
[INTERPRETER]

369
00:40:57,241 --> 00:41:04,081
The second, I told you, that you become
Collectively Conscious because you can feel

370
00:41:04,081 --> 00:41:12,601
- the centers of others.
- [INTERPRETER]

371
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:19,511
- [INTERPRETER]
- So, the microcosm becomes the macrocosm.

372
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:25,201
- [INTERPRETER]
- Micra is better to tell

373
00:41:25,201 --> 00:41:28,501
- [INTERPRETER]
- Alright.

374
00:41:30,337 --> 00:41:37,277
- We become part and parcel of the Whole
- [INTERPRETER]

375
00:41:37,277 --> 00:41:42,097
- A drop becomes the ocean
- [INTERPRETER]

376
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:53,570
Sahaja yoga is working in 55 nations and you will 
have brothers and sisters in all these 55 nations.

377
00:41:53,570 --> 00:42:00,742
[INTERPRETER]

378
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:08,520
- So please, don't feel guilty
- [INTERPRETER]

379
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:13,469
Those who tell you, you are sinners
and all that - forget them.

380
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:18,708
[INTERPRETER]

381
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:26,158
- Those who condemn you, forgive them.
- [INTERPRETER]

382
00:42:28,096 --> 00:42:34,486
- I'll tell you, you are not guilty.
- [INTERPRETER]

383
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:41,680
- Absolutely, no question.
- [INTERPRETER]

384
00:42:42,377 --> 00:42:48,117
And the third condition is,
that you have to forgive

385
00:42:48,117 --> 00:42:52,117
[INTERPRETER]

386
00:42:52,117 --> 00:42:55,157
- Forgive everyone.
- [INTERPRETER]

387
00:42:55,157 --> 00:42:58,847
Whether you forgive or don't forgive,
you don't do anything

388
00:42:58,847 --> 00:43:04,314
[INTERPRETER]

389
00:43:04,314 --> 00:43:07,744
- but if you don't forgive
- [INTERPRETER]

390
00:43:07,744 --> 00:43:12,984
- then you play into wrong hands.
- [INTERPRETER]

391
00:43:12,984 --> 00:43:16,984
- You torture yourself
- [INTERPRETER]

392
00:43:16,984 --> 00:43:21,302
while the person, who has harmed you, 
is first class.

393
00:43:21,302 --> 00:43:25,232
[INTERPRETER]

394
00:43:25,232 --> 00:43:36,042
- So, it's a myth not to forgive.
- [INTERPRETER]

395
00:43:36,042 --> 00:43:43,702
But you don't think about the people whom
you have to forgive; Just forgive in general.

396
00:43:43,702 --> 00:43:49,862
[INTERPRETER]

397
00:43:49,862 --> 00:43:53,562
- Some people say it is difficult
- [INTERPRETER]

398
00:43:53,562 --> 00:43:58,602
but it's a myth. What is difficult? Just
to say, "I forgive everyone," finished.

399
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:03,098
[INTERPRETER]

400
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:06,218
You don't have to take out 
something from your heart

401
00:44:06,218 --> 00:44:09,378
[INTERPRETER]

402
00:44:09,378 --> 00:44:12,448
- You just have to say
- [INTERPRETER]

403
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:18,419
- These are the three conditions.
- [INTERPRETER]

404
00:44:18,901 --> 00:44:25,511
- First is of complete confidence in yourself
- [INTERPRETER]

405
00:44:25,511 --> 00:44:30,461
- second one is not to feel guilty
- [INTERPRETER]

406
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:34,271
and the third one is to forgive
everyone, in general.

407
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:39,021
[INTERPRETER]

408
00:44:39,021 --> 00:44:43,921
Now, first we'll tell you how we will
be nourishing our centers.

409
00:44:43,921 --> 00:44:49,541
[INTERPRETER]

410
00:44:49,541 --> 00:44:55,261
As it is, there are, as you know, they 
must have told you that the left and right

411
00:44:55,261 --> 00:45:01,151
- are two sides.
- [INTERPRETER]

412
00:45:01,151 --> 00:45:07,881
Left side is for the power of desire,
the right side for the power of action.

413
00:45:07,899 --> 00:45:16,289
[INTERPRETER]

414
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:24,489
So now please put your left hand towards
Me. You have to take out your shoes first.

415
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:29,539
- [INTERPRETER]
- because the Mother Earth helps us a lot.

416
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:34,990
[INTERPRETER]

417
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:45,840
[UNCLEAR] For those who are sitting on
the ground, it's all right but those

418
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:51,100
who are sitting on the chair, they have to
put their left leg on one side - right

419
00:45:51,100 --> 00:46:00,980
- with a little distance between the two.
- [INTERPRETER]

420
00:46:02,391 --> 00:46:06,391
Now please, put your left hand towards
Me, on your lap.

421
00:46:07,087 --> 00:46:10,147
[INTERPRETER]

422
00:46:10,377 --> 00:46:14,377
- Be comfortable, first of all.
- [INTERPRETER]

423
00:46:15,075 --> 00:46:19,075
- You shouldn't give a strain
- [INTERPRETER]

424
00:46:19,075 --> 00:46:23,075
- nor you should not bend also
- [INTERPRETER]

425
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:26,859
Don't have to go to Himalayas, stand
on your heads - nothing.

426
00:46:26,859 --> 00:46:31,800
[INTERPRETER]

427
00:46:32,492 --> 00:46:39,192
- Now, please put your left hand towards Me
- [INTERPRETER]

428
00:46:40,886 --> 00:46:46,546
This is symbolic that you want to
have your Self-realization - desire.

429
00:46:46,546 --> 00:46:54,816
[INTERPRETER]

430
00:46:56,825 --> 00:47:04,705
Then, you have to use the right hand
for nourishing your centers.

431
00:47:04,705 --> 00:47:10,475
[INTERPRETER]

432
00:47:11,872 --> 00:47:18,042
- So, first you put your right hand on your heart
- [INTERPRETER]

433
00:47:19,271 --> 00:47:27,051
- In the heart resides the Spirit
- [INTERPRETER]

434
00:47:28,047 --> 00:47:33,807
Now, if you become the spirit, you 
become your own guide, your own master.

435
00:47:33,807 --> 00:47:39,677
[INTERPRETER]

436
00:47:39,677 --> 00:47:46,397
So, please take your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

437
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:54,697
- which is the center of your mastery.
- [INTERPRETER]

438
00:47:55,446 --> 00:48:00,576
This mastery comes to you through 
pure, Divine knowledge.

439
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:06,632
[INTERPRETER]

440
00:48:06,632 --> 00:48:11,492
- But I cannot force it on you
- [INTERPRETER]

441
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:17,165
The center for that is the lower portion
of your abdomen on the left hand side.

442
00:48:17,165 --> 00:48:21,715
[INTERPRETER]

443
00:48:25,626 --> 00:48:33,456
Now, raise your right hand again on
your abdomen on the left hand side

444
00:48:33,456 --> 00:48:38,546
[INTERPRETER]

445
00:48:38,546 --> 00:48:44,876
- We're working only on the left hand side
- [INTERPRETER]

446
00:48:44,876 --> 00:48:49,776
- Now we raise our right hand on our heart
- [INTERPRETER]

447
00:48:49,776 --> 00:48:57,646
Then we put our right hand on the corner
of our neck and turn our head to the right

448
00:48:57,646 --> 00:49:02,066
[INTERPRETER]

449
00:49:02,425 --> 00:49:07,475
I've already told you, that by feeling 
guilty this center goes out of order.

450
00:49:07,499 --> 00:49:13,649
[INTERPRETER]

451
00:49:14,407 --> 00:49:21,507
Then you take your right hand on your forehead
across and bend your head as far as possible.

452
00:49:21,507 --> 00:49:28,147
[INTERPRETER]

453
00:49:28,343 --> 00:49:40,323
Here you have to ask, you have to
forgive everyone in general.

454
00:49:40,323 --> 00:49:43,603
[INTERPRETER]

455
00:49:46,686 --> 00:49:54,006
Now, for your own satisfaction, without 
feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

456
00:49:54,006 --> 00:49:58,530
you have to ask forgiveness
from the Divine power.

457
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:06,770
[INTERPRETER]

458
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:13,469
So, please put your hand on the back side for
that - the center is here [UNCLEAR]

459
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:18,979
- [INTERPRETER]
- Just wait

460
00:50:18,979 --> 00:50:23,269
The center is here for asking forgiveness,
so bend your head back

461
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:29,414
[INTERPRETER]

462
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:37,773
- Now, stretch your palm -
- [INTERPRETER]

463
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:41,574
- this is for the last center
- [INTERPRETER]

464
00:50:41,654 --> 00:50:47,284
Put the center of your palm on top
of the fontanel bone area

465
00:50:47,284 --> 00:50:50,144
[INTERPRETER]

466
00:50:50,144 --> 00:50:54,724
- which was a soft bone in your childhood
- [INTERPRETER]

467
00:50:55,742 --> 00:51:02,342
- Now, please bend your head as far as possible
- [INTERPRETER]

468
00:51:02,342 --> 00:51:09,182
Now, is important is to press back your fingers,
so there is good pressure on your scalp.

469
00:51:09,182 --> 00:51:15,172
[INTERPRETER]

470
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:19,652
Bend your heads, bend your heads,
push back your fingers, push back

471
00:51:19,652 --> 00:51:24,682
- [INTERPRETER]
- Push back your fingers, push back.

472
00:51:24,802 --> 00:51:27,672
[INTERPRETER]

473
00:51:28,114 --> 00:51:34,314
- Now, move your scalp slowly
- [INTERPRETER]

474
00:51:34,857 --> 00:51:41,037
Please move your scalp slowly, 
seven times, clockwise

475
00:51:41,037 --> 00:51:44,527
- [INTERPRETER]

476
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,720
- Slowly
- [INTERPRETER]

477
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,800
- pressurize it
- [INTERPRETER]

478
00:51:53,275 --> 00:51:56,555
- That's all you have to do
- [INTERPRETER]

479
00:51:56,663 --> 00:52:00,813
- These people are standing in the doorway
- [INTERPRETER]

480
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:04,757
- they can come in, if they want.
- [INTERPRETER]

481
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:15,707
- What are they saying?
- [INTERPRETER]

482
00:52:15,707 --> 00:52:21,287
Close the door, They're just close to the
door - I mean, funny people.

483
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:42,330
Alright. Now, please take out your 
spectacles and you have to close your eyes

484
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:47,030
when I tell you. Please don't 
open them till I tell you.

485
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:52,230
[INTERPRETER]

486
00:52:53,727 --> 00:52:57,437
You don't have to say any mantra,
any prayer - nothing

487
00:52:57,437 --> 00:53:01,127
[INTERPRETER]

488
00:53:01,127 --> 00:53:05,587
Don't put concentrate - nothing, just
leave it alone, your attention.

489
00:53:05,587 --> 00:53:18,077
[INTERPRETER]

490
00:53:18,077 --> 00:53:24,147
- Now, please close your eyes
- [INTERPRETER]

491
00:53:24,147 --> 00:53:28,147
- put both the feet apart
- [INTERPRETER]

492
00:53:28,147 --> 00:53:37,407
- and the left hand towards Me, on your lap
- [INTERPRETER]

493
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:42,467
- and put the right hand on the heart.
- [INTERPRETER]

494
00:53:42,467 --> 00:53:46,037
- Close the eyes. Don't open them.
- [INTERPRETER]

495
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:51,432
- Not very tight
- [INTERPRETER]

496
00:53:51,432 --> 00:53:54,732
- ordinary way.
- [INTERPRETER]

497
00:53:54,732 --> 00:54:00,592
Now here, you have to ask Me a very 
fundamental question about yourself.

498
00:54:00,592 --> 00:54:15,082
- You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji.
- [INTERPRETER]

499
00:54:16,834 --> 00:54:23,314
Please ask three times, in your heart,
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

500
00:54:24,077 --> 00:54:31,247
[INTERPRETER]

501
00:54:43,754 --> 00:54:50,544
Now I've told, you become the Spirit, you 
become your own guide, your own guru.

502
00:54:50,562 --> 00:54:56,652
[INTERPRETER]

503
00:54:56,942 --> 00:55:04,092
So now, please take your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

504
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:07,862
[INTERPRETER]

505
00:55:07,862 --> 00:55:15,092
and ask a fundamental question about 
yourself, "Mother, am I my own master?"

506
00:55:15,092 --> 00:55:24,032
- three times.
- [INTERPRETER]

507
00:55:29,043 --> 00:55:34,913
I've already told you that I respect your 
freedom and I cannot force your

508
00:55:34,913 --> 00:55:43,463
- Divine Knowledge upon you.
- [INTERPRETER]

509
00:55:43,463 --> 00:55:46,893
- You have to ask for it
- [INTERPRETER]

510
00:55:46,893 --> 00:55:50,573
So now, take your right hand in the lower
portion of your abdomen

511
00:55:50,573 --> 00:55:54,573
[INTERPRETER]

512
00:55:54,573 --> 00:56:04,833
and here you have to ask, "Mother, please
give me Your Divine Knowledge."

513
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:10,403
Say it six times because this has, 
this center has six petals.

514
00:56:10,403 --> 00:56:22,653
[INTERPRETER]

515
00:56:33,152 --> 00:56:42,562
As soon as you ask for Divine knowledge,
the Kundalini starts moving upward.

516
00:56:42,562 --> 00:56:47,632
[INTERPRETER]

517
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:52,785
- You may not feel anything
- [INTERPRETER]

518
00:56:53,416 --> 00:57:01,446
- but be happy; Nourish the higher centers
- [INTERPRETER]

519
00:57:01,446 --> 00:57:04,596
to allow the Kundalini to pass
through these centers.

520
00:57:04,596 --> 00:57:08,926
[INTERPRETER]

521
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:15,626
So now, please try to raise your right 
hand the upper portion of your abdomen

522
00:57:15,628 --> 00:57:18,488
[INTERPRETER]

523
00:57:18,488 --> 00:57:27,788
With full self-confidence you have to say 
ten times, "Mother, I am my own master."

524
00:57:27,788 --> 00:57:38,508
[INTERPRETER]

525
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:48,810
I've already told you the truth about you 
is that, you are not this body, this mind,

526
00:57:49,378 --> 00:57:56,508
these emotions, these conditionings and 
this ego but you are the Pure Spirit.

527
00:57:56,508 --> 00:58:07,128
[INTERPRETER]

528
00:58:08,957 --> 00:58:14,357
So now, please raise your right hand
on your heart

529
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:18,237
[INTERPRETER]

530
00:58:18,635 --> 00:58:27,745
and here you have to say, with full confidence,
twelve times, "Mother, I am the Pure Spirit."

531
00:58:27,745 --> 00:58:33,845
[INTERPRETER]

532
00:58:48,581 --> 00:58:56,801
Now, the All-Pervading Power of Divine
Love, is the ocean of knowledge,

533
00:58:56,973 --> 00:59:00,973
[INTERPRETER]

534
00:59:00,973 --> 00:59:11,633
- is the ocean of bliss and joy
- [INTERPRETER]

535
00:59:11,668 --> 00:59:20,088
- but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness
- [INTERPRETER]

536
00:59:20,088 --> 00:59:24,848
- and whatever you may do
- [INTERPRETER]

537
00:59:24,848 --> 00:59:31,458
whatever mistakes you may commit, can be easily
dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness.

538
00:59:31,458 --> 00:59:36,718
[INTERPRETER]

539
00:59:38,563 --> 00:59:44,353
- So please, forgive yourself
- [INTERPRETER]

540
00:59:44,755 --> 00:59:50,215
Bring your hand like that, in the corner
of your neck and your shoulder

541
00:59:50,215 --> 00:59:57,815
- and put your head to your right
- [INTERPRETER]

542
00:59:57,815 --> 01:00:03,875
Here, you have to say, sixteen times,
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

543
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:15,945
[INTERPRETER]

544
01:00:25,905 --> 01:00:33,255
I've already told you, whether you forgive
or don't forgive, you do not do anything

545
01:00:33,708 --> 01:00:40,318
[INTERPRETER]

546
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:44,238
but if you don't forgive, then 
you play into wrong hands.

547
01:00:44,238 --> 01:00:49,188
[INTERPRETER]

548
01:00:50,043 --> 01:00:55,583
So, you have to forgive and forgive not
individually but in general.

549
01:00:55,583 --> 01:01:02,153
[INTERPRETER]

550
01:01:02,606 --> 01:01:09,066
So please, raise your right hand on top of 
your forehead across and put down your head

551
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:15,916
- please put down your head
- [INTERPRETER]

552
01:01:16,867 --> 01:01:21,067
and here you have to say it from your 
heart, not how many times,

553
01:01:21,067 --> 01:01:35,087
- "Mother I forgive everyone, in general."
- [INTERPRETER]

554
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,580
- This is very important
- [INTERPRETER]

555
01:01:53,417 --> 01:01:58,057
Now, please take your right hand on
the back side of your head

556
01:01:58,057 --> 01:02:01,487
- [INTERPRETER]

557
01:02:02,765 --> 01:02:06,765
- and push back your head, as far as possible
- [INTERPRETER]

558
01:02:07,935 --> 01:02:12,395
Here, without feeling guilty, without
counting your mistakes,

559
01:02:12,885 --> 01:02:17,545
just for your satisfaction you have
to say it from your heart,

560
01:02:18,605 --> 01:02:24,895
"O Divine Power, please forgive me,
if I have done anything wrong."

561
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:33,392
[INTERPRETER]

562
01:02:33,392 --> 01:02:40,027
- [INTERPRETER]
- Push back, push back your head

563
01:02:40,027 --> 01:02:43,647
- on the back side of your head
not the neck but head.

564
01:02:43,658 --> 01:02:56,278
[INTERPRETER]

565
01:02:56,613 --> 01:03:03,653
- Alright. Now the last center
- [INTERPRETER]

566
01:03:03,653 --> 01:03:09,743
- you stretch your palm fully
- [INTERPRETER]

567
01:03:09,743 --> 01:03:17,623
- and put it on top of the fontanel bone area
- [INTERPRETER]

568
01:03:17,623 --> 01:03:24,053
- which is a soft bone in your childhood.
- [INTERPRETER]

569
01:03:24,053 --> 01:03:28,843
- Now, please put down your head
- [INTERPRETER]

570
01:03:28,843 --> 01:03:33,863
- and push back your fingers
- [INTERPRETER]

571
01:03:33,863 --> 01:03:37,693
- Please put down your heads, please put down
- [INTERPRETER]

572
01:03:37,693 --> 01:03:40,053
- Push back your fingers
- [INTERPRETER]

573
01:03:40,053 --> 01:03:47,673
- Here again, I cannot force Self-realization on you
- [INTERPRETER]

574
01:03:47,673 --> 01:03:51,263
- You have to ask for it
- [INTERPRETER]

575
01:03:51,263 --> 01:03:59,893
So, move your scalp, seven times, slowly,
clockwise, saying, "Mother, please give
me Self-realization,"- seven times.

576
01:04:00,393 --> 01:04:09,363
