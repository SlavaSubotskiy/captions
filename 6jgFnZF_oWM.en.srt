00:07:28,388 --> 00:07:34,380
Talks to Brides and to Grooms.  Delhi (India), 23 March 2000.

2
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:39,505
Talk to Grooms.

3
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:44,387
I am very happy to see you all here,

4
00:07:44,587 --> 00:07:47,610
and you should know you are

5
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:51,272
going for a little different life,

6
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:56,676
that you are getting married in Sahaja Yoga.

7
00:07:57,567 --> 00:08:00,289
Thereâ€™s a difference between

8
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:03,976
the other marriages and Sahaja Yoga marriage

9
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:10,468
in which we understand that marriage has to be

10
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:16,292
a special, as they call yagnya,

11
00:08:16,492 --> 00:08:23,255
means a special type of a holy alliance

12
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:32,935
in which you have to lead a very Sahaj life with your wife

13
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:37,835
and to understand her. She is also Sahaja Yogini.

14
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:42,522
So you must respect her and you must love her,

15
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:46,410
and she should really understand

16
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:53,813
that you are her caring, loving, gentle husband.

17
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:57,461
You must show all concern about her

18
00:08:57,661 --> 00:09:00,157
because she is a Sahaja Yogini.

19
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:05,897
She is not an ordinary woman,
and with that respect I am sure

20
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:12,354
youll be able to lead a very beautiful Sahaj married life.

21
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:16,104
As it is, in Sahaja Yoga, as you know

22
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:20,214
we dont criticize each other.

23
00:09:20,414 --> 00:09:24,604
We see the good points of another person

24
00:09:24,804 --> 00:09:28,963
and we have a great capacity to forgive.

25
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:34,017
So to forgive is not to tolerate or to suffer,

26
00:09:34,217 --> 00:09:39,095
but you forgive just because you are very noble,

27
00:09:39,295 --> 00:09:41,564
you are a Sahaja Yogi.

28
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:47,141
So dont try to find faults with your wife all the time.

29
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:50,672
Also you shouldnt give her all the time

30
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:55,786
orders this, do this, do that - but join hands with her.

31
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:59,075
Because in Sahaja Yoga we dont believe

32
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:04,389
in an individuals rights as to dominate another person.

33
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:09,210
So what you should see the need to help her,

34
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:15,810
to understand her and to share all the problems.

35
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,615
Not to put problems on to her,

36
00:10:18,815 --> 00:10:24,553
but to give her all the helping hand that is needed.

37
00:10:24,753 --> 00:10:27,404
Shes your companion. Shes not your slave.

38
00:10:27,604 --> 00:10:29,748
Shes not your servant,

39
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:34,741
neither you are sort of, I should say, a boss of her.

40
00:10:34,941 --> 00:10:40,038
So all those qualities are not to be seen in a Sahaja Yogi,

41
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:42,772
and understanding is the best part.

42
00:10:42,972 --> 00:10:48,390
Try to understand her side also.

43
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:52,507
Sometimes they are coming from another country

44
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:56,453
and are of a different culture.

45
00:10:56,653 --> 00:11:00,764
So try to understand. This is how youll understand

46
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:05,944
what is the culture of that country from where she comes.

47
00:11:06,144 --> 00:11:09,816
Also its good for children that you must always respect,

48
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:13,176
always respect your wife.

49
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:17,269
You shouldnt have some sort of a ideal about your wife.

50
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:21,803
And, forget about all the other conditionings you have had

51
00:11:22,003 --> 00:11:24,248
or you have seen in the society.

52
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:26,522
You are a very different people.

53
00:11:26,722 --> 00:11:31,509
You are absolutely chosen people

54
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:34,978
for a very special work of Sahaja Yoga.

55
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:38,845
So once you start understanding this point

56
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:45,764
that you are here to marry girls who are Sahaja Yoginis

57
00:11:45,964 --> 00:11:48,225
and who will look after you.

58
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:51,250
I will also tell them what they have to do.

59
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:56,219
But I would request you that do not have domination of a man

60
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:58,570
or thinking that you are

61
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:03,967
the head of the family to trouble the wife.

62
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:07,404
Share with her. Please understand that

63
00:12:07,604 --> 00:12:10,951
and once you start doing that, you will enjoy

64
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:14,154
helping her and understanding her.

65
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:17,586
I hope your marriages are very, very successful

66
00:12:17,786 --> 00:12:21,040
and that you get very beautiful, sweet children

67
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,578
who are born realized souls.

68
00:12:23,778 --> 00:12:27,557
I am sure you will have a very happy life ahead of you.

69
00:12:27,757 --> 00:12:34,596
So go for that, go for a happy life by making her happy,

70
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:41,185
by making every one happy and looking
after everything in a Sahaj way.

71
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:45,060
So may God bless you all.

72
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,291
I am sorry, you have to wait...

73
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:32,284
Talk to Brides

74
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,495
Very nice to see all of you so beautifully dressed

75
00:14:37,695 --> 00:14:41,938
and looking so nice.

76
00:14:43,248 --> 00:14:47,352
I want to tell you one thing,

77
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:52,995
that you are marrying in Sahaja Yoga to Sahaja Yogis.

78
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:55,932
Always remember this point.

79
00:14:56,132 --> 00:15:00,010
As it is, we see there are so many marriages breaking

80
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,256
and all kinds of things happening in Sahaja Yoga.

81
00:15:04,456 --> 00:15:10,163
Also, we get sometimes one percent. Only one percent! Why?

82
00:15:10,363 --> 00:15:15,054
Because they understand the responsibility as Sahaja Yogis.

83
00:15:15,254 --> 00:15:19,046
So, I want all of you to remember

84
00:15:19,246 --> 00:15:23,570
that you are getting married to a Sahaja Yogi,

85
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,445
and you must always remember this fact.

86
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:30,101
You must respect him,

87
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:34,994
you must look after him and care for him.

88
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:40,533
Sometimes he may lose little bit of his balance.

89
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:45,696
It is you who has to bring him back to balance

90
00:15:45,896 --> 00:15:50,289
with very gentle ways.

91
00:15:50,489 --> 00:16:00,450
It is your duty to preserve the society of Sahaja Yogis.

92
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:05,064
People will come to your house. If they are Sahaja Yogis,

93
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:09,923
their wives, their children, you must look after them

94
00:16:10,123 --> 00:16:15,975
because you are in charge of the society of Sahaja Yoga.

95
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:20,057
You may be earning a lot, you may be very well equipped,

96
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:24,669
must be that, but you must always be humble

97
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:28,583
and understand that

98
00:16:28,783 --> 00:16:33,349
you have to carry all the work of Sahaja Yoga

99
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:36,044
through your marriage.

100
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:39,021
This is a very big responsibility.

101
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:44,911
In your case it is the preservation of the society

102
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:50,098
that is of Sahaja Yoga people, their children.

103
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:55,680
So you have to love all of them.

104
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,130
You must care for them.

105
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:04,932
Never think this is your own house and
that you are the queen of the house.

106
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:11,354
But you are the mother, you are the sister,

107
00:17:11,554 --> 00:17:20,797
you are the complete relation of
these people who are Sahaja Yogis.

108
00:17:20,997 --> 00:17:23,320
So when they come to your house

109
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,294
you must show all respect and regard.

110
00:17:26,494 --> 00:17:31,231
Never complain about them to your husband. He wont like it.

111
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:37,032
And also you must remember that your patience

112
00:17:37,232 --> 00:17:41,821
and your love and your guidance

113
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:47,310
will definitely help to build your married life.

114
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,802
If you want to be happy, you must know

115
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,513
how to make others happy also.

116
00:17:52,713 --> 00:17:56,622
If you do not know how to make others happy,

117
00:17:56,822 --> 00:17:58,822
you can never be happy.

118
00:17:59,023 --> 00:18:02,153
So, you should not think about your own demands,

119
00:18:02,353 --> 00:18:05,697
your own needs,

120
00:18:05,898 --> 00:18:11,606
your own, you can say, ideas or anything.

121
00:18:11,806 --> 00:18:14,385
Whatever is there you have to do it

122
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:20,057
in a very gentle manner because you are the women,

123
00:18:20,258 --> 00:18:22,313
you are the ladies.

124
00:18:22,514 --> 00:18:27,383
So your style should be gentle, should not shout,

125
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,649
you should not get angry,

126
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:35,243
you should not treat anyone sharply.

127
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:40,524
I will immediately know who is an unkind hostess.

128
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:45,313
That people will tell Me that, Mother she is a funny woman,

129
00:18:45,513 --> 00:18:50,085
she doesnt know how to behave. So I dont want to hear that.

130
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:56,176
I want to hear that you are very sweet, nice wives

131
00:18:56,376 --> 00:19:02,887
who will look after the husband, who will
look after the family of Sahaja Yogis.

132
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:07,172
Thats your job. Theres nothing to feel degraded in that

133
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:12,407
or less in that. Thats what is you have to do in Sahaja Yoga. n.

134
00:19:12,607 --> 00:19:15,782
Thats why you are so important.

135
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:19,022
You dont know the role of woman is so important,

136
00:19:19,222 --> 00:19:25,428
so very important that she can change the whole family

137
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:28,350
into a beautiful garden.

138
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:36,670
It is her own sweetness, her own creative mind of love

139
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:42,758
that can work it out. Must find out the art of love

140
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:48,445
and work it out on anybody who is disturbed,

141
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:54,615
or who is unhappy, or who is crossed. You can do it.

142
00:19:54,816 --> 00:19:59,898
You should know how to pacify that person and how to impress.

143
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:04,414
First quality you must have is the generosity of character.

144
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:08,716
You should not mind giving up anything to anyone

145
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,857
if they want. You will enjoy your generosity now

146
00:20:13,057 --> 00:20:17,256
and in that you should be generous when you forgive others.

147
00:20:17,456 --> 00:20:20,149
Forgiveness is very important,

148
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:25,250
and then you will never feel the brunt of your married life.

149
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,622
Forgive.

150
00:20:27,823 --> 00:20:31,492
Also you have to forgive yourself. Not to feel guilty,

151
00:20:31,692 --> 00:20:34,709
not to feel guilty at all about anything,

152
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:38,061
because after all you are also Sahaja Yogis,

153
00:20:38,261 --> 00:20:43,514
and if you have done anything wrong,
its all right, doesnt matter.

154
00:20:43,714 --> 00:20:51,933
But you should have the sweetness, the sweetness of a wife

155
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:58,534
who will emit love and peace to others.

156
00:20:58,734 --> 00:21:02,089
You should not be source of some sort of a

157
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:06,219
dominating personality or a person who is aggressive,

158
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:10,891
not at all. On the contrary you are the one who can bear

159
00:21:11,091 --> 00:21:16,594
lots of things and make a fun out
of every nonsense that you see.

160
00:21:16,794 --> 00:21:23,634
Nothing is so serious to fight it,
but to make a fun out of all that

161
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:26,298
and make a fun for every one.

162
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:29,861
Thats what you have to be, always smiling and happy.

163
00:21:30,061 --> 00:21:33,814
You will be amazed, you can make beautiful marriages

164
00:21:34,014 --> 00:21:38,835
for yourself, for your husband and all for Sahaja Yoga.

165
00:21:39,035 --> 00:21:43,866
So I am also very sure, if you make a successful marriage,

166
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:46,608
you will have very, very good children

167
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:51,069
who will be born realized. So you should be good mothers.

168
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:55,943
Mothers who can really do good to the children

169
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:59,373
and to other children also.

170
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:03,568
All that is stored for you in future.

171
00:22:03,768 --> 00:22:08,776
I know youll all be enjoying very much your future life

172
00:22:08,976 --> 00:22:12,932
and make it so beautiful that everybody should talk,

173
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,825
that look at these Sahaja Yoginis,

174
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:18,315
how they have made their lives happy!

175
00:22:18,515 --> 00:22:20,776
Its a very, very important thing

176
00:22:20,976 --> 00:22:25,955
that we should pay attention to our own mistakes

177
00:22:26,155 --> 00:22:31,150
than to the mistakes of others, and try to correct them.

178
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:36,583
See, they are themselves capable of looking after themselves.

179
00:22:36,783 --> 00:22:38,966
Only you should care for them

180
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:43,765
and also you should in every way be very kind and gentle.

181
00:22:43,965 --> 00:22:46,273
I am sure you all can make

182
00:22:46,474 --> 00:22:52,691
very, very good families which
nowadays are not available.

183
00:22:52,891 --> 00:22:56,003
You dont see people who are happy in the family.

184
00:22:56,203 --> 00:22:58,909
So no complaints about the husband,

185
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:02,414
no complaints about anybody to the husband,

186
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:06,016
but you make yourself so sweet

187
00:23:06,216 --> 00:23:14,789
that everybody wants to take your guidance, your love

188
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:18,906
and theyll come to you. I am sure this you can work it out.

189
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,733
There are so many Sahaja Yoginis who have brought such credit

190
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:25,702
to Me and have done such good work.

191
00:23:25,902 --> 00:23:28,217
I expect the same from you.

192
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:32,386
May God bless you.

193
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:38,941
This ceremony is called as Gauri Puja,

194
00:23:39,142 --> 00:23:42,362
means you are still Gauris. You are the

195
00:23:42,563 --> 00:23:45,261
Gauris and that the virgins,

196
00:23:45,462 --> 00:23:48,590
and you have to worship the Mother

197
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:55,545
for your future life as married women.
