1
00:00:02,111 --> 00:00:11,833
I’m just trying to remember if I had a more
fantastic birthday than this!

2
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:26,793
Where words do not come, there the joy
cannot be expressed.

3
00:00:27,734 --> 00:00:34,905
When it becomes so deep, then there is
no movement.

4
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:46,528
This is a great country. Australia has
been created

5
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:54,973
for a special purpose in Sahaja Yoga.

6
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:10,900
This is the Mooladhara chakra, where
resides Shri Ganesha, of this world.

7
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:24,596
How important it is to keep this centre
awakened within.

8
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:30,410
The information about My coming

9
00:01:33,117 --> 00:01:39,199
can only be broadcasted from this centre.

10
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,918
Then the world Kundalini is going to rise.

11
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:47,400
When you are putting your hands towards Me,

12
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:55,706
then the Divine love passes through
your fingers,

13
00:01:55,943 --> 00:02:03,057
goes down through your Ida and Pingala

14
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:10,970
and informs Shri Ganesha about My presence;

15
00:02:11,184 --> 00:02:15,392
and then the Kundalini rises.

16
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:35,210
So today, we should say, is a great day
in the history of Divine work,

17
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:41,465
where I came to Australia.

18
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,431
They asked Me, “Was there any incarnation
in Australia?

19
00:02:49,632 --> 00:02:55,738
Did God visit Australia in human form?”

20
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,388
I said, “It’s not easy to reach
Shri Ganesha!

21
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:09,084
Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh could not
reach Shri Ganesha.”

22
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:15,866
And you know that He is placed like a lotus

23
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:39,004
where all kinds of people who are insulted,
tortured, ignored, are saved.

24
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:49,877
Here He really decides whom to save
from hell, and whom not to save.

25
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:54,101
God’s decisions are very different,
they are absolute.

26
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:59,267
Human decisions are extremely cruel
and blind.

27
00:03:59,468 --> 00:04:07,184
And today you find so many saints in this
Mooladhara.

28
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:13,181
Just it means this is the work of Shri
Ganesh.

29
00:04:13,382 --> 00:04:18,128
He has borne you on this great chakra,

30
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:24,991
where Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha also cannot
enter into,

31
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:31,418
that you should stay here and grow
into beautiful saints

32
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:36,093
of very great magnitude in spirituality.

33
00:04:36,294 --> 00:04:41,979
Such a glorious domain is [put upon this
place - unclear]

34
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,343
and is such a blessing,

35
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:51,232
that even Indians could be jealous of you.

36
00:04:58,993 --> 00:05:09,421
One has to see how Shri Ganesha acts
within us.

37
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:18,944
It’s very important to recognise Him,
to understand Him and to imbibe,

38
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:25,633
otherwise, you will be wasting all His
energies staying in this place,

39
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:31,894
living in this place, so close to Him.

40
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:39,356
And though He is the giver of wisdom,

41
00:05:39,565 --> 00:05:46,211
I wonder how many people understand
the word ‘wisdom’.

42
00:05:46,757 --> 00:05:52,130
Wisdom is the centre of gravity within us

43
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:58,469
which gives us the fulcrum on which
we rotate,

44
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,878
by which we realise that we are inclined

45
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,985
to the left or to the right.

46
00:06:08,593 --> 00:06:17,737
This fulcrum we have to be aware of,

47
00:06:17,938 --> 00:06:22,569
because otherwise we will not know
how far we have gone.

48
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:29,648
Not only [that], but you should know
that it is so much

49
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:37,776
the centre of gravity and our fulcrum
so close to it.

50
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:44,453
Because if your centre of gravity and
fulcrum are separated,

51
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:51,291
there’s no integration. You can be ruined,
completely.

52
00:06:52,228 --> 00:07:01,341
So wisdom means this integration between
your understanding

53
00:07:01,852 --> 00:07:08,433
and the understanding of Shri Ganesha
within you.

54
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:19,961
For example, we go to extremes: extreme
behaviour.

55
00:07:20,162 --> 00:07:28,549
I will give you a very simple example:
I was going to Hong Kong

56
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:34,884
and the lady who organised it, telephoned
to Me again and again,

57
00:07:35,085 --> 00:07:41,158
and she told Me that, “A big bunch
of people are coming to see You.

58
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:49,214
And You are going to be on the television
for the whole of two nights,

59
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:51,705
and this is going to happen and that
is going to happen”.

60
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:56,972
And she was spending so much money,
everything, describing the scene;

61
00:07:57,173 --> 00:08:01,900
that I’ll be “the hot news” and all sorts
of things, you see,

62
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:05,514
like that she was talking about with Me
[unclear].

63
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:13,188
And she was on and on and on. And also,
she told Dr Warren.

64
00:08:13,398 --> 00:08:18,642
Except for giving the newspaper she didn’t
want to pay for.

65
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:25,312
It was going too far.

66
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:33,432
At that juncture, I told her that it was
not necessary

67
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,982
to go to such a limit and plan it out:
that there would be people coming

68
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:43,535
inside the aeroplane just to receive Me:
makes no difference to Me!

69
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:48,161
And there would be a car waiting near
the aeroplane just to receive Me.

70
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:56,067
I don’t know! I don’t know who was waiting
where at every point!

71
00:08:56,848 --> 00:08:59,459
And when we reached there, it was six
hours late

72
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:04,924
and I told Warren, “It’s all going to be
a fizzled out thing this time.”

73
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:17,095
And the plane just deposited us in Bangkok!
There was no way – six hours.

74
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:20,415
And we had to take another plane

75
00:09:20,616 --> 00:09:28,646
in which nobody came in, no car, nothing.

76
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:32,552
We went down looking for her, couldn’t see
her.

77
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:37,594
Telephoned to this hotel, they said,
“No arrangements thrown.”

78
00:09:37,795 --> 00:09:42,585
Warren thought, “Mother has gone
to another extreme now”.

79
00:09:44,402 --> 00:09:51,705
Quite worried that there was no one
to receive us at the airport now.

80
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:54,304
It’s all a joke.

81
00:09:54,505 --> 00:10:00,031
Going to extremes has to be corrected
in you as well, you see,

82
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:03,910
because if you get successful with your
this kind of planning,

83
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:06,827
then you’ll go on doing this kind
of artificial planning

84
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:10,087
and not the planning of the Divine.

85
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:15,976
The Divine has its own plans and we have
to feel the plans of the Divine.

86
00:10:16,177 --> 00:10:20,831
It works it out. You are just an instrument
to work it out.

87
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:28,725
So if you try to do something of your own,
something too much,

88
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:35,162
then who is going to suggest you
the balance is Shri Ganesh.

89
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:39,633
And that balance, once it’s established
in you,

90
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:46,137
you know how you should balance yourselves
and how there is no alternative

91
00:10:46,338 --> 00:10:52,166
for Sahaj Yog, no alternative; one must
know.

92
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:55,917
Everything that is living has
no alternatives.

93
00:10:56,118 --> 00:11:04,626
For example, if a mango tree says that,
“I will create a pomegranate,” it cannot!

94
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:10,354
There’s no alternative. Whatever is there,
it has to see and enjoy;

95
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:13,393
but not to force its way on it.

96
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:17,031
This is one of the things we have to
understand

97
00:11:17,232 --> 00:11:21,087
to establish our wisdom.

98
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:32,155
Because of our concept, our idea,
our anything,

99
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:40,608
even about God for example, about
our achievements itself,

100
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:45,695
can be absolutely wrong if we have
no wisdom.

101
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:54,714
But in nature, if you see, those who grow

102
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:59,111
are never bothered about what shape
they are going to take, do they?

103
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:05,718
Does a tree measure itself up to know how
many dimensions it is going to grow?

104
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:12,340
It grows as much as it can, slowly,
steadily,

105
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:17,644
in coordination with nature it is.

106
00:12:17,845 --> 00:12:28,296
Like that, the wisdom is the one
that understands.

107
00:12:29,903 --> 00:12:33,479
It is an establishment and a state
of mind, you see.

108
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:39,877
We can reach the state of being, when
you become wisdom.

109
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:49,327
Such a wisdom outside is also expressed
so beautifully.

110
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:55,993
Such a wisdom gives you a gentleman
and a gentlelady

111
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:06,438
only in a personality which is settled
down.

112
00:13:06,928 --> 00:13:11,222
If you are frustrated with a certain
problem,

113
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,915
if you are unhappy, if you are suppressed,

114
00:13:15,116 --> 00:13:24,484
any extreme will not allow this flower
of wisdom to grow.

115
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:27,470
So even in frustration you have to look
back,

116
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:30,251
you have to stand back and see
for yourself,

117
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:32,405
“Why am I to be so frustrated?”

118
00:13:32,606 --> 00:13:40,220
Count your blessings one by one, count
your blessings one by one.

119
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:46,634
I’ll say again, count your blessings
one by one.

120
00:13:46,835 --> 00:13:48,716
Once you start counting your blessings,

121
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:55,220
you will find in such a short time, where
are you.

122
00:13:56,594 --> 00:13:59,831
Now the extreme projections of the mind
can take you to:

123
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:06,231
“I’m not going to face!”; although you
would like to do it.

124
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:20,222
But in wise projection, you can see this,
that you are what you have to be.

125
00:14:20,423 --> 00:14:23,737
You are saints.

126
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:28,211
You were born to be saints in this great
country.

127
00:14:28,412 --> 00:14:31,788
You are specially blessed people
in the heavens,

128
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:41,390
and are sent on this Earth to do this
Maha Yoga, to spread it.

129
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:44,073
You have achieved that state.

130
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:49,424
And if you are saints, you should not be
bothered as to a few things like,

131
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:54,500
“Oh! I haven’t got a suitcase” or something
sort of a thing like that;

132
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:57,622
which you have never been very much
bothered.

133
00:14:57,823 --> 00:15:03,370
Can you see that? Any kind of extreme
behaviour.

134
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:07,855
For example, for materialism you people
are not so bad,

135
00:15:08,056 --> 00:15:14,805
in the sense that you understand the value
of aesthetics.

136
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:20,282
But in possessiveness let us take the wise
path – wisdom;

137
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:26,077
logically, it has to be logical: what do we
possess in this world?

138
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,801
Just think of one thing that we can
possess.

139
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:39,712
Except for your own Spirit, you don’t
possess anything.

140
00:15:39,913 --> 00:15:45,270
Except for your evolutionary development,
you don’t possess anything.

141
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:48,440
For example, now you are a saint you’ll be
born a saint always –

142
00:15:48,641 --> 00:15:53,170
this is what you possess. The rest
you don’t possess.

143
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:59,258
It’s logical, logical. You need not to be
realised to understand what I am saying.

144
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:07,119
So why should people here worry about
their possessions?

145
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,225
When you leave this worry, this is another
wisdom,

146
00:16:12,426 --> 00:16:17,876
this is a higher wisdom, which you are
developing within yourself.

147
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:22,860
And if we leave our possessions, our
material problems are solved.

148
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:26,819
This does not mean you throw them
in the sea, but the attachment to that.

149
00:16:27,003 --> 00:16:33,897
Then it is solved, already solved within
yourself.

150
00:16:34,098 --> 00:16:40,699
Like Kay lost her travellers’ cheques,
she did not throw them away.

151
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,177
Suddenly one man bumped into her.
I was with her. He said,

152
00:16:45,378 --> 00:16:48,589
“Imagine, I never knew I was going
to meet you!

153
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,519
When I went to a particular cashier or
somewhere he said,

154
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,903
‘Do you know this lady? I’ve got her
travellers’ cheques with me.’

155
00:16:57,104 --> 00:17:00,981
And here, suddenly, I bump into you!”

156
00:17:01,182 --> 00:17:04,310
How the news has been organised,
in the nature you see,

157
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:10,713
when the flowers bloom, how these bees
come all the way.

158
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:18,223
How the birds fly all the way from Siberia
to Australia?

159
00:17:18,424 --> 00:17:25,121
What wisdom, is that magnetism in them,
the magnetism that is in the Mother Earth

160
00:17:25,322 --> 00:17:30,689
which tells them, “This is the way you
have to go.”

161
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:38,252
So we have to see to this magnetism
within us:

162
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:42,303
what makes us magnetic

163
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:49,342
is not what we could have, what unnatural
things we have,

164
00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:51,789
but what naturally we have achieved within

165
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,986
and we are not afraid to express.

166
00:17:55,187 --> 00:18:00,286
In fear you are never aggressive,

167
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:10,953
but even in fearlessness you are never
aggressive.

168
00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:17,633
In fear you might say that you are not
afraid,

169
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:21,636
but you could be aggressive.

170
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:28,283
When people look very frightened, if you
push them

171
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:34,071
to the extreme of right, they can
come back.

172
00:18:34,272 --> 00:18:40,686
But if you are fearless, you are innocent,
you are just standing there, watching.

173
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:50,094
Fearlessness never means aggression.

174
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:55,977
So the confusion of our concepts

175
00:18:56,178 --> 00:19:01,895
can only be cleared out if there is light
within us.

176
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:07,615
For us, if somebody is aggressing us,
then we think

177
00:19:07,816 --> 00:19:11,345
[that] if we do not aggress the other
person, we are frightened of them,

178
00:19:11,546 --> 00:19:18,597
there’s no vengeance, then we are weakest,
we are weak, we are weak people,

179
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:26,698
so we should fight back. Even when you are
fighting back, you are weak people.

180
00:19:27,673 --> 00:19:32,825
If it was not so, what is there to fight
back?

181
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:37,805
In fearlessness you become the witness.

182
00:19:38,006 --> 00:19:44,102
You see the joke, joke behind all this
extreme behaviour of another person.

183
00:19:44,303 --> 00:19:48,420
And also you know the technique,
kaushalam.

184
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:53,436
Yoga also means kaushalam, it means
technique: how to manage the show

185
00:19:53,637 --> 00:20:03,201
by which his action doesn’t trouble you;
if you want to.

186
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:08,024
If you don’t want, you can even take
the action upon yourself, to prove it

187
00:20:08,225 --> 00:20:12,793
that, “Whatever you are doing is a little
silly and stupid.”

188
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:16,795
Like Christ getting Himself crucified.

189
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:21,741
It was a wise decision,

190
00:20:23,313 --> 00:20:26,948
because if you have to prove that life is
eternal,

191
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:30,592
the best thing is to die and show.

192
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:35,358
And to be [done] publicly, so that nobody
should say that He was not dead.

193
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:39,218
Still there are many people who are saying
[that] He was not dead.

194
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:42,874
Still there are people who are talking
this: “He was not dead.

195
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:47,123
He was alive. So He got out of the place.”

196
00:20:47,324 --> 00:20:51,657
Because they don’t know how to explain.

197
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:58,299
So He had to die publicly

198
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:05,285
and then His resurrection was to be seen
by many people.

199
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:13,961
This drama had to be performed

200
00:21:14,162 --> 00:21:21,716
for you to have the wisdom to know
that life is eternal.

201
00:21:22,835 --> 00:21:27,627
It doesn’t mean that He was weak,
by any chance.

202
00:21:32,136 --> 00:21:40,642
So the idea of our aggression, or our
suppression, both come

203
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:57,301
from either fear or some sort of a satanic
pleasure to oppress others.

204
00:21:58,686 --> 00:22:03,977
So wisdom lies in seeing yourself also.

205
00:22:04,502 --> 00:22:07,275
See how wisdom is so important.

206
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:12,748
Throughout if you find, in every chakra
resides pranava –

207
00:22:12,949 --> 00:22:15,696
is the life of every chakra.

208
00:22:15,897 --> 00:22:21,605
Because it is the wisdom that tells you
whether you are in a chakra or not.

209
00:22:22,797 --> 00:22:26,692
So how wisdom is [so] important that you
even become a sakshi

210
00:22:26,893 --> 00:22:30,154
if you have wisdom, otherwise you cannot.
You become a witness only

211
00:22:30,355 --> 00:22:39,599
when you have that focal point adjusted
to your centre of gravity.

212
00:22:42,324 --> 00:22:45,550
That is wisdom.

213
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:49,427
When people tell Me about somebody
who has harmed them,

214
00:22:49,628 --> 00:22:54,461
they paint such a dark picture of the whole
thing,

215
00:22:54,662 --> 00:23:01,458
as if it was the another war that was
fought.

216
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:05,287
Then you go and listen to another side,

217
00:23:05,488 --> 00:23:10,885
they paint another horrible picture
of this side.

218
00:23:11,317 --> 00:23:16,567
Between these two pictures you stand.

219
00:23:16,768 --> 00:23:22,271
You find the one is reflecting the other,
the other is reflecting the other.

220
00:23:24,998 --> 00:23:32,352
There is no end to it, it’s eternally going
on from this to that, that to this.

221
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:38,519
How do you end it up?

222
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:47,762
Only by your wisdom, by understanding
it’s an illusion.

223
00:23:47,963 --> 00:23:52,172
The main thing is the mirror on which
it is reflected,

224
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:58,710
is just an illusion that is appearing, and
we are worried about it.

225
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:03,248
The whole illusion will drop out as soon
as you just see the mirror

226
00:24:03,449 --> 00:24:07,462
and don’t worry about the reflections.

227
00:24:09,846 --> 00:24:15,377
They’ll come and go: it is for you just
to witness it, that’s all.

228
00:24:15,578 --> 00:24:20,201
It's not - the mirror is a mirror, which is
a solid thing,

229
00:24:20,411 --> 00:24:24,524
and all the reflections are illusions.

230
00:24:26,843 --> 00:24:35,728
That's how we miss all the sweetness
of our own being.

231
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:46,598
Wisdom lies in understanding that you
are the Spirit.

232
00:24:46,805 --> 00:24:52,492
You are not all these illusions, you are
the Spirit, you are the Spirit.

233
00:24:53,735 --> 00:24:57,601
The attention was, as animals, was on food
only, you can say.

234
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:01,752
You were aware of food, nothing else
but food.

235
00:25:01,953 --> 00:25:04,556
This grows higher and higher in awareness,

236
00:25:04,757 --> 00:25:08,993
than you feel - came up to a point where
he started thinking that he is

237
00:25:09,194 --> 00:25:13,414
the prime minister or he is an actor
or an actress

238
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:17,237
and this and that, and all sorts of
so-called they have achieved.

239
00:25:17,438 --> 00:25:23,045
Or maybe they start thinking, “Oh, they are
atheists,

240
00:25:23,246 --> 00:25:31,194
agnostics and all sorts of things, you see,
communists and socialists.”

241
00:25:41,116 --> 00:25:45,859
It’s a drama going on all the time. They
are wearing wigs after wigs, you see.

242
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,967
If they like this wig they’ll wear this,
otherwise they’ll throw away.

243
00:25:49,168 --> 00:25:52,026
This has killed the romance completely!

244
00:25:52,227 --> 00:25:56,682
You start loving the wigs of a person!

245
00:25:59,317 --> 00:26:07,076
And wigs can be bought, they could be
exchanged.

246
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:12,905
You go into the market, you can get, say,
about ten types of wigs.

247
00:26:13,106 --> 00:26:19,055
Supposing you say, “Oh, I like this colour
for the hair,”

248
00:26:19,256 --> 00:26:23,871
so the lady will go and wear that and
come out,

249
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:27,846
and then you'll like her for the wig
that she has got.

250
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:32,637
Then another may wear the same.

251
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:40,721
Or this same lady, who looks nice with one
wig,

252
00:26:40,922 --> 00:26:43,303
could bore you completely.

253
00:26:43,504 --> 00:26:52,037
Because there’s no living dynamism,
that charisma.

254
00:26:52,238 --> 00:26:57,948
Every moment is so beautiful. It breaks
into new waves

255
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:02,175
of such beautiful colours and beautiful
music.

256
00:27:02,376 --> 00:27:08,419
That is all lost with these bought images.

257
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:14,139
Every minute the image changes, with
a living personality,

258
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,913
into tremendous beauty. But the first point
is the wisdom

259
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:20,840
to know that our images cannot be purchased

260
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:27,675
or bought or created or made: they evolve.

261
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:32,283
So we have to only see to our evolving
force:

262
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,312
are we nearer it or are we out of it?

263
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:41,994
Are we moving with our evolving force
or getting ourselves

264
00:27:42,195 --> 00:27:52,231
crucified with all these artificial
misidentifications that says that,

265
00:27:52,432 --> 00:27:56,850
“You are this, you are that, you are...”?
You are nothing but a seeker.

266
00:27:57,051 --> 00:28:00,535
It's a category, I have told many- a-times,
that you are a seeker

267
00:28:00,736 --> 00:28:05,513
and you have to seek. Now, what do you
seek? Is your Spirit.

268
00:28:05,714 --> 00:28:09,849
And once you have found it, establish
yourself on that. That’s what you are!

269
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:16,321
And to know that you are that Spirit itself
is so satisfying;

270
00:28:16,522 --> 00:28:23,941
is itself emitting wisdom in you which is
so joy giving,

271
00:28:24,142 --> 00:28:28,941
and is nothing but love. It’s love,
I tell you.

272
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:31,507
I mean, I cannot go beyond this.

273
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:39,140
There’s no word in human language to say
what is love.

274
00:28:39,341 --> 00:28:46,737
To Me it is nothing but silence,
everything stops at that point.

275
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:51,719
Just feel it within yourself; where
the wisdom becomes love,

276
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:59,123
and love becomes wisdom, that’s
the real integration of life.

277
00:28:59,324 --> 00:29:04,962
Open your hearts, allow Shri Ganesha

278
00:29:05,163 --> 00:29:11,246
to be settled in that, that innocence
which enhances everything.

279
00:29:11,447 --> 00:29:15,291
Look at the little ones, how they came
forward to give Me flowers:

280
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:20,740
every step, every movement was so joyous,

281
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:25,443
was creating such a beautiful, delicate
ripple in My heart.

282
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:30,092
And it’s written as history for Me,

283
00:29:30,293 --> 00:29:37,159
to see these little, little sweet, innocent
Ganeshas coming forward.

284
00:29:37,545 --> 00:29:41,930
And the wisdom becomes so powerful,

285
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:46,648
that you know the source of love
as Ganesha in you.

286
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:53,834
For Him, He did not know anybody else but
one: that which is the source of love.

287
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,832
Never questioned, never argued:
no alternatives.

288
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:10,969
No new ideas came to His mind,
just taking in.

289
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:17,780
Working it out within yourself and
the whole thing just works out.

290
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:22,780
The more you enter into it, you will
understand that you have really entered

291
00:30:22,981 --> 00:30:26,207
into the Kingdom of God where He looks
after everything.

292
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,074
You want a house? All right, have it!
What do you want?

293
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:33,187
You want that? All right, have it. You have
a problem? Have it.

294
00:30:33,388 --> 00:30:37,480
It’s all God’s, the whole thing. Who owns
it but God?

295
00:30:37,681 --> 00:30:41,978
He is the One who owns everything and He’s
the One who enjoys everything.

296
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:45,679
And He wants you to enjoy everything.

297
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:52,802
Only through the power of wisdom that
you can achieve Me.

298
00:30:53,003 --> 00:31:01,356
Today, though I have to show a path
of that achievement in your wisdom

299
00:31:01,557 --> 00:31:07,433
in which there is no artificial thing;
it’s so natural.

300
00:31:08,586 --> 00:31:13,660
But natural doesn’t mean baser. Some
people think to be angry is also natural.

301
00:31:13,861 --> 00:31:17,718
But you are a human being and
a Sahaja Yogi.

302
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,778
Whatever is natural to a Sahaja Yogi

303
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:26,060
is not the same as whatever is natural
to a buffalo.

304
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:31,605
We have nothing to learn from them,
they have to learn from us.

305
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:35,864
So whatever is natural to a Sahaja Yogi

306
00:31:36,065 --> 00:31:39,916
has to be learnt in the school of wisdom.

307
00:31:40,117 --> 00:31:43,561
Not by any rule of any kind, or anything

308
00:31:43,762 --> 00:31:46,361
that I say, “You don’t do this,” and,
“You do this!”

309
00:31:46,562 --> 00:31:51,929
“You are not to do like that.” “You are not
to do this way!”

310
00:31:54,952 --> 00:32:03,355
Even in the hand if you see: this portion
is Australia.

311
00:32:04,136 --> 00:32:09,832
Now just see: this portion is the source
for all the fingers,,

312
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:17,783
it is the connecting point, is this point.
But it doesn’t say anything.

313
00:32:17,984 --> 00:32:21,488
For example, this finger means something,
this thumb means something,

314
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,137
this finger means something, this means
something,

315
00:32:24,338 --> 00:32:29,258
but this [base] doesn’t say anything,
doesn’t do anything.

316
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:32,455
But without this nothing exists.

317
00:32:32,656 --> 00:32:37,973
If it is cut out here, you are paralysed,
all the movements are finished, you see.

318
00:32:38,174 --> 00:32:47,516
This is the connecting link with the Divine
and the guiding link.

319
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:52,557
This only tells which finger to move, where
to take, how to contract, which muscle.

320
00:32:52,758 --> 00:32:58,740
All the muscles [are] controlled in this
portion.

321
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:07,956
The day will come when the information
will reach the whole world

322
00:33:08,157 --> 00:33:16,039
through the awakening of Ganesha in My
children, Sahaja Yogis in Australia.

323
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,505
And the whole world is going to get
the blessings coming from Shri Ganesh.

324
00:33:22,706 --> 00:33:31,184
[…] You know that Kundalini is in India
and only there the Kundalini can rise.

325
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:39,698
But one thing you have to remember,

326
00:33:40,142 --> 00:33:46,995
that you are really placed at a very
pivotal point

327
00:33:47,196 --> 00:33:52,132
and that the responsibility is too much
on you.

328
00:33:53,317 --> 00:33:59,925
The responsibility is to keep the whole
atmosphere pure

329
00:34:00,126 --> 00:34:04,120
and send forth all the fragrance
of the lotus.

330
00:34:04,321 --> 00:34:10,786
Though maybe you will feel you are
surrounded by only mud and everything,

331
00:34:10,987 --> 00:34:17,092
but still you have to be very strong
lotuses.

332
00:34:17,293 --> 00:34:22,597
For the whole world you have to come up

333
00:34:22,773 --> 00:34:28,050
and send forth that beautiful fragrance

334
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:34,867
of announcement that the Blossom Time
has come.

335
00:34:36,211 --> 00:34:41,040
I was asking for the river’s name, what’s
the name of the river.

336
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:47,657
I wonder if you thought about it. See,
the river’s name is Parramatta.

337
00:34:47,858 --> 00:34:53,010
‘Para’ in Greek means ‘above, beyond’,
should be, Parra.

338
00:34:53,211 --> 00:35:01,979
And ‘Mata’ means ‘the mother’. Your
river’s name itself is Parramatta.

339
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:08,662
It’s a Greek word and how the Greeks
have known this word ‘Parramatta’?

340
00:35:08,863 --> 00:35:12,884
This river had to be here, the Adi Shakti
Her[self], only, had to be here

341
00:35:13,085 --> 00:35:17,097
to bless the Ganesha all the time which
has to work hard.

342
00:35:17,298 --> 00:35:24,673
He’s the one who sorts out, the Lambodara.

343
00:35:26,162 --> 00:35:32,675
The one you see in the Sistine Chapel,
very well pointed out,

344
00:35:32,876 --> 00:35:38,581
the huge big stomach. It’s really
an Australian character, personality,

345
00:35:38,782 --> 00:35:46,039
standing there, sorting out people,
throwing left to the right.

346
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,194
It’s so beautiful, I wish you could get
that picture some time.

347
00:35:50,395 --> 00:35:55,148
And you will be surprised – it’s an
Australian. You can see it perfectly -

348
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:58,447
it's Australian character.

349
00:35:58,648 --> 00:36:04,936
That is Christ, absolutely an Australian
body, standing up.

350
00:36:05,137 --> 00:36:09,330
I don’t know how Michelangelo could see
that so clearly,

351
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:14,581
that He had to be Australian like that.

352
00:36:20,201 --> 00:36:28,353
It was so beautiful to come down,
so beautiful.

353
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:40,420
It’s blissful for you maybe, but for Me is
nothing but complete joy, complete joy.

354
00:36:45,104 --> 00:36:52,707
I had told that I will not do anything
after three years' time;

355
00:36:52,908 --> 00:36:57,281
I will just settle down because the saintly
person is not supposed

356
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:59,904
to move from places to places, they must
settle down,

357
00:37:00,105 --> 00:37:04,868
they must have their own round pillow
or seat - that’s called as takiya,

358
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:12,827
and you are not to leave that. But I am
your Mother - hm, great - moving all over.

359
00:37:13,028 --> 00:37:18,939
And can you imagine, I’ve been all over
the places, but never to Australia before.

360
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:27,920
So to come here first thing was so great
that even,

361
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:33,011
today I have not been able to put
all that into words.

362
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:36,711
May God bless you all.

363
00:38:00,755 --> 00:38:06,613
You are really the Ganeshas, the amount
of food you have.
