1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,935
Our main responsibility is, all the time, 
intensely, to think,

2
00:00:13,135 --> 00:00:17,584
“What we can do for the betterment 
of human beings?

3
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:23,412
And what are we doing about it?”

4
00:00:25,896 --> 00:00:28,833
First I used to say, “Count your blessings,”

5
00:00:29,049 --> 00:00:32,460
because that was the best way 
to make people understand

6
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,560
that there are blessings in Sahaj Yoga.

7
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:42,928
Now I would say, “Count your deeds.”

8
00:00:43,184 --> 00:00:46,395
What have you done for Sahaj Yoga?

9
00:00:46,676 --> 00:00:49,127
Sahaja Yoga has done so much for you.

10
00:00:49,785 --> 00:00:52,139
To say that Paramchaitanya will look after you

11
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:55,411
is absolutely absurd!

12
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:01,491
If Paramchaitanya could do everything

13
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:04,894
why should it create human beings?

14
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:10,821
One Adam and Eve were sufficient.

15
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:15,827
You have to do it.

16
00:01:16,068 --> 00:01:20,747
Unless and until you become deep,

17
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:25,013
it cannot trigger, it is helpless.

18
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:29,835
It’s only through you it is going to work out.

19
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,546
Now if there is no instrument, 
electricity cannot work, can it?

20
00:01:40,147 --> 00:01:43,462
Now you should say, 
“The electricity itself must come before me

21
00:01:43,663 --> 00:01:47,201
and must do everything!”

22
00:01:49,782 --> 00:01:54,837
You have to have the instrument 
and you are the instrument

23
00:01:55,064 --> 00:02:01,177
and if you do not want to do it, 
how can Paramchaitanya do it?

24
00:02:01,757 --> 00:02:03,959
It will be something like saying, as I told you,

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,718
that, “Let electricity do the job, 
we’ll not have any instrument.”

26
00:02:10,244 --> 00:02:12,908
Can I work it out?

27
00:02:13,457 --> 00:02:16,408
Can you work it out?

28
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,619
So Paramchaitanya has its own style.

29
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:31,498
It can only work if you people want to work it out.

30
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,451
It’s an energy and you are the instrument.

31
00:02:38,832 --> 00:02:43,589
But the instrument is more busy with the job,

32
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:46,654
with the family, I don't know,

33
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,221
all kinds of nonsensical things.

34
00:02:51,885 --> 00:02:57,870
Now supposing this instrument, 
which is meant for my lecture,

35
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:03,181
forgets what it is

36
00:03:03,857 --> 00:03:07,143
and acts like a ladle in the kitchen

37
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:11,762
because it’s fond of food, say, for example:

38
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:17,927
then what’s the use of making 
this useless instrument?

39
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:21,262
It doesn’t do what it has to do.

40
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:27,340
It doesn’t know what it has been made for.

41
00:03:30,473 --> 00:03:36,308
It has no purpose at all. It’s such a useless stuff.

42
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:46,320
So I feel there’s a kind of a lethargy,

43
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:50,665
a kind of a very subtle lethargy working out,

44
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:55,853
like this that,

45
00:03:56,053 --> 00:04:00,719
“We’ve done our job. 
Let the young people do it now!”

46
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,827
You are matured,

47
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:10,205
and the matured have to do the job.

48
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:19,663
“We have done our level best!”.  
What have you done so far?

49
00:04:29,473 --> 00:04:32,559
So much to be done still.

50
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:36,230
And somehow or other

51
00:04:37,746 --> 00:04:39,169
we have to touch

52
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:43,959
that area where such people remain 
like the yesterday’s player.

53
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:47,541
He is not doing God’s work.

54
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:52,887
He’s an artist

55
00:04:54,705 --> 00:04:59,564
and he’s working so hard to achieve perfection.

56
00:05:03,776 --> 00:05:07,667
He will get the same amount 
whether he’s perfect or not,

57
00:05:12,748 --> 00:05:14,809
but he’s practising at home,

58
00:05:15,052 --> 00:05:18,911
he’s listening to it, he’s trying to develop it.

59
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:22,589
All the time working it out so that

60
00:05:22,882 --> 00:05:26,671
his performance should be excellent.

61
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:29,964
So he’s seeking an excellence.

62
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:34,261
Mediocrity has no place in Sahaj Yoga.

63
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:42,686
Only through excellence you’ll enjoy.

64
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:48,870
Only through excellence 
you will really become Sahaj Yogis.
