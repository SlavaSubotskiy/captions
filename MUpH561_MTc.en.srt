1
00:00:03,242 --> 00:00:09,034
It is a very unique opportunity, I think,

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,492
for Me to meet you again in Bombay

3
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:16,158
when you are all leaving this country,

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,450
and this kind of a special type of a puja

5
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,450
that we are having today.

6
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:31,076
This is the puja done to the sun,

7
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:35,700
and is called as Makar Sankrant.

8
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:43,492
"Makar" is the tropic of Capricorn,

9
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:45,450
Capricorn is Makar.

10
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:50,117
So now the sun is moving from the tropic of Capricorn

11
00:00:51,617 --> 00:00:54,659
towards the tropic of Cancer,

12
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:58,242
and is always a fixed date because it's a,

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,325
it has something to do with the sun.

14
00:01:00,325 --> 00:01:03,450
This is the only date which is fixed in the Indian calendar,

15
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,617
because they have to deal with the sun.

16
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,492
But this time, I don't know why, what has happened

17
00:01:08,492 --> 00:01:10,492
that they have put it on the fifteenth

18
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:13,242
of this month - it's always the fourteenth.

19
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:18,534
Now today is, they are changing,

20
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:24,034
I would say that the seasons are going to be changed.

21
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:30,575
We've got six months when this moves,

22
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:33,951
sun moves towards the southern hemisphere

23
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:38,575
and makes it warm, and it comes to the northern hemisphere

24
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,449
from tomorrow.

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,534
So today is the last day, which we say that

26
00:01:47,826 --> 00:01:50,200
is the day which is the coldest day,

27
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,242
according to Indian understanding.

28
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,534
After this the heat will start growing

29
00:01:58,116 --> 00:02:02,450
and all the - we can do anything that is auspicious,

30
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,325
any auspicious things can be done after this puja is over,

31
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:09,659
during the summer-time.

32
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:12,158
Though it's very hot in summer,

33
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:15,992
still people wants the sun to rule us

34
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:17,909
and to give us warmth because,

35
00:02:18,325 --> 00:02:24,034
because of him only all the fields and all the vegetables,

36
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:26,825
all the fruits, everything grows.

37
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:31,909
And that's why when the six months the sun is not here,

38
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:33,784
we call it as "Sankrant,"

39
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:36,075
meaning a "calamity" in a way.

40
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:38,951
That is when of course in the,

41
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:44,826
in the European countries or say in England or America,

42
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:50,158
it is a calamity at that time when the sun is not there.

43
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:55,492
But even here it is regarded as a time today,

44
00:02:55,492 --> 00:02:59,076
it's the day that the end of the Sankrant,

45
00:02:59,283 --> 00:03:01,617
means the end of the calamity is over.

46
00:03:03,242 --> 00:03:05,700
And they give something sweet to eat

47
00:03:06,076 --> 00:03:09,826
which is also mixed with sesame seeds,

48
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:13,116
because sesame seed is heat-giving.

49
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:17,992
So today being the coldest day they want to give sesame seed,

50
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:21,742
also want you to retain the heat

51
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:25,158
and to adjust yourself to the heat that's coming up.

52
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,158
This is all thought of in a way,

53
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:29,492
in a very gross level,

54
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:30,951
on a very gross level,

55
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:34,492
that we should keep the people warm enough.

56
00:03:34,742 --> 00:03:36,700
Also it is said that

57
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:43,034
the warmth of love should be expressed at this time

58
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:46,242
for people, because it is the coldest day.

59
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:50,076
So they say that "We give you this special thing for you

60
00:03:50,283 --> 00:03:53,158
to say something sweet" - that is "goad goad bola"

61
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:55,034
- means "you say something sweet to us."

62
00:03:56,117 --> 00:03:59,742
And the people who live in warm countries are sweeter people

63
00:03:59,992 --> 00:04:02,826
than the people who live in colder places,

64
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:06,699
because the nature is rather very unkind to them.

65
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,951
I don't blame them for their temperament,

66
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:11,699
because the nature is so unkind.

67
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:14,034
In India you can live anywhere:

68
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:15,867
you can live under a tree,

69
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,034
you can live in a forest,

70
00:04:19,034 --> 00:04:21,283
anywhere you can live quite happily,

71
00:04:21,534 --> 00:04:25,283
as long as there is water to drink and water to bathe.

72
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:29,408
And there's not such a problem as

73
00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:32,324
we have to face in the other parts of the world,

74
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:34,450
where if you have to go out of the house

75
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:38,116
you take about fifteen, twenty minutes to dress yourself up.

76
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:40,034
Here you just can walk out of the house,

77
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:43,034
you can keep your houses open during the summer-time,

78
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,867
and there's no problem of any kind

79
00:04:46,116 --> 00:04:48,034
as far as the nature is concerned.

80
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:52,742
Nature becomes very kind during summer-time here because

81
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:57,575
the trees are lush and lot of greenery,

82
00:04:57,867 --> 00:05:00,867
people feel very happy during that time,

83
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:09,909
and all the activity becomes more with the sun's energy.

84
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:15,700
But in the West as you have seen that the sun is much less.

85
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,283
Because of that,

86
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,200
people keep more to their houses,

87
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,783
to artificial heating or other heatings,

88
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:24,117
and the doors are closed,

89
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,033
the hearts are closed,

90
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,116
and it's difficult for them to

91
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,117
communicate with other people.

92
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:39,450
As you go down south more in your countries also,

93
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,700
you'll find people are warmer,

94
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:43,908
simpler,

95
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:49,783
very hospitable.

96
00:05:50,492 --> 00:05:55,158
With the sun you get the heart which is very open heart,

97
00:05:55,492 --> 00:05:59,158
and a kind of a inviting heart.

98
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:02,867
Now if you see on the Sahaja Yoga style,

99
00:06:03,116 --> 00:06:05,450
the sun line is the right side

100
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,951
and the moon, moon is the left side.

101
00:06:09,617 --> 00:06:11,116
On the moon line

102
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:14,659
one can desire but cannot act.

103
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,909
Apart from that, on the moon line

104
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:20,867
if you go too far it can be destructive.

105
00:06:21,283 --> 00:06:23,992
Because if you sit in the house doing nothing

106
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:29,033
- and also these days there's unemployment, say for example,

107
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:33,867
no work - then you start thinking too much,

108
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:39,534
and this thinking is just the desire energy working out,

109
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:40,992
no action.

110
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,992
And without the action

111
00:06:42,992 --> 00:06:45,575
this energy can become very destructive.

112
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:48,534
That is why we find that people,

113
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,534
they say that "empty mind,

114
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:56,534
empty mind is the devil's workshop."

115
00:06:57,325 --> 00:06:59,742
Where people have, do not act,

116
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:02,408
when the action doesn't take place,

117
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:04,784
then it can be quite destructive...

118
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:17,283
So the whole situation is different

119
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:18,992
in a country which is warm,

120
00:07:18,992 --> 00:07:21,325
and a country which is not warm.

121
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:25,534
But in a country where it is very warm also,

122
00:07:25,534 --> 00:07:26,909
like Africa,

123
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:30,325
there are complications due to too much of heat.

124
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:36,450
Like we have the tropic of -

125
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:39,742
mean the equator passing through,

126
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,867
and it heats up that area so much

127
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:47,158
that it becomes full of jungles,

128
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:50,116
very high trees and tall trees;

129
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:54,116
and the whole place is covered with foliage so much

130
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,534
that there's no possibility

131
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:02,867
for any sunshine to penetrate through,

132
00:08:04,076 --> 00:08:05,742
and it's quite dark,

133
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:07,408
it's full of darkness.

134
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:11,826
So that extreme also comes in the same category

135
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:14,617
as the extreme of the cold season.

136
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:16,826
Now such people live there

137
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:21,575
and they, naturally because the sun is less,

138
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:23,867
so they do not grow much;

139
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:26,951
and they can be primitive people

140
00:08:27,283 --> 00:08:29,492
and they can be quite aggressive,

141
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:32,242
like they learn things from the animals

142
00:08:32,242 --> 00:08:35,076
and they could be quite aggressive.

143
00:08:35,575 --> 00:08:38,157
So the balance has to be struck,

144
00:08:38,742 --> 00:08:40,408
and the balance is that,

145
00:08:40,742 --> 00:08:47,867
that we should desire and act.

146
00:08:48,242 --> 00:08:53,575
But the trouble is in human atmosphere

147
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,076
there is a division of labor, I think,

148
00:08:57,492 --> 00:09:02,367
that one part of the country is thinking,

149
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:06,117
another part of the country is acting.

150
00:09:07,076 --> 00:09:09,951
Under these circumstances nothing works out.

151
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:14,492
So a balance has to be struck where

152
00:09:14,826 --> 00:09:18,033
you have the Sushumna working out.

153
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:21,492
Now the Sushumna Nadi is the one where

154
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:25,867
one would say is the equator - it's not,

155
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:27,242
is not the equator,

156
00:09:27,242 --> 00:09:30,951
but is the axis of the Mother Earth.

157
00:09:31,283 --> 00:09:34,283
Axis of the Mother Earth is the Sushumna,

158
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,282
and that has to act;

159
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:41,367
and when it comes to that axis then we should understand that we have to be on our axis.

160
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:45,283
So we are on the axis,it is the one that balances.

161
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:49,992
Actually there is, there is, there is nothing

162
00:09:49,992 --> 00:09:51,867
like a big pole

163
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:54,992
inside the Mother Earth which we can call it as an axis.

164
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,200
There is nothing that is material

165
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,575
inside the Mother Earth that we can call it as an axis,

166
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:04,200
but it's the energy force

167
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,783
which acts in such a manner

168
00:10:06,784 --> 00:10:11,534
that the Earth moves with such tremendous speed

169
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:14,867
when the cosmos is all spread out so much.

170
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,325
It not only moves but it creates day and night for us,

171
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:22,908
so that day-time we can work and night-time we can sleep,

172
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:24,575
to give us a balance.

173
00:10:25,117 --> 00:10:29,116
Only also it moves in such a manner round the sun

174
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:35,658
that half of the countries get the sun

175
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:37,575
during the summer-time,

176
00:10:37,575 --> 00:10:41,992
and half of them get it during the winter-time.

177
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,867
That's the axis that acts and works out everything.

178
00:10:46,116 --> 00:10:47,034
Apart from that,

179
00:10:47,034 --> 00:10:51,784
this axis keeps all the distances necessary

180
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:56,408
from other planets and other moving bodies in the cosmos.

181
00:10:56,784 --> 00:11:01,117
This axis is the intelligence of the Mother Earth.

182
00:11:02,784 --> 00:11:07,200
It is not only the intelligence but it is the fragrance,

183
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:12,034
and apart from, it is the Sushumna Nadi,

184
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:14,117
you can say, of the Mother Earth.

185
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:18,575
Now through this axis only all these swayambhus

186
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:23,659
and all these great happenings of earthquakes

187
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:25,575
and all that takes place.

188
00:11:25,909 --> 00:11:28,325
This axis is the one which moves.

189
00:11:28,575 --> 00:11:31,407
It's an energy, we can call it axis as the energy,

190
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:36,283
moves the lava into different directions

191
00:11:36,951 --> 00:11:44,325
and pierces through different areas to create earthquakes,

192
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:47,158
and also to have

193
00:11:51,951 --> 00:11:54,826
... volcanoes, volcanoes.

194
00:11:55,158 --> 00:12:00,826
And all these things happen because the axis has sense

195
00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:02,076
what is to be done.

196
00:12:02,408 --> 00:12:05,158
This axis is the one that loves us.

197
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:08,617
Because of this axis we,

198
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:10,826
we have seasons.

199
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:14,492
The seasons are created beautifully to give us

200
00:12:14,492 --> 00:12:17,575
different, different varieties of food

201
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:20,076
and varieties of things.

202
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:25,076
The heat of the Mother Earth if it is lost,

203
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:28,617
then we'll have nothing on this Earth,

204
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:33,283
it'll be all frozen and there will be all snow,

205
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:36,158
and we'll have no food, nothing,

206
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,117
and it will be like moon living here.

207
00:12:39,951 --> 00:12:42,282
Now it has been specially created:

208
00:12:43,158 --> 00:12:46,242
first the Mother Earth when it was created

209
00:12:46,742 --> 00:12:49,158
through the heat of the sun,

210
00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:53,951
so we can say that the sun is the father of the Mother Earth.

211
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:58,158
Then she was brought very close to the moon

212
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,242
so it cooled down, absolutely it cooled down,

213
00:13:01,242 --> 00:13:02,826
it was all snow.

214
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:06,742
Then it was brought closer to the sun

215
00:13:07,034 --> 00:13:09,617
and moved at a point where

216
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:12,367
life could start working,

217
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:15,826
and that's how the whole thing was organized beautifully

218
00:13:16,117 --> 00:13:19,034
to make life grow in that area.

219
00:13:19,242 --> 00:13:21,242
Now when the life started growing,

220
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:25,951
gradually we know that how the carbon was formed.

221
00:13:26,116 --> 00:13:29,534
Now the carbon is formed by the same axis,

222
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:31,742
because there's heat in the axis,

223
00:13:31,742 --> 00:13:34,867
the energy of heat that converts

224
00:13:38,742 --> 00:13:43,116
the plants into carbon.

225
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:45,992
Now this carbon is, later on

226
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,826
forms the basis for,

227
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:51,534
we can say,

228
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:58,116
for the production of carbohydrates,

229
00:13:58,116 --> 00:13:59,367
you can say,

230
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:01,951
or all organic matter.

231
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:06,283
But to create life we had to have another help,

232
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:07,867
is the nitrogen;

233
00:14:08,116 --> 00:14:11,408
and this nitrogen was also, you'll be surprised to know,

234
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:15,534
that was created by the same axis, by its movement.

235
00:14:15,951 --> 00:14:18,408
And when it created this nitrogen,

236
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:21,117
the nitrogen gave us the amino acids;

237
00:14:21,408 --> 00:14:24,825
and when the amino acids were created within us,

238
00:14:25,242 --> 00:14:32,158
then we started our lives from amoeba and all that.

239
00:14:32,158 --> 00:14:36,659
Of course this was done in the ocean,

240
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:39,700
because in the ocean with the movement,

241
00:14:39,992 --> 00:14:43,116
nitrogen was created and life was created,

242
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:46,283
and then through the ocean it's emitted out,

243
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:49,534
and that's how we have amino acids.

244
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:53,242
With the amino acids, the formation of amino acids

245
00:14:53,617 --> 00:14:56,242
gave us the combinations and permutations,

246
00:14:56,492 --> 00:14:57,534
different lives.

247
00:14:58,283 --> 00:15:00,825
So in the whole evolutionary process

248
00:15:00,826 --> 00:15:04,826
the Mother Earth has played a very big part through her axis.

249
00:15:05,158 --> 00:15:07,283
In the same way in human beings,

250
00:15:07,534 --> 00:15:10,408
the axis is the most important thing.

251
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,867
That's the main principle of life we have got, is our axis.

252
00:15:15,158 --> 00:15:17,534
We have to stand on our axis.

253
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:20,367
Those who do not stand on their axis,

254
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:23,742
stand more towards the left or towards the right,

255
00:15:23,992 --> 00:15:28,283
are capable of complete destruction;

256
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,408
because either they will be destroyed by

257
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:35,158
too much of right side or too much of left side.

258
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:39,992
So our axis has to be properly dealt with.

259
00:15:40,283 --> 00:15:43,242
Now those people who do not have a proper axis

260
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:46,617
can have problems of different chakras,

261
00:15:46,992 --> 00:15:52,367
of different kind of quality in a person.

262
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:56,575
A person who stretches his axis too much,

263
00:15:56,575 --> 00:15:58,617
puts back his head like this,

264
00:15:58,617 --> 00:16:00,867
is a person who is very right-sided

265
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:03,575
and creates problem with his ego;

266
00:16:03,575 --> 00:16:05,951
and the one who absolutely bends down

267
00:16:05,951 --> 00:16:10,867
like a slavish person also is a person

268
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:13,408
who goes towards his destructiveness.

269
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:18,283
Now there's a big problem between these two types of people,

270
00:16:18,617 --> 00:16:20,617
one trying to dominate another,

271
00:16:20,617 --> 00:16:24,867
and when they start dominating another person

272
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,992
they actually destroy themselves,

273
00:16:26,992 --> 00:16:30,034
as well as destroy the ones whom they are dominating.

274
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:31,367
For example now,

275
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:35,867
we have seen that we had

276
00:16:36,617 --> 00:16:38,951
Britishers who came here and ruled us.

277
00:16:39,158 --> 00:16:42,492
We have seen the French went and ruled some other people,

278
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:44,324
then there are Portuguese who went and ruled

279
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:45,575
some other people.

280
00:16:46,076 --> 00:16:48,492
But everything that they did to dominate

281
00:16:48,492 --> 00:16:50,575
and all that has double reactions.

282
00:16:50,826 --> 00:16:53,158
First of all by their domination, say,

283
00:16:53,158 --> 00:16:55,242
Indians became very slavish,

284
00:16:55,742 --> 00:16:58,826
Indians became - even today they are extremely slavish,

285
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:01,700
and they do not have that independent axis

286
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,951
as they should have.

287
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:05,242
Extremely slavish people they are.

288
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,450
I mean, especially I've seen in the West,

289
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,742
I am surprised when the Indians go from here,

290
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:11,826
I find they are so very slavish.

291
00:17:11,826 --> 00:17:16,283
They try to sort of do all kinds of slavish acts

292
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:19,034
to please the white-skinned people.

293
00:17:20,158 --> 00:17:25,117
The white skin became sort of a very adorable stuff in India.

294
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:30,492
That added to the ego of the whites,

295
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:32,825
added to the ego of the whites,

296
00:17:32,826 --> 00:17:35,034
and today you see what's happening is

297
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:37,117
all that ego is destroying them.

298
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:40,575
They are on the verge of destruction because of their ego.

299
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,158
So it is so unnatural and it is so superficial.

300
00:17:44,492 --> 00:17:47,742
One has to understand that what is the best

301
00:17:47,742 --> 00:17:50,117
within a human being is his axis,

302
00:17:50,117 --> 00:17:52,076
and everybody has an axis,

303
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:55,742
and one must respect the axis of every person.

304
00:17:56,158 --> 00:18:00,117
In Sahaja Yoga I don't know you by your faces so much;

305
00:18:00,617 --> 00:18:02,826
I know you by your chakras,

306
00:18:02,826 --> 00:18:04,076
by your Sushumna,

307
00:18:04,076 --> 00:18:05,700
what sort of a Sushumna you have.

308
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,076
If you have a deep Sushumna, I know you as a deep person.

309
00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:11,492
If you have a superficial Sushumna,

310
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:14,909
I know you as a person with a very superficial

311
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:17,117
type of a Sushumna.

312
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:21,575
And even if you make up something

313
00:18:21,575 --> 00:18:25,034
by sort of being very nice or good,

314
00:18:25,283 --> 00:18:27,242
or talking about Sahaja Yoga

315
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:29,492
or knowing too much about Sahaja Yoga,

316
00:18:29,492 --> 00:18:33,700
and saying things which will baffle normally anyone

317
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:36,076
as if you are masters of Sahaja Yoga,

318
00:18:36,076 --> 00:18:38,117
I know how deep you are.

319
00:18:39,492 --> 00:18:41,158
So the depth on the axis

320
00:18:41,158 --> 00:18:43,492
is more important than anything else.

321
00:18:43,742 --> 00:18:47,242
Your axis has to be very deep.

322
00:18:47,408 --> 00:18:48,992
Now you will say that "Mother,

323
00:18:48,992 --> 00:18:53,283
the axis is the same as it is, so how can it be deep?"

324
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:57,742
So the, in the axis as you see is made in human beings,

325
00:18:57,992 --> 00:19:03,492
is like a three-and-a-half coiled paper-like thing,

326
00:19:04,158 --> 00:19:07,617
and the inside of it is the Brahma Nadi.

327
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:11,117
The Brahma Nadi is a very, very small little,

328
00:19:11,408 --> 00:19:15,492
we can call a very, very hair-like thing

329
00:19:15,492 --> 00:19:20,492
where only a hair-like Kundalini can pass through.

330
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:24,575
But when the person is deep this Brahma Nadi is bigger,

331
00:19:24,826 --> 00:19:26,283
and all the rest of them

332
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:31,242
which are coiled into each otherare smaller;

333
00:19:31,242 --> 00:19:34,158
while the people who are not deep, their outside

334
00:19:36,826 --> 00:19:40,283
what you call the foldings are bigger

335
00:19:40,283 --> 00:19:43,158
than the inside small thing.

336
00:19:43,408 --> 00:19:47,075
Now such people could be apparently very dynamic,

337
00:19:47,076 --> 00:19:49,951
may look very intelligent, may look very smart,

338
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:52,117
may look to be very good-looking

339
00:19:52,117 --> 00:19:54,367
or whatever it may be outwardly,

340
00:19:55,158 --> 00:19:57,742
but inwardly they are not deep.

341
00:19:58,158 --> 00:20:00,117
Inwardly if they are deep,

342
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,992
their whole attitude is beautiful.

343
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:06,283
They are very joy-giving people,

344
00:20:06,826 --> 00:20:08,408
they are very joy-giving.

345
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,117
And the more if you meet a person of another kind

346
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:16,575
he may look joyous, he may try to give you joy,

347
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:19,951
but the joy won't be really that deep;

348
00:20:20,158 --> 00:20:22,699
it would be like a joy-killing.

349
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:29,117
So it is important for us to make our axis deeper,

350
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:33,951
and that is where we lack the proper assiduity,

351
00:20:34,158 --> 00:20:38,617
the proper effort we have to put in.

352
00:20:39,283 --> 00:20:44,283
Now some people have automatically a very deep axis,

353
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:49,951
and some people have very, very what you should say,

354
00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:54,951
a very constricted type of the axis.

355
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:57,617
This axis has to be grown.

356
00:20:57,617 --> 00:20:59,992
Now when you come for My puja and all that

357
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,867
I do expand it, I agree,

358
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:05,617
but it is temporary thing.

359
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:10,700
To retain it at that point one has to work at home,

360
00:21:10,951 --> 00:21:12,951
in the collective also.

361
00:21:12,951 --> 00:21:18,158
One has to work very much at home with meditation.

362
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:21,158
But it should be done seriously.

363
00:21:21,408 --> 00:21:23,367
It should not be just a joke,

364
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:24,951
to be frivolous,

365
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,617
to be stupid - that's not the way.

366
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:31,492
It should be done very seriously, in the meaning

367
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:34,283
that it is a devoted task you have taken,

368
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,492
it's a meditative thing;

369
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:40,742
it's a prayer to God we can call it,

370
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,742
it's a puja to God.

371
00:21:44,408 --> 00:21:47,117
Is to be done with that reverence,

372
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:54,367
because reverence is the key of achievement.

373
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:58,617
If you have no reverence about yourself

374
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,408
and no reverence of others,

375
00:22:00,408 --> 00:22:02,367
then it cannot be done.

376
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:05,867
But first you must have reverence for your own life.

377
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:07,700
"What am I doing with my life?

378
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,992
Where am I wasting it?

379
00:22:08,992 --> 00:22:10,117
Why should I waste it?

380
00:22:10,117 --> 00:22:12,283
Why shouldn't I be deep?

381
00:22:12,283 --> 00:22:14,367
After all, there must be some purpose of my life.

382
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:17,117
Am I serving my purpose, am I doing that?"

383
00:22:17,492 --> 00:22:20,909
All these things if they pop into your head,

384
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:24,909
then you will understand it's very easy to fight out your ego,

385
00:22:25,117 --> 00:22:28,325
because normally on small, small things people fight.

386
00:22:28,325 --> 00:22:32,492
I've seen that in Sahaja Yoga also people fight on things

387
00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:36,242
like, I mean which are so useless, absolutely useless.

388
00:22:36,242 --> 00:22:40,200
To Me it sounds stupid to even mention

389
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,117
the way people fight over small things and quarrel.

390
00:22:43,492 --> 00:22:46,909
But a deep person, even if he doesn't speak much,

391
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:50,076
even if he doesn't show off much,

392
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:52,909
even if he doesn't sit in the front line,

393
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:55,784
he expresses himself through his depth,

394
00:22:55,784 --> 00:22:58,699
because I can work out better through that.

395
00:23:00,742 --> 00:23:03,117
So to develop this one must meditate,

396
00:23:03,117 --> 00:23:05,117
important thing is to meditate;

397
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,867
every day, every day, every day.

398
00:23:07,867 --> 00:23:09,867
You may not eat your food one day,

399
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:11,367
you may not sleep one day,

400
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:14,408
you may not go to your office one day,

401
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,575
you may not do anything that you are doing every day

402
00:23:17,575 --> 00:23:19,742
- but you must meditate every day.

403
00:23:19,742 --> 00:23:21,367
That's an important point,

404
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:28,076
to develop the central constricted part into a bigger area.

405
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:36,367
Now when that happens that you start developing it,

406
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,034
the first thing you will notice about yourself

407
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:42,117
that you do not care for any comfort,

408
00:23:43,076 --> 00:23:45,492
you're not bothered about any,

409
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,534
any material thing.

410
00:23:49,992 --> 00:23:52,283
Whatever it is you are above it,

411
00:23:52,283 --> 00:23:54,534
you just don't bother your head - let it be.

412
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:57,158
You just don't want to put your neck

413
00:23:57,158 --> 00:24:00,408
into a thing where you do not belong.

414
00:24:00,992 --> 00:24:02,242
You just get out of it,

415
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:03,784
and you think that

416
00:24:04,534 --> 00:24:08,034
"Oh God, this is too much for me, I just don't care for it."

417
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,575
So your whole attention now moves inward.

418
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,992
When the attention starts moving inward

419
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,992
then it expands more.

420
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,450
It's the inner part which is called as the Brahma Nadi,

421
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:24,324
and starts expanding and expanding.

422
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:27,117
Now in small, small things also:

423
00:24:27,575 --> 00:24:29,034
say for example

424
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:33,158
if I have not mentioned somebody

425
00:24:34,076 --> 00:24:36,076
and mentioned somebody else,

426
00:24:37,492 --> 00:24:38,617
then they feel,

427
00:24:38,617 --> 00:24:40,992
"Oh, why didn't Mother mention my name?"

428
00:24:40,992 --> 00:24:44,617
It's too small a thing that it doesn't matter.

429
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:49,826
As long as you have a deep axis you are with Me,

430
00:24:49,826 --> 00:24:53,158
I am with you, absolutely one with each other.

431
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,784
But these outward things are,

432
00:24:55,784 --> 00:24:58,034
"Oh, She gave a nice sari to another one,

433
00:24:58,034 --> 00:25:00,367
She never gave us a sari, She didn't do this,

434
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:01,617
didn't do that."

435
00:25:01,617 --> 00:25:04,117
All those things if it comes to your head,

436
00:25:04,117 --> 00:25:06,951
that means absolutely it's true

437
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,617
that there is something lacking in you.

438
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:13,200
Or if you try to complain,

439
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,909
"Oh, I went there, I had to go by a bus

440
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:17,909
and I had to stand on this thing,"

441
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:20,574
that shows that you are not comforted at all.

442
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:25,367
This widening comforts you.

443
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:28,034
That's the comforting thing,

444
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:31,575
and that really makes you feel so comfortable

445
00:25:31,575 --> 00:25:37,034
in any circumstance, in any position, in any lifestyle,

446
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:43,242
and you do not want to have any other comfort.

447
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:48,450
And this one has to develop,

448
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,450
through meditative effort.

449
00:25:50,826 --> 00:25:54,659
Secondly is, we have to know that Sahaja Yoga

450
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,242
as it is today is a collective happening.

451
00:25:58,076 --> 00:26:00,951
I find especially among Indian men,

452
00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:03,158
they never do any work with their hands,

453
00:26:03,158 --> 00:26:04,574
which is a wrong thing.

454
00:26:04,575 --> 00:26:07,367
Because they don't use their hands at all

455
00:26:07,617 --> 00:26:09,617
their collectivity is poor, very poor.

456
00:26:09,617 --> 00:26:11,951
Indians have the worst collectivity.

457
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:14,117
If you have an ashram,

458
00:26:14,117 --> 00:26:15,784
I don't know why should we build the ashram,

459
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:17,449
nobody is going to stay there.

460
00:26:18,784 --> 00:26:20,784
They want to have their own houses,

461
00:26:21,034 --> 00:26:22,116
their own families,

462
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:23,700
their own children;

463
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:26,450
they are the worst of all for collectivity.

464
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:30,450
The reason is, Indian men never do any work with their hands.

465
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:34,909
They cannot nail one nail - there are many like that

466
00:26:35,367 --> 00:26:37,659
- leave alone repairing anything.

467
00:26:37,951 --> 00:26:41,784
They will stand with their hands on their hips

468
00:26:41,784 --> 00:26:45,784
and would just tell work to other people, you see.

469
00:26:46,117 --> 00:26:47,700
There's a Marathi saying,

470
00:26:47,951 --> 00:26:50,492
a very interesting ....

471
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:58,076
that is, "To sit on a camel and to drive the goats."

472
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,158
So that is very typical of Indian men.

473
00:27:02,408 --> 00:27:03,825
They cannot repair anything,

474
00:27:03,826 --> 00:27:05,367
they cannot do anything.

475
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:07,951
Now if supposing somebody is spreading something,

476
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:09,492
they'll just stand like this, watch,

477
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:11,492
they'll never put their hands to it.

478
00:27:11,492 --> 00:27:14,742
So for every Sahaja yogi it is important

479
00:27:14,742 --> 00:27:17,283
what we call as shramadaan.

480
00:27:18,742 --> 00:27:20,951
They have to do some shramadaan.

481
00:27:21,158 --> 00:27:24,992
"Shramadaan" means the giving of some labor,

482
00:27:26,951 --> 00:27:29,492
and that is what we lack.

483
00:27:29,867 --> 00:27:35,116
That even if it comes to that you'd better clean your house,

484
00:27:35,116 --> 00:27:37,283
you'd better clean the outside of your house,

485
00:27:37,283 --> 00:27:39,742
try to put some garden around your house,

486
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,534
try to paint your house,

487
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,992
do some sort of a work with your hand

488
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,158
which even if you don't have anything,

489
00:27:47,158 --> 00:27:51,283
you can even brush your hair or something like that.

490
00:27:51,283 --> 00:27:55,742
Whatever you think is the easiest you can start with,

491
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:57,867
because I don't think people even do that.

492
00:27:58,367 --> 00:27:59,992
Even they don't shave themselves,

493
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:02,492
they get the person to shave them - I mean,

494
00:28:02,492 --> 00:28:05,408
absolutely lazy lumps as they are.

495
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:08,408
Now, but on the contrary

496
00:28:08,408 --> 00:28:11,367
we see in the West people use their hands.

497
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:13,867
Because of that, you see,

498
00:28:14,116 --> 00:28:16,617
because they can use their hands, they are very collective.

499
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:19,867
So they score a point on being collective,

500
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,992
while the Indians score a point because

501
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,909
they are Indians and they have a heritage

502
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:25,116
and they know what is Kundalini,

503
00:28:25,116 --> 00:28:27,450
they know about Ganesha, they know everything.

504
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:29,659
So they score a point this side.

505
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:31,574
So it's the left side is the desire,

506
00:28:31,575 --> 00:28:33,116
the right side is the action;

507
00:28:33,116 --> 00:28:35,992
again we come back to the same position where

508
00:28:35,992 --> 00:28:37,408
we have an imbalance,

509
00:28:37,408 --> 00:28:39,784
that the action takes place in the West,

510
00:28:40,116 --> 00:28:44,700
and here is only thinking - "all right, we'll do this"

511
00:28:44,992 --> 00:28:47,575
- planning. Everything is a planning point.

512
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:51,200
Nothing works out. You go on planning, planning, planning.

513
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,867
Now we are building one single ashram

514
00:28:54,117 --> 00:28:57,534
in Delhi for the last, I think, ten years.

515
00:28:59,909 --> 00:29:02,950
It is like Taj Mahal, I tell you!

516
00:29:06,826 --> 00:29:09,617
And it's so difficult, you see,

517
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:12,158
to understand why they have taken so much time

518
00:29:12,158 --> 00:29:14,617
when it's not a very big place, nothing.

519
00:29:15,076 --> 00:29:18,826
But it is not only the Sahaja yogis but other factors also,

520
00:29:19,117 --> 00:29:21,951
because everybody is like that, everything is postponed,

521
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:24,617
everything is to be done tomorrow.

522
00:29:24,617 --> 00:29:25,951
"This we will do tomorrow."

523
00:29:25,951 --> 00:29:28,951
Then one person will come, another person won't come.

524
00:29:29,158 --> 00:29:33,617
Like we used to have in the school,

525
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:39,909
we would get a sum like that or something to solve that,

526
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:43,117
see, there were: one house was built,

527
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:46,367
three persons came to work and one ran away.

528
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:50,575
Then two persons came to work and one stayed

529
00:29:50,575 --> 00:29:51,909
and two ran away;

530
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:56,158
and then five persons came to work and two persons ran away.

531
00:29:56,492 --> 00:29:58,784
So how, when will the house be finished?

532
00:29:59,034 --> 00:30:00,617
Never!

533
00:30:01,158 --> 00:30:06,449
With such runaways it can never be finished.

534
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,617
It's like that.

535
00:30:07,617 --> 00:30:10,784
So this is what, where we lack collectivity.

536
00:30:11,034 --> 00:30:13,492
I was saying that all Indians must find out

537
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:17,699
some place where they could go and plant something.

538
00:30:18,158 --> 00:30:20,199
Get hold of some sort of a place

539
00:30:20,492 --> 00:30:24,325
where they could go and plant some nice banyan trees,

540
00:30:24,784 --> 00:30:27,574
water it together, work it out together.

541
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,117
Now the Indian women are that way better.

542
00:30:30,117 --> 00:30:33,158
They do lot of work as far as the cooking is concerned

543
00:30:33,158 --> 00:30:34,574
and all that,

544
00:30:34,575 --> 00:30:36,617
but the other part is missing.

545
00:30:36,951 --> 00:30:38,826
The other part is intelligence,

546
00:30:39,076 --> 00:30:41,075
it's the other part is to think.

547
00:30:41,075 --> 00:30:43,699
Now if all the time what they are thinking,

548
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,909
"Oh, my husband likes this, I must cook this for him,"

549
00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:51,117
and now if the husband has to have a, say,

550
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:52,492
a lemon with his food.

551
00:30:52,492 --> 00:30:53,909
Now there's no lemon in the house.

552
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:56,157
This woman would run up and down all over the place

553
00:30:56,158 --> 00:30:58,034
to get the lemon for the husband,

554
00:30:58,034 --> 00:30:59,909
otherwise he will not eat the food.

555
00:30:59,909 --> 00:31:00,617
Doesn't matter,

556
00:31:00,617 --> 00:31:02,492
once in a while if he doesn't eat it's all right.

557
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:07,951
But the women will try,

558
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,157
because you see they must keep their,

559
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,617
they understand one thing

560
00:31:11,617 --> 00:31:13,450
that you must keep their palate all right.

561
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,909
Then they are quite sensible in India

562
00:31:16,117 --> 00:31:18,115
because here they're real tigers,

563
00:31:18,115 --> 00:31:19,909
all the husbands are like tigers,

564
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:22,200
so you have to keep them feeding; otherwise you see,

565
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,826
God knows when the tiger will jump on you.

566
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,575
The other way round in England or America I've seen,

567
00:31:28,575 --> 00:31:30,034
the husbands are like,

568
00:31:30,034 --> 00:31:33,325
just like goats and the women are like tigers!

569
00:31:40,992 --> 00:31:43,826
And the Westernized Indian women also are like that,

570
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,659
and when they go to West,

571
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:48,909
even simple women I've seen they become like tigresses.

572
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:51,992
Something surprising how they change immediately

573
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,784
to the position, even if they may not wear the jeans

574
00:31:54,784 --> 00:31:56,034
and all those things,

575
00:31:56,034 --> 00:31:57,659
but they become like that.

576
00:31:57,909 --> 00:32:01,367
So this imbalancing starts in a human being

577
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:03,325
when he doesn't understand

578
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:05,659
that you have to be a axis of the Mother Earth,

579
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:09,407
and neither the Capricorn or the Cancer.

580
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:14,242
This balance comes through our depth,

581
00:32:14,242 --> 00:32:16,450
and that depth has to be improved.

582
00:32:17,076 --> 00:32:21,992
Not through just by talking about it,

583
00:32:22,283 --> 00:32:24,158
by talking about Sahaja Yoga,

584
00:32:24,158 --> 00:32:27,534
but actually seriously doing meditation,

585
00:32:27,534 --> 00:32:30,282
actually seriously doing meditation.

586
00:32:34,242 --> 00:32:37,408
Secondly, we must do some collective work.

587
00:32:37,826 --> 00:32:40,659
Now we have in India, say, architects.

588
00:32:41,617 --> 00:32:44,283
They have never touched anything with their own hands.

589
00:32:44,283 --> 00:32:48,408
They are sitting and drawing, you see, that's all - finished.

590
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:50,617
Now after the drawing, do what you like.

591
00:32:50,617 --> 00:32:53,283
And now they have problems, practical problems,

592
00:32:53,617 --> 00:32:55,784
they cannot nail one nail.

593
00:32:56,367 --> 00:33:00,826
All are what you call them as white-collar...

594
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:04,325
Absolutely useless for any handwork.

595
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:07,117
They cannot do any handwork whatsoever.

596
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:10,116
Even if they have to lift, say, one of these chairs

597
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:13,367
and stretch them, they cannot do it, normally.

598
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,867
So under these circumstances one has to understand

599
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:22,325
that we come from a society which is absolutely ruinous

600
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:25,450
as far as collectivity is concerned,

601
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,117
so let us be collective.

602
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,700
Let us try to do something collective.

603
00:33:30,116 --> 00:33:33,117
But the collectivity is so poor in India,

604
00:33:33,117 --> 00:33:38,534
so poor that even they do not treat their wives nicely.

605
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,700
They'll not talk to their wife nicely,

606
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,200
to their children nicely;

607
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,534
to them it is absolutely adharmic to be kind to their wives.

608
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:53,909
Now the other side is that the Western people

609
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:56,450
care so much for collectivity that

610
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,784
whatever it is they try to compromise,

611
00:33:59,116 --> 00:34:01,867
and try to keep the family life all right.

612
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:04,659
So it's the two extremes as we have.

613
00:34:06,034 --> 00:34:10,034
Despite that somehow, thanks to the wisdom of Indian women,

614
00:34:10,325 --> 00:34:12,116
the family life is going strong.

615
00:34:12,325 --> 00:34:16,408
But if you see such men in England,

616
00:34:16,408 --> 00:34:19,242
I can tell you nobody will stand the nonsense

617
00:34:19,242 --> 00:34:21,992
that Indian men do to their women here.

618
00:34:21,992 --> 00:34:27,867
Absolutely, it cannot be forgiven the way they behave.

619
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,408
So the balance between the women and men:

620
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,826
what is the axis, is the home.

621
00:34:35,034 --> 00:34:36,367
Home is the axis.

622
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,450
In the home, what sort of talks you have?

623
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,200
What do you think about,

624
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,700
what is your problem?

625
00:34:42,992 --> 00:34:44,575
Where is your attention,

626
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,367
what do you discuss?

627
00:34:47,116 --> 00:34:48,909
That's very important to see.

628
00:34:49,325 --> 00:34:50,992
In that you'll find out

629
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
what is going on in the family.

630
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,867
Say you are talking ill of each other,

631
00:34:56,325 --> 00:34:59,575
if you are telling your child against your husband,

632
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:01,867
husband is telling the wife against,

633
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,450
telling the children about, against the,

634
00:35:07,992 --> 00:35:10,242
against the husband, like that.

635
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:11,951
If it is going on like that,

636
00:35:12,158 --> 00:35:13,242
then what happens,

637
00:35:13,242 --> 00:35:16,742
that there cannot be the axis which is all right.

638
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:18,951
The axis is love,

639
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,367
axis is love,

640
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:25,076
but not exploitation nor spoiling - it's love.

641
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:29,158
In country like ours, you see, what is the axis we have?

642
00:35:29,617 --> 00:35:32,117
The axis of our country is adhyatma.

643
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:40,117
We have to now get over this hankering after money,

644
00:35:40,117 --> 00:35:43,325
development, this, that. First take to adhyatma.

645
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:48,909
If people get realization before they are developed,

646
00:35:48,909 --> 00:35:52,951
there won't be the problem of creating another America here.

647
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:55,282
We don't have to become communist,

648
00:35:55,283 --> 00:35:56,951
we don't have to do anything like that,

649
00:35:56,951 --> 00:35:59,116
because communists are just the same as Americans,

650
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,867
there's no difference at all in temperament.

651
00:36:02,742 --> 00:36:06,283
If an American is allowed to stay in Russia

652
00:36:06,283 --> 00:36:08,492
he'll behave the same way as a Russian behaves,

653
00:36:08,492 --> 00:36:10,158
and if a Russian is sent to America

654
00:36:10,158 --> 00:36:12,867
he behaves the same way as the Americans behave.

655
00:36:13,617 --> 00:36:15,283
There's no change at all.

656
00:36:15,283 --> 00:36:20,867
Now if the axis of adhyatma in any country

657
00:36:22,534 --> 00:36:26,157
where a person achieves his spiritual ascent

658
00:36:27,534 --> 00:36:32,116
is, becomes the most important thing and is achieved,

659
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:34,408
then any amount of development,

660
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,659
any amount of all these things

661
00:36:37,158 --> 00:36:40,742
cannot destroy that country,

662
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:42,367
cannot create wars.

663
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,283
There will be peace everywhere,

664
00:36:44,283 --> 00:36:46,283
there will be enjoyment everywhere.

665
00:36:46,283 --> 00:36:48,951
So on this day of Makar Sankrant

666
00:36:49,158 --> 00:36:51,867
let us say now the Sankrant is over,

667
00:36:52,116 --> 00:36:55,282
and we have to look forward to the new age

668
00:36:55,283 --> 00:37:02,867
of a new moon blessing us,

669
00:37:03,116 --> 00:37:06,157
and the great sun coming over

670
00:37:06,867 --> 00:37:09,659
to give us all the energy we need,

671
00:37:10,408 --> 00:37:15,992
to celebrate the advent of the golden age of Sahaja Yoga.

672
00:37:16,242 --> 00:37:18,116
May God bless you all.

673
00:37:26,575 --> 00:37:27,784
Now for the puja,

674
00:37:27,784 --> 00:37:29,826
the Makar Sankrant Puja is very little,

675
00:37:29,826 --> 00:37:33,659
it's the puja of the Surya Devata, I don't know ...

676
00:39:01,992 --> 00:39:03,575
From the foreign country,

677
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:07,408
who is going to stay after the

678
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,575
11th, that is on the 12th? On the 12th - after the 12th.

679
00:39:18,575 --> 00:39:24,492
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten ...

680
00:39:25,575 --> 00:39:30,450
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

681
00:39:31,117 --> 00:39:32,742
All right, let's put it,

682
00:39:32,742 --> 00:39:36,826
who is going to stay in Bombay after the 11th?

683
00:39:44,867 --> 00:39:47,034
When are these people going?

684
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:50,492
Those who are going to stay in Bombay after the 11th,

685
00:39:51,076 --> 00:39:54,449
when are they going, when are you going?

686
00:39:56,492 --> 00:40:00,117
You are coming to Pratishthan. All right.

687
00:40:00,492 --> 00:40:03,117
What about you, John?

688
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:21,117
Do you want to stay here in Bombay,

689
00:40:21,117 --> 00:40:23,283
or you want to stay in Pratishthan?

690
00:40:28,076 --> 00:40:30,076
I mean, there's no arrangements here,

691
00:40:30,076 --> 00:40:34,449
so all those who are not going on the 11th or 12th,

692
00:40:35,575 --> 00:40:37,367
like that, in the near future,

693
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,575
how many are those who are going to stay longer?

694
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:54,242
About thirty-four. How many men and how many ladies?

695
00:41:01,076 --> 00:41:05,157
So we have decided that the men can come to Pratishthan,

696
00:41:05,492 --> 00:41:08,492
and the rest of the ladies can go to Alibagh.

697
00:41:08,492 --> 00:41:11,742
The reason is Pratishthan is still extremely spartan.

698
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:13,826
It's not meant for ladies at all,

699
00:41:13,826 --> 00:41:16,242
and I have only one room where I live.

700
00:41:16,242 --> 00:41:19,242
So best thing would be to send all the ladies...

701
00:41:27,575 --> 00:41:29,367
Let them go to Alibagh,

702
00:41:29,742 --> 00:41:32,700
and let them pay for their stay in Alibagh

703
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:36,909
to people who will be looking after them.

704
00:41:37,283 --> 00:41:39,242
Those who are coming to Pratishthan,

705
00:41:39,492 --> 00:41:43,034
how many there are? The rest of the men, about fifty.

706
00:41:44,617 --> 00:41:45,951
Fifty, all right.

707
00:41:46,826 --> 00:41:50,449
So when are you going back with the whole thing?

708
00:41:54,575 --> 00:41:57,575
You see, because it's such a liability, this work.

709
00:41:58,034 --> 00:41:59,157
You can come to Pratishthan

710
00:41:59,158 --> 00:42:01,158
if you want to take some photographs or things,

711
00:42:01,575 --> 00:42:03,742
but it's a liability for us because,

712
00:42:03,742 --> 00:42:06,076
you see, unless and until you go back,

713
00:42:06,283 --> 00:42:08,575
it will be a liability on our head all the time.

714
00:42:08,867 --> 00:42:10,700
So best thing is that you come to Pratishthan,

715
00:42:10,951 --> 00:42:13,282
do a little photography or whatever you want to do.

716
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:15,909
And then you'd better book yourself,

717
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,700
because this must go out of our country,

718
00:42:19,034 --> 00:42:20,826
otherwise they're always on our head,

719
00:42:22,575 --> 00:42:24,117
and they are following us.

720
00:42:24,784 --> 00:42:27,450
So I am sorry, but you'll have to go with this ...

721
00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:29,742
stuff that you are carrying.

722
00:42:30,116 --> 00:42:32,867
So we will have to do it in three, four days' time.

723
00:42:34,117 --> 00:42:36,867
You can finish the photography there,

724
00:42:37,116 --> 00:42:38,574
and you fix up your going.

725
00:42:39,117 --> 00:42:41,784
So for all the ladies who are going to stay on,

726
00:42:42,283 --> 00:42:46,659
can go in Washi or can go to Alibagh.

727
00:42:47,116 --> 00:42:48,449
Alibagh is better...

728
00:42:51,367 --> 00:42:54,909
They can go to Alibagh and stay there in Alibagh,

729
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:57,242
about thirteen or fourteen ladies...

730
00:43:09,617 --> 00:43:11,076
All right, so done.

731
00:43:11,076 --> 00:43:14,324
Now let's ... Atharv, Ganesha ...

732
00:43:16,575 --> 00:43:18,909
Twenty-one people from America have to go,

733
00:43:18,909 --> 00:43:21,450
so we'll try to finish the puja as soon as possible,

734
00:43:21,826 --> 00:43:23,699
and they can leave.
