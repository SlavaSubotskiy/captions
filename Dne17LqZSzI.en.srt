About Indian Sages
Aurangabad, India, 19 December 1989

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:13,690
So now most of you are here, and it’s a
nice place for all of you to meet from different

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,710
countries.

4
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,710
Aurangabad has a special significance in my
own life because my forefathers came from

5
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:39,250
a place very near from here, called as Pathan
but originally known as Pratishthan. I think

6
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:47,170
about two years back we were there, and this
is the place where Valmiki, who wrote the

7
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:55,820
great epic of Ramayana, lived here. And when
Sita came, was taken away from her house and

8
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:15,320
when she was pregnant, there was another ashram
of his in Nepal where she stayed, and then

9
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:25,190
she was brought here. That’s why you see
a kind of a 
culture of Maharashtra, going to the hills

10
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,920
and also to Nepal, through her and her children
who went down, went to Russia and another

11
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:50,030
to China. The name of one who went to Russia
was Luv, and another who went to China was

12
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:59,490
Kush. So they are called as Slavs. They were
mostly called as Lev, and those who went to

13
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,060
China are called as Kusha.

14
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:11,060
So they lived here from their birth till they
became about, say, twelve years of age, when

15
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,840
Valmiki composed Ramayana and taught them
how to sing that song of Ramayana. So then

16
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:29,430
they went to Ayodhya and there they started
singing the song. With that singing, Shri

17
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,329
Rama was very much touched. They challenged
him in a way, that there is a lady who was

18
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:40,609
such a chaste person, who was driven out of
- they didn’t know that was Rama was their

19
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:47,609
father. Then they came back and stayed here
for some time and then went again to Nepal

20
00:02:54,829 --> 00:03:00,439
because she was a Nepali lady. So I think
her father must have arranged something for

21
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:07,439
her to stay in Nepal in that Valmiki ashram,
which can be only approached from Bihar, which

22
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,999
I have seen Myself.

23
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:18,999
Also that’s a very important spot where
this ashram was established by Valmiki, because

24
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:27,180
here there was a big struggle of evolution
going on between the big animals like mammoth

25
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:34,180
and all those big, big animals, between the
others who were very quick to turn and were

26
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:41,829
very clever, intelligent and supple. They
destroyed most of these big animals. And in

27
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,519
that river there were lots of crocodiles,
and when the king of the elephant, known as

28
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:03,150
Gajendra, was drinking in water, one of them,
a big one, attacked to kill him so that the

29
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:11,669
whole clan, or you can say the whole genii
of these elephants, would be destroyed. That

30
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:21,439
spot is very important because there Shri
Vishnu appeared and he killed the crocodile

31
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:27,810
and saved the elephant. So out of all these
big animals, only the elephant was saved,

32
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,710
and that’s why that place is called as Gajendramoksh.
So there’s a big quarrel going on because

33
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,270
Valmiki had his ashrams in different places,
where [was real of Valmiki’s things]. But

34
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:45,270
actually he lived here in this area on the
other side of the Godavari River which was

35
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,720
going along 
the Pathan or the Pratishthan, the kingdom
of Shalivana. And he used to plunder people

36
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,949
and he was a plunderer. He was a fisherman
and he was a plunderer.

37
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:14,590
Then from there they say Narada came as a
saint from there, from the other side, and

38
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:21,240
they plundered him also. So he said ,“Why
are you plundering me?” Narada asked.

39
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,400
He said, “Because I have to feed my children.
I have to feed my wife. I have to feed my

40
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,460
family. I have to look after them. I have
a large family. So how am I to maintain all

41
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,610
that? I am the only person who is the earning
member. “

42
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,449
But he said, “Do you think they will sacrifice
everything for you?”

43
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:38,949
He said, “I am sure they will.”

44
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:44,229
He said, “All right. Now you become like
a dead man.”

45
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:51,229
And they took his dead body, so-called, four
of them, four saints, and put it in the house

46
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:58,319
and told them that this fellow died in plundering
us. “But there is a way to again bring him

47
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:07,090
to life, that you have to promise that somebody
from you, you all, have to die in his place.

48
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:16,470
If you agree that you will die in his place,
then one person has to replace him.”

49
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:24,669
They tried and tried. And somebody said, “No,
I cannot die. I am too young.” Another said,

50
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:29,610
“No, I have to look after my children.”
Another said, “What will happen to my grandchildren?”

51
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:35,509
All kinds of things and nobody offered themselves.

52
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:42,509
So Valmiki got up and he realised that so
far he has been really doing something wrong.

53
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:47,939
So he said then, “What should I say?”

54
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:51,229
He said, “What would you say then if you
die?”

55
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:56,919
He said, “I’ll say, ‘Mara, mara’,”
means, ‘I am dead. I am dead. I am dead’.”

56
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:00,830
He said, “All right, say the other way.
Go on saying.”

57
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,789
So it came to, “Rama, Rama,” like that.

58
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:05,270
But they said, “It won’t work out. You
have to do a penance because you have done

59
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:12,270
lots of bad things in your life and you have
hurt many people. So you have to do the penance.”

60
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:21,479
So he sat down for penance on a big mountain
here which is called as the Valmiki Mountain.

61
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:30,050
And the termites ate up his body, and he became
like a termite. Only his neck was up and he

62
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,439
was saying that and the whole body was eaten
up by termites. So then again Shri Vishnu

63
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:43,439
appeared before him and removed his termites
and gave him his realisation. And a termite

64
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:50,020
in Sanskrit language is called as valmi. That’s
why he was called as valmi ki. That’s why

65
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,499
he was called as Valmiki.

66
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:58,499
So the story then afterwards leads to the
coming of Sita there. So it is a very important

67
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,560
part of Ramayana was played here, and it is
said that Shalivahanas helped this Valmiki

68
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:17,069
temple and Valmiki person to prosper, and
they treated him with great respect as their

69
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:23,169
master. But actually, their master was long
time back was one Chandalia where we have

70
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:30,169
taken the land near Nira River. So it’s
a very ancient time thousands of years back

71
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:36,729
because Rama must have lived before Krishna,
say about eight thousand years back. So it

72
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:41,750
is a very ancient place, this one is.

73
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:47,410
After that people removed all the trees and
all that. So it has become such a barren land

74
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:54,410
and it is not sort of so fertile now, but
once upon a time it was a beautiful forest

75
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:03,910
here, and in that forest Valmiki used to live.

76
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,120
So this is the story of this place. I hope
you will be happy to know you are in a very

77
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,970
historical place just now. And I am trying
to find out if you can on your way go to also

78
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:19,600
to this Pathan, Pratishthan on your way, maybe.
I don’t know how, because we are all running

79
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,990
short of time because of aeroplane timings,
as you know. But in any case I am very happy

80
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:30,180
that also Italians have arrived, and they
have taken so much trouble to come all the

81
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:37,180
way directly from there to get to the puja.
Though I had arranged in Pratishthan all their

82
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:43,010
food, everything, breakfast, so they could
sleep in the night and early in the morning

83
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:46,399
take the food and come here.

84
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,420
All these stories these people know very well.
We all know everything about our country,

85
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:58,420
these ancient times, you see, grand, beautiful,
and the work of all these saints and all these

86
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:07,459
seers has woven into the character of Maharashtran
people. So you will find them that they have

87
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:19,139
certain gifts already to protect themselves,
which has come because of the following of

88
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:26,630
these saints and the following of a realised
soul. And the people are very God-fearing

89
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,600
and they respect saints and they also know
who is a real saint mostly.

90
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:44,570
I hope you all will understand that when we
think of the comfort of our spirit, the whole

91
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:51,980
life is sort of penetrated with the light
of the spirit, and we start changing our attitude

92
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:58,980
towards life. Not only that, but also we have
a kind of a tremendous confidence in our virtues

93
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:07,620
and we enjoy them. We do not indulge into
any such thing. Though in a way we can say

94
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:14,380
that the, in this culture there is not much
of finesse, not much of artificiality. They

95
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:20,300
won’t say thank you a hundred times. That
is not done. They don’t say sorry. They

96
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:26,959
won’t even fold their hands to normally,
the women especially to men, and say namaskar.

97
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,560
Only to God they fold their hands. So there
are certain things, that all the time we go

98
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,120
on shaking hands in the West. All the time
we start bowing to everyone, saying sorry,

99
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,380
thank you and all that. That you will find
they don’t do, but at heart they are very

100
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:50,380
simple people. They live among rocks; so they
have that rocky character. And I hope you

101
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:51,910
will enjoy them.

102
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,510
May God bless you.

103
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:52,760
Note

104
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:52,760
This was a talk before Puja.
