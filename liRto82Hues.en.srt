1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,381
I’m just watching all the beauty.

2
00:00:12,082 --> 00:00:15,186
You looked so beautiful at the airport.

3
00:00:15,387 --> 00:00:24,873
Such a joy for me to see you in that shape.

4
00:00:26,272 --> 00:00:28,548
It’s a

5
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:41,820
rare occasion sometimes

6
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:53,951
that you feel oneness with the whole
universe,

7
00:00:55,246 --> 00:01:00,237
absolutely oneness with the whole universe,

8
00:01:00,438 --> 00:01:09,357
when you feel the love that exists between
all of you.

9
00:01:09,558 --> 00:01:12,893
It’s the love between you,

10
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:17,140
oneness between you,

11
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:23,070
the way you all have opened your heart
to each other

12
00:01:24,158 --> 00:01:30,785
as good human beings, as realized souls,
as saints -

13
00:01:30,986 --> 00:01:45,979
it’s the most fulfilling and satisfying
thing for Me.

14
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:57,172
When a saint used to meet another
saint, say in India, what would happen?

15
00:01:57,982 --> 00:02:05,841
There was a saint in Maharashtra who was
a tailor, but he was a saint.

16
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:10,822
Saint is a saint whether he’s a tailor
or he could be anything.

17
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:16,361
And there was another saint who was
a potter,

18
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:25,212
who used to make pots, and things like
that, out of clay.

19
00:02:26,808 --> 00:02:39,447
So this saint, Namadeva, went to see
this potter

20
00:02:41,053 --> 00:02:45,945
who was making some pots out of clay.

21
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,073
And he looked at him.

22
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:59,630
And the feeling that came into his heart
is expressed -

23
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:06,157
he was a great poet also, Namadeva -
so he says,

24
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:15,190
in Marathi it is, but I’ll translate it
in English - “I came here

25
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:23,112
to see the Chaitanya, the formless,

26
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:28,387
but the formless is standing before me
in the form”.

27
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:32,386
So to appreciate

28
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:40,697
the other saint he said, “Now the whole
Chaitanya, the whole

29
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:47,557
all-pervading power of God’s love has come
in your form before me.

30
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:50,074
I see it”.

31
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:55,047
How to address, just think of it.

32
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:59,392
At that moment, spontaneously he said this.

33
00:04:01,235 --> 00:04:08,118
That is how you are all saints, and saints
have to see that,

34
00:04:08,656 --> 00:04:15,663
that you are the form of that love
of God’s all pervading power.

35
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:20,193
You are in the form of that, all of you.

36
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:25,720
I think that day, you were standing
in the rain and sleet

37
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:29,393
with all your children. For a Mother it’s
too much

38
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:34,731
to see, such beautiful feelings for me.

39
00:04:34,932 --> 00:04:38,657
But the feelings among yourselves,

40
00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:44,797
the open-heartedness, the Pure love,

41
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:50,231
that filled the whole atmosphere
with such beauty.

42
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:53,852
It’s not just talking,

43
00:04:55,604 --> 00:05:02,139
it’s not just writing letters or sending
Birthday cards or something like that;

44
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,118
it’s from the heart,

45
00:05:06,383 --> 00:05:11,204
you have to feel each other that
you are all saints.

46
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:18,036
You are different people, you have
to support each other,

47
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:22,010
you have to look after each other, you have
to understand each other

48
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:26,965
because you are the people of a different
awareness

49
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:31,918
living among people who are blind,
who can hit you,

50
00:05:32,118 --> 00:05:37,041
they can do some harm to you.

51
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:46,351
The other day I was reading Gyaneshwara;
can you imagine,

52
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:50,329
he died at the age of 23 years,

53
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:55,132
at such an young age as 23 years.

54
00:05:55,333 --> 00:06:01,343
And the Gyaneshwari he wrote was
at the age of 21 years. And what a genius!

55
00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:07,408
I mean, you read it, you just don’t
understand,

56
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:14,874
how could he penetrate so deep.
He described you all,

57
00:06:17,116 --> 00:06:21,245
as I have told you many-a-times he has
described you

58
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:35,055
as the oceans of, the walking oceans
of Ambrose - Ambrosia.

59
00:06:37,882 --> 00:06:47,438
Talking trees, and the forest of

60
00:06:52,628 --> 00:07:00,899
the trees of bliss and beauty.

61
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:03,505
That wherever you’ll go you’ll bless
people.

62
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:08,211
Wherever you will stand you’ll be
auspicious,

63
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:12,974
you will create harmony, peace and joy.

64
00:07:13,175 --> 00:07:19,158
That’s your work, that’s your style,
that’s what you are here for.

65
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:24,441
But beware, you ought to be very careful,

66
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:28,650
because the surroundings seem to be
quite deceptive

67
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:31,702
and quite troublesome.

68
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:40,658
And from that surrounding you are coming
out suddenly into a new surrounding

69
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:47,259
where you have known what is Divine love,
what is Divinity.

70
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:54,797
One has to be very careful because
the forces that are negative

71
00:07:54,998 --> 00:08:03,473
are very strong, and working at you
all the time,

72
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:10,859
because you’ve come from matter, you have
evolved from matter

73
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:23,834
and it’s easy to go to matter,
to materialism, to the materialistic ideas;

74
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:33,168
and this materialism takes you
to primitiveness.

75
00:08:33,936 --> 00:08:36,507
All your culture, all your beauty will
drop out

76
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:43,574
as soon as you take to materialism.
If everything becomes money

77
00:08:44,136 --> 00:08:49,708
there’s no place for God, no place
for love,

78
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:57,388
no place for beauty or for any graciousness.

79
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:05,121
Money is for us, we are not for the money.

80
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:08,495
Money should be at our command.

81
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:14,994
We don’t have to give up anything for that.

82
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:25,361
And here then we see the materialism
coming up in a very different way,

83
00:09:25,562 --> 00:09:30,600
very subtle ways, and we do not see it.

84
00:09:30,801 --> 00:09:35,245
When we start saying “my, mine, this is
mine”

85
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:42,078
then you are slowly drifting towards
materialism.

86
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:48,060
When you see yourself in the collective,

87
00:09:50,232 --> 00:09:56,570
that’s the only way you can get out
of materialism.

88
00:09:56,827 --> 00:10:00,195
Because you are in reality a collective
being.

89
00:10:00,396 --> 00:10:04,698
You are not an individual that way.

90
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,004
But the matter divides you from each other.

91
00:10:11,117 --> 00:10:13,567
And when you realize

92
00:10:13,768 --> 00:10:18,473
that we are not slaves of matter, matter is
our slave,

93
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:23,660
we are not going to be dominated
by any matter,

94
00:10:25,513 --> 00:10:29,350
then you can feel that love.

95
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,239
One goes to absurd limits if you take
to materialism;

96
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,631
and everything can be explained in the name
of materialism.

97
00:10:42,536 --> 00:10:48,093
But in the name of Divine how far can you
go and explain?

98
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:51,136
You have to just enjoy it.

99
00:10:51,354 --> 00:10:56,658
When you enjoy you don’t want to explain
or talk about it, you just want to enjoy.

100
00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:00,837
Divinity is to be enjoyed within and
without.

101
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:06,605
It’s within you, divinity is within you,
but is to be enjoyed.

102
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,227
That’s only possible if you understand

103
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:14,866
that you are not going to be dominated
by any matter whatsoever.

104
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:20,036
I’m sorry I’m here for such a short time,

105
00:11:20,237 --> 00:11:25,575
I wish I could be with you forever, which
I am, I think.

106
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:30,563
But you have brothers and sisters
everywhere,

107
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:38,353
the whole world has this message with them.

108
00:11:38,554 --> 00:11:41,451
You, some of you have met them in India.

109
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:46,290
All the Indians have sent their love
to you, lots of love,

110
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:49,983
and they didn’t know what to send you
from there, something special;

111
00:11:50,184 --> 00:11:53,510
so they sent Me.

112
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:09,493
Sometimes I feel all of us should meet
somewhere; all of us

113
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:13,928
from all over the world, from every corner
of the world, all the great saints

114
00:12:14,136 --> 00:12:19,091
who are in these modern times should meet
each other, talk to each other,

115
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:27,252
enjoy each other and understand each other.

116
00:12:29,023 --> 00:12:35,744
That’s the time we’ll think that a new era
has started

117
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:43,879
of love, of trust, of enjoyment of other
human beings.

118
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,835
When you start enjoying another person

119
00:12:47,036 --> 00:12:51,476
then only we can say that you are
in the collective.

120
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:57,740
Like My finger, if it pains the another one
tries to soothe it,

121
00:12:57,948 --> 00:13:01,793
and I feel the soothing, without feeling
any gratitude

122
00:13:01,994 --> 00:13:07,017
or without feeling any sort of a obligation.

123
00:13:08,702 --> 00:13:14,892
So always I say about collectivity. Those
who cannot be collective,

124
00:13:15,093 --> 00:13:19,650
those who cannot open their hearts,
those who keep aloof,

125
00:13:19,851 --> 00:13:23,862
those who think they are - some of them
might be thinking “We are great Sahaja Yogis

126
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:27,246
because we are very old Sahaja Yogis,”
some might be thinking

127
00:13:27,447 --> 00:13:32,470
“we are very intelligent”, some that
“we are rich, and poor” and all that,

128
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:38,989
all these differences should disappear.
Who is crying?

129
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:49,091
She’s crying? What’s the matter?

130
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:54,151
(Yogini speaks: “Clapping made him jump”.
Yogi: “The clapping made him jump, Mother”.

131
00:13:54,352 --> 00:13:57,387
Shri Mataji: “And loudly?” Yogi: “The
clapping made the baby jump, Shri Mataji”.

132
00:13:57,588 --> 00:14:00,637
Oh!

133
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:15,484
One day they’ll all grow up. I was thinking
when they’ll grow up

134
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:20,189
they’ll clap much more than you will do!

135
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:26,209
Little more time we need, somehow.

136
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:31,185
All these great people will be becoming
great Sahaja Yogis

137
00:14:31,386 --> 00:14:39,176
and will give us such a pleasure, such
a joy, such a happiness.

138
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:45,262
Today I wanted to speak about something,

139
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,290
but I’ll just put it as a question
to you all.

140
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:52,172
And I would like to have an answer
from you.

141
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:56,765
You can write to Me and let’s see,
or you can discuss.

142
00:14:56,966 --> 00:15:08,500
That as formerly, as other saints have
said,

143
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:14,190
that once you get your realization
you are lost,

144
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:20,737
you can’t speak about it. You can just tell
them by some similes, metaphors,

145
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:30,881
this, that, but you cannot really give them
the experience by telling them.

146
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:35,816
And that’s why many saints decided that
after realization

147
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:40,253
it’s better to disappear. Even Gyaneshwara
took his samadhi,

148
00:15:40,454 --> 00:15:45,409
he went into a room and he died
in that room.

149
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:51,474
Because they could not say much about it,
they could not tell much about it.

150
00:15:51,675 --> 00:15:54,839
But today that’s not the situation.

151
00:15:55,188 --> 00:16:00,230
Like Kabira has said that,

152
00:16:00,431 --> 00:16:05,378
“When a drop becomes the ocean,
what can you say?”.

153
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:10,412
You are lost, you are no more there,
you are all finished.

154
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:14,201
So what has happened in Sahaja Yoga,
today’s Sahaja Yoga,

155
00:16:14,402 --> 00:16:19,032
that we are all talking about it,
experiencing it and enjoying it?

156
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:23,646
That’s the question for all of the Sahaja
Yogis to solve.

157
00:16:30,927 --> 00:16:34,248
(Smiles and talks to somebody. Name
not clear, sounds like “Elliot”.)

158
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:37,017
You can explain?

159
00:16:39,043 --> 00:16:41,969
Did you hear My question?

160
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:46,273
No? You didn’t hear My question

161
00:16:47,761 --> 00:16:51,390
You see, what I said was that formerly

162
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:56,251
those people who got realisation got lost,
alright?

163
00:16:56,493 --> 00:17:01,391
As you were lost just now into thoughtless
awareness!

164
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:10,254
But you can come back and you can tell
people, you can talk about it,

165
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:14,345
and many people disappeared.

166
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:19,571
Actually, they didn’t want to live after
getting realization for a long time,

167
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:25,310
because they could not explain, talk
to people about it.

168
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:30,556
Also they said that, "How can a person
who has no tongue

169
00:17:30,757 --> 00:17:36,922
tell about the taste of the jiggery?",
it’s a kind of sweet.

170
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:42,951
So there was a problem with them,
all of them had a problem.

171
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:45,490
But now you don’t have that problem.

172
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:50,448
So what has happened in Sahaja Yoga
that you have no problem?

173
00:17:51,557 --> 00:17:55,309
So think it over and write to Me, alright?

174
00:17:59,942 --> 00:18:04,923
So I don’t know what to say anymore.

175
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:10,079
Just we are enjoying our rapport
with each other, isn’t it?

176
00:18:10,248 --> 00:18:14,489
That’s all, sitting down here. Anybody
has any questions?

177
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:20,200
Anybody who is a new person can ask
a question, would be good idea.

178
00:18:25,953 --> 00:18:29,838
Because these people have no questions now.

179
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:37,748
Ask Me a question.

180
00:18:44,061 --> 00:18:47,991
(To somebody) I’ve heard the good news. Ah!

181
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:51,605
Yogi: Shri Mataji, how should we approach
the spreading of Sahaja Yoga?

182
00:18:51,806 --> 00:18:53,739
Shri Mataji: How can we…?
Yogi: How should we approach

183
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,427
the spreading of Sahaja Yoga to new people?

184
00:18:56,628 --> 00:18:59,412
Shri Mataji: What? Another yogi: He said
how should we approach

185
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:03,957
the spreading of Sahaja Yoga to new people,
to the new people.

186
00:19:04,158 --> 00:19:06,419
How should we express Sahaja Yoga,
Shri Mataji?

187
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:13,608
Shri Mataji: To them? Now, you see,
you’ll meet three types of new people.

188
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:16,935
Firstly, those who are yogis,

189
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:21,533
or you can call them as people
of previous births,

190
00:19:21,734 --> 00:19:26,127
who are already very knowledgeable
and are there,

191
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:29,369
just they can feel it, this is it;

192
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:34,184
you won’t have much problem with them,
they’ll know it is so.

193
00:19:36,734 --> 00:19:43,608
To them it’s very obvious, and you’ll be
amazed the way they are there,

194
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:48,318
how they have taken to it so easily.

195
00:19:49,806 --> 00:19:57,918
Now the second type are the people who
may be still believing, non believing,

196
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:03,526
maybe some who are doubting, maybe;

197
00:20:03,727 --> 00:20:10,637
or maybe some who are asking questions
about it, quite a lot.

198
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:17,547
So is not sufficient only for you to get
your realization,

199
00:20:18,154 --> 00:20:23,284
also not sufficient for you that you feel
the vibrations

200
00:20:23,484 --> 00:20:29,457
and that you can give realizations
to others, that won’t help much.

201
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:38,834
You have to know how to deal with various
types of people.

202
00:20:39,035 --> 00:20:48,090
Like I would say a person who is a,
say, a priest,

203
00:20:49,657 --> 00:20:54,150
who comes to you and wants to talk to you
about God, this, that and all that.

204
00:20:54,351 --> 00:20:57,837
So you must know Bible very well,

205
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:02,293
and know Bible in the way a Sahaja Yogi
should know.

206
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:05,053
The other day Rustom telephoned
to tell Me that -

207
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:13,045
I told him to study Koran because, I said,
Islam means surrender,

208
00:21:13,223 --> 00:21:17,278
but before realisation surrender has
no meaning.

209
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:19,503
And he’s told Me that it’s written in Koran

210
00:21:19,704 --> 00:21:22,697
that unless and until you are connected
with God

211
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:28,440
you cannot understand anything what is
written here. It’s clearly said.

212
00:21:28,641 --> 00:21:31,032
Now when the Muslims talk to you,
you can tell them:

213
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:35,425
“This is written in Koran, are you
connected with God?”.

214
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:40,056
Now, they might say, “Are you connected?”.

215
00:21:42,137 --> 00:21:46,079
Now, then if you say, “Yes”, then finished!

216
00:21:46,936 --> 00:21:52,841
Then Mr. Ego will come up, you see,
suddenly, and you be careful!

217
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:59,307
So this subject should be treated
with a barge pole.

218
00:21:59,508 --> 00:22:07,990
Like, such a question if they ask… you see
they will be like that, “Are you that?”.

219
00:22:08,191 --> 00:22:10,368
Like in the beginning they used to ask Me,
“What’s your Father?

220
00:22:10,568 --> 00:22:14,268
What’s your Mother? Who are you?".
This, that, all those things, you see.

221
00:22:14,469 --> 00:22:18,804
So at that time you have to give
an answer to them -

222
00:22:20,663 --> 00:22:25,614
Can you give this lady a chair to sit down?
(Hindi) Sit down.

223
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:32,873
No… Alright. (Hindi) Sit down... Sit down.

224
00:22:40,647 --> 00:22:47,454
So such a question if you answer
in that manner

225
00:22:47,655 --> 00:22:52,068
you have not been clever enough; you have
to be very clever.

226
00:22:54,143 --> 00:23:01,698
Then you should say, "You see, there are" -
avoid the subject, don’t answer;

227
00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:09,412
you just say, “See, there are descriptions
about a person who is a realised soul”.

228
00:23:10,636 --> 00:23:15,935
Jung has said that you have to become
collectively conscious.

229
00:23:17,025 --> 00:23:18,950
Now, what is collectively conscious?

230
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:25,932
That is, on your central nervous system
you should be able to feel another person.

231
00:23:28,822 --> 00:23:33,693
Now Jung has said so, it’s a poet.

232
00:23:33,894 --> 00:23:37,785
Then you have got other people to quote:

233
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,352
William Blake you can quote,

234
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:46,650
you can quote other poets or saints whom
you know,

235
00:23:47,101 --> 00:23:50,760
it depends on what sort of a person
you are dealing with.

236
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:54,215
But just don’t say, ”Yes, I am
a realised soul”.

237
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:59,593
People have been crucified, murdered,
poisoned for saying that.

238
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,790
So be careful, put it on somebody else
and say,

239
00:24:04,991 --> 00:24:10,658
“Yes, the signs of a realised soul’s are
like this,

240
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:14,029
that he has to be collectively conscious”.

241
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:16,186
First of all that you have read Jung

242
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:19,665
or you know so much about collective
consciousness itself

243
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:24,624
will put them right in their own places,
to begin with.

244
00:24:24,825 --> 00:24:28,213
Because you have to be knowledgeable
in these modern times,

245
00:24:28,414 --> 00:24:31,774
and you should be able to communicate.

246
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:35,343
Just by telling them, “I’m a realized soul,

247
00:24:35,544 --> 00:24:40,128
I have to awaken your Kundalini”, nobody
is going to believe you.

248
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:46,498
Even in India people don’t believe that
we can give realisation -

249
00:24:46,699 --> 00:24:50,722
although they know about realisation, they
know about Kundalini, they know everything,

250
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:55,244
but still they cannot believe that we,
like ordinary people,

251
00:24:55,445 --> 00:24:58,496
can give realisation to them.

252
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:04,307
So in no way you should be diffident,
but try to bring them round

253
00:25:04,508 --> 00:25:08,225
through somebody else, because the human
nature is such,

254
00:25:08,426 --> 00:25:13,404
the one who is living, the one who
is existing, they don’t want to accept.

255
00:25:13,605 --> 00:25:18,893
Whosoever is dead, you see, and written 
somewhere, anything, in black and white,

256
00:25:19,094 --> 00:25:23,856
and if you say in this book this is this
written, they’ll accept.

257
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:27,325
That’s why you have to be knowledgeable,
you must read books

258
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:33,962
which are supportive of your realisation,
supportive of Sahaja Yoga.

259
00:25:34,323 --> 00:25:38,797
Then only you can talk to them. If you are
just having realisation,

260
00:25:38,998 --> 00:25:42,807
you can give realisation, you have got
vibrations, that won’t work out -

261
00:25:43,016 --> 00:25:50,662
especially in the Western countries where
people are too much here, nothing there.

262
00:25:51,526 --> 00:25:55,516
You have to tell them that we are also
intelligent enough,

263
00:25:55,717 --> 00:26:03,070
and we also understand it with our brains
and logic, what is the truth is.

264
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:10,178
Then after their realisation, of course,
it’s much easier,

265
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:16,317
but if you say, "Alright, come along, I
have to give you realisation” - you cannot.

266
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,570
You cannot force them, you cannot - they
have to ask for it,

267
00:26:20,771 --> 00:26:23,359
after all there is a protocol of the Divine
also,

268
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,727
the Divine cannot fall at the feet
of people,

269
00:26:25,928 --> 00:26:30,719
“Oh please, come and have your
realisation!”. No, that’s too much.

270
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:41,610
But there are ways and ways by which
you can ask people and work it out.

271
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:45,995
But I must tell you one thing, that all
the Sahaja Yogis before,

272
00:26:46,196 --> 00:26:52,398
they started - I started Sahaja Yoga
in the West and especially in England also,

273
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:55,602
you see, whenever I talked to them
they were very anxious

274
00:26:55,803 --> 00:27:00,232
how to get more people into Sahaja Yoga,
how to bring more people,

275
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:04,029
what to do for more people, how to manage.

276
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:10,408
Or they would think somebody to be
very spiritual or something,

277
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:12,762
“So, Mother, can I bring that fellow?”.

278
00:27:12,963 --> 00:27:17,779
And he would turn out to be a horrid stuff,
you see. It would burn My hands,

279
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,353
it would burn everything, and I would say,
“Now how do you mean? What made you think

280
00:27:22,554 --> 00:27:25,565
that he is spiritual?”. “Mother, he talks
so much of spirituality”.

281
00:27:25,766 --> 00:27:30,516
That’s not the thing. It is a calibre,
is a inner calibre

282
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:33,230
a person must have. He may be
an ordinary person,

283
00:27:33,431 --> 00:27:36,569
he may not be earning so much money,
he might be on the street,

284
00:27:36,747 --> 00:27:38,581
but the inner calibre has to be there.

285
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:44,268
Otherwise, what’s the use of breaking
your head against a wall?

286
00:27:44,783 --> 00:27:51,642
So, this idea of having more and more
is wrong.

287
00:27:52,516 --> 00:27:58,063
But to have people who are of that calibre,

288
00:27:58,264 --> 00:28:04,828
of that quality, and who deserve it.
So many do not deserve it.

289
00:28:07,008 --> 00:28:10,066
So what to do? You cannot just... it’s not
like a barber shop

290
00:28:10,282 --> 00:28:14,637
that you can make the head dressed the way
you like.

291
00:28:14,838 --> 00:28:19,155
The Sahastrara has to open out.

292
00:28:20,014 --> 00:28:24,122
You see, the Kundalini has to come out,
it has to work that way.

293
00:28:24,323 --> 00:28:26,848
You cannot just say, “Alright now,
you got realisation”,

294
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:30,443
you can’t say that way, all the time
the Kundalini’s falling down,

295
00:28:30,644 --> 00:28:34,323
you should say, “Alright, sorry sir,
I’m sorry”. Finished.

296
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:40,865
And the more you show as if you are seeking
elections for the votes,

297
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:44,118
the more they’ll be worse.

298
00:28:44,387 --> 00:28:47,853
If somebody doesn’t get realisation,
well and good!

299
00:28:48,054 --> 00:28:51,340
For example, a lady met Me in a place

300
00:28:51,541 --> 00:29:00,756
and she said, “I want to have realisation”.
I said, “Alright, I’ll try”.

301
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,813
Then she wrote three letters to Me,
sent her photographs and she…

302
00:29:07,014 --> 00:29:09,722
And then she said, “I don’t know why
You don’t write to me,

303
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:11,931
I’ve been writing to You, this and that,

304
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:17,775
I know it’s a difficult task to give
a realisation”. “Oh” - so I talked to her -

305
00:29:17,976 --> 00:29:20,978
“Alright, when I come next in June
you can come along”.

306
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:26,381
But there could be somebody who might be
of that calibre, you can feel it,

307
00:29:26,582 --> 00:29:29,989
you are knowledgeable yourself, you can
feel the vibrations, you can feel it

308
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,160
and you can then take that person
seriously.

309
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:40,930
So work on the people who are simple,
who have that calibre.

310
00:29:41,131 --> 00:29:46,014
Of course, they could be very much spoilt
also because of seeking,

311
00:29:46,198 --> 00:29:54,704
but if they are intense and sincere then
the best thing is to work it out

312
00:29:55,459 --> 00:30:01,425
with complete assiduity and attention
to such a person.

313
00:30:01,626 --> 00:30:04,930
But if it’s a fashion, you see, because
they are going to many gurus

314
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:07,179
and they are doing some, lots of guru
shopping,

315
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:13,431
then you should say, “There’s no shop here,
you can’t pay, first of all, you can’t pay”.

316
00:30:15,775 --> 00:30:21,194
If they understand that, then it’s alright.

317
00:30:21,395 --> 00:30:25,182
Say like one fellow from the BBC came in
and he said,

318
00:30:25,383 --> 00:30:29,091
“We can’t believe in a guru who doesn’t
take any money”.

319
00:30:29,292 --> 00:30:32,253
I said, “Then alright, you go to such
a guru who takes money from you,

320
00:30:32,454 --> 00:30:38,236
I’ve nothing to say”. He said - what did
he say? – “Anglo Saxon brain”.

321
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:43,049
I don’t know what that brain is specially,
made by God or not?

322
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:49,566
Cannot understand anyone who can do
such a thing without money.

323
00:30:49,796 --> 00:30:52,996
Such a person you should say, “Alright,
thank you very much, I’m sorry, you see,

324
00:30:53,197 --> 00:30:57,804
you are beyond me, you are too great,
sorry”.

325
00:30:58,005 --> 00:31:02,491
Not hurting the person. But such ideas,
such things if they have there in brains,

326
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:09,998
you cannot break such a hard nut, can you?
And you should not feel sorry for them.

327
00:31:11,461 --> 00:31:16,111
First see their vibrations, see their
calibre. Calibre is the only way

328
00:31:16,312 --> 00:31:22,886
you can judge how much attention is to be
paid, what is to be done.

329
00:31:25,293 --> 00:31:30,116
For some people it’s so obvious,
so obvious.

330
00:31:30,426 --> 00:31:34,315
And some people go on arguing, arguing
with you.

331
00:31:34,516 --> 00:31:36,988
But all of them now are good Sahaja Yogis

332
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:40,499
despite the fact they argued quite a lot
with Me to begin with;

333
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,706
now they are very good Sahaja Yogis.

334
00:31:42,907 --> 00:31:46,141
But now time has come for you to have
a quick result,

335
00:31:46,342 --> 00:31:50,398
and you will meet people who will be
very good, I’m sure you’ll meet all of them

336
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:55,919
who are in England and you, you will be
able to manage them.

337
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,600
Your ways, your methods, your styles
will convince them.

338
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:02,262
Today, only, Doctor Brian has told Me
that many people

339
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:05,623
are getting interested now in Sahaja Yoga,
because they can see the change

340
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:13,821
that comes in, the transformation,
the confidence, everything that they see.

341
00:32:14,525 --> 00:32:19,523
So you should not try to force Sahaja Yoga
on anyone;

342
00:32:19,724 --> 00:32:28,270
it’s better that you see their calibre.
Calibre is very easy to make out.

343
00:32:28,471 --> 00:32:33,316
You just say it and it is there. They know,
yes, that’s it.

344
00:32:38,366 --> 00:32:40,896
Any other question?

345
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,606
Yogini: Shri Mataji, please, could you talk
about simpathy

346
00:32:45,807 --> 00:32:49,495
and compassion towards other Sahaja Yogis

347
00:32:49,696 --> 00:32:53,434
who have problems, who have some negativity
in them, please?

348
00:32:53,635 --> 00:32:56,636
Shri Mataji: I can’t hear. What’s it?
Clearly, I didn’t hear.

349
00:32:56,837 --> 00:33:00,084
You also didn’t hear, I’ve seen.
Yogi: Shri Mataji? Shri Mataji: Ah.

350
00:33:00,285 --> 00:33:02,368
Yogi: Could You speak about sympathy
and compassion

351
00:33:02,569 --> 00:33:08,274
towards other Sahaja Yogis who have
problems with negativity? Shri Mataji: Ah.

352
00:33:09,004 --> 00:33:13,524
Now. Sympathy and compassion;

353
00:33:13,753 --> 00:33:20,057
sympathy doesn’t get involved, then
it’s compassion.

354
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:25,975
Sympathy. ‘Sym’ means ‘share’, ‘pathy’
means ‘pathos’ –

355
00:33:26,176 --> 00:33:28,866
if you want to share the pathos of another
person

356
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:30,818
then you are sympathizing with that person.

357
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:36,442
Now supposing, somebody’s husband is dead
and that person is crying a lot

358
00:33:36,643 --> 00:33:42,041
and you also go and sit down and cry
louder than her.

359
00:33:43,072 --> 00:33:48,061
Then people will ask you, “Did you husband
die or her husband die?”.

360
00:33:50,142 --> 00:33:54,116
“No, no, I am just showing sympathy,
you know”.

361
00:33:55,435 --> 00:34:01,968
This is lip sympathy, of course.
Another is – may be the heartfelt sympathy.

362
00:34:04,112 --> 00:34:09,196
When it is heartfelt then you don’t cry;

363
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:16,681
then you develop the opposite force

364
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:21,585
to put that person right. What do you say
to that person?

365
00:34:21,786 --> 00:34:29,573
You should say, “See, now if you are born
you are going to die,

366
00:34:29,774 --> 00:34:33,627
everybody’s going to die, that’s, that’s
the system.

367
00:34:33,828 --> 00:34:37,680
Now, two persons never die together.

368
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:43,326
This gentleman who has died now,
he’s your husband, alright,

369
00:34:43,527 --> 00:34:48,107
but now if you start crying like this,
he won’t have any peace,

370
00:34:48,308 --> 00:34:54,216
he’ll be hovering round you, and he might
be in limbo

371
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:59,942
waiting for you to come there, or something
like that.

372
00:35:00,371 --> 00:35:05,674
So no use crying over him, on the contrary,
you should say, “I’m alright,

373
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:10,178
don’t worry about me, I’m alright,

374
00:35:10,379 --> 00:35:14,276
get your realisation as I have got it".

375
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,201
This is the opposite force that you put.

376
00:35:17,402 --> 00:35:24,116
This is a real, real way of helping
that person.

377
00:35:24,965 --> 00:35:27,840
But the compassion is very different,

378
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:33,636
compassion just flows, it doesn’t say
anything.

379
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:43,137
Even you don’t see Me, even if you are
in the hospital, you know I am with you.

380
00:35:44,261 --> 00:35:52,661
It works. Even if you just think of Me,
it works.

381
00:35:55,189 --> 00:36:00,143
Even if you make some mistakes, you know
Mother will forgive.

382
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,573
That’s compassion.

383
00:36:03,774 --> 00:36:07,634
Compassion is just flow, you don’t talk
about it, you don’t say anything.

384
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:12,972
It just flows and covers you completely.

385
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,265
And you enjoy that. That’s compassion;

386
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:28,252
it works - sympathy doesn’t work -
compassion works, it soothes you.

387
00:36:30,652 --> 00:36:41,705
It’s a very beautiful touch of love,
affection, kindness, protection.

388
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:52,164
And you feel so confident that you are
under the protection of the Divine.

389
00:36:55,137 --> 00:37:03,763
So, this compassion has not to be shown
or to be dealt with.

390
00:37:03,964 --> 00:37:07,711
Now supposing, another Sahaja Yogi’s having
a problem.

391
00:37:07,912 --> 00:37:10,171
We have only two problems;

392
00:37:10,372 --> 00:37:15,450
as I say, “How many turns there are
in London? Only two, left or right”.

393
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:20,196
In the same way, they have two problems:
either left or right.

394
00:37:20,742 --> 00:37:25,829
If it is the left one or the right one.

395
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,083
You know right one you have to beat
with the shoes, that’s all, finished.

396
00:37:29,284 --> 00:37:35,334
You don’t have to go and say anything
to the person, if he has right problems.

397
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:41,949
Now if he has the left problem what
do you do?

398
00:37:42,312 --> 00:37:47,045
You need not go and talk to that person:
give him a bandhan,

399
00:37:47,246 --> 00:37:49,598
you can burn the name, you can do
what you like.

400
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:54,428
But you need not face the person, you need
not tell the person that, “I’m helping you,

401
00:37:54,629 --> 00:37:58,316
I’m trying to do something for you”.
That’s wrong, that’s ignorance,

402
00:37:58,517 --> 00:38:05,639
you don’t have to say that; it just works,
it has to work by itself.

403
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,634
But I don’t tell you that I’m going to help
you in any way, do I?

404
00:38:08,843 --> 00:38:19,465
Nothing of the kind. Wherever you are
you know I’m with you, all the time.

405
00:38:20,154 --> 00:38:24,388
In the same way, this compassion will work
whether you are sitting down here,

406
00:38:24,589 --> 00:38:29,234
if you are beating somebody with shoes
that person will come round.

407
00:38:29,436 --> 00:38:34,854
So they have only two problems, one is
the left or the right.

408
00:38:35,578 --> 00:38:41,034
If you try to sympathize with any one
of them you are in trouble.

409
00:38:42,631 --> 00:38:48,797
So best thing is not to directly help them,
but indirectly.

410
00:38:50,597 --> 00:38:56,394
Not to tell them that you are helping,
not even mention it to them;

411
00:38:56,595 --> 00:39:03,756
the concern is the point, the concern
about a person.

412
00:39:03,957 --> 00:39:07,835
Your attention should go there,
your attention is very active.

413
00:39:08,036 --> 00:39:12,502
It’s a very powerful thing you have got,
your attention acts.

414
00:39:12,703 --> 00:39:16,794
Just put your attention to that person,
with a concern,

415
00:39:16,971 --> 00:39:22,695
but no involvement: that is compassion.

416
00:39:22,896 --> 00:39:26,445
You have got it, you have got the power
of compassion

417
00:39:26,646 --> 00:39:31,913
in your attention now, you haven’t used it.

418
00:39:32,114 --> 00:39:38,964
Without taking any credit for it, without
showing it, without confronting it,

419
00:39:39,151 --> 00:39:44,830
just inside yourself you feel it, it will
work out.

420
00:39:45,031 --> 00:39:50,384
But for that you have to cleanse your own
attention, that’s very important.

421
00:39:50,585 --> 00:39:56,072
If your attention is loose type, if your
connection is not alright,

422
00:39:56,273 --> 00:40:02,777
then it won’t work out. But if you have
that kind of an attention

423
00:40:02,978 --> 00:40:13,310
which is silent, which is witnessing, which
is not involved, it’s dynamic, it works!

424
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:20,421
All of you have to become like Me, I’m sure
you all can,

425
00:40:20,906 --> 00:40:24,846
and achieve that calibre of compassion.

426
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:31,814
Alright? Do you follow now? Thank you.

427
00:40:41,677 --> 00:40:47,482
Any other question, Hester? No?

428
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:58,118
Danya has any questions? You never
had them.

429
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:05,745
Anybody else? Jason? None!

430
00:41:07,303 --> 00:41:10,863
Question-less people, I tell you.

431
00:41:18,989 --> 00:41:26,778
Best way is to enjoy others. Best way is
to enjoy others;

432
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:33,292
and to enjoy yourself is to laugh
at yourself, that’s the best way.

433
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:38,947
Address yourself, “You, Mister, now
come along, this is ego, I know.

434
00:41:39,148 --> 00:41:45,137
Ah, that’s it, that’s the one! No no no
no no no no no no, not me!

435
00:41:45,338 --> 00:41:48,252
I’ve had enough of it”.

436
00:41:49,355 --> 00:41:52,644
That’s how you enjoy yourself.

437
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:58,308
And enjoy others, seeing their good points.

438
00:41:58,509 --> 00:42:05,411
Sweet, sweet things they do, very sweet
things. You don’t have to say anything.

439
00:42:05,612 --> 00:42:09,130
And we had 71 marriages, you can’t
believe it.

440
00:42:09,331 --> 00:42:13,818
And I looked at the brides and they were
all looking at Me from the angles, you see;

441
00:42:14,003 --> 00:42:20,364
and the eyes were telling the story
of their love and gratitude,

442
00:42:20,565 --> 00:42:23,860
and I don’t know what all they said.

443
00:42:24,061 --> 00:42:27,371
I was just watching them when they
were walking

444
00:42:27,572 --> 00:42:31,003
with their garlands in their hands,
slowly, slowly;

445
00:42:31,204 --> 00:42:40,288
the sweetness, the beauty of their
feelings; very slowly they were walking.

446
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:49,077
And then I saw the boys standing there,
looking at Me

447
00:42:50,262 --> 00:42:55,062
with tremendous feeling of oneness.

448
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:00,223
You see, this cannot be enjoyed otherwise.

449
00:43:00,424 --> 00:43:03,896
Even with the body you cannot enjoy,
supposing you rub your hand,

450
00:43:04,097 --> 00:43:13,788
you won’t enjoy that much as you enjoy
other people, other sahaja yogis.

451
00:43:15,457 --> 00:43:21,243
And then the friends doing the leg-pulling
also I enjoy,

452
00:43:21,626 --> 00:43:26,473
the way they talk to each other I enjoy,
everything’s so enjoyable,

453
00:43:26,674 --> 00:43:31,488
it doesn’t hurt anyone, it doesn’t trouble
anyone.

454
00:43:32,864 --> 00:43:39,180
You are here to enjoy, God has created
this universe for you to enjoy.

455
00:43:39,634 --> 00:43:43,920
So only thing is that you must improve
your attention,

456
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:48,150
cleanse your attention by meditation,

457
00:43:49,365 --> 00:43:54,661
always think of good things, not of bad
things.

458
00:43:55,474 --> 00:43:59,518
You should not react too much, just be
within yourself,

459
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:02,717
see for yourself, witness everything.

460
00:44:02,918 --> 00:44:09,153
And you’ll be amazed, you’ll see beautiful
points, beautiful things all around you.

461
00:44:09,354 --> 00:44:17,530
So much of beauty which we are losing
because we cannot see it.

462
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:22,644
So that deep, penetrating attention
of concern

463
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:26,443
will solve all the problems, I’m sure.

464
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:32,941
But ‘open your heart’ doesn’t mean that 
you go and hug somebody

465
00:44:33,142 --> 00:44:35,697
and kiss somebody ten times, it doesn’t
mean that at all.

466
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:40,196
On the contrary, it can be quite
embarrassing, you know?

467
00:44:45,526 --> 00:44:48,698
Any other questions?

468
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:07,239
I, I had a problem there, you see, we,
they arranged a programme for Me

469
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,211
to speak to the young presidents’
organisation,

470
00:45:11,412 --> 00:45:16,916
the presidents of big, big – of big, big
organisations,

471
00:45:17,138 --> 00:45:20,750
business organisations, and I had to speak
to them.

472
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:25,201
And one of the lady - of course, I mean -
the questions were

473
00:45:25,402 --> 00:45:28,090
very good and everything flowing (?) over,
and later on she says,

474
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:33,110
“But I can’t believe it, because she is
not at all serious, you see”.

475
00:45:34,684 --> 00:45:36,962
And I laughed and laughed and laughed
with that, I said,

476
00:45:37,163 --> 00:45:41,428
“Now I cannot be serious anymore,
that was too much”.

477
00:45:42,275 --> 00:45:45,954
When there’s so much joy bubbling out, why,
how can you be serious?

478
00:45:46,155 --> 00:45:50,920
This is the idea of a saint that he should
be very serious, stern,

479
00:45:51,121 --> 00:45:58,360
going out with a stick in his hand
all the time hitting everyone on the head.

480
00:46:01,355 --> 00:46:06,537
So, any other question (indistinct word)?
No.

481
00:46:12,034 --> 00:46:13,690
We must have a hall here, big hall

482
00:46:13,891 --> 00:46:19,037
we should buy somewhere, we should be
able to buy.

483
00:46:19,434 --> 00:46:22,486
I’m thankful to people who are working
on Shudy Camp but I think

484
00:46:22,687 --> 00:46:25,012
you must hurry up now,

485
00:46:25,213 --> 00:46:29,327
people are coming for Guru Puja, I told
them we’ll have it in Shudy Camp.

486
00:46:29,528 --> 00:46:32,463
And otherwise if it is not ready we’ll have
to change the venue,

487
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:36,269
so everybody must go and work it out,
I think, is important.

488
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:40,308
We have money, we have no problem on that.

489
00:46:40,662 --> 00:46:45,813
We have to have a nice, grand, beautiful

490
00:46:47,031 --> 00:46:51,257
seminar before Guru Puja. And there are
many coming here,

491
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:58,653
you’ll meet all of them, will be a very
nice time, real festival we’ll be having.

492
00:46:59,153 --> 00:47:03,672
So it would be better that you, all of you
combine together and work it out

493
00:47:03,873 --> 00:47:09,348
and also give different work to different
people;

494
00:47:09,549 --> 00:47:15,908
and they should all try to organize it
in a beautiful way

495
00:47:16,109 --> 00:47:19,929
that there’s no quarrel, nothing.
But you’ll see people, you see, will say,

496
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:24,917
“Oh! This is the room I would like to have
for my wife”, things like that.

497
00:47:25,118 --> 00:47:28,137
Sounds stupidity.

498
00:47:29,595 --> 00:47:33,888
“This is the glass for me, I can’t give it
to you”.

499
00:47:34,158 --> 00:47:38,704
All such stupid things will be there, and
I think, for such people you should say,

500
00:47:38,905 --> 00:47:43,049
“You are not for Guru Puja, better not
be here”.

501
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:47,649
Everybody doesn’t deserve to be there.

502
00:47:48,771 --> 00:47:51,771
That’s you should find out, that what sort
of people they are.

503
00:47:51,972 --> 00:47:55,114
If they are fighting for all these little,
little things it’s best is to tell them

504
00:47:55,315 --> 00:47:59,653
that, “Sorry, you’d better not come
for Guru Puja”.

505
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:09,663
So, the most important thing is that
in Guru Puja we have to receive

506
00:48:09,864 --> 00:48:15,200
a special capacity to be a guru ourselves.

507
00:48:15,401 --> 00:48:19,815
A special intelligence, a special
understanding,

508
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,818
a kind of a wisdom which gives you
discretion

509
00:48:24,019 --> 00:48:27,810
and the ability to argue out things.

510
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:32,347
That will enhance your personality,

511
00:48:32,942 --> 00:48:42,507
a beautiful, dignified personality can be
created within yourselves,

512
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:46,756
so for that you have to be there

513
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:52,759
with all that dedication and understanding
about yourself.

514
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:58,769
So I’m looking forward to this Guru Puja,
and everybody has to write.

515
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:04,216
Now for Sahastrara day they are working
so hard, the people from Australia

516
00:49:04,417 --> 00:49:07,993
have printed so many posters, all over
the world they have sent it,

517
00:49:08,194 --> 00:49:11,899
they have sent it to you also the posters
of Sahastrar Day - have you brought it?

518
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,298
No? You haven’t shown them.

519
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:25,941
So next time you must show all of them,
they should see that,

520
00:49:26,174 --> 00:49:29,521
what they have done, how much; and
you must -

521
00:49:29,722 --> 00:49:32,897
we have no, nothing like a news from there
and this thing - but all this

522
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:35,866
can be discussed among yourself; and you
should know about each other,

523
00:49:36,067 --> 00:49:39,147
what’s happening, where, and what ashram
is doing,

524
00:49:39,348 --> 00:49:45,375
what is the special work they are doing, and
what is the new thing they have discovered;

525
00:49:45,576 --> 00:49:51,017
all sorts of things you can find out from
each other. And you can tell others also.

526
00:49:51,218 --> 00:49:55,465
This is how you keep in communication
with each other.

527
00:49:55,666 --> 00:49:59,668
Oh, there’s a very good news, that
Doctor Rai,

528
00:49:59,869 --> 00:50:05,371
who is the Dean of the Faculty
of Physiology in Delhi University,

529
00:50:05,572 --> 00:50:11,650
started a research work on the comparative
study of Sahaja Yogis and others

530
00:50:11,851 --> 00:50:15,678
as far as the physiology is concerned.
And he’s found out that the people

531
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:26,132
who are not Sahaja Yogis have a very low
resistance for diseases,

532
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:29,875
their skin, skin resistance is less and
so many things he’s found out.

533
00:50:30,076 --> 00:50:33,529
And he has put it on, he’s tabulated
the whole thing,

534
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:38,249
and that is been now approved
by the Government and is now published,

535
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:42,025
going to be published also.
In the same way, you see,

536
00:50:42,226 --> 00:50:47,172
we are thinking of having a research here
done for people in Shudy Camp,

537
00:50:47,373 --> 00:50:50,429
so that we can also publish something
like that with the research.

538
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,972
That so far, you see, so many have been
cured, so many got rid

539
00:50:54,173 --> 00:50:58,100
of their addictions, so many got rid
of their mental problems,

540
00:50:58,301 --> 00:51:01,501
so many things happened; but we haven’t
yet recorded it,

541
00:51:01,702 --> 00:51:05,707
we have not put it properly on the record.
Now this is what we are going to do now,

542
00:51:05,908 --> 00:51:09,686
anybody who has achieved something
or has felt better

543
00:51:09,887 --> 00:51:12,221
or has been cured or something like that

544
00:51:12,422 --> 00:51:15,683
must give it in writing to these people
so they record it,

545
00:51:15,884 --> 00:51:21,021
because, you see, in these modern times
they want everything in black and white,

546
00:51:21,222 --> 00:51:24,239
so that could be done very well here
in England.

547
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,985
Another thing I was thinking that now
“Nirmala Yoga”

548
00:51:27,186 --> 00:51:31,925
has stopped there because of this problem
of foreign exchange.

549
00:51:32,134 --> 00:51:37,480
So what we can do is to have
a “Nirmala Yog” published in India

550
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:42,159
and sent here, and you can print it here
and sell it here,

551
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,570
so that the foreign exchange problem
doesn’t come in.

552
00:51:44,778 --> 00:51:46,961
Because foreign exchange is such a problem
in that country,

553
00:51:47,162 --> 00:51:52,829
you have to have a proper committee,
this, that, all headaches.

554
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:57,136
So you can sell them here and distribute
them here,

555
00:51:57,336 --> 00:52:01,348
it’s very easy, and Paul can help you
there. Paul, can’t you? (Paul: Yes...)

556
00:52:01,549 --> 00:52:05,892
Yes. So it’s alright. We get
the “Nirmala Yog” done there

557
00:52:06,093 --> 00:52:09,054
and just the copy sent here, translated.

558
00:52:09,255 --> 00:52:12,168
You can also add to it, you can also put
something into it

559
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:14,588
and some things from there and some
things from here;

560
00:52:14,789 --> 00:52:21,278
you can distribute it to all the centres
here and we can start like that.

561
00:52:21,478 --> 00:52:25,094
Because they created a big problem
out of that last “Nirmala Yoga”,

562
00:52:25,296 --> 00:52:28,924
I’ve just stopped it, because you see we,
we are not very good

563
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:33,602
at human laws, I think, sometimes you make
mistakes and I don’t want

564
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:38,051
you people to be caught up into these human
laws. So you have to be careful.

565
00:52:38,252 --> 00:52:42,960
And we can do it, I think we can do it.
And as England is the heart

566
00:52:43,161 --> 00:52:46,479
it has to circulate everything.

567
00:52:49,187 --> 00:52:54,454
But the hearts must open out.
The conditioning is very bad here,

568
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:59,255
you see, that you are told that you should
not express your feelings,

569
00:52:59,456 --> 00:53:02,760
you should not say anything, you should be
very poised,

570
00:53:02,961 --> 00:53:07,635
you should not talk about your feelings. 
That’s not so in Sahaja Yoga.

571
00:53:07,836 --> 00:53:11,769
This is the heart and heart must speak,
heart must say;

572
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:17,037
you must know how to say that you love
others. It’s very easy to say ‘I hate’,

573
00:53:17,238 --> 00:53:23,465
but it’s very difficult for people to say
‘I love you’. Because they are afraid,

574
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:26,754
that if you commit like this, “Oh, so
you love me?

575
00:53:26,955 --> 00:53:31,537
So do this for me. You love me?
So do this for me.

576
00:53:32,606 --> 00:53:34,937
How dare you say you love me, if you have
loved me

577
00:53:35,138 --> 00:53:39,128
you must do all this and you must give
this to me”.

578
00:53:40,607 --> 00:53:43,550
Oh, we had some Sahaja Yogis like that.

579
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:46,340
They were abusing Me also that,
“You said you love us,

580
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:49,893
then why don’t You do this for us?”.

581
00:53:50,422 --> 00:53:53,836
Then it becomes a demanding love.

582
00:53:55,901 --> 00:53:59,792
Any other question anywhere?

583
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:07,099
What’s happening, John, about your
priesthood?

584
00:54:10,327 --> 00:54:13,756
They are getting quite exposed.
(John: Yes, Mother.)

585
00:54:13,957 --> 00:54:17,323
Exposure is the only way, but still nothing
goes into the heads of the people,

586
00:54:17,524 --> 00:54:19,740
they are so egoistical, nobody wants
to accept

587
00:54:19,941 --> 00:54:23,409
that it’s all exposed now within –
‘No, it is fanaticism, it is nonsense’.

588
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:27,076
But still they go on with it, what to do?

589
00:54:54,243 --> 00:54:57,862
Beautiful children you have here.

590
00:54:59,074 --> 00:55:02,095
How many are new people who are seeing
Me for the first time?

591
00:55:02,296 --> 00:55:07,269
Raise your hands please. Ah!

592
00:55:09,084 --> 00:55:13,423
Ah, you all look little serious!

593
00:55:14,426 --> 00:55:22,193
Still rather serious. You shouldn’t be
serious at all. Good. Nice.

594
00:55:33,778 --> 00:55:39,285
Get the children. He is just hitting
the head.

595
00:55:46,022 --> 00:55:50,643
Who is the child crying there so much?
Whose child?

596
00:55:50,844 --> 00:55:57,357
(A yogi says something inaudible)
This child? What’s the matter?

597
00:55:57,558 --> 00:56:02,714
Must be hot. Take out the sweater. Eh?

598
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:11,733
(Somebody says something)
It’s alright.

599
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:21,905
I think, must be hot for the child.
And they feel very thirsty also,

600
00:56:22,106 --> 00:56:27,148
you see, these are places where you don’t
have any humidity much,

601
00:56:27,348 --> 00:56:31,817
so they feel very thirsty also in such
places, I think.

602
00:56:42,088 --> 00:56:47,720
All of them cry the same, whether they are
Indians, English, anything!

603
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:54,000
From their crying you can’t make out
what race they come from.

604
00:56:57,693 --> 00:57:04,700
Now better? Have you got some water
or something?

605
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:10,666
See! You must understand your children,
they won’t cry without a reason.

606
00:57:10,867 --> 00:57:14,225
They are all realised souls.

607
00:57:27,074 --> 00:57:32,568
Alright. Thank you, thank you very much.

608
00:57:35,554 --> 00:57:38,245
Anything else?

609
00:57:42,346 --> 00:57:49,596
(Someone asks an inaudible question.)

610
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:51,875
Shri Mataji: Can you say…?
Yogi: How can you best cope

611
00:57:52,076 --> 00:57:55,281
if you have to work in a negative situation?
Shri Mataji: In your office?

612
00:57:55,482 --> 00:57:57,975
Yogi: Job, yes.
Shri Mataji: Negativity in the office?

613
00:57:58,176 --> 00:58:03,068
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: You see, all the negativity

614
00:58:03,269 --> 00:58:09,937
have also, has also an aspect which I call
is ridiculous and humorous;

615
00:58:10,138 --> 00:58:12,568
so anybody who is negative or anything

616
00:58:12,769 --> 00:58:15,674
you watch it, see for yourself, don’t get
involved,

617
00:58:15,875 --> 00:58:22,085
just see which part it is, is it ridiculous
or it is humorous.

618
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:28,883
Then you won’t be serious about it.

619
00:58:37,653 --> 00:58:40,248
Sahaja Yogis have a sense of ridiculous,

620
00:58:40,449 --> 00:58:43,120
you see, they understand what is
ridiculous is;

621
00:58:43,321 --> 00:58:48,056
also they understand what is humorous
or what is stupid.

622
00:58:48,271 --> 00:58:54,040
So just see that, it is stupid? Alright,
let it be, doesn’t matter, what can you do?

623
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,482
These children are growing so fast,
you know.

624
00:59:00,683 --> 00:59:03,365
They’re so becoming all tall, girls
and all that.

625
00:59:03,566 --> 00:59:07,009
I’m just trying to make them out
one after another.
