1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,841
So, the religion should be inside.

2
00:00:13,206 --> 00:00:16,864
That's Sufism.

3
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:22,560
"Sufi" word comes from "safw" [clear].

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:33,920
Mother, mister Heming is teaching at Marmara University and teaching the interpretations of all the Quran.

5
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:34,779
Good.

6
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:35,514
Yes. 

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,780
But, you see, Quran also is very much recent.

8
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:15,255
He is interpreting words from the Quran saying,

9
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:21,593
if people want to follow the regulations of Quran, 

10
00:01:21,593 --> 00:01:31,950
they would notice that Lakshmi would come to them.

11
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:36,897
It’s not that way. You see.

12
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:52,940
If they would believe and would not break the rules, 

13
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,554
they would see the benefits.

14
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:11,801
They would notice that the doors of heaven would be opened to them and that Lakshmi would come to them.

15
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:13,613
To whom?

16
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:15,057
To the people.

17
00:02:15,057 --> 00:02:18,867
To those who are following the rules, those who are  following strickly the Quran.

18
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:23,178
There’s no doubt about it. 
But what I feel about the whole thing is that 

19
00:02:23,178 --> 00:02:29,654
that Koran was written after forty years of the death of Muhammad Sahib.

20
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:47,548
And also- and you cannot remember. But despite that, I find Quran is perfect. 

21
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:53,397
But there are many subtler things that are missing.

22
00:03:02,731 --> 00:03:11,559
Now, for example, Muhammad Sahib has said that he went on a white horse, through the seven heavens. 

23
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:23,829
Now that people don't understand.

24
00:03:25,321 --> 00:03:32,216
So, that is the, he has described exactly what happens when the Kundalini rises.

25
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,584
What he says?

26
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:42,482
He says that actually, he is not travelling somewhere

27
00:03:42,482 --> 00:03:44,200
No, no, no, it is within yourself.

28
00:03:46,804 --> 00:03:53,563
Within yourself, he crosses. Yes, but that is what is Sahaja Yoga.

29
00:03:56,138 --> 00:04:04,848
That is what, yes. But what has happened that 
because of poetry, people don't understand.

30
00:04:08,213 --> 00:04:12,864
And they are misinterpreting. Mainly, they are misinterpreting.

31
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:23,790
People look, are searching the religion outside, not inside.

32
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:30,000
That's the point, that's the point. But what he has said -

33
00:04:34,126 --> 00:04:38,714
Sufis know that this journey is a spiritual journey.

34
00:04:38,714 --> 00:04:46,192
Yes, of course. But the trouble is people don't understand and they are misled.

35
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:55,863
Because people want to make money out of them.

36
00:04:57,794 --> 00:05:09,481
Or they want to gain some sort of a violence or something and they are just bringing a bad name to Quran initially and also to Muhammad Sahib.

37
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:43,620
He believes that 

38
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:54,067
people, the common people is not seeking the Miraj within himself.

39
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:56,273
That's it. 

40
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:04,446
That's true. That is the main thing that we talk about in Sahaja Yoga

41
00:06:04,446 --> 00:06:09,008
that, "You know thyself" is said in the Quran also.

42
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,168
So, when you have not known yourself, you are not a "sama" [listening to your Spirit]

43
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,017
Without knowing yourself, what are you surrendering to God?

44
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:37,823
It's an important thing that first you know yourself.

45
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:43,978
Can you believe that all religions have said the same thing?

46
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:52,445
Christ has said the same, Krishna has said the same, Rama has said the same, 

47
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:58,603
Zoroaster has said the same thing all of them have said the same thing.

48
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:18,509
Krishna, Krishna, yes, very close to Adam to Adam's religion.

49
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:21,726
But Adam, they did not know "Ruh".

50
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:38,949
He believes that the poets from that time didn't have "Ruh" either.

51
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:47,657
True, I agree. But, you see, whether it is Krishna or anyone of these people, 

52
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:58,786
they are all just the same. And they are building up
 human beings to find out about themselves.

53
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,769
And also, Sufis are like that.

54
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:49,467
The education today is only teaching 
the outside, the material, not the inside.

55
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:54,422
Yes, correct. I agree with you. But outside was worked out, I don't know.

56
00:08:56,324 --> 00:09:01,166
But it has to be worked out inside.

57
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:16,332
Because, when it is worked inside, as it is said that, "At the time of "Qiyamah" [Resurrection], your hands will speak" and they speak actually.

58
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,409
So, by outside -

59
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:36,312
Now our hands and feet are speaking also.

60
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:37,134
Hum?

61
00:09:37,134 --> 00:09:42,294
He says, "Now our hands and feet are speaking also".

62
00:09:42,294 --> 00:09:47,799
Ah, that's the thing, but they are very few and they are the Sufis.

63
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:59,063
They are speaking but very few are listening.

64
00:10:00,936 --> 00:10:06,164
Also, you should know what do they mean, what are they saying.

65
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:13,233
And that is what is explained in Sahaja Yoga.

66
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:22,155
You can verify it.

67
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:28,161
He is Mevlevi by the way. 

68
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:28,844
Hum?

69
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:32,040
He is from the part of Mevlevi, Mevlana.

70
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,325
Jalal addin Rumi.

71
00:10:34,325 --> 00:10:37,799
Whirling dervish.

72
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:44,928
But he also didn't say how you become,

73
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:54,799
how, what to do- You see, whatever he was, he was great.

74
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,638
And he has written about his own understanding and feelings. 

75
00:10:59,638 --> 00:11:05,142
He should tell you about his feelings, how he became Mevlevi?

76
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:07,020
He didn't say that.

77
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:12,179
No, he says that Mevlana, he didn't explain openly how to become. 

78
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:13,528
No, no, no, he didn't, he didn't.

79
00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:14,383
He didn't.

80
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:20,978
I agree, what he has done, he said is- 
what is has talked that after becoming a Realized soul, 

81
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:35,560
what you think what you talk and it's like, you can say, the Chinese system of Tao, same thing, same thing.

82
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:42,849
Tao also is a system in which he describes
 what happens to a person who is a Tao.

83
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:50,522
The one who is a Realized soul, what happens to him? 
How he is above everything,

84
00:11:50,522 --> 00:11:59,193
how he works out, how he has no fear. 
But that is what you are saying how it is.

85
00:11:59,193 --> 00:12:02,415
But how to achieve it? They never told.

86
00:12:16,547 --> 00:12:20,951
How human beings achieve it? 

87
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:23,614
And that too, collectively.

88
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:56,357
The people, common people, have no desire to achieve a spiritual thing.

89
00:12:56,357 --> 00:13:00,288
No, no, no. Not now. Now it's a different thing.

90
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:04,742
Because the world is so much full of struggle and strike and all that. 

91
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,219
This has started.

92
00:13:21,854 --> 00:13:28,067
All over the world, there are thousands of people-

93
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:45,194
During the time of Mevlana it was also very much struggle: the Moghuls were invading that land

94
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:48,585
and he escaped and came to Anatolia.

95
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:55,768
But this is a special time. It's already predicted in our scriptures also. 

96
00:13:56,499 --> 00:14:03,600
In Indian scriptures, that this is the time where people will get their Self-realization collectively.

97
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:17,219
In your Italy only, in your country only, there are so many who have got it.

98
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,232
He says, "Inch' Allah" [If God wants it].

99
00:14:34,893 --> 00:14:42,817
He believes that the fundamentals of Islam in Turkey is the Sufism.

100
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:51,225
But one Sufi cannot make others Sufis, it's the point. 

101
00:14:58,628 --> 00:15:01,931
But in Sahaja Yoga, we can make thousands.

102
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:44,259
He knows the point as Istanbul was only five hundred thousand people. Only the half of five hundred thousand people were Muslims at that time.

103
00:15:47,478 --> 00:15:53,561
They were five hundred and twenty Sufi centres.

104
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:58,342
I know, I know that's why it's so important for me. 

105
00:16:00,273 --> 00:16:06,893
But to give it collectively and to give the pure knowledge is very important. 

106
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:10,798
It's spontaneous awaking, without effort. It's not  coming from the brain, it's coming from inside and it is happening in no time, like this. 

107
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:49,974
In Sahaja Yoga, we don't need to do big penances, tapasya, dancing, this and that.

108
00:18:49,974 --> 00:18:54,851
It is just a spontaneous happening. In her presence, the Kundalini awakens,

109
00:18:54,851 --> 00:19:02,811
goes up and we get this enlightenment. And then the full knowledge of Muhammad, Jesus, come to us spontaneously.

110
00:19:02,811 --> 00:19:04,811
Complete, absolute.

111
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:14,141
Without effort.

112
00:21:04,034 --> 00:21:10,032
In thousands, all over the world, they just put the hands like this and the get awakened.

113
00:21:10,032 --> 00:21:12,412
You see the eyes sparkling.

114
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:28,150
What, Shri Mataji, he is trying to tell us is that it's not to come against what we are saying, it's just that from his knowledge, 

115
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,126
But he is a Sufi and he is my son. 

116
00:21:31,126 --> 00:21:36,959
From his knowledge, what he thinks that it is very difficult because he doesn't know. 

117
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:39,470
Ah, yes. It used to be not now

118
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:06,000
He says when he is educating the children in school, he is teaching them Quran,  

119
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,955
and he starts with eighty of them, and after four years he says that only eight of them come out with full understanding of what I'm telling now.

120
00:22:14,955 --> 00:22:19,789
No, you go the other way round. Sahaja Yoga is the other way round.

121
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:24,124
First, we make them the Sufis and then we give them the Quran.

122
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,550
That's the way it is.

123
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:15,873
Only after the awakening, the scriptures can be understood. 

124
00:23:15,873 --> 00:23:18,305
That’s what I try, that's what I thought.

125
00:23:44,787 --> 00:23:53,376
When she gave conferences, many professors, university professors, teachers of Quran, they came to Shri Mataji and they said, 

126
00:23:53,376 --> 00:23:58,273
"The way you explain, Shri Mataji, the Quran, it was never understood before" 

127
00:23:58,273 --> 00:24:00,000
Fundamentalist, so many fundamentalists. 

128
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,168
And they were fundamentalists. 

129
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:08,832
First, you give them the experience 
of the All-pervading Power of "Ruh".

130
00:24:08,832 --> 00:24:13,398
Once they get the experience, then they go deep.

131
00:24:49,006 --> 00:24:53,756
Now he says, "First, open the door"

132
00:24:53,756 --> 00:24:58,740
And then get it. It's correct. Correct! That's all it is. 

133
00:25:02,866 --> 00:25:08,757
Not every door gets opened easily. Some of them are really rustic. 

134
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,987
But Shri Mataji has the key.

135
00:25:11,987 --> 00:25:13,723
To all the doors. 

136
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:18,156
She has the master key.

137
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:32,558
He understands your mission is very high and ultimate

138
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:37,172
and he hopes all the best to your mission.

139
00:25:37,172 --> 00:25:39,781
He has to get many Sufis.

140
00:25:41,854 --> 00:25:47,494
If you want to change the world, 
you can't manage with one or two.

141
00:25:55,716 --> 00:26:02,486
Even to understand Quran or Bible or anything, 
you have to have that eyes.

142
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:20,770
In Sahaja Yoga also, also "vidya" [knowledge], 

143
00:26:21,412 --> 00:26:27,280
is what are all the centres are there, what are the problems of the centres.

144
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:33,254
And we have seen that people have cured physically, mentally.

145
00:26:33,254 --> 00:26:38,614
And also, they become what they call, thoughtlessly aware.

146
00:26:51,722 --> 00:27:00,822
So, all the religions have talked about it. 
It's not only Quran, it's not only Bible, it's not only Gita.

147
00:27:00,822 --> 00:27:04,811
All the religions have said the same thing.

148
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,423
What she said?

149
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,866
She is asking, "How is it possible?"

150
00:27:15,866 --> 00:27:21,172
It’s possible because God has made within us all the arrangements. 

151
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:24,477
He is a great organizer.

152
00:27:28,544 --> 00:27:34,094
And we have within us that power that's the Mother Power

153
00:27:34,094 --> 00:27:38,590
which rises and pierces through your fontanelle bone area

154
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:44,700
and makes you one connection with that All-pervading Power, the "Ruh"

155
00:27:58,814 --> 00:28:03,816
Excuse-me, here in Sufism, also there is a terminology for that moment.

156
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:07,310
It is called "Ana al-Haqq" [I am the Truth]

157
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:09,660
In this religion. 

158
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:14,807
"Ana al-Haqq", saying, I am God. Saying, I am God.

159
00:28:14,807 --> 00:28:15,842
I am religion. 

160
00:28:15,842 --> 00:28:17,611
I am religion, I am God.

161
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:18,230
Correct.

162
00:28:25,808 --> 00:28:27,759
No, no, you become. Actually, you become.

163
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:29,291
Yes, the Truth. I am the Truth.

164
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:35,065
You become. You don't have to have a certificate.
 You just become. First, your hands start speaking.

165
00:28:35,065 --> 00:28:38,000
You know what are these centres are within you.

166
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,880
Every knowledge, perfect knowledge within is available
