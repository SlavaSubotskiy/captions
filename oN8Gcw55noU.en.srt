1
00:03:13,268 --> 00:03:21,124
Today, it’s a great day for all of us,
the seekers,

2
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:28,742
that the last work of the Divine,

3
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:33,818
of opening the last centre

4
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:43,964
in the Great Primordial Being, was done
on the 5th of May 1970.

5
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:11,658
It is the greatest event of all the
spiritual happenings of the Universe.

6
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:32,737
It was done with very great care and
great adjustments.

7
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:51,434
It is not in the limits of human
understanding,

8
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:56,890
how things are worked in the heavens.

9
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:14,777
It is your fortune and God’s love

10
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:20,392
that has worked out this wondrous miracle.

11
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:34,884
Without this happening, there could not
have been

12
00:05:36,656 --> 00:05:45,191
a possibility to give mass Realisation
to people.

13
00:05:53,157 --> 00:05:57,889
One could have done it for one or two
persons here and there,

14
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:05,687
but to give such a mass awakening could
not have been possible.

15
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:25,741
As you know, in the Sahasrara, there are
the seats of the seven main chakras.

16
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:41,599
There are one thousand nadis or, as they
call it, flames,

17
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:53,977
and they all have each sixteen thousand
powers.

18
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:15,237
Every nadi deals with a particular type
of a person

19
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:25,845
and, with the permutations and combinations

20
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:36,671
of all these nadis, human beings are
looked after.

21
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,085
As soon as Sahasrara was opened,

22
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:56,983
the whole atmosphere was filled with
tremendous chaitanya

23
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:13,093
and there was tremendous light in the sky,

24
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:21,593
and the whole thing came on this Earth

25
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:29,485
as if a torrential rain or a waterfall,

26
00:08:38,638 --> 00:08:43,459
with such a tremendous force,

27
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:53,205
as if I was unaware and got stupefied.

28
00:08:58,937 --> 00:09:05,415
The happening was so unexpected and
so tremendous

29
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:16,346
that I was stunned and I became completely
silent at its grandeur.

30
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:43,551
I saw the primordial Kundalini rising like
a big furnace,

31
00:09:51,250 --> 00:10:01,874
and the furnace was very silent but
a burning appearance it had:

32
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:13,110
as if you heat up some metal and it has
many colours, in the same way,

33
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:20,207
the Kundalini showed up like a huge
furnace, you can say;

34
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:25,489
a furnace which is like a tunnel,

35
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:41,439
where you see these plants you have for
coal burning to create electricity;

36
00:10:51,555 --> 00:10:56,199
and it stretched like a telescope one after
another,

37
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,926
it came out, shoot, shoot, shoot,
like that.

38
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:18,134
And the Deities came and sat on their
seats,

39
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:27,802
on their golden seats,

40
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:38,554
and then they lifted the whole of the head,

41
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:46,380
like a big dome,

42
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:53,028
and opened it,

43
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:57,660
and then this torrential rain

44
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:04,192
completely drenched me

45
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:15,633
and I started seeing all that and got lost
into the joy.

46
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:31,306
It was like an artist seeing its own
creation fulfilled.

47
00:12:31,507 --> 00:12:36,509
I felt the joy of great fulfilment.

48
00:12:51,001 --> 00:13:00,061
After coming out of that beautiful
experience

49
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:13,208
I looked around and I saw human beings
so blind

50
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,567
and I became absolutely silent.

51
00:13:31,148 --> 00:13:38,053
Then I desired that I should get the cups
to fill this nectar.

52
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,163
But I saw all stones.

53
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:07,212
Sahasrara is the most beautiful part
of your being.

54
00:14:12,777 --> 00:14:18,810
It is a big lotus with one thousand petals
of different colours

55
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:24,743
appearing like inflated flames.

56
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:38,457
It is a thing which is seen by many people

57
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:50,327
but to see it pour that torrential rain

58
00:14:54,631 --> 00:15:00,342
was like these flames becoming a fountain,

59
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:09,946
fountain of colours and of fragrance.

60
00:15:12,464 --> 00:15:20,277
Can you think of a flower pouring
its colour and its fragrance around?

61
00:15:26,778 --> 00:15:31,623
People have written very little about
Sahasrara,

62
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:41,084
because whatever they have seen
is from outside

63
00:15:46,356 --> 00:15:52,095
and it’s not possible for them to go
from inside.

64
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:58,914
Even if you reach from inside, if the whole
Sahasrara is not opened out,

65
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:02,631
you cannot see its beauty;

66
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:12,166
because when it is closed, the whole
of it, the total,

67
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:18,519
then you just pass through a little
aperture and get out of it.

68
00:16:24,337 --> 00:16:33,970
But just imagine a huge big petaled,
thousand petaled lotus,

69
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:41,595
and you are sitting inside, in the corona
and looking at all these petals —

70
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,606
all very beautifully coloured, and
fragrant,

71
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:02,952
and pulsating with the bliss and the joy.

72
00:17:19,564 --> 00:17:28,772
To remain into Sahasrara, on that position,
is the ideal situation.

73
00:17:36,565 --> 00:17:48,015
But then, after the silence, you are filled
with tremendous compassion and love,

74
00:17:55,254 --> 00:18:03,446
and you are drawn out to people

75
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:12,373
who haven’t yet known what is having eyes.

76
00:18:18,803 --> 00:18:28,340
And thus you try to put your attention
to the Sahasrara of millions of people,

77
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:43,132
and then you start seeing the problems
that exist in the Sahasrara.

78
00:18:49,007 --> 00:19:00,638
And even if you desire to ope
 the Sahasrara it is a very difficult thing

79
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:14,951
because the channelising from the Divine
to human beings

80
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:19,979
has to be through human beings.

81
00:19:31,115 --> 00:19:33,870
The power could be with you,

82
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:39,636
but it has to be channelised through
human element.

83
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:53,574
All my life I had not known many
realised-souls.

84
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:01,151
How to get them?

85
00:20:03,462 --> 00:20:06,721
How to work it out?

86
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:13,839
So I started looking out for people,

87
00:20:18,555 --> 00:20:23,413
and I met one old lady of seventy years,

88
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:31,539
and she was very perturbed about
something very gross;

89
00:20:34,748 --> 00:20:40,089
and when she came to me she felt
very peaceful.

90
00:20:42,654 --> 00:20:46,906
Her Sahasrara was very worn out.

91
00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:58,812
And in my company she would think
of something else, not of the Spirit.

92
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:08,811
And her brain would be covered with clouds

93
00:21:10,932 --> 00:21:14,277
and darkness.

94
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:20,751
Again and again I had to enlighten it

95
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,823
but she did not get her Realisation.

96
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,713
Most of the people who came to me
in the beginning came for getting cured.

97
00:21:39,595 --> 00:21:43,985
This capacity I had from childhood.

98
00:21:45,454 --> 00:21:50,642
And I could also give Realisation to a few
people before,

99
00:21:54,484 --> 00:21:59,268
but they had to be very earnest – aartha.

100
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,119
I didn’t meet any one of that quality

101
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,737
because I was not living in the forest,

102
00:22:13,938 --> 00:22:22,593
I was living as a normal human being
among other normal human beings,

103
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:35,266
and they were not that earnest, that
aartha,

104
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:42,918
and I had to do this work among them.

105
00:22:49,316 --> 00:22:52,317
How to talk to them about the real world
that exists

106
00:22:52,518 --> 00:22:56,766
and the false [one] in which they live?

107
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:13,440
And one lady, the first one who got
Realisation, just came to see me

108
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:20,354
because she was possessed with the idea
of seeking, she thought,

109
00:23:25,274 --> 00:23:29,085
and it worked in her.

110
00:23:34,031 --> 00:23:37,436
That was not the happiest day,

111
00:23:40,042 --> 00:23:45,988
because she’s one of those who get
individually Realisation.

112
00:23:50,823 --> 00:23:55,933
With this great happening many should get
at a time.

113
00:24:02,855 --> 00:24:07,081
We had a programme in Bordi

114
00:24:07,995 --> 00:24:12,490
in ’70,

115
00:24:12,977 --> 00:24:19,942
and there, first, one gentleman got
Realisation in the evening.

116
00:24:25,282 --> 00:24:32,408
Next day there were negative forces acting
[in the] morning time,

117
00:24:35,672 --> 00:24:40,904
and they started talking of favouritism.

118
00:24:44,087 --> 00:24:50,062
I could see in the atmosphere the
vibrations were going wrong.

119
00:24:54,477 --> 00:25:01,926
In the evening I took up a very strong,
firm attitude.

120
00:25:06,522 --> 00:25:10,424
I was in a great fury.

121
00:25:12,648 --> 00:25:17,179
I had never gone into such a fury before

122
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,726
and I lashed all of them.

123
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:32,354
Surprisingly, twelve of them got
Realisation,

124
00:25:37,022 --> 00:25:41,269
That was the greatest moment.

125
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:47,529
Then many got, one by one.

126
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:55,868
Three of them who were traveling back,
got Realisation.

127
00:25:56,069 --> 00:26:00,625
Suddenly, in the train, they felt
the vibrations.

128
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:12,342
So the mass evolution started.

129
00:26:16,874 --> 00:26:21,397
Sahasrara is your awareness.

130
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:25,975
When it is enlightened

131
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:34,706
you get into the technique of the Divine.

132
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:39,333
Now there are two techniques:
the technique of the Divine,

133
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:43,664
and the technique that you follow.

134
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:59,449
You cannot act as Divine, but you can use
the Divine power and manoeuvre it.

135
00:27:09,907 --> 00:27:16,184
For example, Divine looks after all
the Universal happenings:

136
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:27,784
every minutest particle is controlled
by Divine.

137
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:35,672
When your Sahasrara opens out

138
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:45,032
and your Kundalini touches the fontanelle
bone,

139
00:27:50,573 --> 00:27:56,876
sort of an igniting force is ready in your
Sahasrara,

140
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:11,559
and as soon as the fontanelle bone area
opens up through the Brahmarandhra,

141
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:24,567
the grace of your Spirit ignites that
igniting force

142
00:28:29,076 --> 00:28:35,190
and your nadis get enlightened;

143
00:28:39,795 --> 00:28:42,484
not all of them,

144
00:28:42,685 --> 00:28:45,256
quite a lot of them;

145
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:49,928
not all the length,

146
00:28:50,747 --> 00:28:54,997
but quite the peripheries.

147
00:28:57,657 --> 00:29:02,329
That’s how you get your enlightenment.

148
00:29:04,188 --> 00:29:07,374
So many things happen

149
00:29:07,575 --> 00:29:14,398
because, also, of your seven centres
being in the Sahasrara.

150
00:29:19,543 --> 00:29:24,226
 With the light you see their relative
positions.

151
00:29:27,554 --> 00:29:35,018
I mean you do not see, but it work
 in your conscious mind.

152
00:29:40,853 --> 00:29:46,473
Your conscious mind feels that integration
within you.

153
00:29:55,632 --> 00:30:03,868
The rationality which is separated from
the heart becomes one with the heart.

154
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:13,562
It becomes one with your attention.

155
00:30:14,597 --> 00:30:18,679
Wherever your attention goes

156
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:23,818
you act in a collective way.

157
00:30:25,295 --> 00:30:31,382
All the activities of your attention are
blessed.

158
00:30:33,463 --> 00:30:39,359
The attention itself is effective.

159
00:30:40,837 --> 00:30:45,775
Your attention is very important,

160
00:30:48,118 --> 00:30:52,631
your desires are even more important.

161
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:04,096
Because it is such an integrated thing,
your desires and your attention become one.

162
00:31:09,354 --> 00:31:12,695
Whatever is good for the Spirit you desire

163
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:20,655
and your attention goes to the thing,
whichever is emitting the Spiritual power.

164
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:32,159
The priorities change very fast.

165
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:40,121
Those people who are primitive and
not evolved

166
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:46,096
may not find that happening

167
00:31:49,551 --> 00:31:53,959
but those who are over mentally developed,

168
00:31:55,668 --> 00:32:01,887
they actually have an attention which
they try to test.

169
00:32:04,492 --> 00:32:08,117
They first want to see how to raise
the Kundalini.

170
00:32:08,318 --> 00:32:12,976
They want to see that it is logical.

171
00:32:20,255 --> 00:32:25,122
For a balanced person there’s no
questioning at all,

172
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,973
we have some people like that among us.

173
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:40,097
They just became and they never questioned.

174
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:46,565
They just settled down.

175
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:53,152
They are innocent, they are intelligent,

176
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:57,593
above all they are spiritual.

177
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,440
But whatever may be the defect
in the quality

178
00:33:02,641 --> 00:33:06,681
can be corrected through your Sahasrara.

179
00:33:11,985 --> 00:33:15,280
First of all you have to put down your ego

180
00:33:15,481 --> 00:33:20,239
because if ego is there it presses
the Sahasrara.

181
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:27,796
Also the super-ego must be reduced

182
00:33:27,997 --> 00:33:34,859
because it also presses the Sahasrara
and gives pain.

183
00:33:40,535 --> 00:33:44,648
So to keep the Sahasrara in its healthy
state

184
00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:52,725
one has to understand that the priorities
are to be changed.

185
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:06,534
Some people take time, so they have to put
some deliberate effort.

186
00:34:11,361 --> 00:34:20,183
There are many books, if you read them,
they suggest anti-God activities.

187
00:34:24,748 --> 00:34:29,074
An enlightened Sahasrara doesn’t like it,

188
00:34:30,822 --> 00:34:33,952
it closes back.

189
00:34:34,153 --> 00:34:37,661
That’s like a poison.

190
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,960
It doesn’t like any poisonous thought
to come in the mind.

191
00:34:48,073 --> 00:34:52,194
If you go about with the poison

192
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,645
then it again closes.

193
00:35:02,115 --> 00:35:09,158
In the same way the people who are hot
tempered, very much hot tempered,

194
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:14,767
and all other problems of the ego,

195
00:35:14,968 --> 00:35:20,532
if they try to suppress the Sahasrara

196
00:35:22,804 --> 00:35:27,257
[then] also the Sahasrara starts closing
down.

197
00:35:27,823 --> 00:35:33,376
Those people who have had conditioning
from wrong gurus,

198
00:35:36,023 --> 00:35:38,984
and wrong books,

199
00:35:39,185 --> 00:35:42,314
from wrong parents maybe,

200
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,778
from a wrong country,

201
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:52,323
from a wrong livelihood

202
00:35:53,436 --> 00:36:00,560
also do not allow the Sahasrara to grow
in it’s healthy way.

203
00:36:05,735 --> 00:36:11,492
It is only the Sahasrara [that] has
to grow, not the Spirit.

204
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:18,258
The more sensitive the Sahasrara is,

205
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:25,803
the more it receives the Spiritual
qualities of the Spirit.

206
00:36:32,796 --> 00:36:37,442
Actually the peace is felt in
the Sahasrara.

207
00:36:39,127 --> 00:36:43,398
The bliss is also felt in the Sahasrara

208
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:50,687
because that is the brain, and the brain
is the epitome of the nervous system,

209
00:36:50,888 --> 00:36:54,914
central nervous system, our consciousness
itself.

210
00:37:01,328 --> 00:37:07,548
So only, merely, by opening Sahasrara,
the work is not done.

211
00:37:13,621 --> 00:37:17,940
We have to have more and more channels

212
00:37:19,425 --> 00:37:25,057
who will act on these nadis with their
different powers,

213
00:37:29,495 --> 00:37:37,010
and who can work it out in a proper
systematic manner.

214
00:37:42,663 --> 00:37:50,480
But those people who indulge into wasteful
habits after Realisation,

215
00:37:55,783 --> 00:38:00,197
obstruct the flow of the nadis,

216
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:08,921
and really are very harmful for the Virata.

217
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:20,353
Such people should really leave Sahaja
Yoga and spare [us].

218
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:31,683
Or such people should be asked to leave
and one should severe relations

219
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:39,518
with such people who is standing against
such a great work of the Divine.

220
00:38:52,225 --> 00:38:55,545
The one who wants to develop on Sahasrara
should know

221
00:38:55,746 --> 00:38:59,882
that he should not have bad company,

222
00:39:04,224 --> 00:39:09,121
but always have the company of the other
sahaja yogis.

223
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:15,821
He should not have his own holidays
and her own time,

224
00:39:16,022 --> 00:39:22,594
but most of the time he should spend in
the company of other sahaja yogis.

225
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:37,189
After the Sahasrara, when you are above
Sahasrara then you can see

226
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:46,534
that it is very important that all these
nadis must be kept together.

227
00:39:58,947 --> 00:40:08,112
And all the centres and the Deities must
be kept awakened and integrated.

228
00:40:16,089 --> 00:40:20,567
This can be done even with a conscious
effort

229
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:27,788
by watching yourself, your thoughts.

230
00:40:30,853 --> 00:40:36,194
You will start seeing your ego and your
superego.

231
00:40:37,537 --> 00:40:44,091
If you are going to see how you cheat
yourself and you are dishonest to yourself,

232
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:54,270
how you are convincing yourself that
you are very good,

233
00:40:57,168 --> 00:41:01,555
how you are enjoying a ego trip.

234
00:41:04,192 --> 00:41:10,561
Sahaja Yoga is for people who are Spirits

235
00:41:17,848 --> 00:41:22,393
so all other things must drop out.

236
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:31,594
All misidentifications must be dropped out.

237
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:39,162
One can do it through conscious mind,
as I said,

238
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:45,850
that you can really correct yourself

239
00:41:52,541 --> 00:42:01,389
because after Realisation whatever you
desire becomes part of the Divine desire

240
00:42:07,678 --> 00:42:13,373
and whatever you do becomes a part
of the Divine action.

241
00:42:16,725 --> 00:42:22,516
So one has to remember that with
conscious effort

242
00:42:22,717 --> 00:42:30,152
we can find out ourselves and see if we
are really honest about it.

243
00:42:34,186 --> 00:42:37,082
If one is honest one can see that
collectivity

244
00:42:37,283 --> 00:42:43,014
is the only way to expand your Sahasrara.

245
00:42:51,142 --> 00:42:55,180
For that tolerance is needed,

246
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,558
wisdom is needed,

247
00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:05,761
and a stature is needed of a prophet,

248
00:43:10,684 --> 00:43:13,531
which you are,

249
00:43:16,438 --> 00:43:20,381
and you should talk like a prophet.

250
00:43:25,057 --> 00:43:29,866
Actually, you have to educate yourself.

251
00:43:34,113 --> 00:43:40,608
How does a prophet speaks? How does
a prophet speak?

252
00:43:41,792 --> 00:43:47,799
This is not insincere or acting

253
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,621
because now you are awakened.

254
00:43:55,321 --> 00:44:02,956
When you are not awakened then whatever
you do like this is artificial.

255
00:44:17,844 --> 00:44:31,218
Sahasrara is the controlling, guiding,
evolving force

256
00:44:38,481 --> 00:44:48,896
and so to keep it absolutely ready for
growth and expansion

257
00:44:54,263 --> 00:45:00,844
one has to watch one’s own growth.

258
00:45:03,798 --> 00:45:08,857
Never justify your wrongdoings.

259
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:20,336
If you start justifying, you are actually
thinking about that.

260
00:45:23,529 --> 00:45:28,106
We have no time to think about oneself.

261
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:36,211
You have to think of others

262
00:45:36,412 --> 00:45:40,058
because others are also in your brain;

263
00:45:42,472 --> 00:45:46,422
and when you start thinking of others,

264
00:45:46,805 --> 00:45:52,579
talking to them about their resurrection,

265
00:45:55,422 --> 00:46:05,298
your Sahasrara will definitely increase
in its size and in its sensibility.

266
00:46:12,244 --> 00:46:15,849
The sensitivity will also increase,

267
00:46:16,796 --> 00:46:19,735
the depth will also come in.

268
00:46:20,912 --> 00:46:26,948
It is just like a tree, when it grows,
its roots spread very strong.

269
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:38,810
So you have to come out of your shells

270
00:46:42,526 --> 00:46:45,978
and spread your wings.

271
00:46:46,741 --> 00:46:52,072
All small things of mind

272
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:58,333
must be given up.

273
00:47:02,033 --> 00:47:09,359
You have to live like a very, huge,
big personality

274
00:47:16,295 --> 00:47:19,877
which has to give support,

275
00:47:20,807 --> 00:47:24,595
guidance, help

276
00:47:24,796 --> 00:47:29,648
and awakening to thousands.

277
00:47:30,725 --> 00:47:37,650
If this Sahasrara Day in France,

278
00:47:40,803 --> 00:47:47,131
establishes a new dynamism

279
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:51,818
in this country,

280
00:47:52,939 --> 00:47:55,456
I am sure

281
00:47:56,307 --> 00:48:02,292
that it will catch up with the thought
of the people.

282
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:14,193
It will resound into their brains,

283
00:48:17,775 --> 00:48:22,672
their unconscious will transmit it into
their being

284
00:48:27,547 --> 00:48:33,112
and they will start thinking afresh.

285
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:42,906
Now, new breakthroughs will take place,

286
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:55,511
and people will start going towards
Truth logically.

287
00:49:00,926 --> 00:49:04,347
They’ll come to right conclusions.

288
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:11,568
They’ll drop out all that is useless and
wasteful.

289
00:49:18,315 --> 00:49:22,962
Sahasrara is the throne for the Spirit

290
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:29,612
and the bigger is the king, the bigger
is the throne.

291
00:49:32,337 --> 00:49:35,468
The way you treat your Spirit

292
00:49:35,669 --> 00:49:41,283
is expressed in through the way you
have your Sahasrara.

293
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:56,665
As it is the seven chakras are seated
in the Sahasrara,

294
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:06,303
you become the master of all these seven
chakras,

295
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:17,972
and that’s how you can do Realisation,
you can give Realisation.

296
00:50:23,943 --> 00:50:28,538
And then you can become a subtle being.

297
00:50:30,095 --> 00:50:34,506
Through your conscious effort,

298
00:50:34,707 --> 00:50:40,864
you can enter the beings of others and
raise their Kundalini and correct them.

299
00:50:46,673 --> 00:50:50,899
Enlightenment of the Sahasrara also gives
you a new sight

300
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:58,253
to see all the sukshmas, all the subtle
things in the atmosphere.

301
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,670
When you start developing higher and
higher,

302
00:51:06,871 --> 00:51:13,016
you can see the vibrations as lights around
you.

303
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:23,489
You may not have any interest in many
things

304
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:31,209
but you’ll be amazed how you become
the master of so many things.

305
00:51:36,425 --> 00:51:42,954
As if your brain is materialising whatever
you have been desiring.

306
00:51:49,313 --> 00:51:58,484
And this is what is Krishna promised, who
is actually the Virata.

307
00:52:04,954 --> 00:52:11,364
So you become the master of your brain

308
00:52:12,493 --> 00:52:17,662
because actually the Spirit is master
of the brain.

309
00:52:19,634 --> 00:52:25,603
The more you start bringing Spirit into
your attention,

310
00:52:25,804 --> 00:52:31,520
the more the Sahasrara increases
in its size.

311
00:52:36,672 --> 00:52:40,974
And the light of that expands

312
00:52:42,032 --> 00:52:47,162
and you become [a] more powerful
sahaja yogi.

313
00:52:50,379 --> 00:52:54,514
This is the greatest thing also for God
Almighty

314
00:52:54,715 --> 00:52:58,883
to see that this has happened,
so that He can,

315
00:52:59,084 --> 00:53:05,286
for the time being, postpone His anger
and wrath;

316
00:53:17,826 --> 00:53:26,269
so that He can forgive human beings
for their mistakes,

317
00:53:31,128 --> 00:53:35,647
their obstinacy

318
00:53:35,848 --> 00:53:40,031
and childish pranks.

319
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:45,934
Let the man rise

320
00:53:47,414 --> 00:53:53,610
to see the glory and the greatness
of his Father.

321
00:53:56,881 --> 00:54:05,126
Let him have so much of power that he
can bear the compassion of God.

322
00:54:15,758 --> 00:54:26,677
Let the Sahasrara develop into such
dimensions that it can execute

323
00:54:26,886 --> 00:54:33,458
the working of the Divine through his own
conscious mind.

324
00:54:43,115 --> 00:54:47,093
The Sahasrara has one mantra, that is
“Nirmala”,

325
00:54:47,294 --> 00:54:52,191
meaning: must keep it clean, pure and
immaculate.

326
00:55:02,651 --> 00:55:06,661
That is what is your job,

327
00:55:08,678 --> 00:55:14,302
is [to] try to keep it pure and clean.

328
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:26,895
And this will definitely mark another step,
another accelerated jump

329
00:55:27,096 --> 00:55:35,811
into a new dimension of many more human
beings.

330
00:55:49,486 --> 00:55:53,728
It is a very great pleasure to be in Paris
today,

331
00:55:53,929 --> 00:55:59,641
so that the whole world attention should
be on Paris,

332
00:55:59,842 --> 00:56:07,146
on France, on this country which is really
being cursed;

333
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:23,376
neglected by all the deities,

334
00:56:24,735 --> 00:56:30,406
because human beings really went very
wrong.

335
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:43,914
Let all the Deities be settled down in this
country

336
00:56:46,717 --> 00:56:51,057
because this is the attention,

337
00:56:54,059 --> 00:57:02,558
and attention, whatever attention we pay,
is reported to us through Sahasrara.

338
00:57:15,066 --> 00:57:21,636
So the Sahasrara of France may be
opened out,

339
00:57:25,558 --> 00:57:32,011
so the attention of France should be
directed towards Spirit,

340
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:37,508
and  towards the eternal life.

341
00:57:38,564 --> 00:57:42,935
Is [a] very important country,

342
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:49,442
that’s why I decided to have this day
celebrated here.

343
00:57:52,975 --> 00:57:59,754
Now the responsibility on the French sahaja
yogis is much greater.

344
00:58:04,605 --> 00:58:08,860
They have to change their methods

345
00:58:09,211 --> 00:58:11,719
and styles.

346
00:58:12,317 --> 00:58:16,422
They should be very mild, gentle

347
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:20,967
and healthy people

348
00:58:23,223 --> 00:58:28,578
but at the same time they should be very
strong sahaja yogis,

349
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,680
so that when others see them

350
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:39,589
[they] find that superiority in them.

351
00:58:43,463 --> 00:58:47,877
Before the Sahasrara day we have had
such a successful session.

352
00:58:48,078 --> 00:58:51,070
I am very happy about you.

353
00:58:56,754 --> 00:59:00,143
May God bless you all.

354
00:59:01,066 --> 00:59:05,361
Now I bless all the other centres,

355
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,711
who have prayed and are praying;

356
00:59:10,912 --> 00:59:16,422
to give them a very developed Sahasrara,

357
00:59:17,551 --> 00:59:20,553
an enlightened one,

358
00:59:20,739 --> 00:59:25,751
that will separate them from their small
shells.

359
00:59:27,633 --> 00:59:31,979
Let them expand so much,

360
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:38,946
that they become one with the whole.

361
00:59:39,147 --> 00:59:42,281
May God bless you all.

362
00:59:49,179 --> 00:59:52,353
May God bless you.

363
00:59:52,992 --> 00:59:55,897
Good (…)
