1
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:30,891
You must put some heated butter
in the nose, all of you.

2
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:32,421
Sahaja Yogi: Inside?

3
00:31:32,421 --> 00:31:35,701
Shri Mataji: Inside, with a dropper, alright?

4
00:31:35,701 --> 00:31:37,631
Heat butter and fill it up.

5
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:43,041
And then, when it is slightly warm, not very
warm, absolutely slightly warm, then put it

6
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:48,141
in your nose, very important, because the-
I don’t know in this country, people, it’s

7
00:31:48,141 --> 00:31:54,151
a very simple thing to be done once in a while,
about say two or three days later or even

8
00:31:54,151 --> 00:31:56,001
every day you do, doesn’t matter.

9
00:31:56,001 --> 00:32:02,631
It’s like putting cream on your hands, you
see, because the cold weather also chaps inside

10
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:04,461
the lining of the nose.

11
00:32:04,461 --> 00:32:12,781
And when you put this, it makes the nose smooth
and you don’t get troubles of it.

12
00:32:12,781 --> 00:32:13,901
It’s very simple.

13
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:17,760
All of you should do, all the Sahaja Yogis
are supposed to do.

14
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,881
There are so many things that a Sahaja Yogis
are supposed to do, one of them is this, that

15
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:25,011
try to keep you Hamsa Chakra alright.

16
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:28,871
By keeping your nose alright you are keeping
your Hamsa Chakra better.

17
00:32:28,871 --> 00:32:35,071
So better use this simple method of heating
some ghee, we call it.

18
00:32:35,071 --> 00:32:41,601
You see, you can prepare it, heat the butter,
keep it in a bottle with a dropper, and heat

19
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:49,781
it in the hot water and then put it in the
nose, just like that, in the night, before

20
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:50,781
sleeping.

21
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:52,141
Even in the ears, we must put olive oil.

22
00:32:52,141 --> 00:32:55,861
It’s very important.

23
00:32:55,861 --> 00:33:00,791
For the teeth also, you must take some salt,
put some olive oil and rub your gums.

24
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:04,050
With that, you won’t have to go to the dentist
anymore.

25
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,255
That’s the best, I’ve never been to a
dentist all my life, and I don’t want you

26
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:09,781
to go to the dentist anymore.

27
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:17,081
So that’s a very good way of rubbing your
gums with vibrated salt and what you call

28
00:33:17,081 --> 00:33:18,281
the olive oil.

29
00:33:18,281 --> 00:33:25,571
Also you must oil your heads, every Saturday,
with so much of oil, nicely, oil it, massage

30
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:28,911
your head and sleep off and next day, wash
up your hair.

31
00:33:28,911 --> 00:33:30,691
You’ll feel very much better.

32
00:33:30,691 --> 00:33:34,421
If any of you cannot give olive oil the best
is almond oil for the head.

33
00:33:34,421 --> 00:33:36,071
You’ll keep very peaceful.

34
00:33:36,071 --> 00:33:40,241
Specially your children, you must massage
them till they’re five years of age, every

35
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:46,461
night, when they go out to sleep in the night,
nicely very- before sleeping.

36
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:49,991
And then put some powder, clean it out, let
them sleep.

37
00:33:49,991 --> 00:33:53,011
Then the children won’t be running and upset
and all that.

38
00:33:53,011 --> 00:33:55,821
They’ll become very quiet children, well-behaved
children.

39
00:33:55,821 --> 00:33:59,431
Because you people don’t massage the children,
all their lives they are jumping.

40
00:33:59,431 --> 00:34:04,651
And all their lives they are slightly violent,
you see, the nose must be smooth out.

41
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:09,390
It’s a very simple method and as you are
Realised people you’ll smooth them much

42
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,390
more.

43
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:12,794
All these small, small things must be taken
care of, you see.

44
00:34:12,794 --> 00:34:18,991
Now if you have too much of cold, if you have
too much of cold, then you can mix up with

45
00:34:18,991 --> 00:34:27,280
a bit of camphor, with oil, and put that in
the nose, little actually, not much, that

46
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,501
also is very good, that also smooth your cold
and puts you right.

47
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:35,851
This country has one big problem with Vishuddhi
chakra everywhere in the West, because of

48
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:36,851
the cold.

49
00:34:36,851 --> 00:34:41,170
And in Sahaja Yoga it is compulsory that you
must wear an undershirt.

50
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,891
It is compulsory.

51
00:34:43,891 --> 00:34:49,701
Whatever may be, it is hot, cold, in India
when it’s steaming hot, you must wear an

52
00:34:49,701 --> 00:34:56,151
undershirt, because, when it is very hot you
start perspiring and that perspiration causes

53
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:57,151
problems.

54
00:34:57,151 --> 00:35:03,401
So, always wear an undershirt, whether you
are in a hot season or in a cold season.

55
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:06,700
That’s a compulsion for Sahaja Yogis that
they must wear.

56
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:13,441
And for all of them, also is compulsory that
they should always wear a muffler when they

57
00:35:13,441 --> 00:35:17,250
go out in the winter time this is an important
thing.

58
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:23,340
And also put some cotton wool in the ears
as I put it.

59
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:27,750
For your sake I’ve told you to put it cause
you are careless, so I look after you but

60
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,841
putting it to my ears like this.

61
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:32,161
You all should put it before going out.

62
00:35:32,161 --> 00:35:38,230
And keep your head covered in the night, when
you sleep, cover your head with something

63
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,230
and then sleep.

64
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:42,871
Because most of the time, your body is all
covered, but the head is not covered.

65
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:47,681
Because now you are Realised-souls and your
Sahastrara is weak, so you must look after

66
00:35:47,681 --> 00:35:48,681
your Sahastrara.

67
00:35:48,681 --> 00:35:52,931
Cover your head so that you won’t have any
problem.

68
00:35:52,931 --> 00:35:56,241
Also you must verify what sort of a person
you are.

69
00:35:56,241 --> 00:36:01,501
If you have a liver problem, you must get
a diet for that, which is here, people will

70
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:02,501
tell you.

71
00:36:02,501 --> 00:36:06,971
If you are left sided person, if you have
left sided problems, then you must know about

72
00:36:06,971 --> 00:36:07,971
the diet that you have to take.

73
00:36:07,971 --> 00:36:13,621
For example, a person who is a left sided
should not take carbohydrates at all, on the

74
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:15,761
contrary should eat proteins, in whatever
form it is possible.

75
00:36:15,761 --> 00:36:20,681
In Sahaja Yoga you know we don’t believe
in vegetarianism or anything, but we do believe

76
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:28,791
that the muscles of bigger animals than us,
are not good for our teeth, or for our body

77
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:35,931
also because the structure of a muscular cell
of a bigger animal is much bigger than ours.

78
00:36:35,931 --> 00:36:40,821
And that’s how they heat up, I mean, even
by mistake if I eat some beef, or anybody

79
00:36:40,821 --> 00:36:47,131
ask me, the other day, my cheeks were swollen
up, so that’s why it happens, it is an automatic

80
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:48,131
reaction.

81
00:36:48,131 --> 00:36:56,531
And we are not supposed to use plastics; in
our clothes, also try to avoid.

82
00:36:56,531 --> 00:37:01,801
Some person, [?] plastic can be used but not
all the time plastics and nylons.

83
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:04,081
And also the food should not be eaten in plastics.

84
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:10,851
You can eat it in paper, paper is alright
because it is –what you call- is wood, it

85
00:37:10,851 --> 00:37:11,921
doesn’t matter.

86
00:37:11,921 --> 00:37:18,481
But you shouldn’t eat in plastic food, plactic
with fork and spoon of plastic and it’s

87
00:37:18,481 --> 00:37:23,241
too much plastic in this country, be careful
because plastic is anti-God.

88
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:28,331
It is anti-human life, it is anti-biological
processes.

89
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:32,871
So avoid plastic as far as possible, be careful
on that.

90
00:37:32,871 --> 00:37:38,031
Also don’t use, I mean, something out of
absolute plastic like, I’ve seen I wanted

91
00:37:38,031 --> 00:37:44,071
to buy one pair of slippers for myself, I
couldn’t get one in the all of New-York.

92
00:37:44,071 --> 00:37:46,451
Because I didn’t want a plastic.

93
00:37:46,451 --> 00:37:50,711
And if you wear that then you develop all
kinds of skin problems and diseases, so be

94
00:37:50,711 --> 00:37:52,181
careful on that.

95
00:37:52,181 --> 00:37:55,331
There are so many other things we have to
be careful about.

96
00:37:55,331 --> 00:38:00,001
And because we have found out that these things
are harmful, that’s why we have made it

97
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:02,731
compulsory that every one of you must be careful.

98
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:09,061
Because now you have become the temple of
God and the temple of God should be healthy.

99
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:15,961
We don’t want tubercular patients to go
around as saints nobody is going to believe

100
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:16,961
them.

101
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,271
Sahaja Yogi: Can you just tell us about sugar.

102
00:38:20,271 --> 00:38:21,561
Shri Mataji: Ah.

103
00:38:21,561 --> 00:38:27,651
Now there is another falsehood about- thank’s
God it’s now broken- that the sugar is against

104
00:38:27,651 --> 00:38:29,551
our growth and all that.

105
00:38:29,551 --> 00:38:34,931
Sugar is very important for attention, specially
people who suffer from liver.

106
00:38:34,931 --> 00:38:38,331
For example, people who are thin, mostly,
suffer from liver trouble.

107
00:38:38,331 --> 00:38:44,171
For them, sugar is so important, that if they
don’t take sugar, they’ll become like

108
00:38:44,171 --> 00:38:49,821
the sugar cane which is, comes out of the
machine, pressing machine, you see.

109
00:38:49,821 --> 00:38:52,001
They’d better take some sugar.

110
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:56,141
Sugar is very important for your liver!

111
00:38:56,141 --> 00:39:00,111
Best carbohydrate is the white sugar, not
the red sugar; red sugar is not good because

112
00:39:00,111 --> 00:39:02,701
it has got molasses, it’s very heating.

113
00:39:02,701 --> 00:39:06,901
Some people have funny ideas here, also about
food.

114
00:39:06,901 --> 00:39:12,201
Like, some of them believe, that if you eat
natural food- and once I got something from

115
00:39:12,201 --> 00:39:15,151
natural store and I got diarrhoea for five
days!

116
00:39:15,151 --> 00:39:20,341
Because it was meant for animals not for human
beings.

117
00:39:20,341 --> 00:39:26,231
Like some people eat, what you call them [Shri
Mataji speaks in Marathi] cotton seed.

118
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:29,001
Now cotton seeds we give only to animals.

119
00:39:29,001 --> 00:39:31,001
I can’t believe it.

120
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:34,551
But I’ve seen in Switzerland, they give
cotton seed in the bread.

121
00:39:34,551 --> 00:39:39,211
There was cotton seeds in the bread, one or
two is alright, but imagine [Shri Mataji speaks

122
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,991
in Hindi] – Laughs from Hindi speakers.

123
00:39:41,991 --> 00:39:44,231
I mean it has to be given to buffalos only!

124
00:39:44,231 --> 00:39:46,351
[Laughter] Like that, I was given a [inaudible]
You see, these are very strong things.

125
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:51,331
In the same way, very soft food is also not
good, we have to be in the centre in everything.

126
00:39:51,331 --> 00:39:56,810
Don’t eat very raw food you see, like some
of the bread in France you know, even in England

127
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:00,611
we find, the bread cereals [inaudible] completely.

128
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:02,951
So that kind of a crispy stuff is not needed.

129
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:10,051
It should be such that your gums are looked
after, there are delicate things, and have

130
00:40:10,051 --> 00:40:13,031
food which is good for you.

131
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:18,051
Don’t go with rationality, don’t go with
the fashion, but whatever is good for you

132
00:40:18,051 --> 00:40:19,051
that should be done.

133
00:40:19,051 --> 00:40:23,821
And you find out about yourself, what is your
temperament, what sort of a food will suit

134
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,991
you, and accordingly you should eat.

135
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:32,171
Of course, everybody is free to do what they
like but we can only advise them that this

136
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:37,191
will suit you and you’ll find out it will
be very useful to all of you, it will help

137
00:40:37,191 --> 00:40:38,191
you.

138
00:40:38,191 --> 00:40:42,181
For your hair growth, also you should get
vibrated oil and use it.

139
00:40:42,181 --> 00:40:45,991
Now, you’ll be surprised that day, somebody
saw Warren and he said: “He is the same

140
00:40:45,991 --> 00:40:46,991
fellow?

141
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:47,991
He looks much younger”.

142
00:40:47,991 --> 00:40:49,131
So I said: “Yes”.

143
00:40:49,131 --> 00:40:53,311
he had a bald head from here to here like
that and now he’s grown hair.

144
00:40:53,311 --> 00:41:00,041
With proper care, you can have you hair quite
intact, for quite some time, if you look after

145
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,041
your hair.

146
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:05,941
But hair is very important is not so much
the look, but it’s Sahastrara.

147
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:13,181
And if you put oil in your Sahastrara every
week, you will have a smooth personality,

148
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:21,401
a smooth behaviour, a smooth movement; you’ll
deal with other people in a gentle manner.

149
00:41:21,401 --> 00:41:22,441
So this is very necessary.

150
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:27,471
In India we actually have a big masseur attached
to a family, you see, he’s a very hefty

151
00:41:27,471 --> 00:41:32,541
fellow, and he comes to masseur [massage]
the men, you see, and he just sits on their

152
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:35,631
body and really finishes them off completely!

153
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:39,091
At the first shot, they’re dead!

154
00:41:39,091 --> 00:41:44,911
Then he uses their body fully and pushes them
and sits on them rub them with one clap!

155
00:41:44,911 --> 00:41:48,611
You see, five, six of them will be jumping
on five, six people.

156
00:41:48,611 --> 00:41:50,411
With clap, they’ll go round.

157
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:53,251
By the time the second clap comes in, the
person is finished!

158
00:41:53,251 --> 00:41:55,261
That’s how, that’s how they manage.

159
00:41:55,261 --> 00:41:58,931
But there is no importance on massage in here,
you see.

160
00:41:58,931 --> 00:42:02,261
And don’t ask a non Sahaja Yogi to massage
you, never.

161
00:42:02,261 --> 00:42:08,891
Don’t allow anybody to touch you that way
because, you see, these people carry all bad

162
00:42:08,891 --> 00:42:10,721
vibrations and you may suffer.

163
00:42:10,721 --> 00:42:16,711
You must allow only the Realised souls to
massage you, if possible, or you yourself

164
00:42:16,711 --> 00:42:17,901
should massage yourself.

165
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:23,501
But don’t go to these masseurs and people
who are massaging all kind of people and they

166
00:42:23,501 --> 00:42:25,951
might be giving you some troubles.

167
00:42:25,951 --> 00:42:31,021
So one has to be very careful about certain
things and certain personal habits also which

168
00:42:31,021 --> 00:42:32,021
we have discussed.

169
00:42:32,021 --> 00:42:37,531
And you can ask Warren, he’ll tell you about
it, which are very important for Mooladhara

170
00:42:37,531 --> 00:42:41,621
and all those things, which must be followed,
whether you are in England, America, anywhere.

171
00:42:41,621 --> 00:42:46,421
These must be followed to keep yourself clean
outside and inside.

172
00:42:46,421 --> 00:42:47,781
Now if you have any question.

173
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:53,021
Sahaja Yogi: I was only wondering about the
kind of techniques that we should use when

174
00:42:53,021 --> 00:42:55,191
massaging the children.

175
00:42:55,191 --> 00:42:56,791
But I guess we can talk about that another
time.

176
00:42:56,791 --> 00:43:01,921
Shri Mataji: I mean, anyway you use is alright,
but always, you put it upwards, you see?

177
00:43:01,921 --> 00:43:07,381
The movement should be upwards, but use oil
otherwise you pull up, you pull up their hair.

178
00:43:07,381 --> 00:43:10,811
So use oil to put it upwards.

179
00:43:10,811 --> 00:43:14,161
Sahaja Yogi: And don’t forget the Sahasrara.

180
00:43:14,161 --> 00:43:16,551
Shri Mataji: Sahasrara, don’t forget.

181
00:43:16,551 --> 00:43:21,361
Sahasrara you must put lot of oil on children.

182
00:43:21,361 --> 00:43:29,321
Sahaja Yogi: Mother we’re gone need more
hairdressers, people who can cut hair, who

183
00:43:29,321 --> 00:43:30,321
are Realised souls, cause they are touching
our Sahastrara while cutting.

184
00:43:30,321 --> 00:43:31,321
Shri Mataji: Yes.

185
00:43:31,321 --> 00:43:32,321
Otherwise you can grow, what’s the harm?

186
00:43:32,321 --> 00:43:33,321
Sahaja Yogi: We can grow our hair Mother?

187
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:35,121
Shri Mataji: Yes here, up to here [below the
ears] you can grow and turn them round.

188
00:43:35,121 --> 00:43:42,541
Shri Mataji: You see, you’ll look like a
philosopher, quite impressive.

189
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:48,691
Shri Mataji: But you should not be a funny
looking person.

190
00:43:48,691 --> 00:43:52,821
That’s one thing very important you see.

191
00:43:52,821 --> 00:43:57,201
You have to, not to adopt some funny methods,
you see?

192
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,441
Like people have.

193
00:43:58,441 --> 00:44:03,491
Specially, nowadays, the fashion is to disable
your hair and keep them absolutely disabled,

194
00:44:03,491 --> 00:44:08,121
there’s no need of doing-
Sahaja Yogi: The hair must be up there, over

195
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:09,121
the forehead.

196
00:44:09,121 --> 00:44:10,121
Shri Mataji: Ah!

197
00:44:10,121 --> 00:44:14,041
It should be keep back over the forehead,
don’t cover your forehead or your eyes,

198
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:15,041
never.

199
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:16,731
Sahaja Yogis: Agnya chakra
Shri Mataji: Ah.

200
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:17,731
Agnya chakra.

201
00:44:17,731 --> 00:44:20,441
You must keep it open, you see, always open.

202
00:44:20,441 --> 00:44:26,241
You must have a centre path if it’s possible,
but keep the forehead open, this is important.

203
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:30,471
You should keep the forehead open, it’s
very good for others you see, and don’t

204
00:44:30,471 --> 00:44:32,680
cover your eyes with any hair.

205
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,861
Many people have a habit of allowing the hair
to come in the eyes and you’ll have [inaudible].

206
00:44:37,861 --> 00:44:42,581
Children also, never allow hair to come on
their eyes.

207
00:44:42,581 --> 00:44:46,801
Then we have something for the eyes also,
what you call Netranjan, I don’t have now

208
00:44:46,801 --> 00:44:51,671
anything, but it’s a very good, simple thing,
cots you nothing about- [Shri Mataji speaks

209
00:44:51,671 --> 00:44:53,421
aside] one cent of a dollar.

210
00:44:53,421 --> 00:44:56,321
Sahaja Yogi: We have some, we can send them
tomorrow.

211
00:44:56,321 --> 00:45:00,971
Shri Mataji: Alright, they have some, they’ll
give you, which is to be applied first very

212
00:45:00,971 --> 00:45:01,971
carefully.

213
00:45:01,971 --> 00:45:07,061
Because if you are not used to it, it will
a little bit burn and the tears will start

214
00:45:07,061 --> 00:45:09,311
coming out of your eyes, it will clear your
eyes.

215
00:45:09,311 --> 00:45:12,930
And you’ll be surprised, with that, if you
use it, you don’t develop these bags [dark

216
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:14,051
circles] and things like that.

217
00:45:14,051 --> 00:45:15,141
And the water flows out.

218
00:45:15,141 --> 00:45:17,251
It’s a very simple thing.

219
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:25,901
And for soap also, try to use natural soaps,
better use, because here the soaps are such

220
00:45:25,901 --> 00:45:27,871
that I don’t know what to say.

221
00:45:27,871 --> 00:45:28,991
Sahaja Yogi: Paramolove Mother?

222
00:45:28,991 --> 00:45:32,631
Paramolove, I think that is about the only
soap you can get here.

223
00:45:32,631 --> 00:45:46,162
Shri Mataji: Yes that is good, Paramolove
is good.

224
00:45:46,162 --> 00:45:47,162
It’s very good.

225
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:48,162
Gap in the video

226
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:52,251
Shri Mataji: What to do, is to take a little
oil, and heat with some clove, Cloves.

227
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:54,081
Sahaja Yogi: Cloves?

228
00:45:54,081 --> 00:45:55,911
Shri Mataji: Cloves.

229
00:45:55,911 --> 00:46:05,481
And let the oil be a little bit cool down,
when it is quite cooled down, nor burning

230
00:46:05,481 --> 00:46:09,621
out at all, but just warm, you can feel it,
then put it in the ears.

231
00:46:09,621 --> 00:46:11,161
Sahaja Yogini: Olive oil is better?

232
00:46:11,161 --> 00:46:12,701
Shri Mataji: Olive oil is alright.

233
00:46:12,701 --> 00:46:13,701
Gap in the video

234
00:46:13,701 --> 00:46:19,051
Sahaja Yogi: Mother can you explain to us
the techniques of vibrated sugar and vibrated

235
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:24,091
salt, by giving vibrations, I don’t quite
understand you see…

236
00:46:24,091 --> 00:46:30,041
Shri Mataji: You see, because God has given
you vibrations, the power is flowing through

237
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:32,301
you now, the vibrations are there.

238
00:46:32,301 --> 00:46:37,591
So whatever you get from outside is touched
by so many people, so many people have created

239
00:46:37,591 --> 00:46:41,441
it and they have got a good mind or may be
something’s wrong with them, best thing

240
00:46:41,441 --> 00:46:43,881
is to give them a bandhan before eating.

241
00:46:43,881 --> 00:46:47,021
[Shri Mataji turns tree times her hand]
Any food you eat you must give it a bandhan

242
00:46:47,021 --> 00:46:52,001
like this three times, so your vibrations
flow into the food and you get it sanctified.

243
00:46:52,001 --> 00:46:57,951
Or else, you can also use your hands for eating
if you have washed your hands, then it’s

244
00:46:57,951 --> 00:46:58,951
alright.

245
00:46:58,951 --> 00:47:04,121
Or else, if you are taking the water, you
can just put your hands there, then it gets

246
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:05,451
vibrated, then drink it.

247
00:47:05,451 --> 00:47:09,481
Because, the thing is, the vibrations have
started flowing through your hands, but still

248
00:47:09,581 --> 00:47:12,941
have not spread to your body fully.

249
00:47:13,001 --> 00:47:15,581
You see my point?
