1
00:00:07,134 --> 00:00:10,074
So first, open your heart,

2
00:00:11,201 --> 00:00:14,140
“Mother, please come in my heart.”

3
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:19,636
All right, you say that.

4
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:21,503
It’s better.

5
00:00:26,357 --> 00:00:31,077
It’s very simple way and I’m at your disposal.

6
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:37,477
You see, it happens because of the past,

7
00:00:37,557 --> 00:00:40,235
because people have been unkind to you,

8
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:42,788
maybe that you have not forgiven them.

9
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:45,263
It can happen with anything

10
00:00:45,343 --> 00:00:49,731
and that makes you feel so closed, isn’t it?

11
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:53,984
Because of the experiences you have had of other

12
00:00:54,064 --> 00:00:55,701
and you cannot forgive them.

13
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:59,261
If you can’t forgive them, then 
you become like that, your heart is closed,

14
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:02,716
you can never be happy, you are very critical of others.

15
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,757
All these things come with a closed heart.

16
00:01:05,837 --> 00:01:07,401
You cannot feel happy yourself.

17
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:09,436
You don’t make others happy.

18
00:01:09,516 --> 00:01:12,939
Now how do you open your heart is

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,424
just to feel for everyone,

20
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:19,959
think about others.

21
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:26,314
See now, when I travel I always buy 
presents for people here and there

22
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:33,144
and went to Poland

23
00:01:33,225 --> 00:01:37,231
and there was one shop I use to always buy things from there

24
00:01:37,312 --> 00:01:42,454
for all the Sahaja Yogis and the third time I went the lady said,

25
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:45,016
“You are a very, very noble person.”

26
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:45,998
“Why?”

27
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:48,142
“You don’t buy anything for yourself.

28
00:01:48,222 --> 00:01:52,363
You buy only for others all the time. Never for yourself. ”

29
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:56,836
I never think about Myself, but you people think for Me,

30
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,521
I don’t think for Myself.

31
00:02:00,813 --> 00:02:03,895
Wherever it is, whatever it is, is all right.

32
00:02:04,162 --> 00:02:07,234
To Me it doesn’t matter

33
00:02:07,315 --> 00:02:12,124
where I live, how I live, what I eat, what – I don’t care.

34
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:15,079
There’s no time to think well, they’re thinking of others,

35
00:02:15,192 --> 00:02:18,456
you have no time to think about yourself, Isn’t it?

36
00:02:19,058 --> 00:02:20,755
That how it works out.

37
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:26,704
You think about others, immediately now, 
a very small thing like that

38
00:02:26,785 --> 00:02:31,957
you see, I’ll tell you, 
once I’d gone to a shop to buy some things

39
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:35,823
for ladies and I was buying some saris.

40
00:02:43,075 --> 00:02:45,626
Alright. There I was buying saris

41
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:50,366
and I bought these saris and took the saris out of the...

42
00:02:50,446 --> 00:02:53,693
I bought these saris and I was quite happy about it.

43
00:02:53,993 --> 00:02:59,361
Nice saris are there and I had to distribute 
to whom should I do this and do that.

44
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:02,006
I was just thinking.

45
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:08,292
I just forgot that I have to buy a sari 
for Myself because there’s a Puja.

46
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:12,165
Just forgot about it completely.

47
00:03:12,246 --> 00:03:14,266
And later on it came into My head,

48
00:03:14,346 --> 00:03:20,349
“My God, now there’s no sari for Puja. Now what?”

49
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:24,437
I was quite worried about it.

50
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:30,668
It never comes to Me that

51
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:33,899
“I need this” or “I need that. I need food.”

52
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:38,272
Unless until you say, ‘Will you have food?’ 
I will not say bring food.

53
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:41,011
It doesn’t come to Me.

54
00:03:42,037 --> 00:03:46,691
And you’ll be amazed that 
when I reached the place, you see

55
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:50,163
– it was a Diwali celebrated in Switzerland –

56
00:03:52,256 --> 00:03:57,978
I opened the thing and there was a sari 
which I’d bought before,

57
00:03:58,058 --> 00:04:02,036
sometimes, an absolutely new with everything,

58
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,845
so surprised. I said, “How did I have it?

59
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:08,033
How do I have it so?”

60
00:04:08,113 --> 00:04:12,573
Just couldn’t imagine! I had not put 
this sari there, it was kept somewhere.

61
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,633
I was quite amazed, how did I have the sari,

62
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,453
They were so upset: 
"No sari, Mother what to do?

63
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:20,394
Here it is!

64
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,541
So when you think about others, you see,

65
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:27,857
this Divine Power thinks about you.

66
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:32,817
But when you thinking about yourself, 
you are extremely miserable, horrible person.

67
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,400
Nobody likes you.

68
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:37,226
Nobody wants to talk to you and have anything to do with you

69
00:04:37,307 --> 00:04:39,679
because you’re so much concerned about yourself,

70
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:44,666
and but when you think about others – small, small things,

71
00:04:44,746 --> 00:04:46,988
very small things.

72
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:49,875
Another thing happened then,

73
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:54,415
that once I went with My daughter to a shop

74
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:59,962
and I liked one sari very much, I thought it’s good

75
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:03,234
for the evening we have Puja program,

76
00:05:03,314 --> 00:05:06,021
but I’m rather miserly about Myself, so

77
00:05:06,102 --> 00:05:10,872
I said no, better not, it’s rather expensive,
why to buy it, so I came out.

78
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:14,558
And it was all right.

79
00:05:14,638 --> 00:05:18,648
Then after some time, you see,

80
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:23,122
I think it was some occasion,

81
00:05:23,216 --> 00:05:29,022
so My daughter brought the same sari 
and she gave it to Me.

82
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:31,279
And I was very much touched.

83
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:35,689
You see, because I didn’t buy because I was feeling 
– I’m a miserly person that way.

84
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:38,538
So she bought it for Me and she gave it to Me.

85
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:40,810
And she said, ‘You see what is this sari?’

86
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:42,824
“Oh, my God,” I said.

87
00:05:42,904 --> 00:05:48,290
I mean, it’s very subtle understanding 
of expression of love.

88
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:51,783
I can afford this sari, she can also,

89
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:54,767
but the way she went at the same day

90
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:57,713
when I came home, she went 
and bought the sari, kept it

91
00:05:57,806 --> 00:06:00,993
because she thought that it would be sold out.

92
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:05,430
Because she liked the sari,  so she bought it.

93
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:07,351
That’s how you can suggest.

94
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:10,643
Like once we had a big dinner in our house

95
00:06:10,723 --> 00:06:14,250
and my another daughter had given Me 
a sari as a present.

96
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,297
They give sometimes.

97
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:21,123
So that day I wore that sari and she was in tears.

98
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:23,236
She said you have so many beautiful saris,

99
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:25,202
of all the things, you wore this sari.

100
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:28,036
“Because, I said, you are coming for dinner, so

101
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:29,983
I thought it’s better to wear it.”

102
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:33,669
‘How do you remember, Mummy, that I gave you this?’

103
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:39,189
It’s just a subtle – now see, 
this is just matter. Sari is a matter.

104
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:40,869
You see, it’s just a matter,

105
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:45,335
but through that matter how you can express love.

106
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:54,097
I always give a simile of a glass mean 
applied with metal.

107
00:06:54,177 --> 00:06:56,564
It becomes a mirror.

108
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:01,189
In the same way, if you can apply your feelings

109
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:05,396
to any matter it becomes like a mirror. Anything.
