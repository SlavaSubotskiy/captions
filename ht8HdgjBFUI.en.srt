1
00:00:02,477 --> 00:00:06,255
[A little child calls loudly:
“Mataji! Jai!”.]

2
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:20,953
Today's Puja we have arranged of Durga
or the Kali.

3
00:00:21,326 --> 00:00:30,301
That is the destroying form of the Goddess
of all the evil and negativity.

4
00:00:30,502 --> 00:00:34,719
This we had to do it in France,

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:43,128
because I feel very strongly that day
by day, in general,

6
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:48,185
France is going down and down and down.

7
00:00:48,386 --> 00:00:50,673
While you people are coming up,

8
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:56,036
the rest of the France is in the most
pitiable condition.

9
00:00:56,237 --> 00:01:02,178
Firstly, as you understand, is the Catholic
church,

10
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:07,564
which - perhaps you are not aware of,
perhaps maybe -

11
00:01:07,765 --> 00:01:13,054
because you don't read any other languages,

12
00:01:13,255 --> 00:01:19,004
you just read French compulsorily
by this country.

13
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:26,496
So you have no international views
or international news

14
00:01:26,697 --> 00:01:35,029
that this Catholic church has done
so many horrible things in the past,

15
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:40,959
that is unbelievable that they have
anything to do with God.

16
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:51,192
They burnt many cardinals in the hearth -
roasted them.

17
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:58,110
Not only that, they killed so many people

18
00:01:58,311 --> 00:02:02,260
who ever tried to utter a word about them.

19
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:07,120
They were much worse than Muslim people.

20
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:12,276
They went to other countries like South
America, America -

21
00:02:12,477 --> 00:02:19,841
all these places they're all Catholics -
even our country.

22
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:28,047
And they killed millions and millions
of people.

23
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:35,713
Now as this is Kruta Yuga that has started,

24
00:02:35,914 --> 00:02:39,060
one of the things as I said yesterday
is that:

25
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:43,635
you will have to pay for whatever you
have done,

26
00:02:43,836 --> 00:02:48,236
on mass scale or individual scale.

27
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:53,994
If that is the case,

28
00:02:54,195 --> 00:02:58,380
then one must know that France has to pay
a lot

29
00:02:58,581 --> 00:03:04,094
and this Catholic church has to pay more.

30
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:09,764
Catholic church has just taken out yarns
out of their heads

31
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:14,963
and started a theory of original sin.

32
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:20,237
That's how to condemn every other
Incarnation, every other Prophet -

33
00:03:20,438 --> 00:03:22,946
that they were all with original sin.

34
00:03:23,147 --> 00:03:26,179
And even they said Mary was born with
original sin,

35
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,727
for many popes they were discussing it.

36
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:38,598
This shows that this whole hocus-pocus
religion of Catholic church

37
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:45,556
had to establish itself by forcing people,
by torturing them,

38
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:53,084
by taking all their ideas into their
own control,

39
00:03:53,285 --> 00:03:58,521
give them funny ideas like original sin.

40
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:05,898
Another is that you must confess, giving
them the left Vishuddhis.

41
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,425
They treated women as nothing

42
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:15,758
and to Mother of Mary they called Her
a woman.

43
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,611
And this Paul, as I told you yesterday,
is a fact.

44
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:23,844
Now it's necessary for Sahaja Yogis
to understand

45
00:04:24,045 --> 00:04:32,902
how this Catholic church is so dangerous
and has been doing such harm.

46
00:04:33,103 --> 00:04:37,747
As there has been so many books about it -

47
00:04:37,948 --> 00:04:43,610
that you people don't read, because
it's not in French.

48
00:04:44,103 --> 00:04:50,100
There are English books from America -
you must learn English.

49
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:54,159
It's very important now I feel, that
all the French must know English,

50
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,243
they must read English.

51
00:04:57,444 --> 00:05:02,384
French will not give you the international
personality

52
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:06,421
that you are supposed to acquire.

53
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:10,323
You had some scholarship, not much.

54
00:05:10,524 --> 00:05:13,858
The real scholarship comes from England

55
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:21,811
and also from America in English language,
and also from India.

56
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:27,347
One gentleman who tried to translate
all these things in UNESCO,

57
00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:31,003
he was thrown out by your media.

58
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:36,184
Your media is taking full advantage that
you don't read any other newspapers;

59
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:39,743
they are doing whatever they feel like.

60
00:05:39,944 --> 00:05:47,384
All kinds of scandals, all kinds
of sensationalization -

61
00:05:47,585 --> 00:05:51,522
whatever they want to write, they write
in free press.

62
00:05:51,723 --> 00:05:57,006
On one side there's suppression of natural
life of human beings,

63
00:05:57,207 --> 00:06:00,381
let them to go to Freud.

64
00:06:00,582 --> 00:06:04,084
When Freud is the dirtiest man you
could think of,

65
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:07,452
who has put his ideas into your head.

66
00:06:07,653 --> 00:06:14,407
But as if you are already brainwashed
people that you accepted all that.

67
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:18,647
How could you accept Freud? If Freud
had come to India,

68
00:06:18,848 --> 00:06:21,753
they would have killed him in no time!

69
00:06:21,954 --> 00:06:25,840
What happens is that, somehow or other -
I don't know what is the reason,

70
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:30,445
I don't know where to place it, but
the wisdom is not there.

71
00:06:30,646 --> 00:06:34,251
There is no maturity, there is no wisdom.

72
00:06:34,452 --> 00:06:39,068
America I can understand because it is only
two-three hundred years old.

73
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:43,291
But what about the French? They have
not been able

74
00:06:43,492 --> 00:06:48,336
to mature but they have become extremely
frivolous.

75
00:06:48,537 --> 00:06:51,839
Maturity is finished.

76
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:58,791
One of the reasons could be that they want
that you should be always young.

77
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:05,364
In India, young people are called
as stupid:

78
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:11,933
you call it gadha pachisi, means
at twenty-five years they are donkeys.

79
00:07:12,134 --> 00:07:17,981
They are never regarded as sensible people
to be followed.

80
00:07:18,576 --> 00:07:25,809
And gradually by this movement from
Catholic church to Freud,

81
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:29,737
what has happened that you haven't got
your own personality

82
00:07:29,938 --> 00:07:34,531
to understand what is right and what is
wrong.

83
00:07:34,732 --> 00:07:38,120
Of course, I must say Sahaja Yogis must
have done lots of punyas

84
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:43,783
and must be very courageous people to be
born in this country.

85
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:47,923
Otherwise I don't know how you could have
taken your birth here.

86
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:56,687
The law is so funny that they said it
depends on the mood of the magistrate,

87
00:07:56,888 --> 00:08:03,616
As if, you see, the magistrate doesn't
know the law.

88
00:08:04,212 --> 00:08:08,599
Such a stupid country in modern times
I've never known.

89
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,269
Nowhere in the world there's such a stupid
law as it is here.

90
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,527
Of course, in America, there is no justice,
they do what they like.

91
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:22,206
But here is so-called modern people.

92
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:26,615
What is their condition is that they have
no sense of law.

93
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:29,293
If you ask them, "What is the law?"
They don't care.

94
00:08:29,494 --> 00:08:32,134
It's the mood of the magistrate.

95
00:08:32,335 --> 00:08:36,539
Now supposing he has had a big drink
in the last night,

96
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,154
second day he comes with a hangover,
so finished.

97
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:48,410
And then he will be very much biased
towards the drunkards only.

98
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:56,695
So, here it is becoming such a horrible
society

99
00:08:56,896 --> 00:09:04,022
that Indians would be shocked, beyond
doubt, but nothing but prostitution.

100
00:09:09,203 --> 00:09:13,247
To see and to be seen.

101
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:15,801
Why?

102
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:18,782
Every woman has to dress up in such a way

103
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:25,665
that she should be attractive, for what?
Is she a prostitute?

104
00:09:28,211 --> 00:09:34,844
All kinds of bathroom cultures developed.

105
00:09:35,045 --> 00:09:41,189
For example French bath, you know what
it means, all over the world.

106
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:47,749
It's a very dirty habit of laziness,
it comes because of drinking.

107
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,579
If you drink too much, next morning you
are so lethargic

108
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,169
that you take just a French bath and
go away.

109
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,873
So, please try to remember as French
Sahaja Yogis,

110
00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:04,583
that your task is much more difficult
than the task of other countries,

111
00:10:04,784 --> 00:10:12,905
because it lacks completely wisdom.

112
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:18,783
Neither you'll find in your institutions,
nor in your government,

113
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:26,617
nor in any education.

114
00:10:27,152 --> 00:10:32,053
It's lacking wisdom completely.

115
00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:37,391
And to have wisdom, according to these
Freudian people,

116
00:10:37,592 --> 00:10:41,659
is that you are egoistical!

117
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:49,491
They have such funny ideas from the yarn
of Mr. Freud

118
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:54,666
that no sensible man would accept.

119
00:10:55,872 --> 00:11:01,593
But people have lost their senses,
and like blotting paper,

120
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:11,957
whatever is filthy, destructive, horrible,
subhuman, they try to absorb.

121
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:17,133
Supposed to be Christian nation.

122
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:25,171
Please, all Sahaja Yogis must understand:

123
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:31,447
You must get hold of books and find out,
where are we?

124
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:36,000
I worked very hard in France, you know
that very well.

125
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:39,251
I used to think, this is the gate of hell.

126
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:43,215
But it is much worse than that,

127
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:48,487
it's a mire of filth and you are born here

128
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:55,045
and you have become like lotuses,
so fragrant and beautiful.

129
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:58,002
You'll have to fight it out:

130
00:11:58,203 --> 00:12:01,142
I am always with you, all My powers
with you.

131
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:04,517
But remember that you have to fight
the society,

132
00:12:04,718 --> 00:12:10,262
you have to save so many people, you have
to rescue them.

133
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,955
Children are given liberty, "Do what
you like."

134
00:12:15,156 --> 00:12:18,209
They have no sense of liberty!

135
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,859
Supposing there's an aeroplane,

136
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,862
which was not fixed properly and made
to fly.

137
00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:27,349
What will happen to the aeroplane?

138
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:33,851
If the children are given liberty without
the right sense of their duty

139
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:38,793
and the right sense about themselves,
what will happen to them?

140
00:12:38,994 --> 00:12:46,151
Why children are born to parents?
It is to get spoiled,

141
00:12:46,352 --> 00:12:51,663
to have liberty or to get some guidance?

142
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:55,568
You cannot guide your children.

143
00:12:55,769 --> 00:13:01,338
They are so rude, they are so arrogant.

144
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:07,394
They have gone off, completely.

145
00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:11,307
You know for one month we had to struggle
with these western children

146
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,736
and we had come to the point of urge
of closing down that school

147
00:13:14,937 --> 00:13:19,046
because they were really violent children,

148
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:22,247
as if coming from some jungle.

149
00:13:22,454 --> 00:13:26,505
Even the jungle animals have some sense.

150
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:31,171
So you have to think about your children.

151
00:13:31,372 --> 00:13:34,728
What's going to happen to your children?

152
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:38,819
What is going to be their situation?

153
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:45,135
If they are going to live in the same
manner in this dirt,

154
00:13:45,336 --> 00:13:52,610
these children will turn out to be waste,
just a waste!

155
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:58,714
They will have no education, no character,
no personality,

156
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:08,654
they'll end up with AIDS or with drugs
or something like that.

157
00:14:08,855 --> 00:14:15,026
I do not see any future for the children
of France, no future.

158
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:23,614
And you have to fight that, "We want
to have future for our children,

159
00:14:23,815 --> 00:14:26,474
we don't want them to be ruined."

160
00:14:26,675 --> 00:14:30,691
And you must have courage to fight it.

161
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:35,202
It's very important to have courage.

162
00:14:35,403 --> 00:14:40,494
If you do not have the courage, you cannot
fight it.

163
00:14:40,695 --> 00:14:46,761
And today's Puja is to give that courage
in your hearts.

164
00:14:46,962 --> 00:14:52,841
See it all around you, what's happening?

165
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:56,764
You are all nicely enjoying yourself
in the realm of God,

166
00:14:56,965 --> 00:14:58,863
you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

167
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:03,345
But what about the rest of the people?

168
00:15:03,563 --> 00:15:08,474
The majority of the people, where are they
going?

169
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:25,787
What is going to be the future of this
horrible Mooladhara place?

170
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:33,150
Now Freud has been discovered
as a fraudulent man,

171
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:36,264
and now there are books after so many
years,

172
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:40,444
when he has already ruined the people
all over the world.

173
00:15:40,645 --> 00:15:45,125
But the worst of all, they have ruined
here.

174
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:51,988
It's a responsibility specially
of the women I think,

175
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:56,034
because they are responsible for
the society.

176
00:15:56,235 --> 00:16:01,611
The society of France has gone to dogs

177
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:08,227
and for you to now take up upon yourself

178
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:14,861
to talk against this kind of anarchy

179
00:16:15,062 --> 00:16:20,472
that is working out the destruction
of your families.

180
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:30,769
If the women decide, I am sure, they
can very, very easily work it out.

181
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:36,039
Instead of asking for liberation
nonsensical,

182
00:16:36,615 --> 00:16:41,264
you better ask for the ascent of this
country.

183
00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:44,626
I know, I've worked very hard and you are
all there.

184
00:16:44,827 --> 00:16:47,619
I am very happy to see that you all
are there

185
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:59,474
to fulfill the desires of the Divine.

186
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:05,400
Because now you should know in a very
big way,

187
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:11,432
masses of masses of people will be
destroyed.

188
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:19,651
Not from without but from within.

189
00:17:21,385 --> 00:17:27,335
Suddenly you'll hear so many millions
disappear with this disease.

190
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:36,296
Also you must protect yourself, all of you:

191
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:44,014
always give yourself a bandhan; always
lead a clean life.

192
00:17:44,215 --> 00:17:50,441
There are certain hygienic rules of Sahaja
Yoga, please try to follow them.

193
00:17:50,642 --> 00:17:53,814
Do not neglect it.

194
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:58,034
If somebody gets AIDS, you'll not have him
in Sahaja Yoga,

195
00:17:58,235 --> 00:18:02,684
whatever may be the conditions, whatever
may be the reason.

196
00:18:04,777 --> 00:18:10,177
You have to be very careful, also I would
say never treat a AIDS patient.

197
00:18:10,378 --> 00:18:12,963
Like the one yesterday who was arguing
with Me,

198
00:18:13,164 --> 00:18:17,280
actually because they have only two types
of people:

199
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:24,507
one who are arrogant and another one
which always

200
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:31,519
think that it's better they should die.
They have no will to live.

201
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,238
So there are only two types of people,
either right-sided or left-sided.

202
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:40,995
And they can never ascend. We have tried,
we have tried.

203
00:18:41,196 --> 00:18:44,305
Of course, one person is living
for the last seven years,

204
00:18:44,543 --> 00:18:49,950
but still he has no faith in himself.

205
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:55,456
Maybe next generation might be better on,
if they come back.

206
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:59,825
But as far as this generation is concerned,

207
00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:04,781
you should know your responsibility
is very great.

208
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:09,725
All the Sahaja Yogis must take a vow

209
00:19:09,926 --> 00:19:14,762
that they'll fight this society and try
to save their country

210
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:20,528
and their countrymen from a complete
disaster.

211
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:24,097
There is going to be no war,

212
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:29,365
only they will fight themselves and die.

213
00:19:31,341 --> 00:19:33,622
It's a very serious matter.

214
00:19:33,823 --> 00:19:39,199
For that, we decided to have this Puja
of Durga today

215
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,668
that all negativity should be destroyed.

216
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:50,875
So many Deities build up the body of Kali.

217
00:19:51,076 --> 00:19:56,592
Every part of Her body was created
by a Deity, looked after by a Deity,

218
00:19:56,793 --> 00:20:04,577
and is also, later on, is reflected
in you all.

219
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:10,845
So they say that God has made human beings
in His own image,

220
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:14,667
I would say, I've made you in My own
image,

221
00:20:14,868 --> 00:20:19,781
all the Deities at your disposal.

222
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:24,279
They're all with you, and they have created
you - if you see it minutely -

223
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,769
it is the Deities who have brought forth
all the beauty that you had.

224
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:39,568
They have made all this beautiful
congregation, beautiful transformation,

225
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:47,424
and they have created such angelic people
out of you.

226
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,696
They are always working it out,

227
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:56,370
but one thing you have to do is to have
the drive.

228
00:20:56,571 --> 00:21:01,722
You had pure desire to ascend, but
for what?

229
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:06,354
You want to have the light, but for what?

230
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:10,501
You want to become gurus, for what?

231
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:15,295
To save people, for their salvation.

232
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:18,939
Only through your channels I can work out
Sahaja Yoga.

233
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,371
If I could work out Myself, I would have.

234
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:27,129
It's not question of killing one rakshasa.

235
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:32,245
God knows how many there are, rakshasas
and rakshasas.

236
00:21:32,446 --> 00:21:38,452
And they are everywhere, even within you
they were.

237
00:21:38,653 --> 00:21:42,149
Now they have gone away.

238
00:21:45,493 --> 00:21:51,283
So you have to do full justice to Sahaja
Yoga, that's very important.

239
00:21:51,484 --> 00:21:54,478
I knew the puja would be very late,
because Kali's puja

240
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:01,042
is always done in the night, after twelve.
So it had to be this way.

241
00:22:01,243 --> 00:22:03,677
Though last night I slept at four o'clock
and I,  tonight,

242
00:22:03,878 --> 00:22:10,873
I don't know what time I will sleep -
it all works out. It's all worked out.

243
00:22:11,074 --> 00:22:14,124
But you have to have deliberations
and you have to think,

244
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:16,937
“What can we do to change this?”

245
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:23,928
Why not write some books, why not write
some experiences?

246
00:22:24,129 --> 00:22:29,647
Get them published in French only. Let
the French know what’s happening outside.

247
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:34,000
Get some of the books translated –

248
00:22:35,362 --> 00:22:41,616
some American books, some English books.
At least give quotations from there.

249
00:22:41,817 --> 00:22:45,971
How they are unaware. First this Catholic
church has to go away.

250
00:22:46,172 --> 00:22:52,404
It will, no doubt, I am sure about it.
They are literally frightened of us.

251
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:04,956
And we have to now really show them
what we are capable of.

252
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:14,760
And the funniest thing is that a president
has chosen

253
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:17,328
his lady-friend as the prime minister.

254
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:24,523
I mean, it’s not possible in any sensible
country. It’s never heard of.

255
00:23:24,724 --> 00:23:29,865
I must say, English are thousand times
better.

256
00:23:30,753 --> 00:23:33,191
They are really very good.

257
00:23:33,392 --> 00:23:37,251
At least, as far as administration
is concerned,

258
00:23:37,452 --> 00:23:41,414
as far as their parliament is concerned,
the justice is not stupid like this,

259
00:23:41,615 --> 00:23:46,549
it’s based on law, not based on the mood
of a magistrate.

260
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,052
How you are still continuing with such
stupidity

261
00:23:50,253 --> 00:23:54,969
which are really even before medieval age:

262
00:23:55,170 --> 00:24:01,073
primitive, people are absolutely primitive
to accept such laws.

263
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:09,193
At least you can write a book about
the strange laws of French, one title.

264
00:24:13,403 --> 00:24:17,034
How it has harmed. There is a very nice
book, “Fraudulent Freud”.

265
00:24:17,235 --> 00:24:21,617
Please read that, and see how Freud
has ruined the French,

266
00:24:21,818 --> 00:24:25,251
how their brains are twisted, how they
have twisted ideas.

267
00:24:25,452 --> 00:24:29,650
You are all so intelligent, clever people.

268
00:24:32,023 --> 00:24:39,386
So if not with the sword, Kali has to work
through the pen.

269
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:52,407
I never knew it was in that bad shape,
though I knew it was.

270
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:59,033
So this is a challenge for all of us,

271
00:24:59,234 --> 00:25:06,314
and let Me see what you can write, all
of you, put together your experience:

272
00:25:06,515 --> 00:25:09,845
how the French parents behave, how
the grandparents behave,

273
00:25:10,046 --> 00:25:14,286
what’s happening in this country and
all that.

274
00:25:19,588 --> 00:25:23,781
They are living in fool’s paradise.

275
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:34,139
They don’t know how destruction is just
hanging over their heads.

276
00:25:37,952 --> 00:25:43,173
Though you are all saved, but you have
to think of others,

277
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:50,859
that is what Sahaja Yoga is, that is not
only that we care for the bhaktas –

278
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:59,499
like Kali just wanted to protect
the bhaktas, the sadhakas.

279
00:26:00,237 --> 00:26:09,231
But you have to protect many, many more
people.

280
00:26:09,432 --> 00:26:16,170
You have all the powers, just assume them
and use them.

281
00:26:17,972 --> 00:26:20,926
You can do it.

282
00:26:21,127 --> 00:26:24,486
Your media is the worst of all

283
00:26:24,687 --> 00:26:28,978
and we can start a newspaper also calling
it anti-media.

284
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:32,402
What can they do to us?

285
00:26:32,603 --> 00:26:37,800
Or some sort of an independent name,
we can give it.

286
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:41,921
And it should be open for people who
are suffering

287
00:26:42,122 --> 00:26:48,560
from media sensationalization.
They can write:

288
00:26:48,761 --> 00:26:52,555
how the media is harming them, how they
are giving false reports and things.

289
00:26:52,756 --> 00:26:55,882
We can! Why not?

290
00:26:58,954 --> 00:27:02,183
I am sure it will work out.

291
00:27:03,764 --> 00:27:08,768
Think it over what you can do with
your pen.

292
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,877
Whatever you have gained, whatever you
are enjoying: beautiful music,

293
00:27:17,078 --> 00:27:20,574
all the Pujas, everything. But think
of others.

294
00:27:20,775 --> 00:27:27,268
They are already drunk and tossing
their heads on their pillows.

295
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:33,603
Think of them. They, when will they feel
this joy?

296
00:27:33,822 --> 00:27:36,447
I simply feel pity for them

297
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:41,006
that they should have taken to all these
bad things,

298
00:27:41,207 --> 00:27:43,208
because of the suppression of the Catholic
church.

299
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:45,616
It’s the Catholic church which has
suppressed them,

300
00:27:45,817 --> 00:27:48,978
that’s why they have come to this.
No other way –

301
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:53,617
reason why they should accept this kind
of thing.

302
00:27:57,906 --> 00:28:02,633
In Sahaja Yoga, we do not do all these
things, we are in the centre.

303
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:06,855
We do not have this kind of problems,
because we don’t suppress anyone,

304
00:28:07,056 --> 00:28:11,180
nor do we go to the other extreme
of indulgences.

305
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:14,830
I think the whole Europe can be divided
into two types of people:

306
00:28:15,031 --> 00:28:19,197
one are Anglo-Saxons, and others are
Latins.

307
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:24,291
Anglo-Saxons are right-sided and the Latins
are left-sided:

308
00:28:24,492 --> 00:28:31,888
they cry, weep, miserable, they indulge
into dirt and filth.

309
00:28:32,517 --> 00:28:35,586
Just these two types they are.

310
00:28:35,787 --> 00:28:41,446
Now unluckily you are in the Latin side.

311
00:28:42,204 --> 00:28:48,555
So here, Catholic church is prospering.

312
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:54,641
Now, if you see to the Latin side and
understand

313
00:28:54,842 --> 00:28:58,223
to what extent they have gone to the left
side,

314
00:28:58,424 --> 00:29:03,515
and getting to the left side what diseases
you get, very nicely,

315
00:29:03,716 --> 00:29:07,009
make a list of them.

316
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:11,682
So what I said will work out in France:

317
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:15,701
the left-sided incurable diseases.

318
00:29:15,902 --> 00:29:19,476
As it is, you walk on the street, you find
at least three, four

319
00:29:19,677 --> 00:29:24,908
mad people, lunatic people walking,
you’ll find them.

320
00:29:25,711 --> 00:29:30,456
Very simple it is. You don’t have to go
to the lunatic asylum, on the street!

321
00:29:30,657 --> 00:29:36,326
They’ll be all talking and saying things,
but it’s all there.

322
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:39,964
“That’s why they drink, that’s why they
are miserable.”.

323
00:29:40,164 --> 00:29:45,725
I do not know what are the statistics
of the diseases.

324
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:54,970
So the problem is extremely grave,
very grave.

325
00:29:55,171 --> 00:29:58,488
And you have to work it out,

326
00:29:58,689 --> 00:30:03,604
with the gravity of your Gurupada which
you have asked Me the other day –

327
00:30:03,805 --> 00:30:09,551
you asked for the status of a guru,
for ladies as well as for men.

328
00:30:09,752 --> 00:30:14,307
And I said, “All right, start!”

329
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,867
I hope you all have heard the song
I’ve made, for asking.

330
00:30:21,068 --> 00:30:23,498
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]

331
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:25,282
All right, once they will sing that song.

332
00:30:25,483 --> 00:30:27,779
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]

333
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:38,392
They will sing that song to you. There are
different requests from the Mother,

334
00:30:38,593 --> 00:30:42,756
and in this the last one is that: “Mother,
now you give us

335
00:30:42,957 --> 00:30:47,117
the Gurupada, the status of a guru.”

336
00:30:47,318 --> 00:30:52,866
But every guru has a duty: to cleanse
the society in which he lives.

337
00:30:53,067 --> 00:30:56,127
It’s his duty, he has to fight it.

338
00:30:56,328 --> 00:31:00,879
Christ fought it alone, so many saints
fought it alone,

339
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,177
they were treated very badly, put in jail,
given poisons, things, but they fought it.

340
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:11,478
In the same way you stand on Truth,
and you have to fight it.

341
00:31:13,736 --> 00:31:17,111
Because you are saints.

342
00:31:20,643 --> 00:31:23,009
May God bless you.
