1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,920
A very simple understanding should be that

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,320
why are we in Sahaja Yoga?

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,720
We are in Sahaja Yoga to ascend,

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,760
to go higher and higher, as you sang yesterday.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,520
It was very entertaining yesterday the way

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,640
you talked about your ambition to be higher and higher,

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,800
really it was very joy giving, no doubt.

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,280
But what are we doing about it?

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,120
What are we trying about it, we should see.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,400
Seriously we must think, are we meditating?

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,840
Are we all doing something to elevate others also,

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,120
to give Realisation to others?

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,520
Specially women, I've seen, don't do much of this,

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,920
which is very bad, because you are the mothers.

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,400
You have to go all out to give Realisation to others,

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,800
but men are more active that way and women are not.

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,200
So, it works the other way round.

18
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,800
Now, on one side, the men are, I think, are active,

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,360
but don't meditate,

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,800
women meditate and men do the outside works,

21
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:27,480
sort of a part time or you can call it a good labour division

22
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,400
that you meditate at home and we'll go all out.

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,320
It's not going to work out.

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,240
So, one has to meditate

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,880
and one has to also go out to spread Sahaja Yoga.

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,080
Both things have to be done.

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,320
Supposing now, you meditate and you don't spread Sahaja Yoga,

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,680
you will never ascend,

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,480
because after all this Kundalini, you see,

30
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,680
She is a sensible woman, She is very sensible.

31
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,840
She thinks: "Why should I make her a saint, what is the use?"

32
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,240
Sahaja Yoga is not individualistic.

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,800
It's not for one person to become a saint

34
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,480
and sit somewhere. It's not like that.

35
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,320
It's not meant for one person, for oneself,

36
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,360
it's not individualistic.

37
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,720
It's a collective happening.

38
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,040
So, if you are not helping to the collective,

39
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,040
Kundalini says: "Alright, you are alright as it is!"

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,800
Just like our body:

41
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,600
see in our body, if one organ says:

42
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,720
"Alright, now I'm alright, I'm not going to work out."

43
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,040
Or one cell says that: "I'm not going to now grow,

44
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,360
it's alright, why should I worry about the whole body?" It won't.

45
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,160
It's a living, it's a living organism!

46
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,920
I have told you 100 times,

47
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,440
when it is a living organism, it has to grow,

48
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,400
it has to grow and also to absorb.

49
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,280
To have energy, you have to meditate and you have to grow.

50
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,360
If you don't grow, you are finished,

51
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,880
you are no more a Sahaja Yogi.

52
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,240
I wouldn't call a person a Sahaja Yogi

53
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,320
who has not even given one person Realisation.

54
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,720
Cannot be a Sahaja Yogi!

55
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,800
Sahaja Yogi has to give Realisation to others.

56
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Apart from other activities, the main activity

57
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,040
should be how we give Realisations to others.

58
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,640
Unless and until we really look after that side of life,

59
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,120
we can never, never grow in Sahaja Yoga.

60
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,560
For example, now take My position,

61
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,640
I'm alright, I'm complete, I have no problem.

62
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,160
But why did I work so hard

63
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,240
and wanted so many Sahaja Yogis? Why?

64
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,520
I don't have to grow either, I'm overgrown already.

65
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,640
I don't have to do it, but why?

66
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,880
What is the need? The need is like this,

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,280
the need is of love.

68
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,640
I have so much love that I have to canalize it.

69
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,720
If I don't, I'll suffocate. I can't love Myself.

70
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,240
So this love has to spread.

71
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,720
For that, I have to have you people who can

72
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,040
take this love to others and make them happy.

73
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,360
This is a kind of a vision I have,

74
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,720
and in this special time,

75
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,960
it was promised by many people, by many saints

76
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,000
and it is so obvious that your are all specially chosen

77
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,960
for this kind of thing.

78
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,800
Now, how far you understand your importance is a different point.

79
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,720
You do for your emancipation, alright you meditate,

80
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,320
but if you are not canalizing the love,

81
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,360
the Divine love, what is the use?

82
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,280
Now, supposing I repair something very nicely,

83
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,560
I repair this machine nicely,

84
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,400
put it right, everything and I don't speak,

85
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,760
what is the use of having this?

86
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,520
In the same way, if you work very hard...

87
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,720
I know people who get up at four o'clock, have their bath,

88
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,040
do meditation, sit down.

89
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,960
In the night again, they sit down for meditation,

90
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,600
but they never go out,

91
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,360
they never talk to others,

92
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,320
they never spread Sahaja Yoga,

93
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,880
they do not give Divine love to others,

94
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,960
so how can this great problem of this world

95
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,080
be solved that it has no love,

96
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,200
it has never known Divine love.

97
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,280
It has to be given to them,

98
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,440
they have to feel this Divine love,

99
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,760
this power of Adi Shakti.

100
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,080
They have to know it,

101
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,080
otherwise you have been selfish, I would say,

102
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,800
that you had a nice time, having all this

103
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,720
and you have not given to others.

104
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,360
This is the reason why Sahaja Yoga sometimes fails

105
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,960
to create a proper balanced personality in a human being.

106
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,240
Some people are like this, that now supposing,

107
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,880
a Sahaja Yogi has married another Sahaja Yogini,

108
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,080
take a position like that.

109
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,480
Now, My desire is that they should develop

110
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,960
a complete understanding of each other, love for each other,

111
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,160
but love for Sahaja Yoga and for others.

112
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:06,200
This is the only way we can justify marriage in Sahaja Yoga.

113
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,520
Otherwise why should they marry?

114
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,280
But it doesn't happen like that.

115
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,600
What happens is that first they are married,

116
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,440
then either they will quarrel,

117
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,160
they will ask for divorce.

118
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,720
If that doesn't happen luckily,

119
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,360
-because in Sahaja Yoga it's so easy to get married, you know-

120
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,320
if that doesn't happen,

121
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,600
then they start having their own family,

122
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,960
their own homes, becoming very small,

123
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,160
very, very small, very limited.

124
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,200
Did you come to Sahaja Yoga for that?

125
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,240
You have to realize your responsibility.

126
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,240
See this Mother Earth, how She knows Her responsibility.

127
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,280
She is just made out of nothing but soil and mud,

128
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,040
but look at Her

129
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,400
how She is conscious, how She is particular,

130
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,480
how She works it out, how She is attentive,

131
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,200
how She is careful.

132
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,400
While you, though you have been blessed so much

133
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,880
by everything, you are, are you thinking

134
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,840
of giving it to others?

135
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,480
With twelve disciples, whatever was the problem of Christianity,

136
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,080
it's not a good job, I must say, but still

137
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,240
Christianity spread out.

138
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,320
Islam was not a very good job either, it spread out.

139
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,520
All those bad jobs have spread out so much.

140
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,440
So why not the good job of Sahaja Yoga?

141
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,880
It has to spread, it has to go to various places.

142
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,200
Try and find out where you can go and talk about it

143
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,440
and do something good to others

144
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,320
and help them somehow

145
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,880
to rise above this common existence

146
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,840
of misery, unhappiness and destruction.

147
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,920
The time is very short

148
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,200
and, I think, if you see the time,

149
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,960
the rate at which we are moving is not proper.

150
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,840
We have to be much faster,

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,640
we have to go much ahead

152
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,240
and we have to create much more Sahaja Yogis

153
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:39,720
through our consistent, very intensive effort.

154
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,080
But it's a side issue, by the way,

155
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,960
Sahaja Yoga is by the way.

156
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,040
And this is where we are failing in our responsibility.

157
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,800
We have to learn from the Mother Earth.

158
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,320
You might say that: "Mataji, how can we be like You?

159
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,560
After all, You are Adi Shakti!" Many people say like this.

160
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,720
"You are Adi Shakti." "So what?"

161
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,720
"You see, with one finger you can move things like that!"

162
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,480
But why should I? Why should I? What is the need?

163
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,560
So in that reflection that you are Me,

164
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,520
in that reflection that the Mother Earth is Me,

165
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,480
in that beautiful creation within you,

166
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,880
you have to become very sensitive

167
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,680
to the need of the world. What is the need of the world?

168
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,840
Today, if you fail, the whole thing will fail forever.

169
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,880
Only very few will be there.

170
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,360
So the need for you is to spread Sahaja Yoga,

171
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,040
because this love is not only for you,

172
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,800
is not to be enjoyed by you,

173
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,960
but is to be enjoyed

174
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,600
by as many possible in whole world.

175
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,160
So, today we have to decide that

176
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,000
as the children of Adi Shakti,

177
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,800
we have to go all out,

178
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,600
everywhere, every corner,

179
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,120
we have to shout, and we have to tell loudly

180
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,280
what is the time in which we are living

181
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,760
and what is the responsibility

182
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:39,400
that you have to fulfil as Sahaja Yogis.

183
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,600
There must be some reason why you are here.

184
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,560
Like in the beginning, Sahaja Yogis used to ask Me:

185
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,640
"Mother, was I this last life?

186
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,920
Was I Shivaji last life?"

187
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,840
I said: "What's the use?" You might have been anything,

188
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,320
but what you are today is much higher, try to understand!

189
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,120
You might be, say, Napoleon,

190
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,360
you might be, say, one of the kings

191
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,120
or maybe, or may be the queen from somewhere, so what?

192
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:16,080
What did they do? Did they raise anybody's Kundalini?

193
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,440
Did they have any power?

194
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,080
Even the disciples of Christ or even

195
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,880
Mohammed Sahib's disciples, anyone,

196
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,480
did they do it?

197
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,520
Did they have any understanding of Kundalini?

198
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,720
Did they have any love for others

199
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,640
that they should give them Realisation?

200
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,600
There were some Sufis, they never gave Realisation to anyone,

201
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,240
there were so many saints who never gave Realisation to anybody.

202
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,240
Mohammed Sahib never gave Realisation to anybody,

203
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,480
Gautam Buddha never gave Realisation to anybody,

204
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,560
think of it!

205
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,560
Christ never gave Realisation to anybody, anybody!

206
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,560
Krishna did not do it, Rama did not do it,

207
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,240
nobody, but you can do it!!

208
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,960
You can do it

209
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,120
and you know everything about Kundalini.

210
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,960
It's a very big thing

211
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,720
because you are children of the Adi Shakti.

212
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,120
You are here and your Mother is here.

213
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:30,320
It's a very, very fortunate thing for Me that you are here.

214
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,280
I'm very proud of you,

215
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,320
but again and again I have to tell you

216
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,720
that the work has to be with a faster speed,

217
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,680
we have to move with a faster speed

218
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,040
and get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

219
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,600
It is rather, rather difficult for Me

220
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,960
to say something forcefully.

221
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,200
That's not My nature, you know.

222
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,680
Can't get into tempers and cannot get angry

223
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,920
and I cannot forcefully say something to you,

224
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,080
But if you fail, then

225
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,720
only thing will be that you have failed Me completely.

226
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,960
It means that, nothing less than that.

227
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,200
And if you don't want to do it,

228
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,920
then I would request all of you to take a vow today,

229
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,760
that you spread Sahaja Yoga and you will talk about Sahaja Yoga,

230
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,440
know about Sahaja Yoga.

231
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,200
There are many who don't know anything.

232
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,080
Also it is very surprising, they are Sahaja Yogis, they don't know anything.

233
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,000
And don't create problems for Me like marriage:

234
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,320
"We can't now live with the wife, we can't live with the husband."

235
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,720
All sort of nonsensical problems

236
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,040
people create for Me in Sahaja Yoga.

237
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,960
Are you here to create problems or to remove problems of people?

238
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,240
So, on the whole, we have done well, I must say,

239
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,360
but it's not the final, we have to work faster

240
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,920
with more enthusiasm and joyfully.

241
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,720
You don't know what joy you get

242
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,160
when you give Realisation to somebody.

243
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,240
The most joyful moment is when you give Realisation to others.

244
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,240
Just try, you must try once, you'll enjoy it,

245
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,520
and then you want more and more and more.

246
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,720
Now, after Sahaja Yoga, really,

247
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,640
the want disappears into this desire that:

248
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,840
"My God, this man is going,

249
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,960
should I call him and give him Realisation?"

250
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,840
On the street, you'll feel like calling:

251
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,040
"Come here, come here, I want to give you something!"

252
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,640
You make him sit down and you give Realisation.

253
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,680
This will be your style, like mad, you'll say:

254
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,960
"Ah no! Look at this,

255
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,320
this gentleman is without any Realisation, let us give."

256
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,200
You'll have to go to churches, to universities,

257
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,680
you'll have to go to all such congregations

258
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,040
where they have no idea about what they can achieve

259
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,280
and then tell them without any fear, without any malice.

260
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,720
You can talk to them and you should tell them:

261
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,560
"Now, we are here to help, for your good,

262
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,200
we have not come for our good but for your good,

263
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,760
now listen to us!" And I'm sure, very sure

264
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,680
that the Kundalini within you will be very happy.

265
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,160
She's not happy, you see,

266
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,160
She's not happy with people who are not using Her fully.

267
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,920
So, She'll be very happy to help you

268
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:29,320
and do the needful for the emancipation of the whole world.

269
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,560
May God bless you!
