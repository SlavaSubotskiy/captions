1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,060
Today it’s a great day because Sahasrara day

2
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,150
and Mother’s day have come together.

3
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:31,010
That’s a very Sahaj happening, I think,

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,080
and that is what we have to understand,

5
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:47,120
how Sahasrara and the motherhood go together.

6
00:00:53,130 --> 00:01:00,060
Sahasrara was definitely opened

7
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,990
and Mother had to do it,

8
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:16,990
because formerly those people who came on this earth

9
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:24,950
tried to teach people about Dharma,

10
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,130
to bring them to the central path,

11
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,160
to the straightforward path of ascent.

12
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,960
They tried everything,

13
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,100
whatever way they thought was good for a particular community,

14
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,010
particular area, particular country.

15
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:50,020
They talked about it and lots of books came out of it.

16
00:01:50,130 --> 00:02:03,090
But instead of all these books creating people of  religious,

17
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:10,100
spiritual and a united nature,

18
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,090
created people who were all against each other.

19
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,960
Absurd, it’s an absurd thing, but it happened.

20
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,080
So all these books that were written,

21
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:32,940
all this knowledge that was given, was all misused by human beings

22
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:41,050
just to get their own power, I should say;

23
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:48,150
so it was all a power-orientated, also money-orientated, game going on.

24
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:58,020
When we see the outcome of all these religions, we feel it’s all empty.

25
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:08,980
They talk of love, they talk of compassion but it is all for a purpose.

26
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,040
It is all a political game sometimes,

27
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:20,040
because they still feel that they should have power,

28
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,050
not the spiritual power but the worldly power,

29
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,990
so that they can dominate the whole world.

30
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,970
So this domination started working so much in the human mind

31
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,110
that we had lots of wars, killings, all kinds of things.

32
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,930
And when it subsided I felt that now,

33
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:53,130
maybe, opening Sahasrara might help people to see the truth.

34
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:59,930
At the level of Sahasrara, you know the truth.

35
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:08,150
So all kinds of illusions, all kinds of misunderstandings,

36
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:18,130
all kinds of self-imposed ignorance, they all have to disappear.

37
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,150
Because what you know is the truth.

38
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:31,070
The truth is not sharp, it’s not harsh,

39
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:38,050
it is not something which is difficult to assimilate.

40
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:45,000
People thought truth must be something that would be just very

41
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,130
damaging or could be very harsh,

42
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:56,110
could create problems between human beings, which it should not have,

43
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,020
it should not have, it was not meant to be.

44
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,930
But whenever they talked of truth

45
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,160
the people used it for a wrong purpose.

46
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,080
It’s something special about human beings

47
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:22,110
that they start using things for a wrong attitude, for a wrong message,

48
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,070
and try to use it for their own purpose.

49
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,100
It’s such a common thing with human beings

50
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,080
that they want to have power over other men.

51
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,040
Now I’ve seen in My own country when

52
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,110
people wanted to have separate nations.

53
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,930
Those people who wanted to have separate nations actually did it,

54
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,940
not to achieve anything great but just because they can become,

55
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,000
those people who wanted, few of them,

56
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,970
they'll become something great in their own country.

57
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,100
So they never wanted to be in a country where

58
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,030
they may not rise to that height.

59
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,970
So then, they separated those countries and by separating I have seen

60
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,960
all these countries are suffering, suffering very much.

61
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,000
There’s no growth, there are financial problems,

62
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,050
all kinds of problems are there and

63
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:26,100
also the main country is suffering because they have now developed

64
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,940
enmity and all this is working out against the main country.

65
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:37,170
So to have a separatist idea itself is against Sahaj.

66
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:44,160
Say, for example, a flower growing on the tree looks very nice,

67
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,080
it develops there, matures there and it produces seeds also.

68
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:57,100
But supposing you cut the flower and take it away, then what happens?

69
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,010
The tree loses the flower, no doubt,

70
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,050
but mostly it is the loss of the flower.

71
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,020
Now this they did, all of them, and when they did it,

72
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,100
you see, what is the result?

73
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:20,150
That people who tried to have their own country, their own domain,

74
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:28,070
they were killed, murdered, abused and some of them are in jail.

75
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:32,940
So the attitude, even outside  Sahaja Yoga,

76
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,010
has shown that it doesn’t help.

77
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,040
So we must learn to be one.

78
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,970
If after Sahaja Yoga, after your realization,

79
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:53,100
if you do not understand this message that we all have to be one,

80
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,050
one single unit, one single body;

81
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,990
if we cannot be, if you are identified with other things,

82
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,110
then it’s no way you have grown, you have not matured.

83
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,100
A very important point on Sahasrara day, one has to understand,

84
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:16,940
that all the seven chakras have their peethas in the Sahasrara.

85
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,940
All the seven chakras.

86
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,160
They are nicely settled down in the midriff of your brain

87
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:31,040
and they act through that area, wherever they are,

88
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,050
on the chakras and work it out.

89
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:40,130
Now all these seven chakras become one,

90
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,020
I should say, or go into unison.

91
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:49,970
Complete integration takes place in these centers.

92
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:57,960
Because these are governed by these seven main chakras,

93
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,160
we can call them, you can call them by any name,

94
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,930
and they govern all the other chakras

95
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,140
and because they are in unison, completely integrated,

96
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,000
that’s why all your chakras are integrated.

97
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:22,170
Is the peethas which are enlightened, I should say, by Kundalini,

98
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:31,990
also blessed by the Divine power, immediately become integrated.

99
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,990
They say that like pearls in one string.

100
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,100
It’s even more than that, it’s more than that,

101
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:47,980
all these peethas within you get integrated in such a manner

102
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:54,000
as if there’s no difference in their manifestation.

103
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,030
Supposing you have a chakra which is not alright,

104
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,120
something wrong physically, mentally, emotionally,

105
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,090
whatever it is, the other chakras try

106
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:17,000
to help this sick chakra and try to evolve a personality

107
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,940
of a Sahaja Yogi in a way that he’s integrated.

108
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,170
Now integration within yourself is very important,

109
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,980
unless and until you are integrated within yourself

110
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,970
you cannot be integrated outside.

111
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,080
And the within yourself the integration

112
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,980
is such a blessing of Sahaja Yoga that a person

113
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:45,060
who gets this realization becomes a personality

114
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,030
which is above the normal personality.

115
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:55,170
It is not attached to all the negative forces,

116
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,140
the destructive forces.

117
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,960
It just gives up so many things

118
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,990
which normally very difficult to give up.

119
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,020
All these seven chakras, that we have within ourselves,

120
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:16,140
are then guided by these peethas in unison.

121
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:21,160
Just the help that comes from this unison

122
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,060
helps all the chakras to get completely integrated.

123
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,000
As it is we are not integrated because

124
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,130
our mind goes on one side, our body goes on another side,

125
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,000
our heart goes on another side, our emotions are different.

126
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,060
We do not know which is the right thing to do,

127
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,970
what is the best thing to do.

128
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,080
But after realization, in the light of the Spirit,

129
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,940
you get the truth and you know what is to be done.

130
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,060
For example, after self realization

131
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,060
you can judge people on their vibrations.

132
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,100
You don’t have to use your brains for that,

133
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,990
just on your vibrations,

134
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:12,110
immediately you know what’s wrong with yourself and with others.

135
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:18,140
So here it is a double correction, one is you see your own being,

136
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,970
your own self, your self knowledge comes to you

137
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,090
and secondly you can also make out another person,

138
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,140
what sort of a thing he’s done.

139
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,160
If somebody is not Sahaj and claims to be Sahaj,

140
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,050
you can easily find out that he’s not Sahaj,

141
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,050
his behaviour is not Sahaj.

142
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,060
So the best thing is for all of us is

143
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,090
to get this integration absolutely working out within ourselves.

144
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,970
We should not shun it but we should accept that

145
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,140
whatever defects we had, whatever wrong we have been doing,

146
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:02,050
what wrong thinking we had, whatever destructive we had taken to,

147
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:08,110
all this has to disappear because you are Sahaja Yogis.

148
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:14,020
Sahaja Yogis have a special job to be done.

149
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,940
They’re not like other people who are just working for money,

150
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,060
working for power, working for domination.

151
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,080
You are not.

152
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:29,000
You are working in Sahaja Yoga for the emancipation of humanity.

153
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,080
So whole thing is that this Sahasrara

154
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:38,970
is a global field where we enter in.

155
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:45,940
We enter into a global field and when we are there we just become,

156
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,090
ourselves, a global personality.

157
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:53,010
So all these minor things like your race, your country,

158
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,970
your religion and all these,

159
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,090
which are artificial barriers between human beings,

160
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:04,950
just drops out and you become a realized soul,

161
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:09,950
and you know what is humanity, you understand the humanity.

162
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,080
This has to happen in all the Sahaja Yogis.

163
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,000
When they are together.

164
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,040
They should understand that we are not,

165
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,950
no more ordinary human beings,

166
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,120
we are special people chosen for a very special work

167
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,930
which is the most important thing today.

168
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,110
Now, as you know what is going on in Kali yuga,

169
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,010
I need not describe all that to you,

170
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:38,030
but what is the light of the Spirit which is going to show you

171
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:43,930
what you can do to remove the ills of Kali Yuga.

172
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,010
Starting right from yourself,

173
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,150
you just see for yourself with great amusement,

174
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,950
what you have been doing was all stupid.

175
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,030
You should not have done that but you have been doing,

176
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,170
so it’s alright, you can forgive others who are doing it.

177
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,150
And you’ll understand that those who have been doing it

178
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,140
have been doing all this out of ignorance.

179
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:10,110
But now you have your Sahasrara open.

180
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,120
In the open Sahasrara you are getting,

181
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,940
or the Divine is pouring Its grace all the time.

182
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:24,980
With that reception, with that, we should say,

183
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,060
the nourishing of your Sahasrara,

184
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,950
what happens is something really great.

185
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:36,060
One thing happens that you get detached from yourself,

186
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,170
you can see yourself, you can see your past,

187
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,150
you can understand yourself that you have been doing

188
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:48,980
so many wrong things and misunderstanding people.

189
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:54,970
This sometimes takes you too far away from yourself.

190
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,060
But once this light comes and the Sahasrara is nourished,

191
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,010
in that light you see clearly

192
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,980
what wrong you have been doing to yourself.

193
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,940
Then, as a person, you can see your faults

194
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
but also you see the faults of your society, where you live.

195
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,090
I’ve seen immediately after people get their realization

196
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,940
they start telling Me,

197
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,970
“Mother, I was a Christian but see, this is Christianity”.

198
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,010
Somebody will say, “Mother, I was very patriotic,

199
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,980
but I see now what is patriotism is”.

200
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,960
Like, everybody starts seeing its own background,

201
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:42,950
its own styles in which he has lived and just gets out of it.

202
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,150
And once you are out of it it’s no more identified with you.

203
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,100
And it’s such a spontaneous happening.

204
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,040
Only thing, you have to learn to be spontaneous.

205
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,010
And that’s what I find that, in Sahaj, people still,

206
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:04,990
though they are out of this illusion, this ocean of illusion,

207
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:10,170
still sometimes their one leg is still there in the ocean

208
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,060
and still they’re pulling it out and pushing it back.

209
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,120
That should not be.

210
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,980
That is only because people don’t meditate.

211
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,990
Now to say you must meditate, people think it’s a kind of a ritual,

212
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:30,980
or maybe a kind of a style of Sahaja Yoga, no.

213
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:37,060
Meditation is for you, to go deep down into yourself,

214
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,980
to achieve all that your Sahasrara wants to give you.

215
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:47,040
To achieve that height of detachment,

216
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:54,040
of understanding is only through meditation.

217
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,170
So what happens in meditation is

218
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:02,150
that your awareness crosses over Agnya, goes above,

219
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:09,040
and is now stationed in the Sahasrara, in thoughtless awareness.

220
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,960
Then the reality of Sahasrara, the beauty of Sahasrara,

221
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,990
starts pouring in your own character, in your own temperament.

222
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:24,070
Unless and until you meditate, not meditate just to get well

223
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,120
or just to feel that “I must meditate“.

224
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,040
But meditation is very important for all of you

225
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,930
that you develop your Sahasrara in such a manner

226
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,980
that you imbibe the beauty of your Sahasrara.

227
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,060
If you don’t use your Sahasrara in this way,

228
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,120
after some time you’ll find Sahasrara will close down,

229
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,020
you’ll have no vibrations

230
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,950
and you’ll have no understanding of yourself.

231
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,030
So very, very important thing is to meditate.

232
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,020
I can immediately make out a person who has been meditating

233
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,960
and the one who has not been meditating.

234
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,160
Because a person who does not meditate he still thinks that

235
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,950
“Oh, it’s alright, I’m doing this, I’m doing that.”

236
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:16,100
Meditation is the only way you can

237
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:22,990
enrich yourself with the beauty of reality.

238
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,170
There’s no other way.

239
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:28,940
I cannot find any other way but meditation

240
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:34,950
by which you rise into the realm of divinity.

241
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,130
For example, I would say that Myself,

242
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,080
whatever I have done is this,

243
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,140
that I have been able to find out a method

244
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,950
how to give Self-realization to masses.

245
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,970
But that doesn’t mean that if I give to masses,

246
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,160
they are all Sahaja Yogis, no.

247
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,130
You must have seen whenever you have your programs,

248
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,950
people get realization when I’m there

249
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:07,050
and they come to programs for a while and then they drop out.

250
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,050
The reason is, they have not meditated.

251
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,940
If they had meditated they would have known

252
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,940
what is their quality, what are they.

253
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:28,050
Without meditation you don’t understand what is best for you.

254
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,170
So today is a day when you have to promise Me

255
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,980
that you’ll meditate every night,

256
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,970
every evening, maybe in the morning also.

257
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:42,050
Whenever it is possible if you can go into a meditative mood,

258
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:47,170
you are in contact with this Divine power.

259
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,970
Then, whatever is good for you, whatever good for your society,

260
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,970
for your country, all is done by this Divine power.

261
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:03,020
You don’t have to overpower the Divine power,

262
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,030
you don’t have to order, you don’t have to ask,

263
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:13,950
just if you meditate you are one with this All-pervading Power

264
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:18,950
which is another great blessing to us.

265
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,030
Unless and until your Sahasrara is opened

266
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:31,000
all the blessings of the Divine power cannot come to you, cannot.

267
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,940
Maybe you might get some money, you might get some jobs,

268
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,170
you might get this and that.

269
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,000
But your own development is only possible when you meditate

270
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,050
and your Sahasrara is completely open and open to truth.

271
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:54,970
Now the truth is that this Divine power is compassion, is love.

272
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,110
This is the truth.

273
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,050
They say God is love and God is truth,

274
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:05,940
so the equation has to be made that truth is love and love is truth.

275
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,110
But it’s not a truth that, as you have for your own children,

276
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,060
you have for your family, attached.

277
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,140
Attached love is not truth.

278
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,970
If you are attached to somebody

279
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,950
then you never see the bad points of that person.

280
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,980
If you are angry with somebody,

281
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,060
then you can never see the good points of that person.

282
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:31,120
But it’s a complete detached love

283
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,950
and that love is extremely powerful

284
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,170
because whenever you project that love to anyone,

285
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:43,060
you’ll be surprised, the problems of that person will be solved,

286
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,000
his personality will improve,

287
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,090
everything will work out in a very big way and his life will be changed.

288
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:54,090
But if you’re attached to anything whatsoever,

289
00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:07,000
that attachment itself causes problems and doesn’t allow Sahaj to grow.

290
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,980
This attachment could be any kind, for example,

291
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,980
you can be attached to your country, attached to your society,

292
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,970
attached to your family, it can be of any kind.

293
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:24,090
But when Sahasrara is open, you’ll learn one thing, is detachment.

294
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,120
It just happens that you get detached.

295
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,980
Though, I mean, you are not running away.

296
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,060
As it is in Sahaja Yoga we don’t believe in people who run away

297
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:39,950
from society and go to Himalayas, all that I call escapism,

298
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,060
that is not the point.

299
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:45,930
What happens is that you are there, you see everyone,

300
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:49,970
you watch everyone, you know everyone,

301
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:55,040
you are close to everyone, but you are a detached person.

302
00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:00,060
It’s a state of mind that you achieve when Sahasrara is open.

303
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,110
In that state you are dealing with people,

304
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:10,070
you are dealing with problems, you are dealing with situations,

305
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:15,930
but you are not involved in it, there’s no involvement;

306
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,930
and that involvement which you had before

307
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:24,060
can never give a complete insight, what is happening,

308
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,980
what the truth is, about any situation.

309
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,070
So this detachment helps.

310
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:35,120
The greatest thing of the detachment is that you are not affected.

311
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,160
No use saying that, “oh you are not affected,

312
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:46,070
Mother, so how can you feel for another person?

313
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,940
How can you have compassion for another person?

314
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:55,010
Because if you feel for another person

315
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,130
then only you can solve the problem”.

316
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:03,960
But this feeling that you have is again a kind of an attachment.

317
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:09,150
It is not a real feeling, because it doesn’t help.

318
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,020
The person is crying, you are also crying,

319
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,990
the person is trouble, you are also in trouble.

320
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:21,040
And this does not help that person, nor will it help you.

321
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,040
So to have detached in no way means

322
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,050
you do not feel for another person.

323
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,080
You do feel.

324
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:36,130
You feel the agony of that person, the trouble of that person,

325
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:41,940
of the whole society sometimes and of the whole country.

326
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,130
But that your feeling is so detached

327
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:50,150
that the All-pervading Power takes over.

328
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,930
First we must have full faith

329
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:57,020
in the capability of this All-pervading Power.

330
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,100
As soon as you are detached.

331
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,970
You say, “You do it” - finished.

332
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,960
Once you say that, “You are going to do it,

333
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,050
it’s You who is going to do it,”

334
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,130
whole thing changes completely.

335
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:15,100
Because you transfer all your responsibilities, all your problems,

336
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,960
to this Divine power, which is so powerful,

337
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,130
which is so capable, which can work out anything.

338
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:29,040
So whenever you think that this problem you are going to solve,

339
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,010
you are the one who’s going to do it,

340
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:37,050
then, alright, the Divine power says: “Alright, try your luck.”

341
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,970
But if you can really put this problem to the Divine power,

342
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,070
it will work out.

343
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,100
We have all kinds of problems in Sahaja Yoga,

344
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,930
especially when we find that people

345
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,150
are not so much attracted to Sahaja Yoga,

346
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,080
they are few in number then you feel very bad about it.

347
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:59,940
But have you tried to meditate on this point,

348
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:04,960
and have you tried to put this problem to the Divine power?

349
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,130
Why should we worry?

350
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,130
When we have Divine power available through our Sahasrara,

351
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,960
why should we worry?

352
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,020
Why should we think about it?

353
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,050
Just leave it to the Divine power.

354
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:20,930
If that is possible, if that you can achieve,

355
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,150
which is very difficult for human beings,

356
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,970
because they live with their ego,

357
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,020
they live with their conditionings;

358
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:33,020
but if that attachment to all these things goes away,

359
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:38,160
then what you do is just leave things to this power.

360
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,070
Krishna has said in His Gita:

361
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:45,080
“Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja”

362
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,100
“Forget about all your dharmas”.

363
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,010
Dharmas means, He means, meaning that we have a dharma of a wife,

364
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,080
of a husband, of a member of the society,

365
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,150
all of them have their own dharma.

366
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:04,050
But He says “Leave them. And leave it, them to Me and I’ll manage.”

367
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,940
This is it what we have to learn, is to say that

368
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:12,080
“It’s this Divine power which will solve our problems.”

369
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,990
As human beings it’s a very difficult state

370
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:20,050
and this state only can be achieved through meditation.

371
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:24,080
But I’m not saying that you go on meditating for hours together.

372
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,100
That’s not necessary.

373
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:31,100
But with full faith in yourself and in the Divine power.

374
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,940
If you work it out, I’m sure it’s not difficult

375
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,990
to rise to that state of consciousness.

376
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,050
That is what we have to achieve.

377
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:45,100
It’s possible for men as well as for women.

378
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,080
They don’t have to think: “How can we, Mother, do it after all?”

379
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,990
You see, all such people are no good for Sahaja Yoga.

380
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:59,020
Those who have diffidence about themselves cannot do anything.

381
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,080
But those who are surrendered and those who think they can do it,

382
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:13,020
can manage all this transfer of their power to the Divine power.

383
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,130
Just put it on the Divine power.

384
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:20,040
Now supposing I have a car which can drive Me down.

385
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,930
So, if I have a car then I don’t put bullocks on it,

386
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:31,010
that I don’t push My car, I just sit inside and use it.

387
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:34,930
In the same way, if you have this great power around you,

388
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:40,120
if your Sahasrara is absolutely, completely submerged in it,

389
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:46,140
then you’ll be amazed how things work out for yourself.

390
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:52,000
I will give you an example of a Sahaja Yogi, he’s no more now,

391
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:56,990
he was a fisherman, ordinary fisherman, but also he was educated,

392
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:00,930
so he was working in a bank.

393
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:04,070
This one was going one day to do some Sahaja Yoga work

394
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,940
and he had to go by boat.

395
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,140
So when he came out he saw that the whole place was clouded

396
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,070
and it was about to burst out into a big havoc.

397
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:20,970
So he got very much perturbed about it that – “what is this?”

398
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,110
Immediately, his Sahasrara was so open and good, immediately he said,

399
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,080
“Now I leave it to this Divine power

400
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,080
to stop all these things happening.

401
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,960
I don’t want it to rain and to have any problem

402
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:39,110
till I come back home and go off to sleep”.

403
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,080
And it was surprising, people told Me that

404
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,140
“Mother, the clouds and everything were there

405
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:52,160
all throughout but it did not rain, did not do anything,

406
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,970
and there was no chaos of any kind”.

407
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,030
He went to another island where he had to go,

408
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,080
he did Sahaja Yoga and came back.

409
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,110
And then when he went to sleep, then only,

410
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,970
everything started pouring down.

411
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:11,140
So, nature, everything, every leaf, every flower, everything,

412
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,970
is worked out through the Divine power.

413
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,110
So we should not have our ego that we can do something ourselves,

414
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,020
we can manage ourselves.

415
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,170
Once you have that kind of a thing,

416
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,100
you are not yet that much developed,

417
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,080
you are not that much grown up in Sahaja Yoga.

418
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,050
But to grow up in Sahaja Yoga should not be difficult for you,

419
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,060
because you have guidelines.

420
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:40,100
Those people who got their realization, very few of them,

421
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:44,970
like Sufis and we had some saints in India, all of them;

422
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,970
how much they must have struggled.

423
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,060
Nobody to guide them, nobody to help them,

424
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,990
nobody to tell them about what they can achieve.

425
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:57,950
And despite that they were very satisfied people,

426
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,170
very happy people, and they worked it out so well.

427
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,080
They saw the whole world with another angle, as you can also see,

428
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,030
but they were not upset and they had such self-confidence,

429
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:16,170
they had such knowledge of their own

430
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:21,080
that they achieved through their meditative process.

431
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,100
And the way they have written books,

432
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,110
some of them are so great, it’s very surprisingly,

433
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:34,170
how they have achieved these great verses, such full of knowledge.

434
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:39,130
One cannot understand that they had no guidance,

435
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,110
nobody was to tell them.

436
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,950
But one thing with them was

437
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,090
that they always tried to look after their Sahasrara.

438
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:54,940
Now one thing is there obstructing Sahasrara

439
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,950
is the movement of your Agnya into thoughts.

440
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:04,950
That’s the only thing, that’s the only thing

441
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,090
that stops your entry into Sahaja Yoga.

442
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,000
Thoughts are coming all the time,

443
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,160
because a human being is born who reacts to everything,

444
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,110
react to this and react to that

445
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,950
and the thoughts come in and the thoughts go.

446
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,950
There’s a big crowd of thoughts.

447
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:27,140
Because of that your attention cannot cross over Agnya

448
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:32,000
and can reside in the Sahasrara.

449
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:37,130
So first of all, one should see what sort of thoughts are coming.

450
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,940
You have to condemn yourself sometimes.

451
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:43,940
You have to say: “What nonsense! What have I been doing?

452
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,020
What’s the matter with me? How could I do all that?”

453
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:52,060
Once you start doing that, these thoughts will start disappearing.

454
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,030
These thoughts are coming from two angles,

455
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:58,140
one from the ego and another from your conditionings.

456
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,160
And these are so much built up within you,

457
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,970
that they don’t allow your agnya to be crossed.

458
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:11,170
That’s why we have two Bija mantras of ‘Hum’, ‘Kshum’.

459
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,110
First one is, when it is conditioning,

460
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:17,030
you are endowed with this kind of a fear,

461
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,970
“I shouldn’t do like this, I shouldn’t do like that,

462
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:23,080
it’s not allowed, that is not allowed.”

463
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,090
That’s the conditioning part of it.

464
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,080
Conditioning can be of many types.

465
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,050
But the ego part of it is that,

466
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:31,170
“I must overpower everybody, I must get this,

467
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,950
I must be able to rule everyone.”

468
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:40,010
These two things are there in the mind

469
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:43,150
which are all the time crossing over.

470
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:49,110
So it’s important that we should go into thoughtless awareness

471
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:54,090
and that thoughtless awareness is the real way

472
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:59,980
that your Sahasrara can be nourished by the Kundalini.

473
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,980
Because Kundalini cannot go through, it cannot pass through.

474
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:09,000
And for that, as I said, there are two Bija mantras,

475
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,070
one is ‘Hum’ another ’Kshum’.

476
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,070
So, if you are conditioned, you are frightened,

477
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,930
you are afraid and you had ideas about yourself.

478
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,030
These days the way people are describing, they’ll say,

479
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,140
“I’m an extrovert”.

480
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,090
Somebody will say, “I’m an introvert”,

481
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:30,090
somebody will say “I’m a hippie”, “I’m that”, I’m that.

482
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:34,060
All kinds of things they can have attributed to themselves.

483
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:40,060
But these ideas are all coming from outside, they are not from inside.

484
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:46,070
To get to the inner side of yourself, the subtler side of your being,

485
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,980
you must allow the Kundalini to go through the Agnya.

486
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,170
And to cross the Agnya is a very important thing

487
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,150
in modern times and for that you have to meditate.

488
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,960
If you can meditate with complete faith in yourself

489
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,930
this Agnya can be opened out.

490
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,930
With surrendering to the Divine,

491
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,980
you have to surrender yourself to the Divine.

492
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,980
And when this Agnya opens, you’ll be amazed,

493
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,960
your Sahasrara is just waiting to transfer,

494
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:25,170
to give you all the help that you need through the All-pervading Power.

495
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,070
Your connection of Sahasrara with

496
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,140
the All-pervading Power is established.

497
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:39,090
And by that you’ll be amazed how all these seven chakras work for you,

498
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:44,130
how they help you, how they try to give you whatever

499
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:48,060
is the real knowledge about everything.

500
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:52,090
This real knowledge that you get is very joy giving.

501
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,010
You can see this real knowledge in everything.

502
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:59,960
You don’t have to start reading any book about it.

503
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,040
In every situation and in every person, in every flower,

504
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:12,930
in every natural happening, you see clearly the hand of the Divine.

505
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:21,010
Once you see the hand of the Divine your egos start disappearing.

506
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:24,070
Once you say that “It’s You. You do everything.”

507
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,950
Kabira has said something great about this,

508
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:37,100
he said that when the goat is alive it goes on saying

509
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:42,040
“Mai, mai” - “I am, I am”.

510
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:50,040
But when it is slaughtered and its intestines are made into strings,

511
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,040
which are used for cleaning the cotton, then it said

512
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,130
“tuhi, tuhi” - “you are, you are, you are”.

513
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:01,020
See, in this symbolic way, they have suggested that:

514
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:09,090
you have to become dissolved into this Divine power.

515
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,950
“It’s the Divine power that does everything. What am I?

516
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:17,040
I was just a drop and I fell into this ocean of awareness

517
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:23,040
of the Divine power and that is taking over and working it out.”

518
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:28,150
That will help you a lot to be a great Sahaja Yogi.

519
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,010
You developed curing powers, but still you are not proud of it.

520
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:38,130
You developed, of course, awakening powers, you are not proud of it.

521
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:43,160
You develop so many creative powers and you are not proud of it.

522
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,930
You become really very, very creative, extremely creative.

523
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,040
But the greatest thing happend to you

524
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,090
that you become a global personality.

525
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,950
So you start seeing the problem of every country,

526
00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:00,100
of every other nation where they have problems.

527
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:04,010
But these problems, when you see, you don’t see like other people.

528
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:07,160
Because others may like to use it for their own purpose,

529
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,160
maybe for media, maybe for something.

530
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,960
But what you want to see is that these problems are solved.

531
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:20,930
You see, your powers are so great, with this kind of a mind,

532
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:25,930
I would say, which is dominated completely by the Divine power,

533
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:31,050
that it, whatever disturbs you,

534
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,960
immediately it’s taken over and it starts working out.

535
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:40,010
Many, many problems have been solved by Sahaja Yoga

536
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:44,130
and also they can be solved on a very universal level,

537
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,940
if you are a global person.

538
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,120
If you are a global person then

539
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:54,960
what happens is that you become a, sort of a, vehicle,

540
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:59,150
or you can become like a channel for this Divine power

541
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:03,970
to act because you are purely a global personality.

542
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,050
Not attached to this, attached to that,

543
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:10,160
but a pure Sahaja personality which can be used

544
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,160
by this Divine power very easily.

545
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,930
For that, as I told in the afternoon also,

546
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,020
that we have to be careful about few things that we have.

547
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:25,960
Firstly anger, anger is the worst thing that we have.

548
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,130
Angry for what?

549
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,120
There are people who talk like this - “I was very angry” -

550
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,080
as if they’re proud of their anger.

551
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,160
Anger is a sign of complete stupidity, absolute stupidity.

552
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,150
And there’s no need to get angry with anyone because,

553
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,930
by anger, you don’t solve the problem.

554
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,100
With anger you spoil yourself.

555
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,990
With anger you ruin your own, own nature.

556
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:54,010
With anger you really spoil the whole situation.

557
00:40:54,080 --> 00:41:00,990
So no use, no use having any anger about anything.

558
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:04,040
But if anything happens that angers you,

559
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,130
you should settle down and see for yourself

560
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,020
why is it wrong, why is it disturbing you?

561
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:17,110
Your seeing itself will help this problem to be solved.

562
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,100
You must first of all realize that you are

563
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,050
a special personality that your Sahasrara

564
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:26,150
has been opened out to this all Divine power,

565
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,020
as if you have entered into the realm of divinity.

566
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:46,050
You are great guests in that great court of Divine domain.

567
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,970
You are not an ordinary person.

568
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:54,020
And so once you understand why you have Sahaja Yoga

569
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:59,960
and why you have got realization, is that there’s something special.

570
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,960
But that should not give you any ego.

571
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,040
It’s not for ego that you have to have this,

572
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,050
but it’s for understanding that

573
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:13,040
you have to play into the hands of the Divine.

574
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,160
It is this play is something I could explain like this,

575
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,080
that: if you are, supposing, an artist,

576
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,070
then in the hand of the artist is the brush

577
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:27,140
and the brush never thinks that it is doing anything.

578
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:30,140
It’s the artist who is doing everything.

579
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:34,960
In the same way, when you are one with the Divine power,

580
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:39,940
you just feel “I’m not doing anything.

581
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,110
It’s the Artist who’s doing it.

582
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,990
It’s the Artist who is managing”.

583
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,000
And who is the Artist?

584
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,110
It’s this Divine power, which loves you, which cares for you,

585
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:55,030
which looks after you, which absolutely is identified with you.

586
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,100
You’ll be surprised,

587
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:01,100
I have got so many letters from people how Sahaj has helped them.

588
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,010
How at the right moment they got the help.

589
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:10,980
At the point of complete destruction, how they were saved.

590
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,020
So many people have written to Me.

591
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,930
But I’m not surprised.

592
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:19,020
Because if you are one with the Divine, it looks after you.

593
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,940
It has all the powers, all the powers.

594
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:29,160
Only one power it doesn’t have, to control you.

595
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:36,000
If you want to ruin yourself, it gives you freedom, complete freedom.

596
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,020
If you want to ruin yourself, ruin.

597
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:42,140
If you don’t want to accept Divine power, alright, don’t accept.

598
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:47,050
It’s a complete freedom to do what you like with yourself.

599
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:50,020
That is one thing it has given and that’s why

600
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:56,030
you must curb down that freedom and respect the Divine power.

601
00:43:56,030 --> 00:44:04,030
Today is, I like the day when it is a Mother’s, I should say,

602
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:05,160
Mother's day also,

603
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,160
because I think only a mother can work it out that way.

604
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:12,140
One has to have lots of patience with people.

605
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,000
What I’ve seen about all these great incarnations who came,

606
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:24,970
they just disappeared; in a very short time they lived, very short time.

607
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:30,050
Somebody was crucified about 33 years of age.

608
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:34,000
Somebody took a samadhi at 23 years of age.

609
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,950
Because I think they couldn’t bear the way people were stupid.

610
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:39,140
They couldn’t see the point

611
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:42,120
that they could do something for human beings.

612
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:46,000
They lost their confidence I think, or maybe that they thought

613
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,050
it’s useless to work for these people.

614
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:53,000
Like that they took a position that, it’s better to disappear.

615
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:55,950
But Mother’s position is different,

616
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:01,050
She’ll go on struggling and fighting for her child.

617
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:04,060
She’ll fight it out to the last to see

618
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:07,050
that the child gets all the benefits.

619
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:12,010
And this patience and this love and this forgiveness

620
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,060
is innately built in a mother,

621
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,090
see, because her attitude is very different.

622
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:28,070
Not any achievement, not any big name

623
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:32,140
or a, what you call a sort of an award or anything.

624
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:35,970
It is just she does it because she is a mother.

625
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:40,000
And that is what is the sign of any mother,

626
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,010
if she’s a real mother, at least for her own children,

627
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:47,040
she will go all out, she will work out everything

628
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:52,140
for day in and day out and try to save the child from disaster.

629
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,090
But Sahaja Yoga is a much bigger family

630
00:45:55,150 --> 00:46:00,010
and for that you really had to be worked out

631
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:02,040
through the mother’s principle.

632
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,940
You cannot take any other principle.

633
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,000
Like there were very great warriors we had

634
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:11,030
and they have done a great job also

635
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:14,030
and they have worked out as warriors.

636
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,950
Then we had some who were very sacrificing.

637
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,950
All kinds of people there were.

638
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:24,030
They worked very hard to establish dharma in people

639
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,170
but they could not.

640
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,040
I thought of one thing that, no use establishing dharma.

641
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,090
First of all give them realization.

642
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:38,040
When in the light of the Spirit they see what’s wrong,

643
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,970
they become dharmic automatically.

644
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:44,930
The best way is to do that, not to force dharma on them.

645
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,170
Because if you put dharma on them,

646
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:50,970
they don’t know how to bear it, they can’t digest.

647
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,140
So this will be the best way,

648
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:59,090
is to just make them aware of their Spirit.

649
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,010
Once the light of the Spirit comes,

650
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,140
in the light they see everything clearly,

651
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:06,980
then no problem is there.

652
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,170
And that’s why this Mother’s quality is very helpful.

653
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:13,110
I mean in every country there has been

654
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:18,070
a manifestation of the Mother Principle, in every country,

655
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:21,170
and it has been depicted and said.

656
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,150
But later on, it was taken over by people

657
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:28,140
who didn’t want to talk about Mother.

658
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,070
Because they could not justify themselves

659
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,090
the way they were behaving.

660
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:35,010
So they said, best is not to talk of the Mother.

661
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:38,120
Also those who were very much advanced people,

662
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:42,000
very matured, who were really incarnations

663
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,090
did talk about the mother all the time.

664
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:46,140
But still talk was talk.

665
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,120
Now this has to be worked out as a Mother has to work it out.

666
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:53,010
So in your own way,

667
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:59,170
when you are doing Sahaja Yoga, there also you have to be a mother.

668
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,030
More mother’s quality than the father’s quality,

669
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:07,980
that: there’s no ambition, there’s no competition,

670
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,140
there’s no jealousies, nothing.

671
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,950
Just you want your children to come up

672
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:19,120
and to grow in their spirituality.

673
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,030
If that is the only attitude we have,

674
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:27,120
then you’ll be amazed how satisfied you’ll feel.

675
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:34,930
Because this is a very, very joy-giving thing

676
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:38,120
to see people growing in spirituality.

677
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:41,980
Not only talking about it, not only reading about it,

678
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:45,980
but actually happening, actualizing within us.

679
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,120
So this quality is very helpful

680
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:53,170
and that really helps every Sahaja Yogi;

681
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:57,930
to be patient, to be kind, to be humble.

682
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,990
But you have to correct also.

683
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:04,960
But there’s a way of correction of another person,

684
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:10,030
of people who are coming, not from the Divine world

685
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,960
but from the normal world.

686
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:16,150
So it’s a difficult task to correct them.

687
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,130
Some people are so hot tempered they can’t bear it.

688
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,150
Doesn’t matter, you have to forgive them.

689
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:28,020
But best is to concentrate on people who are simple,

690
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,070
who are loving, who are affectionate

691
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:35,950
and then gradually all these complicated people, also, will join.

692
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:43,010
Your way of dealing with others has to be motherly.

693
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:46,950
The motherly relationship has to be there.

694
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:51,030
Now I was surprised that in the western literature,

695
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:56,100
I don’t find any description of a child and a mother’s relationship,

696
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:57,930
very surprising.

697
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:59,980
There’s no description at all.

698
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,990
How the mother sees the child, how he walks, how he falls down,

699
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,930
then how he gets up and how he talks.

700
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,040
All kinds of beautiful things has described,

701
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:14,070
but not in the Western countries.

702
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:16,020
I don’t know, they never saw this point,

703
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:19,930
I think, that it is very important that to describe

704
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:22,090
the attention of the mother.

705
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,040
How she’s loving, how she’s kind,

706
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:30,980
how she tolerates so much nonsense and how she keeps it as a,

707
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:35,930
sort of a, forgiving thing.

708
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:39,090
Not just to use it against the child or to trouble.

709
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,060
Sometimes you have to correct, you have to tell.

710
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:45,090
But at the right time, at the right place,

711
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:52,010
if they are told, the child also sees the point, whatever is there.

712
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:55,950
The first, most convincing thing is the affection

713
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:57,960
and the love of the Mother.

714
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:04,090
She goes on forgiving and giving that assurance that

715
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:08,040
“I have a mother, nothing can happen to me.”

716
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:11,950
And this assurance works very well.

717
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:15,930
But the same assurance you have to give to other Sahaja Yogis

718
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:18,130
who are getting realization from you.

719
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,070
Let them feel that you are not angry with them.

720
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:23,930
They are stupid, I know.

721
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:26,120
They are sometimes violent.

722
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:30,130
I have gone through all kinds of people.

723
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,960
But the only thing that has worked is pure love.

724
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:44,980
Pure love has no attributes of expecting something.

725
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:53,160
You just give love and try to improve that person, with full attention.

726
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:59,040
But in Divine work, you don’t have to get attached to that person.

727
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:03,150
Supposing, there’s somebody who is not up to the point,

728
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:06,940
is also troublesome, gets angry with you, annoyed,

729
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,020
insults you and everything, so forget it!

730
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,010
There are many others.

731
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,070
There’s no need to run after one person,

732
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,960
to get attached to that person or to make them fear.

733
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,150
Now main thing is that,

734
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:24,150
I feel all the Sahaja Yogis always feel that I’m their own,

735
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:25,160
which is a fact.

736
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,930
Whether I talk to you, whether I meet you or whatever it is,

737
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:33,010
you have to know that I’m your Mother

738
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:37,040
and any problem you have you can always tell Me.

739
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:40,040
But sometimes the way people tell Me problems also,

740
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:43,050
I feel, how low they are.

741
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,130
Their mentality is so low.

742
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,040
What are they asking Me?

743
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:52,080
Supposing you go to some king and ask him for, say,

744
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:55,030
half a dollar, then what will the king say?

745
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:56,970
“What is the matter with this person?

746
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,930
He doesn’t know what he should ask for.”

747
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,090
In the same way, one feels that way that

748
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:06,060
when you are asking anything to your Mother,

749
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:09,070
it should be of some value.

750
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:18,030
Some great value, it should have the value of complete satisfaction.

751
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:22,060
When you ask for something it should give you complete satisfaction.

752
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:25,970
But I’ve seen people asking for this thing, for that thing.

753
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:29,040
I mean it’s to such an extent that I sometimes feel,

754
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,060
“Oh God, how am I getting all these people around Me

755
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:38,140
who are desiring something very low, very mean, very insipid?”

756
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:46,060
But if you are one with the Sahasrara, then Sahasrara itself works.

757
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,110
It will bring you contact with people,

758
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:56,140
in contact with such people that you are amazed how it works.

759
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:59,140
I went to Turkey and My experience of Turkey

760
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,110
has proved that beyond doubt.

761
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:05,950
I never expected, but the Turkish people,

762
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:09,940
of all the people of the world,

763
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:14,080
have taken to Sahaja Yoga just like a windfall.

764
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:17,960
I can’t understand how they have accepted it.

765
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,130
And they were at least two thousand people

766
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:24,110
in the follow-up and people were finding it impossible

767
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:27,940
to get them round and tell them.

768
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:30,170
And when they had very close meetings also

769
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,160
they had so many people and they continued to be there.

770
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:38,030
Now maybe that it’s a very disturbed country

771
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:41,130
with fundamentalism very much working out.

772
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:48,990
But everywhere, every country has problems and has, we should say,

773
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:56,140
a kind of a very destructive image, every country has.

774
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:59,990
But in some countries, I don’t know how,

775
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:04,000
it sparks and once they become Sahaja Yogis, no problem.

776
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:06,970
There’s no problem about anything,

777
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,940
means they are Sahaja Yogis you see, you don’t have to tell them.

778
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:13,170
They themselves work it out, they understand it, what is it.

779
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:18,030
Like we have every country which has problems,

780
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:22,000
which has people who are not of a very great level,

781
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,170
who are not great seekers.

782
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,990
Maybe in some countries, I feel, those who were great seekers are lost.

783
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:32,170
Like England, I feel that all the seekers are lost by drugs,

784
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:35,020
hippyism, all nonsense.

785
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:41,000
America is the worst of all, which is so much lost into wrong seeking;

786
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:46,080
and it’s difficult to find people there who have right seeking.

787
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:52,080
Gradually it is working out, but still, I must say,

788
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,170
we should not think of any one particular country where Sahaja Yoga

789
00:55:56,990 --> 00:56:01,020
is not working out so much or in some places working out so much.

790
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:06,140
It is, what we have to think, globally that Sahaja Yoga is growing.

791
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:11,030
And you are part and parcel of that society which is Sahaja Yoga.

792
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:14,980
It’s a very rare society which they never had.

793
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:17,160
They had one or two sufis here and there,

794
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:21,140
one or two realized souls here and there, who only suffered.

795
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:26,000
All their lives they were tortured, nobody looked at them.

796
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:30,030
I had great hopes about Maharashtra, but I’m so disappointed,

797
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:35,150
because they tortured all these great saints all throughout,

798
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:39,030
so badly, in such a mean manner,

799
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:41,970
that I think they are still paying for it.

800
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:45,170
And despite the fact that I’ve done so much work there,

801
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:51,040
what I feel is that, their karmas are not good because they still,

802
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:55,120
I would say, it’s a rotten country, become so rotten.

803
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:04,130
You can see that, the way people are behaving, whole thing is so bad.

804
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:07,050
Though Sahaja Yoga is there, no doubt,

805
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:09,940
but I wouldn’t say it is of that level

806
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:12,130
as it is in the north, north of India.

807
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:13,940
It’s very surprising.

808
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:16,940
North Indians never knew anything about Sahaja Yoga,

809
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,930
they were not such religious people either.

810
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:24,130
But how the north people have taken to Sahaja Yoga it`s very surprising.

811
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:28,150
So you can’t say where the light will show, just can’t say.

812
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,990
And wherever it shows we should accept.

813
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:33,150
Wherever it doesn’t show, we should not feel bad about it.

814
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:35,010
What can you do?

815
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:38,990
You cannot sort of break their heads for Sahasrara,

816
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:41,930
their Sahasrara has to be opened out.

817
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:44,020
And with your motherly love,

818
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:47,940
with your motherly understanding I’m sure you can do it.

819
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:54,050
Not, may not be, to the same extent in every country,

820
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:58,020
but I’m sure, as I feel that,

821
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:05,100
maybe the punyas of these great saints will work and maybe,

822
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:09,930
wherever I felt a little bit disappointed,

823
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:16,070
I feel that all these places will work out and Sahaja Yoga will grow.

824
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:19,960
But first and foremost is your Sahasrara.

825
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:23,970
Only your Sahasrara can reflect the light of the Divine.

826
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:26,940
So, your Sahasrara is extremely important.

827
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,130
You must meditate to enrich your Sahasrara,

828
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:36,070
to cure it, to make it completely nourished by the Kundalini.

829
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,070
There`s no need to do many rituals but meditation

830
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:44,990
and also little bit of taking Bandhan, even now today,

831
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:50,000
is necessary I think, when you go out.

832
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:57,050
Because still Kali Yuga is working it’s own pangs and the Satya Yuga

833
00:58:57,050 --> 00:58:59,080
is trying to come out.

834
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:05,130
We are the ones who are going to support, look after the Satya Yuga.

835
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:09,160
And that’s why the Sahasrara opening is very,

836
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,080
very important, it’s very important.

837
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:21,020
And those who want to grow should meditate every day,

838
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:23,960
whatever time you may come home, maybe in the morning,

839
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,050
maybe in the evening, anytime.

840
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:29,080
But you will know that you are meditating when

841
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:33,100
you can get into thoughtless awareness, then you will know.

842
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,080
Your reaction will be zero.

843
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:37,140
Look at something you will just look at it,

844
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,110
you won`t react, because you are thoughtless.

845
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:42,960
You won`t react.

846
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:46,140
When that reaction is not there then everything,

847
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:49,160
you’ll be surprised, is Divine.

848
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,940
Because reaction is your Agnyas problem.

849
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,110
Once you are absolutely thoughtlessly aware,

850
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:00,080
you are one with the Divine.

851
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,970
So much so that the Divine takes over, every activity,

852
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:10,140
every moment of your life and looks after you.

853
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:14,960
And you feel completely secured, one with the Divine.

854
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,960
And enjoy the blessings of the Divine.

855
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:21,940
May God bless you!

856
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:52,170
Now we have so many children.

857
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:57,030
I don't know what to do with all these children here.

858
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,970
They can just come up on the stage

859
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:04,170
and they can sing the song of Shri Ganesha.
