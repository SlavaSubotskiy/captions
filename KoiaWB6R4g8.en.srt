1
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:09,420
So today I want to tell you about purity.

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,540
That is my name, "nir"

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,540
Nir-mala.

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,240
’Ni’ means ‘no’; ’mala’ means ‘impure’.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,980
The one who has no impurities is Nirmala.

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,260
That’s one of the names of the Goddess also.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:35,040
 

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,640
Purity is a quality which is silent, it speaks in silence.

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,200
 

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,280
It is one of the most non-aggressive activities.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,280
 

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,960
 

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,580
It probes into you.

14
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,000
 

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,580
It doesn’t express in any way,

16
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,400
even love may express in words, it may express in action.

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,060
But this is the one which is expressionless, the purity.

18
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,640
 

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,900
And it washes off all that is impurity.

20
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,740
 

21
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:30,040
You cannot, by rationality, understand how it works out.

22
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,020
 

23
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:40,960
You have to feel it and know it, that it is working out its process.

24
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,760
 

25
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,660
It’s very delicate. Sometimes, it’s flooding also.

26
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,420
 

27
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,760
But is never shocking, never.

28
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:00,020
 

29
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:06,820
When I say that, I find the human ideas have become love addict.

30
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,960
 

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,040
When we will become loved, it's  upside down.

32
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:24,400
When we are plunging into something, we are plunging into something where we are going to get destroyed.

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,240
 

34
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,940
We are upside-down.

35
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,860
 

36
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:38,480
This comes out of impurities, that you cannot see things correctly in their right perspective.

37
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,060
 

38
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:51,940
So let us see what are the things which we think create impurities in us.

39
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,940
 

40
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,960
 

41
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,260
They say it in two words, you see: lust and greed.

42
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,700
 

43
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,580
In Sanskrit, they'll say: "kana, kanaka": "woman and gold".

44
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,100
 

45
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:22,400
But ‘woman’ doesn’t mean: "woman means lust" and "greed means gold".

46
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
 

47
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
 

48
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,660
Now, let us see if  really we've done impurities

49
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,480
or they create impurity in us,

50
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,660
 

51
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:47,040
or why these two things have become the source of impurity to us?

52
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
 

53
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
 

54
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,040
 

55
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,440
 

56
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:03,140
Because we do not understand the right perspective of matter and of sex.

57
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,500
 

58
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:16,720
If we can understand them in right perspective then these two become the source of happiness and joy to us.

59
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,720
 

60
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
 

61
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:26,300
For example, say, a tree, it has two sides:

62
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,340
 

63
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,360
it has the shoot and the root.

64
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:38,120
If the root becomes upward and the shoot becomes downward, it will not survive.

65
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,740
 

66
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,960
Root has to go down into the earth and the shoot has to come up.

67
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,620
 

68
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:56,880
The root has the capacity to suck in the liquids that are inside the soil.

69
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,340
 

70
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:08,280
Also it has capacity to digest all the essential salts necessary for him.

71
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,280
 

72
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,800
Supposing now the root starts malfunctioning

73
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:28,980
and starts sucking the impurities instead of the pure things that are needed for the body of the tree,

74
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,720
 

75
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,060
then what will happen?

76
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,460
There will be malnutrition and the tree will collapse.

77
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:46,760
But the root has the wisdom to pick up the necessary salts for its nourishment.

78
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,480
 

79
00:05:50,480 --> 00:06:02,480
This is where we must understand that we do not have proper feelers for our own nourishment

80
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,120
 

81
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:14,120
and we blame God, or we blame nature, we blame society, we blame cultures, we blame our parents, we blame our governments, we blame this and that.

82
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,180
 

83
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:24,660
Because we have no feelers we suck in that is impure,

84
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,880
 

85
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:35,640
which will create more problems for us than joy and happiness and nourishment.

86
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,820
 

87
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,720
If the tree has to grow

88
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,160
t should avoid all that is poisonous to it, all that is impure.

89
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,160
 

90
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,040
 

91
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,260
And there could be two methods.

92
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,140
If your rationality is that high graded

93
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,040
if your intelligence is of that high calibre,

94
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,760
 

95
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,440
you just deny all that your body which is not good

96
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,820
to your spiritual body, or to your mental body, or to your emotional body, or to your physical body.

97
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:16,200
You just deny it, f you have that much of super intelligence.

98
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,180
But the intelligence has not reached those divine strata,

99
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,420
so we devise compromises easily.

100
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,200
But whom are you harming? You are harming yourself.

101
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,900
 

102
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,720
We go on collecting impurities very fast.

103
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,720
 

104
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
 

105
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,000
And that’s what I call is the human freedom:

106
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,840
 

107
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,440
if he wants he can collect impurities.

108
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,820
A tree is not.

109
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,380
 

110
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,760
It will not collect impurities.

111
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
 

112
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:58,360
But, if impurities invade it, it will die, it cannot protect either.

113
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,320
Human beings have a freedom to choose.

114
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:11,140
Also they have the power to protect from the new impurities.

115
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,700
And Sahaja Yogis, as you know, have much more powers.

116
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,700
 

117
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,060
 

118
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,580
So our roots have to go down, into what?  Into dharma,

119
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,420
into sustaining power of love.

120
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,900
 

121
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:39,340
If that is weak, then the roots are taken off and such people are uprooted.

122
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,900
 

123
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:49,040
In the traditions, in the historical mistakes and errors of our elders,

124
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,800
 

125
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,020
we can see what mistakes they have done and learn from them.

126
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,020
 

127
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,400
And avoid the impurities that they had and destroyed themselves.

128
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:10,020
We can see in big empires fell, crashed, in no time. Why?

129
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,800
What did they do?

130
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,080
 

131
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,080
We are not going to do.

132
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,580
 

133
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:23,080
But so far I've not known any nation that sits down and gets a comprehensive look of the whole picture:

134
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Why that nation has fallen down?

135
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,080
Why these ones destroyed themselves?

136
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,760
 

137
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,460
So far I have not known any political leader of that type.

138
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,460
They’ll do patchwork,

139
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,340
but none of them sit down to see why the whole sky collapsed,

140
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,360
 

141
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,600
what happened to those people who enjoyed so much of power once upon a time, suddenly collapsed.

142
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,400
 

143
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,440
Somebody could sit down like that they would see that they sucked in the impurities.

144
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,960
 

145
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,800
Now how do you suck impurities?

146
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,620
 

147
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,920
You suck them because your feelers become blunt.

148
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,920
 

149
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,280
When your feelers are blunt you don’t know what you are sucking.

150
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,020
 

151
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:21,380
It only is possible when you are lob-headed, it's the word we call.

152
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,840
 

153
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:33,500
In the beginning the body, the mind resist to all that is impure,

154
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,460
 

155
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,200
in most of the cases I would say.

156
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,720
Some of the devils if they are born,

157
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,160
they may be children but their filths are  exceptionnal.

158
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:54,960
But most of the human beings are born in innocence and they resist.

159
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,960
 

160
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:07,000
Gradually you start making your feelers damaged and then the impurity starts coming in.

161
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,780
 

162
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:16,600
All these things start, people say, from desire,

163
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,960
 

164
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,040
clearly.

165
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,580
 

166
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:27,800
Desire to be  the king, desire to be most beautiful person,

167
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,180
desire to be leader of the whole world,

168
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,160
desire to eat, desire to have, possess — all desires.

169
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,580
 

170
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:45,100
But here also, I would say, is an impurity.

171
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,920
 

172
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:53,640
Desire in all of these things is reaching the point that is joy:

173
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,980
 

174
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,720
We desire the joy.

175
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,720
 

176
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,820
 

177
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,940
Desire for joy, if you keep it pure, then you go on getting it

178
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,520
though this is not that spiritual joy,

179
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,220
this is not spiritual joy, we can see it around.

180
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,880
 

181
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,280
Those who are seeking money should go and see

182
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,740
 

183
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,200
if they reach.

184
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,480
You will know they are not people feeling joy like us.

185
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,740
 

186
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,420
And when you go to people who are in joy and in tranquility,

187
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,640
you find they are talking of something else!

188
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,500
 

189
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:54,720
When we have accepted desire as something wrong

190
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,180
 

191
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,820
we also negate the ultimate desire.

192
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,240
 

193
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:09,520
But the essence is "swa", we call the essence as "swa" - "swa" means "self".

194
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,920
 

195
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,300
Essence of everything is that.

196
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,800
 

197
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,840
If you want to have a beautiful tree in front of your house,

198
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,840
the desire is be joyous!

199
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,600
 

200
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,140
What does a tree matter to you if it does not give you joy?

201
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,360
It's like anything in the world as you know.

202
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,420
 

203
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:48,340
That joy, that essence of everything, if it is kept pure,

204
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,340
 

205
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,700
then it’s nourishing you.

206
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,440
Like the trees embed themselves into Mother Earth and suck

207
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,140
 

208
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,840
the beauties of Mother Earth, the essence of Her that they take [insure] for nourishing

209
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,500
 

210
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
and enrich themselves.

211
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,280
 

212
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,860
But that does not mean by any chance, by any meaning,

213
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,080
that you lose your character or individuality, you do not!

214
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,960
You see, a mango tree will be a mango.

215
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,320
 

216
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,960
a banana tree will be a banana.

217
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,840
 

218
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:41,120
Because the outside is different, but inside is the same.

219
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,860
 

220
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:52,400
And in every country the Mother Earth has its own varieties: accordingly, you'll have trees, you'll have plants.

221
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,820
 

222
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,980
You cannot have mango in England.

223
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:02,440
But you cannot have, say,  a birch tree in India.

224
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,000
 

225
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,720
But [it] makes no difference as long as they are truly nourished.

226
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,780
 

227
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:20,080
So your character is not lost, your individuality is not lost, on the contrary, it’s made better.

228
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,220
 

229
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,660
In its purest form, every character is beautiful.

230
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,740
 

231
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,120
Every religion in its purest form is the seat of God

232
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,460
 

233
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:37,200
and the different facets of one diamond that is God.

234
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,380
 

235
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,120
They have to be there and whatever angle you go, you see them sparkling.

236
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,360
 

237
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,360
At every angle, they sparkle.

238
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,500
A diamond sparkles at every angle.

239
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,800
Because it has got its own character

240
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,640
 

241
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,940
and its own variety and its different parts.

242
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,960
 

243
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,640
So the essential unity between them is through the sap which is running.

244
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,440
 

245
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,860
If our attention is on that purity of oneness

246
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,660
 

247
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,380
then it's on many of impurities that have cropped up in ourselves, in our Sahasrara

248
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,380
 

249
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,880
 

250
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,640
The other impurity we suffer from is lots of collectiveness

251
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,640
 

252
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,820
 

253
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:36,720
We don’t mind wearing the same dresses all over the world. If a jeans starts all over the places you'll go, even Japan,

254
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,360
you'll go to Australia, you'll go to, even to China

255
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,500
communist countries, anywhere, the jean everyone is wearing.

256
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,820
 

257
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,900
But the essential unity within us in its purest form, nowhere.

258
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
 

259
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,880
 

260
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,980
Of course these feelers you develop after Sahaja Yoga.

261
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,980
 

262
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,080
But if you have failed in your dharmas,

263
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,540
 

264
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,540
that’s the base, it's the root,

265
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:11,080
if we do not have those roots properly done, then the tree cannot stand.

266
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,820
It is necessary.

267
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,520
 

268
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,460
Of course, incarnation is just the opposite: his roots are in the heavens

269
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,680
 

270
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,220
his flowers on the body.

271
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,940
 

272
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,820
An incarnation does not break its dharma

273
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,820
 

274
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,420
 

275
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,940
it is dharma.

276
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,940
 

277
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,260
He does not need, He’s dharmateet, He’s beyond dharma.

278
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,860
Whatever He does is the religion of the whole world!

279
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,860
 

280
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:48,660
Nothing touches Him. His roots are in the Divine.

281
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,320
Only the Divine Force, there's no question of impurity in them,

282
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,020
 

283
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:58,380
no question of clearing them or bathing

284
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,680
because he is in the Divine

285
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,320
and He’s sucking that out and giving it to you slowly.

286
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,180
It's up side down treatment [unsure]

287
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,200
 

288
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
embedded in you.

289
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
 

290
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,260
 

291
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,980
So for an incarnation there is no dharma, he's beyond dharma,

292
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,160
 

293
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,700
he’s gunateet, he is beyond all moods [gunas]

294
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,700
He’s beyond everything

295
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,480
 

296
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,640
But human beings have to first develop their dharma,

297
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,640
 

298
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:35,200
then rise, rise beyond themselves

299
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
 

300
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
into Collective Consciousness.

301
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,560
 

302
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,260
And when they turn upside down they become incarnations.

303
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,260
 

304
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:47,860
 

305
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,540
It's possible. Two persons have done that

306
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,840
 

307
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,960
so far: Buddha and Mahavira you can call them  as Deities.

308
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,980
 

309
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:04,240
Only these two persons have done it and in Sahaja Yoga if we do that, we might be incarnations [unsure]

310
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,240
 

311
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
 

312
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,960
 

313
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,820
when our roots will be in the Divinity.

314
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,620
 

315
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,740
Here you have to choose,

316
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,520
 

317
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,020
Still, the freedom of choice exists for you.

318
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,080
 

319
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,240
For Me, there is no freedom at all.

320
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,560
I cannot choose the impurity.

321
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,280
 

322
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,560
That’s why I say I've no temptations.

323
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,840
 

324
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,400
I have no sense of possession. I'm planned.

325
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,400
 

326
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,700
So the choise doesn't exist for Me at all of any.

327
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,860
 

328
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,860
I have no time and space.

329
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,740
I am spaceless. I am timeless

330
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,740
because

331
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,220
my roots are in my being.

332
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,220
 

333
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,220
 

334
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,920
But even to have the blossom within yourself

335
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,360
and for others to enjoy,

336
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:08,220
even to nourish yourself, have to have your dharma properly established.

337
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,220
 

338
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,260
So we come to the question of lust and greed.

339
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,660
 

340
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:26,360
Lust and greed are to be seen in this light.

341
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,360
 

342
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,260
Are we lusty of God?

343
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,100
Are we greedy of His wealth?

344
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,100
 

345
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,100
 

346
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,640
If you ask such a question,  then you see the purity.

347
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,140
 

348
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:51,380
We waste so much time thinking about greed  and lust,

349
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:58,860
 

350
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:04,800
but very little time we have to think of this essential desire.

351
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,220
 

352
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:17,360
Now, there are two types of things, one is that of a human being and one of an incarnation.

353
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:23,540
That’s why the behaviour of incarnations cannot determine the behaviour of human beings.

354
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,900
 

355
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,740
This is a very big mistake we have been always committing.

356
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,740
And please beware!

357
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,180
You cannot be incarnations now,

358
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:40,000
and you should not determine your behaviour according to the behaviour of an incarnation.

359
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,960
Because an incarnation is above all these things.

360
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,360
 

361
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,880
It’s a different thing altogether, as I told you.

362
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
 

363
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:55,080
A tree must take its nourishment, or be embedded in the Divine.

364
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,920
 

365
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,340
You have to rise still to that stage

366
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,700
 

367
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,540
where your seats might go into that.

368
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:07,860
And maybe the trees will go and inform the Divine towards that.

369
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,860
 

370
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,500
 

371
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,420
So the patterns of life that are followed by an incarnation

372
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,420
 

373
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,400
 

374
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,600
are always followed  and that's why false religions fail.

375
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,240
 

376
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,960
For example, we’ll say Christ took a hunter in his hand and started lashing at people,

377
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,000
beating them when they were selling God.

378
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,560
I feel the same way and I, I'm doing it.

379
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,260
 

380
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,320
If you read Kabir you will find he’s slashing at all these people.

381
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,320
 

382
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,320
If you read Mohammad sahib, He criticised them.

383
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,740
 

384
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,900
But, you are not,

385
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,680
 

386
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,360
you are not incarnation.

387
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,340
 

388
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,540
In you, when you have those impurities -

389
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,720
 

390
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,840
because what I see, that human beings nurture them within themselves

391
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,800
 

392
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,100
and they like to see the drama in that.

393
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,040
For example, they’ll go to a picture or a drama:

394
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:14,100
they’ll say: "You see a cruel man hitting someone."

395
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,140
And they'll say: "What a cruel man! He is horrid!"

396
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,760
 

397
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,360
But they don’t know, that cruelty they share it in themselves.

398
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,860
 

399
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:26,700
They want to call others cruel, but not the cruelty that exists within them.

400
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,700
 

401
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,660
 

402
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,580
You see, as far as others are concerned they become a witness,

403
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,840
but as far as they are concerned they are not.

404
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,380
If they could be, if they could be a witness to themselves,

405
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,880
 

406
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,280
if they could see themselves

407
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:50,880
then what would happen is that their purifying forces within them would start

408
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,880
specially for Sahaja Yogis,

409
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,580
because it has opened now, the tap is open,

410
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,540
 

411
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,140
the Spirit is emitting just now.

412
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:04,340
Only you see where it has to go if your attention is just put in your being

413
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,820
Just put it, do not justify and say:

414
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:15,380
"My society is bad, my parents are bad, this happened, because of this it has happened, because-" No!

415
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,380
 

416
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,080
 

417
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,180
They are there because you are harbouring them.

418
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,600
In others you can see clearly, but in yourself you cannot see.

419
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,160
 

420
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,480
That is why a human mind is a very funny mind

421
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
 

422
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
which is been evolved that way.

423
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,000
 

424
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,520
You read a book, for example if you read somebody’s book,

425
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,280
immediately you're identified with the hero and never with the villain.

426
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,500
 

427
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,080
We don’t know the villain is much more there than hero inside, you see?

428
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,200
 

429
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,780
It’s a common theme I have seen with human beings, you see, I have now learnt through many lives

430
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,780
and this one what a human being is.

431
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,760
 

432
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,220
Just the opposite is again in an incarnation.

433
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,000
Just the opposite is an incarnation.

434
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,200
 

435
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,620
You see, supposing you have a problem within yourselves,

436
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,120
 

437
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,060
immediately I try to see in myself which kind of problems you have.

438
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,200
 

439
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,960
In my own vastness I correct it and you get it

440
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,820
 

441
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,820
because you are my body.

442
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,920
 

443
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,020
You are within Me, all Sahaja Yogis are within Me,

444
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,020
which I search and find out

445
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,020
 

446
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,520
 

447
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,920
That’s how I do it. And unless and until I'll do it, I don’t feel all right, you have seen it.

448
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,580
 

449
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,680
My problems are very different from yours.

450
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,680
 

451
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,680
 

452
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,900
 

453
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,380
So we have to pay attention to ourselves.

454
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,380
 

455
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,520
But attention in a way which is very pure wisdom

456
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,800
 

457
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,340
is a deeper attention, is not superficial.

458
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,520
 

459
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,500
One should learn to go deep into yourself and see

460
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,060
 

461
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,060
"Are we cruel people?"

462
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,060
 

463
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,060
"Am I cruel? I don't know"

464
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,480
"Which part of me is cruel?"

465
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,220
 

466
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,960
"Which part of mine is harming others?"

467
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,180
Now this boy who came, he wouldn’t take out his socks because he thought there's a fragrance.

468
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:20,800
 

469
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Are we fragrant ourselves?

470
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,240
 

471
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,700
Are we considerate about it that we have different fragrance?

472
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,200
 

473
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,860
It’s a silent process, it’s a stillness inside of you, acting.

474
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,780
 

475
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,780
And this has to be there.

476
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,040
 

477
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,900
And because, as I said, in the western countries you are crashed people

478
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,320
 

479
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,340
 

480
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,620
it is much more necessary for you people to work harder

481
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,700
than the people who are yet to crash down.

482
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,860
They are about to, most of them are coming behind you.

483
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,040
 

484
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:06,080
And you have to announce with a horn: "Now don’t crash! We have crashed like you."

485
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,560
 

486
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,560
That’s very important.

487
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:15,120
Any man who has any consideration, any feeling for others,

488
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,960
 

489
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,520
if he gets hurt by a stone on his way

490
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,840
he’ll immediately stand and say: "Oh, there's a stone here, now go, be careful, don't topple here, be careful."

491
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
 

492
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,000
When we are hurt by certain foolishness and stupidities,

493
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,540
or you can say even the impurities that we have assembled within ourselves,

494
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,220
you see, our own egoistical pursuits,

495
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,080
 

496
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,200
let us announce to the world that we have been foolish.

497
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:51,880
"We have done it, we are broken people, we have broken our hands, we have broken our heads, we have broken our chakras."

498
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,220
"Now you don't, for heaven sake you don't." Because they are following you.

499
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,220
 

500
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,740
 

501
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:04,520
They think you are going on an ascent,  they don’t know that you all had it before.

502
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,620
 

503
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:12,660
In every way possible you have to announce it, but the announcement is expected by people.

504
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,380
You see, it's such a funny world

505
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,120
 

506
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,120
to be a perfect person.

507
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,460
 

508
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,680
So they want also your ascent.

509
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,080
 

510
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,080
This is what the world is, you see.

511
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:32,720
Today, supposing you say: "I was crashed down, I was finished, I have nothing in me to offer you."

512
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
They’ll say: "Then what are you talking about, shut up!"

513
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,700
 

514
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,620
But still, then, you have something to offer, in life.

515
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,800
 

516
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,640
And what do you have to offer is that: "We are crashed." People are not listening.

517
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,300
 

518
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,540
It will help so many people, you don’t know!

519
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,160
 

520
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:59,920
But people will deny you if you say only that. But if you say: "No, I was crashed but I'm complete now."

521
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,220
 

522
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,960
But your being should announce that you are resurrected.

523
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,500
On the contrary, if you are greedy, if you have still the same style now,

524
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,240
 

525
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,180
they are not going to believe.

526
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,640
 

527
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,780
So, Sahaja Yoga has given you that path by which you ascend.

528
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,780
 

529
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:28,900
And when you ascend you can go on along telling people: "Don't fall, don't fall."

530
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,720
 

531
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,640
If you fall it’s difficult to ascend as it has happened to us.

532
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,620
 

533
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,540
So don’t fall! There is a short circuit. Come to the short circuit.

534
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,080
 

535
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,880
Your dharmas must be established,  very necessary. "

536
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,820
 

537
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:57,360
In the whole of these crashed societies, dharmas are to be established.

538
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
What are we doing about it?

539
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:05,600
 

540
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:14,500
In the developing countries, they gather up their impurities by a wrong premise [unsure] that they have.

541
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,200
 

542
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:22,300
They think: "Oh we must develop. We must have cars, we must have telephones."

543
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,460
 

544
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:30,160
You see, the wole attention is: "How effective you are as far as your material things are concerned."

545
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,780
 

546
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:38,020
which is, when they start getting rid of their poverty, they just forget why did they remove that poverty for.

547
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,300
 

548
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:47,620
It would be like a bridegroom who has to be ready to be married.

549
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,220
 

550
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,540
Then they dress him up, put a tie over there

551
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,620
 

552
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,620
Now, he's ready to marry.

553
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,120
 

554
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,300
He's married.

555
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,740
Now the night has come, he has to meet his wife.

556
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,580
 

557
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,820
Still, he is carrying on with his dress like a fool.

558
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,520
 

559
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,680
Why did he marry? To love his wife.

560
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,120
 

561
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,760
Like a fool he's still, he's in his attire, proud of these outer things [unsure] that have been done to him,

562
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,760
not understanding it has a meaning.

563
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,580
 

564
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,580
We remove poverty for what?

565
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,700
We remove all these problems for what?

566
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,700
We develop for what?

567
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,740
We develop so that our day to day life becomes easier and we have time for God,

568
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,600
 

569
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,600
we have time for meditation.
