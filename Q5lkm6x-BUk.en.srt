Public Program The Nabhi Chakra

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,360
New Delhi – India January 31, 1983

4
00:00:11,452 --> 00:00:17,583
The music was very fine and elevating to all of you.

5
00:00:20,782 --> 00:00:24,105
The effect of music in Sahaja Yoga is tremendous,

6
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:27,493
and if a Sahaja Yogi sings the song

7
00:00:27,537 --> 00:00:28,993
it's so great that it acts like a mantra upon My being.

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,549
So I'm very thankful to Mrs. Venogopalan

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,704
for singing such a beautiful song today. It stirred Me completely.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,438
Then Gavin Brown was very sweet. He's an Englishman, very gentle

11
00:00:46,804 --> 00:00:48,772
and a very steady Sahaja Yogi. 

12
00:00:50,126 --> 00:00:53,782
He's one of the first Western Sahaja Yogis

13
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:55,782
I met.

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,960
Today I will tell you about the Nabhi Chakra which deals

15
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,890
with this honesty of seeking.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,850
Nabhi Chakra is the center which controls

17
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:20,591
or manifests outside in the gross as

18
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:30,539
Solar Plexus. Nabhi Chakra has two sides: one is the left,

19
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,594
another the right, and one in the center.

20
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:40,365
So on the left hand side is the Gruha Lakshmi,

21
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,401
on the right hand side is the Raja Lakshmi

22
00:01:43,446 --> 00:01:48,138
or Gaja Lakshmi and in the center is the Lakshmi

23
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,553
which ascends into Mahalakshmi.

24
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:08,767
When the seeking starts, a human being

25
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:13,091
first starts seeking food.

26
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:21,196
Food is very important for all the animals. If they have no food

27
00:02:25,803 --> 00:02:32,615
then they cannot exist. So the seeking starts

28
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:40,816
with food, and when the shelter is sought, they try to find the water.

29
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:51,958
So this center is made of water

30
00:02:56,283 --> 00:03:05,521
and in this center resides the Deity of Shri Vishnu or Narayana;

31
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:18,272
and His power, as I told you, is Lakshmi and then Mahalakshmi.

32
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:22,549
You will find out in Sahaja Yoga

33
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:30,788
that gradually you start developing one power and then the other.

34
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:36,661
Everyone who comes to Sahaja Yoga, if they are truthful

35
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:41,851
and not involved with any wrong things,

36
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:47,501
then definitely they are helped in Lakshmi Tattwa,

37
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:50,802
means their well-being is looked after.

38
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:54,309
As Krishna has said, "yogakshema vahaamya."

39
00:03:55,164 --> 00:03:58,514
So He looks after the kshema part of it.

40
00:03:59,112 --> 00:04:02,006
Everyone who has been to Sahaja Yoga

41
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:04,224
has been helped miraculously

42
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:07,781
also in the Lakshmi Tattwa, that means materially.

43
00:04:09,192 --> 00:04:11,152
In so many ways they are helped,

44
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,333
that one has to just see for themselves

45
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:16,417
how these miracles take place.

46
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:26,277
An example is of a villager who had a small little holding of land

47
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:33,330
and he was living hand to mouth every day.

48
00:04:34,724 --> 00:04:38,489
When he came to Me, after some time I found

49
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,555
he would bring one garland,

50
00:04:40,607 --> 00:04:42,999
big garland, for Me every evening.

51
00:04:43,443 --> 00:04:46,656
And he was away in the village every day he would attend My program.

52
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:53,071
I was quite surprised that how could he afford it, and I asked him,

53
00:04:53,517 --> 00:04:57,275
"How can you afford a garland for Me every day?

54
00:04:57,356 --> 00:04:59,030
You shouldn't bring it, it's not proper."

55
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:02,819
So he said, "Mother, You know everything."

56
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:04,663
I said, "Why, what happened?"

57
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:10,737
He said, "I have a plot of land next to mine

58
00:05:10,796 --> 00:05:14,292
which we never used because it was absolutely a barren land -

59
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,327
little bit, not much big land, but a small land, piece of land.

60
00:05:20,873 --> 00:05:24,038
And after Realization I used to always go

61
00:05:24,462 --> 00:05:27,753
walk over it bare feet to plough this little

62
00:05:28,047 --> 00:05:29,789
piece of land that I had.

63
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:35,231
After some time when I was coming here after that,

64
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:38,801
one gentleman came to see me and he said that

65
00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:41,780
“This piece of land that you have is very precious.“

66
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,840
He said, “What's the problem?” He said that

67
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:54,084
“I have a kiln of bricks, and I have seen that even

68
00:05:54,615 --> 00:06:02,764
by chance – Sahaja - we mixed a little clay from this soil,

69
00:06:02,847 --> 00:06:07,637
from this part of the land that you have,

70
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,652
and we found that our bricks have become so good and so strong

71
00:06:13,252 --> 00:06:14,843
that we would like to purchase

72
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,508
this clay from you at the price of seers."

73
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:23,773
And that's how he started getting money sufficient

74
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:29,905
for him and he became much better off.

75
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:34,580
But in Sahaja Yoga one has to remember you don't go to extremes,

76
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,529
in any principle.

77
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:40,141
That is one thing people should know, that you don't go to extremes.

78
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:44,032
You don't become extremely rich.

79
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:48,489
I've seen those people who are extremely rich,

80
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,633
when they come to Sahaja Yoga, they are a big headache,

81
00:06:51,168 --> 00:06:54,309
very big headache. If they are sick,

82
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:57,079
if you cure them of their heart trouble,

83
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:00,445
then they try to possess you.

84
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,566
They will get all the heart patients, they will get

85
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:05,219
all kinds of patients to you,

86
00:07:05,476 --> 00:07:08,217
you go on tolerating it, they try to possess you.

87
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,743
They immediately start talking about their cures

88
00:07:10,776 --> 00:07:13,292
to everyone, they publish in papers, this thing, that thing,

89
00:07:13,688 --> 00:07:17,437
it's impossible. And they just try to overpower you.

90
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:18,632
Without any appointment

91
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,610
they'll arrive and they would expect you to attend to them immediately,

92
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,637
it's terrible.

93
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,277
And then they’ll send all their relations for cure

94
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:32,479
and you have to show all patience,

95
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:34,740
all their friends, they become like agents.

96
00:07:36,245 --> 00:07:41,567
All their patients, all their relations, all their friends,

97
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:45,825
they want to oblige them and spare

98
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:49,054
no love, no affection, nothing further.

99
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:54,818
The Sahaja Yogis, if they try

100
00:07:55,068 --> 00:07:57,509
to say that “No, you shouldn't do like that and all that,"

101
00:07:57,948 --> 00:07:59,026
they feel insulted.

102
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,703
And they all try curing much faster

103
00:08:05,575 --> 00:08:07,096
than anybody else does.

104
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,361
They themselves are weak,

105
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,875
they are sick people themselves,

106
00:08:10,362 --> 00:08:12,072
heart patient, this patient, that,

107
00:08:12,216 --> 00:08:14,280
but if you tell them, “Don't cure,” they'll feel bad.

108
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,038
If you don't tell them,

109
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:17,817
they'll get sick and you'll have another problem.

110
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:21,616
They never try to understand Sahaja Yoga in it's big way.

111
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:29,446
They just want to see it according to their own way of ego

112
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:32,922
that they have accumulated with their money,

113
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:37,154
and they never know how they go on hurting

114
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:43,557
everyone by overpowering Me all the time.

115
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:48,052
It's very amazing, whenever I cure a rich man,

116
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:51,247
I've been wanting to run away from that person.

117
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:54,656
I would never go to their house, I would not like to eat in their house.

118
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:56,547
It's a very bad thing.

119
00:08:59,187 --> 00:09:03,822
So too much of riches is also not okay

120
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,246
because it gives you a tremendous

121
00:09:07,618 --> 00:09:09,380
ego that you don't see yourself,

122
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,056
and anybody tries to say anything protect oneself,

123
00:09:12,144 --> 00:09:15,837
then such a person feels insulted or humiliated.

124
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:21,307
Not only that, but they try to hold Me and hold the whole thing

125
00:09:21,388 --> 00:09:25,926
according to their business ways which is impossible.

126
00:09:26,295 --> 00:09:27,771
See, they have to gain money,

127
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:31,285
they have another attitude because they are miserly.

128
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,378
I don't have to earn money or anything.

129
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,768
If I am doing anything, I’m, really,

130
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:37,887
in a way, I'm obliging. Isn't it?

131
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:42,447
But they will force on Me all their rules and regulations, everything,

132
00:09:42,477 --> 00:09:44,197
without having their own discipline.

133
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:47,751
So very rich people in Sahaja Yoga

134
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:52,313
so far have been extremely troublesome,

135
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:55,736
I should say, to Me and to the whole organization.

136
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:57,834
They are very narrow-minded.

137
00:09:58,363 --> 00:10:02,993
They cannot see the big vision that I have before Me.

138
00:10:04,324 --> 00:10:08,124
Whatever little ideas they have about themselves and about their

139
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,028
own thinking, reading, they will try to push onto Sahaja Yoga.

140
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,574
It's not My experience once, but many a times.

141
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:19,686
Then somehow or other it so happens that they drop out.

142
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,030
So, too much richness gives you a tremendous ego, worse than

143
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:28,042
even, I would say, a bulldog.

144
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,520
It’s impossible for a rich man to see

145
00:10:32,741 --> 00:10:37,221
that all these riches are outside him. They are not inside him.

146
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:42,896
He has to be rich in heart to understand compassion.

147
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:46,357
Compassion doesn't mean that you give alms to others,

148
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:49,298
or if you give money to others, it's not that.

149
00:10:50,314 --> 00:10:53,143
On the contrary, you just have beggars by doing that.

150
00:10:55,074 --> 00:10:57,074
Compassion is that works,

151
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,531
compassion is that flows,

152
00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:05,379
compassion is that manifests.

153
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:09,661
It is not in compassion where you can make it materialize it,

154
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,575
“All right, come along I'll give you a hundred rupees.”

155
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:16,594
On the contrary, giving somebody a hundred rupees is the worst thing.

156
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:20,965
I have tried this with some Sahaja Yogis who were with Me.

157
00:11:21,657 --> 00:11:25,132
I tried to give them some money some time as they were very poor.

158
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,209
They became horrid.

159
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:33,306
Some of them started drinking,

160
00:11:33,418 --> 00:11:35,787
some of them took to some other ways and they became

161
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,386
sort of addicted to money. It was impossible.

162
00:11:38,594 --> 00:11:41,436
And they tried to spoil as many Sahaj Yogis as they could.

163
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:48,873
So such people if they come, it's impossible to manage them.

164
00:11:50,547 --> 00:11:53,386
They are not Sahaja Yogis because they are asahaja.

165
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:57,093
They are still sticking to the idea that they have so much money,

166
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,660
that they are so rich and they can overpower everyone with money.

167
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,770
Not Me, I'm sorry.

168
00:12:07,438 --> 00:12:14,842
But only thing I feel sorry for them that they cannot get to God.

169
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:21,436
There is no honesty of seeking in them, there is no honesty of seeking.

170
00:12:22,337 --> 00:12:25,465
The elite people whom I have addressed

171
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:27,713
so many places like this, because

172
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:32,190
some people whom I have cured wanted Me to address the elite,

173
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,763
so-called. I think they are elated, to Me what they are.

174
00:12:36,862 --> 00:12:39,905
They don't want to be in Sahaja Yoga.

175
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:42,387
They are already eliminated, I sometimes feel.

176
00:12:42,464 --> 00:12:46,413
Thousands of them I've addressed, I've wasted My time with them.

177
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,462
They are good for nothing, absolutely empty people.

178
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:56,447
They are very happy because they have a few cars,

179
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,459
or some houses or something like that.

180
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:04,207
I too have all these things, I would say so-called riches.

181
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:07,535
I have always seen from My father's side

182
00:13:07,723 --> 00:13:09,530
and from My husband's side.

183
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,662
I don't understand what is there to be proud of this emptiness.

184
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:19,650
But human beings are such, a empty vessel makes a big sound,

185
00:13:20,293 --> 00:13:24,870
in the same way, an empty rich man makes a very big sound.

186
00:13:29,762 --> 00:13:33,970
Not that the very poor are also good,

187
00:13:34,618 --> 00:13:36,618
because those who are extremely poor

188
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,160
are busy with their food problems.

189
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,596
They have little, little problems and their values are still have to

190
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,941
come up to a point.

191
00:13:45,316 --> 00:13:48,720
It's only in the middle you can work out Sahaja Yoga better.

192
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:52,400
Those who are extremely rich and proud

193
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,425
cannot come to Sahaja Yoga easily.

194
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:58,495
Those who are very poor also cannot come to Sahaja Yoga.

195
00:13:59,026 --> 00:14:05,333
But when this middle part of the river is enriched

196
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,162
and starts flowing well, then it spreads on the sides

197
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:09,777
and then it can engulf.

198
00:14:09,978 --> 00:14:12,721
But you cannot  start it the other way round. I have tried.

199
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:14,270
I have tried both ways

200
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,932
and I have told you what happened.

201
00:14:16,058 --> 00:14:17,303
Whom I gave money,

202
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:19,909
whom I tried to help through giving money

203
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:23,837
became wayward, useless, frivolous people,

204
00:14:24,387 --> 00:14:29,853
got lost to Sahaja Yoga. And those whom I thought

205
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:31,925
were moneyed and satisfied people

206
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:36,395
had another role to play is to possess Me all the time,

207
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,028
to use Me all the time whenever they wanted,

208
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:42,968
for whatever purpose they wanted to use Me.

209
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,105
And they must know, you cannot possess Me, you cannot possess Me,

210
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:53,354
but this kind of an ignorance

211
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:55,691
still in their minds is that they can possess God,

212
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:56,861
they can possess everyone.

213
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:05,113
For such people there are no reasons

214
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:08,175
to come to Sahaja Yoga, to be very frank.

215
00:15:08,932 --> 00:15:10,956
And even if they come to Sahaja Yog

216
00:15:11,926 --> 00:15:16,234
they have to know that for Mother richness of heart,

217
00:15:16,793 --> 00:15:18,793
understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

218
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,546
humility, non-possessiveness are very important.

219
00:15:28,664 --> 00:15:37,726
In this ascent of yours, money is not important at all.

220
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:41,802
Even if you are poor or rich, you get your Realization.

221
00:15:42,215 --> 00:15:47,376
For example, I went to Maharashtra, most of them are,

222
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,507
I would say, very poor people

223
00:15:51,686 --> 00:15:52,926
in the sense that 

224
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,187
they are not middle class at all. They are not educated,

225
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,128
they are sometimes factory workers

226
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:05,450
or they have small holdings. Not very rich.

227
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:09,831
But they are very good Sahaja Yogis, excellent Sahaja Yogis.

228
00:16:10,523 --> 00:16:13,368
They have such beautiful eyes

229
00:16:13,677 --> 00:16:17,388
and such beautiful feeling and such compassion

230
00:16:18,364 --> 00:16:25,002
that Lakshmi Tattwa is absolutely balanced in them.

231
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:30,171
You know that Lakshmi is shown to be a lady,

232
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:34,391
and lady who is a mother.

233
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,344
Mother doesn't care whether you are rich or poor.

234
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,401
If her one son is rich and another is poor,

235
00:16:42,675 --> 00:16:46,284
she'll pay more attention to the poor and ask the rich

236
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:48,761
to give his money to the poor also.

237
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,827
She is not bothered. If somebody is in need,

238
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:55,482
she will be the first to help the person who needs.

239
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,146
Now this is a spiritual thing in the spiritual life.

240
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:03,136
The person who is a real seeker,

241
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,198
who is a truthful seeker, the Mother will go out of the way

242
00:17:09,635 --> 00:17:13,523
to be with that person. And those who are not honest about it,

243
00:17:14,172 --> 00:17:16,726
Mother will try somehow or other cut them short.

244
00:17:22,544 --> 00:17:27,686
The problem that lies with human beings is

245
00:17:28,243 --> 00:17:30,743
that they do not know what they want.

246
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,703
They think they want first of all money.

247
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:37,276
But those who have money,

248
00:17:37,546 --> 00:17:38,971
they think they must have power.

249
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:41,746
If they have too much money, they think that they must go into politics

250
00:17:42,172 --> 00:17:43,874
because they have had no power.

251
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,961
Then they fail in politics, or say they become too much in politics,

252
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:52,807
whatever it is, then they want love from their children

253
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:56,320
which they can't get, because they are too busy or something like that.

254
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,916
So they don't know what they want.

255
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:05,835
Those who believe that by having money will be better off,

256
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,967
should listen to all these people who have come from affluent countries

257
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:09,995
and they will tell you

258
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:12,024
how things have gone wrong there,

259
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,545
how people are ruined, what's going wrong with them,

260
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:17,209
absolutely they are in a bad shape.

261
00:18:19,324 --> 00:18:21,606
You cannot call them human beings

262
00:18:22,011 --> 00:18:25,155
because they are so cruel, they kill even their own children,

263
00:18:25,463 --> 00:18:27,546
and that society tolerates such people.

264
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:30,300
In India if you hear somebody

265
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,202
killing a child, 

266
00:18:31,232 --> 00:18:34,196
I have never heard so far in the sixty years of My life,

267
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:38,677
but supposing you hear someone has killed his daughter or son,

268
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:41,245
nobody will ever look at that person.

269
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:44,279
He will not be allowed in the society, nobody will even

270
00:18:44,394 --> 00:18:49,267
give any girl in the marriage to

271
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:53,584
his daughter or a son. He'll be absolutely barred from the society.

272
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:58,691
No one can think of such a relationship between children and parents.

273
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,996
And then there are funny relationships also,

274
00:19:02,316 --> 00:19:03,788
it's something so absurd,

275
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:07,331
on both the sides on cruelty and on morality,

276
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:10,757
they are so absurd, it's impossible to understand.

277
00:19:11,513 --> 00:19:15,235
So money has given this ego and they say, “What's wrong?

278
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:20,111
What’s wrong?” It's absolutely malignant attitude.

279
00:19:20,563 --> 00:19:22,226
When you say, “What's wrong?” that means

280
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,266
you do not want to keep your relationship with the whole.

281
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:29,543
You do not want to keep your relationship

282
00:19:29,956 --> 00:19:37,522
with the Primordial One, the One who has you,

283
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:42,148
everyone within Himself. You are part and parcel of the whole,

284
00:19:42,296 --> 00:19:43,970
and how can you say, “What's wrong?

285
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,842
I do what I like.” You just become like a malignant cell.

286
00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:53,515
So at the Nabhi Chakra one has to know

287
00:19:53,979 --> 00:19:57,683
that one should not hanker after money too much.

288
00:19:58,979 --> 00:20:01,568
Now those who hanker too much after money,

289
00:20:03,364 --> 00:20:09,699
may develop their right side better, they may have money, no doubt.

290
00:20:10,665 --> 00:20:15,054
But they miss their left side. Left side is Gruha Lakshmi,

291
00:20:16,254 --> 00:20:18,260
they have no Gruha Lakshmi in their house.

292
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:21,483
They are very hectic people, they run about,

293
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,368
they run the rat race, they get heart attacks,

294
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:27,953
if not heart attacks, they will get leukemia,

295
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:32,619
they'll get diabetes, liver, all such things,

296
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:39,254
because their attention is on money and not on God.

297
00:20:39,826 --> 00:20:42,440
So either you are on the right or on the left.

298
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:48,296
Those who are very emotional people,

299
00:20:48,505 --> 00:20:52,263
extremely emotional, more worried about their family;

300
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:54,290
for them family is everything,

301
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:57,106
the relations are everything, they are like that,

302
00:20:57,201 --> 00:20:59,645
they may not have so much of Lakshmi because they distribute

303
00:20:59,722 --> 00:21:05,559
all the Lakshmi. But still they are better people. But sometimes

304
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:07,432
such people who sacrifice

305
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,965
so much for others, 

306
00:21:09,443 --> 00:21:12,542
give up everything that they have, can become crazy

307
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:16,368
because they’ll find people do not reciprocate,

308
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,521
they do not return their love, 

309
00:21:18,793 --> 00:21:20,809
they do not understand what they have done.

310
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,407
So going to the extreme of helping others can cause

311
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:28,224
trouble to the person who does this job, and also trouble to people

312
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:30,120
who have taken free money from him,

313
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,446
because if you distribute free money to people what will happen?

314
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:37,492
I'll give you a simple example of America helping India.

315
00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:41,948
When Americans helped India,

316
00:21:42,096 --> 00:21:44,546
they thought they were doing a great favor to Indians,

317
00:21:44,773 --> 00:21:47,428
which was a wrong thing. Because whatever they did

318
00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:50,777
whatever they did was lost in the wilderness.

319
00:21:51,205 --> 00:21:53,428
Nobody tried to maintain it, it was free.

320
00:21:55,928 --> 00:21:58,276
But by giving that they showed the contempt,

321
00:22:00,578 --> 00:22:04,242
and when they gave some wheat and rice to India

322
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:06,681
there was no grace about it, because

323
00:22:06,928 --> 00:22:09,591
then put some sort of a seed in it

324
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,757
which creted two horrible things in the villages.

325
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,571
One was called as congress grass

326
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,805
because it came from America.

327
00:22:18,448 --> 00:22:23,487
And another was called as a mad acacia.

328
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:28,473
Babool, as we call it, mad babool. These trees

329
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,801
have gown so much in the villages

330
00:22:30,823 --> 00:22:32,628
that they don't know what to do with them.

331
00:22:32,868 --> 00:22:36,266
They have such big, big thorns that anyone who is stung by them

332
00:22:36,682 --> 00:22:39,168
can even die. They are very poisonous

333
00:22:39,738 --> 00:22:41,251
and if the children get it,

334
00:22:41,303 --> 00:22:45,895
they get such poisonous problems that they cannot be cured.

335
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:49,068
This is how American government has helped us.

336
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:52,836
Now who's going to tell them what you have done so ungraciously?

337
00:22:53,077 --> 00:22:56,463
It was better to starve than to get any help from anyone.

338
00:22:57,886 --> 00:23:01,943
Long time back I had said that it is better to starve in this country

339
00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:05,766
than to get any help from these wretched, horrible

340
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,273
Western countries who think no end of themselves.

341
00:23:10,251 --> 00:23:12,562
You just pamper their ego for nothing at all.

342
00:23:12,993 --> 00:23:15,974
What have they got? They have just plastic affluence.

343
00:23:16,613 --> 00:23:19,967
But this ego out of money makes them so stupid

344
00:23:21,012 --> 00:23:24,065
that they don't know what's happening in their own country.

345
00:23:24,456 --> 00:23:26,911
How their country’s going down in every way.

346
00:23:27,485 --> 00:23:30,047
How their people are going down. Either they are in

347
00:23:30,094 --> 00:23:31,912
fear or they are abandoned.

348
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:34,866
Otherwise they are communist

349
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:38,242
or they are so-called capitalist

350
00:23:38,356 --> 00:23:39,905
where they are just abandoned.

351
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,351
If you go and see that country,

352
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,236
I mean you can't sit like this anywhere and talk in the outside,

353
00:23:46,288 --> 00:23:49,328
somebody might come and murder somebody.

354
00:23:49,543 --> 00:23:51,731
If you walk in the dark you can be murdered.

355
00:23:51,827 --> 00:23:55,748
In America, so called advanced country of America, in New York City.

356
00:23:59,134 --> 00:24:02,331
So this kind of riches we are trying to aspire, especially

357
00:24:02,611 --> 00:24:05,819
people in Delhi are very anxious to aspire lot of money.

358
00:24:07,677 --> 00:24:10,614
I don't know why Punjabis, Gujaratis

359
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,133
and Maarwadis have taken to this.

360
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,602
Maarwadis are another style.

361
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:20,233
How the Punjabis and the Gujaratis

362
00:24:21,053 --> 00:24:23,153
are trying to acquire the money.

363
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:26,967
And when I see them abroad I

364
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,887
just don't know if they are anywhere near India.

365
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:36,881
Horrid people they. They have no culture left in them that is Indian.

366
00:24:37,306 --> 00:24:39,004
They are absolutely outward.

367
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,997
They think no end of themselves, 

368
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:44,556
they think they have reached the heavens.

369
00:24:45,871 --> 00:24:48,104
Then if you see their Nabhi Chakra,

370
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:51,458
you'll be amazed, all of them suffer from horrible livers,

371
00:24:51,761 --> 00:24:56,086
high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attacks

372
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,905
and they drink like fish, especially Sardargis.

373
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:04,711
I was surprised who are supposed to be in the name of God,

374
00:25:05,332 --> 00:25:07,407
they drink like fish.

375
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,917
They are very particular about wearing a Puggadi and a Dhari,

376
00:25:11,952 --> 00:25:13,547
but while drinking they don't mind.

377
00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:17,642
Every Sardargi you go to has a big bar in his house,

378
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:19,036
where even a lord

379
00:25:19,057 --> 00:25:21,430
does not have because it is regarded as very vulgar in England.

380
00:25:22,475 --> 00:25:25,451
Without learning any aesthetics of that country,

381
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:30,488
they have become just like a agriculture there is no culture

382
00:25:35,112 --> 00:25:36,313
is the fact,

383
00:25:37,207 --> 00:25:39,504
this is what money has done to them, they have 

384
00:25:39,637 --> 00:25:41,134
no respect for themselves.

385
00:25:42,273 --> 00:25:46,296
So this Lakshmi Tattwa is to be balanced. Same about these

386
00:25:46,524 --> 00:25:48,359
Gujaratis who have gone.

387
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:50,702
Another kind lives here, the Maarwadis.

388
00:25:50,775 --> 00:25:53,228
Less said the better about these horrible Maarwadis.

389
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,996
I don't think anyone of them will ever get Realization

390
00:25:57,169 --> 00:25:59,169
or a place in the Kingdom of God.

391
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,673
They are blood suckers.

392
00:26:06,582 --> 00:26:09,630
They are not human beings. For money's sake, they'll

393
00:26:09,783 --> 00:26:14,455
suck the blood like juice, suck the blood, and now they had a nice time.

394
00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:23,469
This is not a world for you to seek money.

395
00:26:23,908 --> 00:26:26,055
You have come on this earth as a human being

396
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:30,349
to seek God, to seek your Spirit, to be one with your Self,

397
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,660
to be in that peaceful place

398
00:26:33,662 --> 00:26:38,065
which is the Kingdom of God, which is the Kingdom of Heaven,

399
00:26:38,616 --> 00:26:41,538
and not to jump into a mire

400
00:26:41,718 --> 00:26:43,148
which looks very beautiful

401
00:26:44,911 --> 00:26:52,169
but is not really beautiful. It's agonizing, it's terrorizing.

402
00:26:52,285 --> 00:26:55,021
People can't sleep if they have too much money,

403
00:26:55,522 --> 00:26:57,422
because they don't know what to do with that.

404
00:26:57,452 --> 00:26:59,702
Here also all those who have got money,

405
00:27:00,111 --> 00:27:02,541
they don't know when the income tax will come on them.

406
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,471
I have solved My income tax problem by having no income at all.

407
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,656
I have no income, no income tax,

408
00:27:13,034 --> 00:27:16,029
so I'm not worried about the Income Tax Commissioner.

409
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,251
He cannot control Me.

410
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:23,006
Best is not to have more income

411
00:27:23,504 --> 00:27:25,331
that is to be taxed, otherwise you’ll have

412
00:27:25,351 --> 00:27:26,768
to have another income tax

413
00:27:29,576 --> 00:27:31,691
lawyer that My brother is.

414
00:27:31,996 --> 00:27:36,026
I told him, “I don't need you at all, all My life, thank you very much.”

415
00:27:37,144 --> 00:27:43,657
You get so absolutely free, on top of the world if you have no income.

416
00:27:46,497 --> 00:27:53,497
Like if you want to solve your car problem, never learn driving.

417
00:27:54,055 --> 00:27:59,797
Somebody drives you down or nothing, you can walk with your feet.

418
00:28:01,077 --> 00:28:03,766
The accumulation of all these nonsensical things

419
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,991
have caused us all this tension, so-called:

420
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,612
“How much we have to pay, what is the income tax,

421
00:28:12,935 --> 00:28:15,835
tomorrow the police is going to come in my house?”

422
00:28:16,364 --> 00:28:18,133
If they come to Me I'll say, “All right,

423
00:28:18,327 --> 00:28:20,903
have everything that you can. Nothing there,

424
00:28:21,924 --> 00:28:27,374
certain bills which I have not paid, that's all.” Just let them pay.

425
00:28:30,282 --> 00:28:33,057
One has to live with complete freedom in this world.

426
00:28:33,726 --> 00:28:37,497
And to achieve that freedom, one has to know that

427
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:41,286
the priorities should be all right. If money is your priority,

428
00:28:41,462 --> 00:28:47,584
you have it. No, not Me. If you want to give Me money,

429
00:28:47,778 --> 00:28:50,818
“No Sir,” I won't at any cost.

430
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:55,339
You can give Me flowers, this, that, all right, but no money at all.

431
00:28:57,198 --> 00:29:01,664
I don't want to know about money at all, it's a headache.

432
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:12,784
In the same way, we do not realize that having relationships -

433
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:18,397
brother, sister or son, this and that - is another big headache.

434
00:29:20,932 --> 00:29:23,066
That doesn't mean that you should start beating them,

435
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:28,305
but people can sell their country for the sake of their children.

436
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,929
It’s a very dangerous thing, horrible,

437
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,098
that kind of an attachment, the mamatva (ownership).

438
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,243
This is my son, finished.

439
00:29:40,729 --> 00:29:43,540
If he's your son then you can murder anyone you feel like,

440
00:29:43,571 --> 00:29:46,206
you can do what you like because he is your son.

441
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:49,128
He is not somebody's son whom you are murdering?

442
00:29:51,358 --> 00:29:53,932
This mamatva that comes - “My husband.”

443
00:29:53,962 --> 00:29:55,206
Specially our Indian women.

444
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,476
“My husband” immediately starts problem.

445
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:11,460
All this comes out of ignorance. Of course, love has to be there.

446
00:30:12,306 --> 00:30:14,306
But love never gives you attachment,

447
00:30:15,535 --> 00:30:23,573
because it is wise, it is wisdom. Supposing in a tree the sap of the tree

448
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:28,589
goes and gets fixed in one fruit because it loves. “It's mine.”

449
00:30:29,023 --> 00:30:31,920
Then what happens to the rest of the tree? It dies

450
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:33,846
and that fruit also dies.

451
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:40,176
So this mamatva has to go out.

452
00:30:40,942 --> 00:30:42,837
But by telling it will not go,

453
00:30:44,954 --> 00:30:47,078
by just advising it will not go.

454
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:50,188
Even if you suffer, I have seen so many people coming to Me,

455
00:30:50,578 --> 00:30:53,887
“My own father deceived me.

456
00:30:54,468 --> 00:30:58,197
My own son deceived me.” I said, “Which one is your own?

457
00:30:58,797 --> 00:31:01,771
The one who deceived you is not your own.”

458
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,685
“My husband.”

459
00:31:06,122 --> 00:31:09,260
There are some ladies who eat My head out of their husbands.

460
00:31:10,897 --> 00:31:15,639
“My husband did this, my husband did this, my husband did this.”

461
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,917
Baba, why don't you hit him hard and finish with it?

462
00:31:22,191 --> 00:31:31,203
But it's so much accepted, this mamatva, this attachment.

463
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:38,203
Attachment to money, attachment to people, attachment to this

464
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:46,774
is nothing but a hook which hooks you to baser levels.

465
00:31:47,716 --> 00:31:56,889
You have to rise above, and then you really enjoy the beauty of richness.

466
00:31:57,802 --> 00:32:01,733
As I told you the other day, I see all beautiful things.

467
00:32:01,765 --> 00:32:05,471
It's nice I don't possess them. See now these carpets are spread here.

468
00:32:06,254 --> 00:32:09,310
If they were Mine, I should worry, “Oh God, now

469
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:11,696
I hope they are not going to be spoilt.

470
00:32:12,411 --> 00:32:14,446
I hope nobody sits on them.

471
00:32:15,557 --> 00:32:20,271
I hope they are insured, so nobody runs away with that.”

472
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:23,369
But when they don't belong to Me, I'm enjoying them better.

473
00:32:25,139 --> 00:32:27,578
Other people's things is a better idea.

474
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:35,182
This myth carries us to such an extent of stupidity

475
00:32:37,063 --> 00:32:41,507
that sometimes I feel whether these human beings are human beings,

476
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:46,339
or they are their possessions. Their Spirit is lost,

477
00:32:47,864 --> 00:32:51,936
everything is lost, they're not bothered.

478
00:32:52,921 --> 00:32:57,473
But if their little position is lost, they weep and wail,

479
00:32:57,696 --> 00:33:01,689
as if they are dead, their forefathers are dead hundred times.

480
00:33:06,052 --> 00:33:10,090
But people like Me are just batchas, emperors.

481
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:17,306
They are not bothered. To them comfort cannot capture,

482
00:33:18,213 --> 00:33:22,170
they don’t need any comfort. If you have comfort

483
00:33:22,748 --> 00:33:25,832
it crawls upon you, it makes you a slave, too.

484
00:33:26,228 --> 00:33:30,594
If you seek comfort you are in for enslavement,

485
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,091
take it from Me. Any kind of comfort.

486
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:40,952
It's only human beings who can become really so crazy.

487
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:45,351
No animal can become. There is another type of a comfort,

488
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:51,394
is that a mental idea

489
00:33:51,603 --> 00:33:53,854
that everybody must appreciate,

490
00:33:54,105 --> 00:33:57,567
and that you should be able to overpower others.

491
00:33:57,821 --> 00:34:00,442
This also comes I think from Nabhi Chakra.

492
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:03,598
Is a kind of a feeling

493
00:34:03,738 --> 00:34:06,317
that you should be able to overpower many people, 

494
00:34:06,354 --> 00:34:07,228
they should look at you.

495
00:34:07,684 --> 00:34:11,044
These days in London there are women who are suffering from

496
00:34:11,153 --> 00:34:13,785
a funny disease called anorexia, where they just don't eat.

497
00:34:15,551 --> 00:34:19,252
Women just don't eat because they should be thin and skinny.

498
00:34:19,278 --> 00:34:21,951
For what? For what you should be thin and skinny?

499
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,681
Because you look attractive, but for what?

500
00:34:28,687 --> 00:34:31,534
I don't think skinny people look attractive by any chance.

501
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:35,416
Horrible they are. They create only pity

502
00:34:35,503 --> 00:34:39,262
and you feel you know repulsive about the whole stuff.

503
00:34:40,598 --> 00:34:45,661
Once a beauty queen came to see Me. I thought she was a T.B. patient.

504
00:34:49,176 --> 00:34:53,756
And I said, “You look all right but it seems you are a T.B. patient.”

505
00:34:53,831 --> 00:34:57,071
She said, “No Mother, I've got a beauty prize.” “Yes?

506
00:34:58,614 --> 00:35:00,851
Who were the people? Doctors must have given it

507
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:02,707
because they want some patients there.”

508
00:35:04,453 --> 00:35:05,484
This is the trouble,

509
00:35:06,154 --> 00:35:08,968
we go out of the way to trouble our Nabhi,

510
00:35:10,116 --> 00:35:12,406
not to eat your food, fasting.

511
00:35:13,316 --> 00:35:17,943
If you want to fast this life, next life you will not have any food.

512
00:35:18,309 --> 00:35:21,814
Thank you very much. No food.

513
00:35:22,441 --> 00:35:26,260
Fasting? All right, you’ll have a permanent fasting. What do you say?

514
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:30,632
You don't have to do any fasting. Why do you want to fast?

515
00:35:31,205 --> 00:35:32,951
And even if you want to fast

516
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,895
because you want to change the timing or maybe

517
00:35:38,189 --> 00:35:39,719
for your health's sake, it's all right.

518
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:43,561
But why in the name of God you want to malign Me?

519
00:35:44,034 --> 00:35:46,384
You have got everything to eat and you don’t want to eat.

520
00:35:47,014 --> 00:35:49,292
Those who have got food to eat, they don’t want to eat.

521
00:35:49,474 --> 00:35:53,811
Next life they become poor and then they blame the rich.

522
00:35:54,758 --> 00:35:57,283
But in last life you'd been wanted to fast,

523
00:35:59,096 --> 00:36:03,022
so this life you are not given any food, because you asked for it.

524
00:36:05,766 --> 00:36:09,003
And that is how also the Nabhi Chakra gets you twisted,

525
00:36:09,094 --> 00:36:10,638
when you fast like mad.

526
00:36:11,495 --> 00:36:14,370
There is no need to fast in the name of God.

527
00:36:14,664 --> 00:36:18,359
God has given you all the wealth, all the beauty,

528
00:36:20,368 --> 00:36:23,865
all the love. Actually in Sahaja Yoga

529
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:28,218
if you fast in My name, I think it's horrible

530
00:36:28,468 --> 00:36:31,770
because if you want to trouble your Mother

531
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:33,680
or to make Her uneasy,

532
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:35,543
or to take a revenge on Her,

533
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,931
then you say, “Mother, I'm not going to eat my food.”

534
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,809
Then Mother is finished. That's the best way to conquer Her.

535
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:43,410
To say, “Mother I'm not going to eat my food.”

536
00:36:44,142 --> 00:36:47,341
So this kind of a mad fasting

537
00:36:47,446 --> 00:36:51,493
is also very bad for your Nabhi and when you do that

538
00:36:51,588 --> 00:36:54,344
then you have a problem because you are invaded

539
00:36:54,581 --> 00:36:58,341
by your left-sided, what you call, beyond

540
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:05,903
the Ida Nadi, you have the collective subconscious;

541
00:37:06,578 --> 00:37:08,578
and you are invaded by them.

542
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:15,628
And you are in for trouble, physically, mentally, emotionally.

543
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:19,963
And mostly those people who fast are very hot tempered.

544
00:37:21,345 --> 00:37:24,184
The day they are fasting day is there, never go near them.

545
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:27,883
Because they are already planning what they are going to eat.

546
00:37:32,475 --> 00:37:35,835
And in the morning they plan and they don't get it,

547
00:37:36,176 --> 00:37:38,401
so they are very angry for that part.

548
00:37:40,537 --> 00:37:43,623
All these asahaja things are not going to help you.

549
00:37:43,901 --> 00:37:45,405
You have to be normal people.

550
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,800
You don't have to put up into tension yourself for Sahaja Yoga, nothing.

551
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:55,045
Be normal. Be nice people. Don't torture yourself.

552
00:37:55,271 --> 00:37:57,904
That is one point on the Nabhi on the left hand side

553
00:37:58,286 --> 00:38:01,173
and on the right hand side: don't get into indulgences.

554
00:38:02,891 --> 00:38:04,210
Don't pamper yourself.

555
00:38:04,895 --> 00:38:07,197
Both things are the same for Sahaja Yoga.

556
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,829
Whether you starve or you overeat, is the same.

557
00:38:11,953 --> 00:38:15,479
There is no difference between the two, because

558
00:38:16,034 --> 00:38:17,344
if you are not on the seat,

559
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:18,589
whether you are on the left

560
00:38:18,614 --> 00:38:20,614
falling on the right, does it make any difference?

561
00:38:23,186 --> 00:38:26,142
So to be on the seat is to be

562
00:38:26,693 --> 00:38:29,120
in the blessings of Shri Lakshmi.

563
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:33,029
And I have described to you how Shri Lakshmi is a lady

564
00:38:33,364 --> 00:38:39,381
and in Her left hand She has got two lotuses and the right,

565
00:38:39,514 --> 00:38:44,925
one lotus, and right hand another lotus on top, which shows a person

566
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,920
who is balancing. She’s balancing on a lotus.

567
00:38:50,498 --> 00:38:53,822
Imagine. She’s standing on a lotus. That means She is balancing.

568
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:58,541
And She’s balancing, She’s standing there

569
00:39:00,124 --> 00:39:06,052
and She is holding two lotuses in Her hand showing

570
00:39:06,742 --> 00:39:09,591
that She’s like a lotus.

571
00:39:11,365 --> 00:39:15,485
A person who is a rich man, Lakshmi Pati,

572
00:39:16,158 --> 00:39:20,499
has to be like a lotus, warm, pink, warm.

573
00:39:21,212 --> 00:39:24,469
And even a horrible thing, like

574
00:39:31,756 --> 00:39:33,463
wasp-like thing.

575
00:39:33,685 --> 00:39:36,395
I don’t know what you call it in English, you don’t have that black thing.

576
00:39:36,897 --> 00:39:39,563
We have a very black wasp, you see,

577
00:39:39,584 --> 00:39:44,918
which is hard, hard like nut and has angular thorny legs.

578
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:49,147
That black thing comes in

579
00:39:50,314 --> 00:39:54,415
and is good for nothing, but it comes in

580
00:39:56,283 --> 00:39:59,389
for the residence, for the ashraya,

581
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,954
the lotus keeps it

582
00:40:03,475 --> 00:40:08,113
on top of it’s corolla, which is a very, very soft thing, with all love.

583
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,351
And in the night it closes down so that

584
00:40:11,544 --> 00:40:14,400
the poor insect who is just like a nut

585
00:40:14,835 --> 00:40:18,831
should not get any trouble from the outside weather.

586
00:40:19,847 --> 00:40:24,193
Like a mother who takes the child in the armchair,

587
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:29,193
that love should be there for a Lakshmi Pati.

588
00:40:29,855 --> 00:40:32,567
How many are Lakshmi Pati’s like that? Have you seen any?

589
00:40:34,116 --> 00:40:38,534
If they see somebody who is coming with money propositions,

590
00:40:38,942 --> 00:40:40,572
then they may open their doors.

591
00:40:41,054 --> 00:40:44,190
Otherwise, they have no love for anybody.

592
00:40:44,725 --> 00:40:49,882
For those who come for their ashrayas, for their help,

593
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:54,543
they are not there. On the other side

594
00:40:54,847 --> 00:41:07,082
are the people who are so repulsive. They are not like lotus.

595
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:11,354
There is no fragrance. They are such miserly people

596
00:41:12,526 --> 00:41:18,434
that they stink of miserliness. While the lotus

597
00:41:19,499 --> 00:41:25,605
gives its fragrance through that mud, to that horrible thing

598
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:31,233
that even the little worms which crawl upon

599
00:41:32,752 --> 00:41:39,443
those lotus petals smell of this beautiful fragrance.

600
00:41:41,175 --> 00:41:44,380
This is what it has to be. It has to give.

601
00:41:45,147 --> 00:41:47,961
It has to be beautiful. It has to be cozy.

602
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:49,815
It has to be welcoming.

603
00:41:51,687 --> 00:41:55,021
Then another hand is giving.

604
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:58,798
The Lakshmi is always giving. She doesn’t receive;

605
00:41:59,053 --> 00:42:00,248
She just gives.

606
00:42:00,959 --> 00:42:02,831
If you are really a Lakshmi Pati

607
00:42:02,903 --> 00:42:04,849
you don’t want to have anything from anyone.

608
00:42:05,046 --> 00:42:10,321
You don’t receive. If you are really rich, who can enrich you more?

609
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:16,578
What can you give to a person who is fully rich? There is no

610
00:42:17,038 --> 00:42:19,656
way of entering into it now it’s all up to the brim.

611
00:42:20,317 --> 00:42:22,533
He’s rich up to the brim. Then what do you give?

612
00:42:23,928 --> 00:42:24,902
You cannot give anything.

613
00:42:25,842 --> 00:42:28,476
But where you have to give means that he’s a beggar –

614
00:42:29,592 --> 00:42:30,480
he’s still a beggar.

615
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:34,838
All of these so-called rich people

616
00:42:35,058 --> 00:42:36,654
who still are hankering money

617
00:42:36,694 --> 00:42:38,551
are still beggars, they are not rich.

618
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:42,008
They may think themselves. Empty vessels, but they are not rich

619
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:44,646
because they are still expecting money.

620
00:42:50,303 --> 00:42:57,303
So, it is important that we should understand,

621
00:42:59,262 --> 00:43:00,943
the money is not the way.

622
00:43:01,221 --> 00:43:03,406
Money takes us away from dharma.

623
00:43:03,595 --> 00:43:05,332
It takes us away from God.

624
00:43:05,365 --> 00:43:08,483
It takes us away from reality. It covers our eyes.

625
00:43:09,223 --> 00:43:10,207
We don’t think

626
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:15,543
that we have to follow a path of righteousness and of virtue

627
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,973
because we think we are rich, God is going to be afraid of us.

628
00:43:19,203 --> 00:43:21,554
We can even purchase Him and can

629
00:43:21,675 --> 00:43:23,327
manage Him by giving some bribes.

630
00:43:25,654 --> 00:43:26,396
That’s not so.

631
00:43:28,053 --> 00:43:31,567
You must face yourself. You have to face yourself.

632
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:37,031
That it’s not the money that’s going to give you that elation,

633
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:46,818
that higher life, but it is the love of God,

634
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:51,151
the honesty of seeking, honesty.

635
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:57,150
That is the quality of this chakra is the Satya,

636
00:43:58,285 --> 00:44:00,794
Vishnu, is the Satya.

637
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,136
He’s the Narayana. Narayana means Satya.

638
00:44:05,377 --> 00:44:07,707
So there cannot be Satya Narayan, isn’t it?

639
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:11,151
Narayan is Satya, then how can there be Satya Narayan?

640
00:44:11,694 --> 00:44:13,694
But we have many Satya Narayana Pujas.

641
00:44:15,008 --> 00:44:18,663
For all these Satya Narayanas, Sahaja Yogis are not supposed to go.

642
00:44:19,775 --> 00:44:22,032
They can only go to Narayana Puja

643
00:44:22,689 --> 00:44:26,504
because Satya Narayana is that path which is added to it

644
00:44:27,537 --> 00:44:30,203
for camouflaging, is meant for these

645
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,462
horrible Brahmins who make you pay. For what?

646
00:44:37,847 --> 00:44:41,970
Sahaja Yogis are not allowed to go to Satya Narayana Puja.

647
00:44:42,278 --> 00:44:47,350
They can have Narayana Puja. And what is Narayana ultimately becomes?

648
00:44:48,226 --> 00:44:56,011
In the Nabhi Chakra Narayana existed since He was created by the Devi.

649
00:44:57,926 --> 00:44:59,401
And It looks after

650
00:45:01,439 --> 00:45:04,982
the seeking, the nourishing of the seeking like a father,

651
00:45:05,961 --> 00:45:10,608
and then It incarnates again and then It incarnates again

652
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,606
to help our seeking to a higher position and a higher position

653
00:45:15,377 --> 00:45:23,131
till it reaches a point where you start seeking God Almighty.

654
00:45:23,951 --> 00:45:28,911
Then you jump into the Shakti of Mahalakshmi.

655
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:33,587
Then you are in the hands of Mahalakshmi Shakti.

656
00:45:34,085 --> 00:45:38,325
Means Lakshmi evolves into Mahalakshmi principle.

657
00:45:42,209 --> 00:45:49,209
Now this Mahalakshmi principle resides in the central path of Sushumna.

658
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:59,975
And this central path of Sushumna is to be established fully

659
00:46:00,394 --> 00:46:03,035
and awakened when the Kundalini rises.

660
00:46:03,816 --> 00:46:05,816
When the Kundalini does not rise,

661
00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:09,257
this path is kept absolutely black.

662
00:46:11,631 --> 00:46:17,353
It is absolutely black, there is nothing in it except for the deities

663
00:46:18,286 --> 00:46:21,418
who are lying without any light.

664
00:46:23,277 --> 00:46:27,912
When the Kundalini rises, then only these deities get awakened

665
00:46:28,802 --> 00:46:32,171
and when they get awakened this Sushumna path,

666
00:46:32,594 --> 00:46:38,417
this central path of Mahalakshmi starts acting

667
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:44,913
as the balancing power, to begin with at the Nabhi chakra.

668
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:51,697
So Nabhi Chakra is surrounded by ten Gurus, the Prophets

669
00:46:52,154 --> 00:46:53,983
who give you the balance,

670
00:46:54,304 --> 00:46:58,154
who come on this earth again and again to give you balance in life.

671
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:01,845
They tell you, “don’t do this, don’t do that.”

672
00:47:02,009 --> 00:47:06,295
But we don’t listen, we don’t accept it. We may say

673
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:08,974
that we follow such guru, such guru. Like,

674
00:47:09,085 --> 00:47:12,420
you know Muslims are. They say, “We follow Mohammed Sahib.”

675
00:47:12,987 --> 00:47:14,720
Now if Mohammed Sahib has said

676
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:18,588
anything it is that don’t drink, is the thing he said.

677
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,850
But I’ve yet to come across a Muslim who doesn’t drink.

678
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,030
They may not drink in Riyad because they’ll be killed there.

679
00:47:25,827 --> 00:47:27,733
But if they come to London, they drink.

680
00:47:27,755 --> 00:47:29,053
Actually, when My husband

681
00:47:29,572 --> 00:47:31,321
went to Saudi Arabia they said,

682
00:47:31,363 --> 00:47:33,338
“You are the only Muslim we have ever come across.”

683
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:40,025
It’s true. Whatever is said to them, they do just the opposite of that.

684
00:47:40,656 --> 00:47:43,483
At that time there were no cigarettes, no tobaccos,

685
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:44,787
so He didn’t say about that

686
00:47:44,881 --> 00:47:46,035
so they have found a loophole.

687
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,855
Muslims smoke, doesn’t matter, because Mohammed Sahib never said.

688
00:47:50,824 --> 00:47:53,120
Mohammed Sahib had to take another birth

689
00:47:53,146 --> 00:47:55,542
to come as Guru Nanaka to tell them, “Oh, God.

690
00:47:56,550 --> 00:48:01,622
Now you are smoking this horrible thing has come, now you don’t smoke.”

691
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:08,033
But who will accept that Nanaka and Mohammed Sahib were the same people?

692
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:15,594
No difference. Same thing it was. We can prove it in Sahaja Yoga.

693
00:48:17,342 --> 00:48:22,045
We can prove it, how important it is that we should know

694
00:48:22,418 --> 00:48:23,959
that they were all the same,

695
00:48:24,673 --> 00:48:26,757
and that they stood for the same thing,

696
00:48:27,121 --> 00:48:28,501
but at a period.

697
00:48:28,582 --> 00:48:31,095
Now today you have got ganja,

698
00:48:31,221 --> 00:48:33,799
I don’t know the names also of all these things what you 

699
00:48:33,948 --> 00:48:34,642
drink and smoke,

700
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:35,596
God knows what.

701
00:48:36,285 --> 00:48:37,976
Human beings are really clever

702
00:48:38,204 --> 00:48:40,759
to get everything that can destroy you. It's like,

703
00:48:40,955 --> 00:48:43,561
call a bull, “come and hit me.” It's like that. If there’s

704
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:46,008
not a bull then you’ll like ask a buffalo, “come and hit me.”

705
00:48:46,067 --> 00:48:48,025
Now there's no buffalo, all right,

706
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:51,529
you ask an elephant, “come and stampede me.” It's like that.

707
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,162
Human beings are so stupid.

708
00:48:53,735 --> 00:48:55,179
So now supposing, I say

709
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,740
if I write down a list of

710
00:48:56,763 --> 00:48:59,426
all the thing you drink and smoke, I don't know how many things

711
00:48:59,452 --> 00:49:00,544
 there are in this world, 

712
00:49:00,879 --> 00:49:03,468
then you'll find out the third thing when I die,

713
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:07,181
that “Mataji didn't say this one.” So we should do it.

714
00:49:08,296 --> 00:49:13,435
Very intelligent. All the time destroying your central path,

715
00:49:15,342 --> 00:49:17,405
and nicely managing through that.

716
00:49:17,849 --> 00:49:20,721
Is this the way are you going to go to God by any chance?

717
00:49:22,178 --> 00:49:24,014
Is this the way are you following

718
00:49:24,287 --> 00:49:26,860
the great incarnations who came on this earth?

719
00:49:30,191 --> 00:49:33,726
So the balancing comes through Nabhi

720
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:41,318
and Nabhi looks after you and teaches you how to behave.

721
00:49:41,893 --> 00:49:46,126
For example, now your left Nabhi is Gruha Lakshmi.

722
00:49:47,644 --> 00:49:49,909
Gruha Lakshmi is the Deity of the household.

723
00:49:51,177 --> 00:49:53,177
But if you have too much outward type,

724
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:54,740
you're running a madness.

725
00:49:55,754 --> 00:49:58,343
So early in the morning you get up, read the newspapers.

726
00:49:58,531 --> 00:49:59,926
Is against Sahaja Yoga again.

727
00:50:00,418 --> 00:50:02,865
Not to read newspapers in the morning time. 

728
00:50:03,005 --> 00:50:04,534
You can read it in the night,

729
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,975
but not in the morning. Because if you read it in the morning,

730
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:10,637
you'll get upset.

731
00:50:11,812 --> 00:50:13,523
And poor this spleen has to

732
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:16,394
pour in more red blood corpuscles

733
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,431
and it becomes mad and fails you.

734
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,201
On the contrary, in the morning talk to your wife,

735
00:50:22,457 --> 00:50:23,549
talk to your children,

736
00:50:23,647 --> 00:50:25,534
look after your Gruha Lakshmi Tattwa.

737
00:50:25,592 --> 00:50:27,775
The wife also has to be a Gruha Lakshmi as I told you.

738
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:32,389
Then you have your food properly.

739
00:50:32,814 --> 00:50:36,393
Sit down and eat properly. But no,

740
00:50:36,866 --> 00:50:39,453
just after that, upsetting that Nabhi,

741
00:50:39,632 --> 00:50:41,063
you jump into your car,

742
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,140
taking your breakfast in your hand, eating on the way,

743
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:47,326
honking at people, getting angry with them,

744
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:51,518
the wife is calling, “Come along you have your breakfast!”

745
00:50:51,545 --> 00:50:55,434
Nothing doing. You are on your way on a special work,

746
00:50:55,865 --> 00:50:59,843
you end up with leukemia at least, minimum of minimum,

747
00:50:59,957 --> 00:51:01,682
if not with heart attack.

748
00:51:03,835 --> 00:51:08,061
Leukemia comes from left Nabhi, when your Gruha Lakshmi is ruined.

749
00:51:12,061 --> 00:51:14,742
The Deity of Gruha Lakshmi is Fatimabai,

750
00:51:14,855 --> 00:51:16,306
the daughter of Mohammed Sahib,

751
00:51:19,728 --> 00:51:26,728
while the daughter of the sister

752
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:34,684
of Nanak Sahib is on the left Vishuddhi. You'll see that.

753
00:51:36,056 --> 00:51:42,726
Nanaki. Now this aspect of life we never think about.

754
00:51:42,893 --> 00:51:46,186
When you get leukemia, then you'll come to Mother, “please cure me.”

755
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:47,252
And if you are rich,

756
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,845
you will see to it that I cure that person.

757
00:51:49,871 --> 00:51:51,834
If I don't cure you will sit on My head.

758
00:51:52,721 --> 00:51:56,394
You'll be in ten times on My head unless and until I cure your leukemia.

759
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:59,806
But if I tell you, “My son, you take it easy,

760
00:52:00,198 --> 00:52:03,324
life is not for getting wretchedness out of you.

761
00:52:03,794 --> 00:52:06,704
What have you gained out of all this running about?

762
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:07,663
Nothing.

763
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:09,822
But this horrible left Nabhi

764
00:52:09,931 --> 00:52:13,130
by which you are suffering, your family people are suffering.

765
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,558
Only person who has gained 

766
00:52:14,806 --> 00:52:18,160
is the doctor or the doctors or the hospitals.”

767
00:52:20,531 --> 00:52:21,659
They won't listen.

768
00:52:23,609 --> 00:52:27,771
And you know leukemia is such a fast developing disease of cancer

769
00:52:28,002 --> 00:52:31,352
that one can pass out within one month,

770
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:33,226
doctors will tell you,

771
00:52:33,406 --> 00:52:35,532
at the most you'll live for one month, that's all. They'll

772
00:52:35,659 --> 00:52:38,049
take all the money to give this certificate, very nicely.

773
00:52:39,435 --> 00:52:41,023
But why have that?

774
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,291
Be patient with yourself.

775
00:52:43,525 --> 00:52:46,974
Be kind to your Nabhi, look after your Gruha Lakshmi.

776
00:52:49,015 --> 00:52:51,407
All kinds of diseases of the stomach

777
00:52:51,574 --> 00:52:55,342
come from this imbalance this way or that way.

778
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:58,655
All these great gurus came on this earth

779
00:52:58,814 --> 00:53:01,717
to give us balance, to teach us balance and tell us,

780
00:53:02,126 --> 00:53:06,297
“Don't do this and don't do that.” All the Ten Commandments.

781
00:53:07,149 --> 00:53:12,423
But to us these Ten Commandment have no meaning.

782
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:17,850
Now I’ll touch a point which is very important today

783
00:53:18,457 --> 00:53:20,314
for you people to understand

784
00:53:20,779 --> 00:53:23,976
about non-vegetarianism and vegetarianism.

785
00:53:24,125 --> 00:53:26,374
Because this subject I wanted to handle,

786
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:28,357
because if they are vegetarians they

787
00:53:28,384 --> 00:53:29,656
can’t bear to see

788
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,344
that Mother says it doesn't matter if you are a non-vegetarian,

789
00:53:33,591 --> 00:53:37,526
because it doesn’t go against your awareness. It does not.

790
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:42,006
But drinking does. Drinking does go against your awareness.

791
00:53:42,692 --> 00:53:48,978
But not eating meat or not eating meat. But one has to understand.

792
00:53:49,933 --> 00:53:54,637
Now somebody told Me that in Gita it is written that those who eat meat

793
00:53:56,068 --> 00:54:02,994
are Tamo Gunis. I am surprised at Gita itself.

794
00:54:03,091 --> 00:54:06,980
Because Shri Krishna Himself in the very beginning,

795
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:13,029
has told Arjuna that you should go all out to kill all these people,

796
00:54:13,455 --> 00:54:17,621
even your relations, kill, actually kill human beings.

797
00:54:17,966 --> 00:54:21,188
Your relations and your guru also is to be killed,

798
00:54:22,299 --> 00:54:23,587
because I have already killed.

799
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:27,995
Nothing is going to be killed by you because they are already killed.

800
00:54:30,146 --> 00:54:33,639
And He gives so many explanations that it should not be done,

801
00:54:34,331 --> 00:54:37,768
but He said, “No, I tell you, you have to go and kill.

802
00:54:37,968 --> 00:54:39,936
Surrender yourself to Me and I'll take care of them.”

803
00:54:40,323 --> 00:54:43,781
So how did He preach this, I just don’t understand, in Gita.

804
00:54:44,261 --> 00:54:46,330
Now this seems to be a new introduction

805
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:49,771
that the people who eat (meat) are Tamo Gunis. They are not,

806
00:54:50,688 --> 00:54:52,831
they are never. They are Rajo Gunis.

807
00:54:53,889 --> 00:54:56,933
If you eat meat you become Rajo Gunis not Tamo Gunis.

808
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:01,410
Tamo Gunis are the people who eat carbohydrates, we have seen it

809
00:55:01,493 --> 00:55:04,205
in Sahaja Yoga. We have two types of diseases,

810
00:55:04,248 --> 00:55:08,987
one is lethargic organs and one is active organs.

811
00:55:10,586 --> 00:55:17,583
So those who are lethargic having too much carbohydrates

812
00:55:18,587 --> 00:55:22,419
and those who are overactive are having too much proteins in them.

813
00:55:24,105 --> 00:55:28,114
I mean if you take proteins, in the science, scientifically,

814
00:55:28,203 --> 00:55:32,207
will you become lethargic? I mean ask any doctor.

815
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:34,710
And then the doctor says Gita 

816
00:55:34,723 --> 00:55:36,881
is all humbug because it doesn't understand

817
00:55:37,026 --> 00:55:38,028
what it is saying.

818
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:41,341
And while you say like this that “We must follow Gita.”

819
00:55:42,516 --> 00:55:44,649
I think somebody has gone wrong there

820
00:55:44,678 --> 00:55:46,312
and has written something wrong in Gita

821
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,188
as they have written in Bible, they have written in every book.

822
00:55:49,705 --> 00:55:51,239
I'll tell you what they have written wrong in

823
00:55:51,258 --> 00:55:53,258
Bible later on when it comes to Christ.

824
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:58,679
I think just some people have put it there for oppose.

825
00:55:58,873 --> 00:56:00,873
If you eat too much meat you get Raj Gunis

826
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:04,419
and Raj Gunis become as I have told you right-sided people,

827
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:05,617
become very aggressive

828
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:08,891
and they become ahamkaris and they can harm.

829
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:13,324
But the people who just eat grass can become

830
00:56:13,391 --> 00:56:16,253
lethargic, absolutely lethargic.

831
00:56:16,658 --> 00:56:19,106
They will have lethargic heart if not active one,

832
00:56:19,137 --> 00:56:20,419
they will also get heart attack.

833
00:56:21,323 --> 00:56:24,958
They will have lethargic intestines by which they will get

834
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,494
tremendous all the time passing out of the stools,

835
00:56:27,529 --> 00:56:29,434
they'll never be able to digest any food,

836
00:56:29,682 --> 00:56:30,750
they'll be very weak people.

837
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:35,656
So those people who have a lethargic heart or a lethargic

838
00:56:39,986 --> 00:56:46,461
liver or lethargic intestines should take to proteins.

839
00:56:47,345 --> 00:56:49,145
I'm not saying meats, but proteins.

840
00:56:49,645 --> 00:56:52,011
But a vegetarian doesn't take so much proteins.

841
00:56:52,045 --> 00:56:54,723
It's easier to take meat, there's no harm.

842
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,619
But those who are active people should take

843
00:56:59,699 --> 00:57:02,233
more to vegetables. It’s sensible.

844
00:57:03,692 --> 00:57:07,490
Guru Nanaka ate all the meats, was he a bad man?

845
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:13,563
These Maarwadis who are supposed to be absolutely abstaining

846
00:57:13,613 --> 00:57:16,495
from even from lahasoon (garlic) and pyaj (onion).

847
00:57:17,088 --> 00:57:20,679
Was He worse than them by any chance?

848
00:57:21,425 --> 00:57:23,425
What about Buddha, Himself? He ate meat

849
00:57:23,633 --> 00:57:26,844
because He died of eating raw meat, Himself.

850
00:57:27,913 --> 00:57:30,010
Only thing you should not eat the meat

851
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:32,342
of animals which are bigger than you,

852
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:34,686
and not of a cow which is an Indian cow.

853
00:57:35,547 --> 00:57:36,572
Specially Indian cow.

854
00:57:37,021 --> 00:57:38,902
Also bigger cows are not good

855
00:57:38,925 --> 00:57:40,925
because they give you a problem on the teeth.

856
00:57:45,822 --> 00:57:50,591
But smaller animals, even with Jainism

857
00:57:50,657 --> 00:57:59,370
they said that you must save the bullocks, the cows,

858
00:57:59,921 --> 00:58:03,809
and you must save other animals,

859
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,819
but they never said you must save goats

860
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:08,341
and you must save chickens.

861
00:58:08,966 --> 00:58:12,603
Because Mahavira knew we cannot give Realization to chickens.

862
00:58:13,873 --> 00:58:16,866
What is the use of saving chickens and mosquitoes

863
00:58:17,556 --> 00:58:19,889
and also bugs?

864
00:58:21,678 --> 00:58:23,678
Of course they are doing like that.

865
00:58:24,058 --> 00:58:26,426
Some Jain people save bugs and

866
00:58:26,482 --> 00:58:32,078
put it on a human being, and they take the blood of those

867
00:58:32,724 --> 00:58:34,724
human beings and they are paid for it.

868
00:58:35,698 --> 00:58:37,272
It's absurd but they do it.

869
00:58:37,488 --> 00:58:39,718
For them bugs are more important than human beings.

870
00:58:40,715 --> 00:58:43,956
Billions and billions of bugs cannot make a human being.

871
00:58:46,515 --> 00:58:49,322
All these absurd ideas we have in this country.

872
00:58:50,139 --> 00:58:54,286
So when I say you are not to be a vegetarian

873
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:57,309
or non-vegetarian, you have to see what you need and eat that.

874
00:58:57,687 --> 00:59:01,487
But all the time your attention is in food itself is wrong.

875
00:59:03,946 --> 00:59:07,861
So there is no good in you people

876
00:59:08,734 --> 00:59:12,331
getting into these problems of vegetarianism and non-vegetarianism.

877
00:59:12,691 --> 00:59:15,425
Of course in the Western countries people should take

878
00:59:15,869 --> 00:59:21,368
to vegetarian food, not absolutely, but more than what they have,

879
00:59:21,608 --> 00:59:24,942
while the people who are in India who are vegetarians

880
00:59:24,982 --> 00:59:27,084
will have to later on take to meat. Otherwise

881
00:59:27,126 --> 00:59:28,830
they will have lethargic heart.

882
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:31,443
I’ll cure them once again they will have problem,

883
00:59:31,547 --> 00:59:35,194
then they will have to go for a by-pass. Save money there?

884
00:59:36,088 --> 00:59:39,918
You cannot. You will have lethargic intestines,

885
00:59:41,088 --> 00:59:46,352
then you will have lethargic liver. You will have all kinds of

886
00:59:48,362 --> 00:59:51,723
cirrhosis, or maybe on the hand you might get

887
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:56,854
all kinds of rashes and things like that, allergies,

888
00:59:58,132 --> 01:00:03,393
all these problems will come. And then ultimately such people

889
01:00:03,607 --> 01:00:07,278
look so peaceful because you see, they are like cabbages.

890
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:12,363
Yes. If somebody is like a cabbage

891
01:00:13,287 --> 01:00:15,116
then how do you give him Realization?

892
01:00:15,564 --> 01:00:18,138
You can't give Realization to cabbages can you?

893
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:22,673
We have to have here chivalrous people,

894
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,590
brave people, warriors.

895
01:00:25,262 --> 01:00:29,201
You have to fight the evil forces, and what can

896
01:00:29,415 --> 01:00:35,100
these people who are cabbages going to do for it?

897
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:44,724
One has to understand yatharth, the reality

898
01:00:44,777 --> 01:00:49,475
and not put your conception. Because you are born in a Jain family

899
01:00:50,372 --> 01:00:59,155
and that's why you want everybody to eat grass, is wrong , is wrong.

900
01:00:59,398 --> 01:01:03,670
The one who has to eat protein must eat protein.

901
01:01:04,897 --> 01:01:07,354
Now what is the food for Sattvic people?

902
01:01:09,873 --> 01:01:15,209
That one should eat. You can’t live with it. So what I eat? Channa.

903
01:01:15,829 --> 01:01:22,861
Can you live with channa? Is protein. Channa, or you can eat meat.

904
01:01:23,329 --> 01:01:27,481
But not very heavy meats, lean meats and ghee,

905
01:01:36,216 --> 01:01:40,532
and what I eat the most is honey.

906
01:01:44,523 --> 01:01:48,601
That's My food. Honey I eat, you know that, honey I drink.

907
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:54,435
That's. But you can't live with that can you?

908
01:01:55,529 --> 01:01:58,256
So you have to eat little carbohydrates. Doesn't matter,

909
01:01:58,836 --> 01:02:01,654
but you balance yourself in Nabhi Chakra

910
01:02:04,837 --> 01:02:08,412
But there should be no attention on food at all.

911
01:02:09,398 --> 01:02:10,984
Actually if you ask Me what I ate

912
01:02:10,998 --> 01:02:12,642
in the morning, I won't be able to tell you.

913
01:02:12,678 --> 01:02:16,048
Really I'm very bad at it because I have no attention on it.

914
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:19,434
Whatever one gets, eat it, and you don't feel like eating, don't eat.

915
01:02:20,052 --> 01:02:26,173
What's so important is to enjoy every moment of your life.

916
01:02:27,407 --> 01:02:30,210
If a person is finicky about food, specially Indians are,

917
01:02:30,631 --> 01:02:32,435
is very dangerous for Nabhi Chakra.

918
01:02:33,439 --> 01:02:36,588
Because those who are mad after food

919
01:02:37,002 --> 01:02:38,567
and about Nabhi Chakra

920
01:02:40,929 --> 01:02:43,306
are extremely hot-tempered, I think and...

921
01:02:43,782 --> 01:02:46,025
I don’t know what the word in English is but in

922
01:02:46,038 --> 01:02:47,793
Hindi we call it chichode,

923
01:02:52,087 --> 01:02:56,554
irritable, irritable, and these chichode

924
01:02:57,684 --> 01:02:59,493
will make their wives’ lives miserable.

925
01:02:59,874 --> 01:03:03,546
They will come and tell, “In that house I ate very good curry nuts.”

926
01:03:04,765 --> 01:03:07,479
So that poor lady is running after the curry nuts.

927
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:09,982
We Indians are so much food-minded.

928
01:03:10,934 --> 01:03:13,477
You can't imagine, they won't believe we are supposed to be

929
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,290
starving people.

930
01:03:15,163 --> 01:03:17,163
But we are so food-minded

931
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:20,122
that once there was for these Bengalis,

932
01:03:20,161 --> 01:03:22,757
supposed to be Mukha Bengalis, I must tell you about them.

933
01:03:23,314 --> 01:03:25,819
They had raw fish, raw fish which they get it

934
01:03:25,826 --> 01:03:26,999
from the Central India

935
01:03:27,431 --> 01:03:29,928
and people couldn't get fish so they were starving.

936
01:03:30,621 --> 01:03:32,576
So Bombay people very graciously sent

937
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:35,479
one shipload, because I know that, I was part of it,

938
01:03:36,338 --> 01:03:40,858
to them as a gracious act that let the Bengalis eat the fish.

939
01:03:40,989 --> 01:03:43,902
They said, “What? We are not going to eat sea fish,

940
01:03:44,441 --> 01:03:45,955
we are Bangladeshis.”

941
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:49,589
Threw all the fishes in the sea.

942
01:03:49,628 --> 01:03:52,431
It all become sardana (rotten) and it was thrown into the sea.

943
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:55,401
Can you imagine? Nobody will believe in the West,

944
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:57,678
this is how we are fasting and

945
01:03:57,722 --> 01:04:00,478
that is how we are poor people.

946
01:04:00,578 --> 01:04:05,160
Can poor people afford to throw away one shipload of fish

947
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:08,560
in the sea because they want raw fish?

948
01:04:10,651 --> 01:04:16,879
We are so food-minded that our Nabhis are always like this.

949
01:04:17,704 --> 01:04:19,774
And our women are to be blamed because

950
01:04:19,786 --> 01:04:22,777
they know to control their husbands, they are spoilt them.

951
01:04:28,041 --> 01:04:30,440
The job of a woman is to be a Gruha Lakshmi.

952
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:34,273
To have ideals before the family,

953
01:04:34,818 --> 01:04:37,044
ideals before a husband,

954
01:04:37,121 --> 01:04:39,121
ideals before the children.

955
01:04:39,622 --> 01:04:41,366
The house should be ideal,

956
01:04:41,427 --> 01:04:44,786
should be a warm house where everybody's welcome.

957
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:48,658
The wife’s job is to keep her Nabhi all right,

958
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,057
the Nabhi of the children all right and the Nabhi of the husband

959
01:04:52,116 --> 01:04:54,441
and Nabhi of all the people who come to her house.

960
01:04:56,098 --> 01:04:58,456
She has to lead a life of auspiciousness,

961
01:04:59,088 --> 01:05:05,452
of kindliness, of religious nature. She has to be a soft-natured woman.

962
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:12,178
But this is all missing, only thing she is worried with,

963
01:05:12,327 --> 01:05:17,339
how to please the husbands. Because that's one of the big jobs for her.

964
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:21,302
So to keep our Nabhi all right

965
01:05:21,447 --> 01:05:23,447
we have to understand as Sahaja Yogis

966
01:05:24,301 --> 01:05:28,171
that we have not to pay so much attention to food.

967
01:05:30,365 --> 01:05:33,097
That doesn't mean you eat all dirty food.

968
01:05:34,027 --> 01:05:37,098
But it definitely means that when you eat your food,

969
01:05:37,238 --> 01:05:39,238
you must see the vibrations of the food.

970
01:05:40,291 --> 01:05:42,510
You must always give vibrations to the food.

971
01:05:42,991 --> 01:05:44,991
Eat the food which is vibrated.

972
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:48,138
Certain foods, now supposing if

973
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:52,422
I have to go and eat in any one of these big five star hotels,

974
01:05:53,034 --> 01:05:54,266
next moment I vomit,

975
01:05:54,433 --> 01:05:57,513
I always vomit. If somebody invites Me in a hotel,

976
01:05:58,322 --> 01:06:00,842
I start thinking, ‘Baba, now what an ordeal.’

977
01:06:01,654 --> 01:06:03,686
Because it is not cooked with love.

978
01:06:05,905 --> 01:06:08,452
That's what it says [Marathi],

979
01:06:10,455 --> 01:06:13,625
“He likes the little berries of Shabari.”

980
01:06:14,868 --> 01:06:20,918
[ Marathi]

981
01:06:25,557 --> 01:06:29,597
Was does that mean?  That means the love

982
01:06:30,231 --> 01:06:34,259
that is expressed in that food

983
01:06:35,231 --> 01:06:37,231
is what we should care for,

984
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:47,159
and not for the lavishness, not for the show of it

985
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:50,481
and not at all for your own taste,

986
01:06:50,895 --> 01:06:53,045
but the taste of food should be

987
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:57,478
that it should carry love. Let your tongue feel the love.

988
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:03,897
That is the best taste,

989
01:07:04,237 --> 01:07:07,539
and whatever is cooked with love always tastes very well.

990
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:13,541
So when you cook,

991
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:18,265
cook with love. When you eat, eat with love.

992
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:23,207
With kind words to the person who has cooked with love

993
01:07:24,726 --> 01:07:31,205
and above all, count your blessings, count your blessings,

994
01:07:33,347 --> 01:07:37,847
and think of others who may not have had food today.

995
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:41,069
This is the Lakshmi Tattwa, is

996
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:43,729
where the hand is like this, where it gives

997
01:07:44,095 --> 01:07:49,850
and there's a hand where it gives protection to people who need money.

998
01:07:50,325 --> 01:07:51,953
But not in a way we do it,

999
01:07:52,887 --> 01:07:55,612
the way Americans do or Russians do it. We do the way

1000
01:07:56,268 --> 01:07:57,453
Lakshmi does,

1001
01:07:57,898 --> 01:08:00,951
that this protection does not get out of hand.

1002
01:08:01,101 --> 01:08:03,440
You give it without telling anyone. 

1003
01:08:03,461 --> 01:08:05,279
Just because you have to give you give,

1004
01:08:05,988 --> 01:08:07,436
and actually you do that.

1005
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:11,482
If you have given, as My father said, one rupee to someone,

1006
01:08:11,744 --> 01:08:14,482
run away from that person as soon as possible

1007
01:08:16,074 --> 01:08:18,074
with the speed of one mile, he said.

1008
01:08:18,298 --> 01:08:19,699
But if you have given

1009
01:08:20,332 --> 01:08:24,209
five rupees, run away from him at the speed of 500 miles.

1010
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:27,594
It's very practical.

1011
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:30,779
That is how we have to give.

1012
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:32,862
This is the Lakshmi Tattwa,

1013
01:08:33,405 --> 01:08:36,167
is the Nabhi Chakra about which I have told you.

1014
01:08:36,865 --> 01:08:39,930
It's a very important Chakra,

1015
01:08:40,555 --> 01:08:46,646
because today you are here because in your Chakra,

1016
01:08:46,733 --> 01:08:49,171
Mahalakshmi Tattwa was awakened

1017
01:08:49,689 --> 01:08:55,059
because you wanted to seek God. Because you wanted to come to God.

1018
01:08:55,685 --> 01:08:58,265
You have not come here for money.

1019
01:08:59,234 --> 01:09:03,760
You have not come here for anything else but God.

1020
01:09:03,898 --> 01:09:05,898
Your seeking is in God.

1021
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:08,506
You want to know the truth about God

1022
01:09:08,762 --> 01:09:10,762
and you want to have God.

1023
01:09:11,143 --> 01:09:13,782
You don't want to put your ideas on to this,

1024
01:09:13,868 --> 01:09:17,585
but you want to see how Mother wants

1025
01:09:17,775 --> 01:09:19,991
us to receive the blessings of God.

1026
01:09:20,832 --> 01:09:27,331
So become that as we seek the love of God, the grace of God.

1027
01:09:28,988 --> 01:09:34,417
The Lakshmi has to be gracious and the Mahalakshmi

1028
01:09:34,661 --> 01:09:40,518
is the One who is the gracious lady, is the graciousness in you.

1029
01:09:40,989 --> 01:09:45,498
The grace that must come evolved into your personality.

1030
01:09:45,982 --> 01:09:48,967
Within that grace he feels the hankering of the Father.

1031
01:09:49,841 --> 01:09:54,973
The Father, the Narayana. He wants to have His blessings,

1032
01:09:55,396 --> 01:09:57,766
and that is how the first, the truth,

1033
01:09:58,086 --> 01:10:00,405
the seeking of the truth rises in you,

1034
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:04,676
and that is how the honesty of seeking is blessed

1035
01:10:05,565 --> 01:10:07,090
when the Kundalini rises.

1036
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:10,842
She first gives you - first thing that you get

1037
01:10:11,286 --> 01:10:15,896
is the truth, by enlightening your brain.

1038
01:10:16,395 --> 01:10:18,395
When I will tell you about Sahasrara

1039
01:10:19,128 --> 01:10:26,128
and about Agnya, I will tell you how this brain becomes

1040
01:10:27,716 --> 01:10:30,486
a receptor of the ultimate truth,

1041
01:10:31,621 --> 01:10:35,148
how truth is spread, you start

1042
01:10:35,347 --> 01:10:38,818
receiving the knowledge of absolute truth.

1043
01:10:39,609 --> 01:10:41,609
How this brain when enlightened

1044
01:10:42,102 --> 01:10:50,481
gives you the power to know what is truth and what is not truth,

1045
01:10:51,063 --> 01:10:54,239
and there are no alternatives.

1046
01:10:56,291 --> 01:10:57,945
This I'll tell you later on

1047
01:10:58,163 --> 01:11:01,500
when the Kundalini I'll describe at the brain level.

1048
01:11:01,953 --> 01:11:06,516
But for today I think Nabhi Chakra is very important.

1049
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,750
For all of us, for India specially,

1050
01:11:09,776 --> 01:11:11,627
our Nabhi Chakra is very important,

1051
01:11:13,249 --> 01:11:16,175
that we should know that God Almighty,

1052
01:11:16,787 --> 01:11:20,308
the Narayana, the Vishnu,

1053
01:11:21,404 --> 01:11:25,559
is the One who gives the kshema after Yoga.

1054
01:11:25,605 --> 01:11:28,732
He says, “Yoga Kshema Mahatmyam,” He gives the kshema.

1055
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:32,528
And we are sinning against the God

1056
01:11:33,814 --> 01:11:37,084
when we don't believe that honest and

1057
01:11:37,099 --> 01:11:40,820
righteous and virtuous life will give us the kshema

1058
01:11:40,939 --> 01:11:42,939
as promised by God Almighty.

1059
01:11:43,358 --> 01:11:47,397
You are sinning against our Father, while in the West

1060
01:11:47,648 --> 01:11:49,882
they are sinning against the Mother

1061
01:11:50,378 --> 01:11:51,942
on the left hand side,

1062
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:56,425
because they have forgotten that immoral life

1063
01:11:56,677 --> 01:11:59,655
is an insult to the Mother Power of God.

1064
01:12:01,028 --> 01:12:03,170
So both things are important,

1065
01:12:03,581 --> 01:12:06,875
whether in the West or East, is important

1066
01:12:07,449 --> 01:12:11,908
that we should not sin against the Father and sin against the Mother.

1067
01:12:13,767 --> 01:12:16,750
I hope I've tried to tell you everything

1068
01:12:17,031 --> 01:12:19,276
in such a way that you do not feel hurt.

1069
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:22,209
Because all of you come from different, different

1070
01:12:22,809 --> 01:12:25,588
types of lives; different, different conceptions;

1071
01:12:26,017 --> 01:12:30,383
different, different gurus, and you can get confused about it.

1072
01:12:30,877 --> 01:12:33,701
So, in Sahaja Yoga you should

1073
01:12:33,734 --> 01:12:36,126
allow this to work out.

1074
01:12:36,506 --> 01:12:40,301
Allow the light to come in and don't get confused, don't get upset.

1075
01:12:40,801 --> 01:12:42,909
Here you are to seek God

1076
01:12:43,204 --> 01:12:46,125
and not to sit on what you have known so far,

1077
01:12:46,193 --> 01:12:49,390
or which you have heard so far, or whatever you have followed.

1078
01:12:49,597 --> 01:12:53,739
Because that has not given you anything whatsoever.

1079
01:12:54,278 --> 01:12:59,168
Like one of My disciples who's a big officer

1080
01:13:00,446 --> 01:13:02,610
and one day he told Me, “Mother,

1081
01:13:02,686 --> 01:13:04,606
I don't know about Gita,

1082
01:13:04,595 --> 01:13:07,371
I don't know about Ramana, Krishna, anyone.

1083
01:13:07,898 --> 01:13:12,313
I know You, because You are the One who has given me Realization.”

1084
01:13:14,959 --> 01:13:18,443
Of course after knowing Me you will know all of them.

1085
01:13:18,846 --> 01:13:20,846
But it is better you know Me now, because

1086
01:13:21,121 --> 01:13:23,903
Those are no more here. It is I Who is sitting here,

1087
01:13:24,211 --> 01:13:25,790
so better know Me first,

1088
01:13:26,228 --> 01:13:28,228
and then you will know Them better

1089
01:13:28,418 --> 01:13:30,768
than what you have known Them before.

1090
01:13:31,094 --> 01:13:33,647
So let us compromise in this point:

1091
01:13:33,847 --> 01:13:37,118
that try to understand it through Sahaja Yoga.

1092
01:13:37,178 --> 01:13:40,637
Everything can be proved. Whatever I have said is absolute truth,

1093
01:13:41,791 --> 01:13:42,889
nothing but the truth.

1094
01:13:43,696 --> 01:13:48,511
But you allow yourself not to be bound by any

1095
01:13:48,605 --> 01:13:51,083
previous ideas and previous conceptions.

1096
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:54,480
But let it be open mind to see what I've said,

1097
01:13:54,573 --> 01:13:57,933
it's just a hypothesis, let it become a law.

1098
01:13:58,134 --> 01:14:01,596
When you see it yourself, when it becomes in your heart,

1099
01:14:01,690 --> 01:14:04,884
on the vibrations, when you see and judge what I've said,

1100
01:14:04,989 --> 01:14:12,716
you'll be amazed that Nabhi Chakra which you feel on these fingers,

1101
01:14:13,156 --> 01:14:15,156
even the children can tell you.

1102
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:19,728
May God bless you all. Thank you very much.

1103
01:14:22,142 --> 01:14:26,457
Tomorrow I'll tell you about other chakra called

1104
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:30,628
the Chakra of the Devi, Herself .

1105
01:14:36,022 --> 01:14:39,173
If there are any questions, I've told you, you better write it down.

1106
01:14:39,242 --> 01:14:40,884
It's always worked out very well.

1107
01:14:41,334 --> 01:14:45,321
I think now we should go in for meditation and try

1108
01:14:45,784 --> 01:14:47,784
to get your Realization.

1109
01:14:58,621 --> 01:15:05,621

1110
01:15:16,535 --> 01:15:19,287
Will you please put your hands towards Me,

1111
01:15:21,358 --> 01:15:24,042
like this, just in humble way.

1112
01:15:24,394 --> 01:15:28,878
Because you have not known so far, and you will know it

1113
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:33,980
when you will know it: So you put your hands towards Me like this

1114
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:36,505
and as I've told you these are

1115
01:15:36,546 --> 01:15:39,213
five chakras, sixth and seventh chakra is here is on our hands.

1116
01:15:39,757 --> 01:15:41,258
Five chakras, sixth and seventh.

1117
01:15:44,648 --> 01:15:45,919
I must tell you today I met

1118
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:48,001
some Kashmiri Muslims, that's a good idea.

1119
01:15:48,707 --> 01:15:51,945
Suddenly they did feel for Me something. I don't know how.

1120
01:15:52,656 --> 01:15:54,656
And they said, “Are You the Mother?”

1121
01:15:54,814 --> 01:15:57,305
I said, “Yes, I am.” They came to Me

1122
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:01,315
and then said that “You must tell us about Ruh, about Ruh,

1123
01:16:02,197 --> 01:16:04,139
about spiritual life, about Spirit.”

1124
01:16:05,418 --> 01:16:06,378
They came to Me. I said,

1125
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,006
“All right, you put your hands towards Me like this.”

1126
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:11,746
They put their hands towards Me and they felt the cool breeze.

1127
01:16:12,286 --> 01:16:14,921
And they said, “This is what it is. Mohammed has said

1128
01:16:15,187 --> 01:16:18,549
that your hands will speak. This is it. That's the truth.”

1129
01:16:19,993 --> 01:16:21,602
I said, “Yes,

1130
01:16:24,575 --> 01:16:26,575
when you have your second birth,

1131
01:16:26,796 --> 01:16:29,294
you’ll be rid of all the nonsense of

1132
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:33,119
these so-called religions which are separating you.

1133
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:36,265
They were never meant to be separated,

1134
01:16:36,539 --> 01:16:40,036
they were meant to integrate you. But you have done it, doesn't matter.

1135
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:45,118
Now by God's grace Sahaja Yoga has come, you'll have second birth.

1136
01:16:45,677 --> 01:16:48,064
So all the things that are attached to your birth

1137
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:54,534
will be finished and you’ll be a new person having a new life in which

1138
01:16:54,889 --> 01:16:59,176
you forget all that is attacking you,

1139
01:16:59,351 --> 01:17:02,493
is attached to you, which is dragging you,

1140
01:17:02,657 --> 01:17:07,452
which is making you think, think, think but not ascend.”

1141
01:17:09,214 --> 01:17:13,517
I'm very happy, these simple Muslims who met Me, they were in a shop

1142
01:17:13,836 --> 01:17:17,514
selling something, and they were so sweet and so beautiful.

1143
01:17:20,872 --> 01:17:23,301
They didn't say that “You are not Mohammed.” Nothing of the kind.

1144
01:17:23,357 --> 01:17:25,209
They said, “This is what Mohammed has said,

1145
01:17:25,478 --> 01:17:27,845
that “At the time of the Resurrection, your hands will speak,”

1146
01:17:29,305 --> 01:17:32,795
and what are these people fighting for?”

1147
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:39,826
You see. This is what it is.

1148
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:43,433
May God bless you all!

1149
01:17:48,494 --> 01:17:52,728
Let us have now both the hands towards Me and close your eyes

1150
01:17:52,882 --> 01:17:54,882
just close your eyes.

1151
01:17:55,628 --> 01:17:57,183
[Shri Mataji gives Realization.]
