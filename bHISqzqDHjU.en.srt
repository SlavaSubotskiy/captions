1
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:23,458
Today we have gathered here to do Shri Krishna Puja.

2
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:35,208
We have to understand clearly that Shri Krishna

3
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:40,667
is a very, very important deity within us

4
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:45,583
because He is the Vishnu,

5
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:50,792
who resides in the Void,

6
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,542
in the Nabhi.

7
00:06:56,083 --> 00:07:03,333
He is the one who generates Dharma within us.

8
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:07,583
When you got your realization I didn’t tell you,

9
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,208
“Don’t do this. Don’t do that.”

10
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:15,625
I never told you that “This is not good. That is not good.”

11
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,125
You just did it

12
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:24,834
because Shri Vishnu was awakened within you.

13
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:28,000
He is in the Void

14
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:32,542
and if He is awakened

15
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:40,667
He brings you to the light,

16
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:44,583
removes your ignorance, removes your darkness,

17
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,083
and you start seeing that

18
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:54,458
whatever you were doing was destructive for you,

19
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:59,667
and that’s how the dharma is established.

20
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,750
Of course, the Dharma was established also

21
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:10,375
by all the ten Gurus who came on this earth,

22
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:15,041
the prophets, who taught us about dharma.

23
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,208
So this combination of Shri Vishnu

24
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:33,000
and the ten Gurus

25
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:38,834
is to establish Dharma within us.

26
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,166
Now this Dharma is taught by prophets,

27
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:44,250
as you have seen everywhere.

28
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:48,041
They have said, “Don’t do this. Don’t do that.”

29
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,834
They have talked of Ten Commandments.

30
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:57,208
Every prophet has talked about Dharma, what is to be done,

31
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:02,041
up to a point when Christ also had to talk about it

32
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,583
and He says, “Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

33
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,291
But Shri Krishna is the one

34
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:21,375
who says that “I come on this earth

35
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:31,834
when there is a glani, means demise, of Dharma.”

36
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,458
When the Dharma becomes weak

37
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,208
then He comes on this Earth,

38
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:41,417
and then He destroys the people

39
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:47,041
who are responsible

40
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:56,500
for bringing Dharma to this level of doom.

41
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,500
The second thing He says, that

42
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,125
“I protect the saints. I protect the saints

43
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:15,333
and I kill all those who are devils or who are satanic,

44
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,333
who are destructive.”

45
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:19,375
These are His promises

46
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:24,250
which He gave long time back as Shri Krishna.

47
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:29,458
As Vishnu we know Him only as the one

48
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:33,792
who is the giver of Dharma, mainly.

49
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:38,000
But all His potent qualities really were expressed

50
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:40,500
when He came as Shri Krishna.

51
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,083
At the time of Shri Rama also these qualities

52
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:47,458
could not be expressed in that way.

53
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:52,750
So Shri Krishna’s first half of His life

54
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,500
He spent in Gokul and Vrindavan

55
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:03,625
where He showed His beautiful expression of His character,

56
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:08,083
as He made it,

57
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,750
what He calls as Leela, Leeladhara,

58
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:16,959
the one who said that you become a witness;

59
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,875
you witness the whole world like a drama,

60
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,542
Sakshi Swarupa.

61
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:30,583
And then once you see the whole world as just

62
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:38,250
a child watches, in a child-like mirth and joy, you enjoy life.

63
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,000
That has happened to you people

64
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:45,458
that you have become like citizens of Vrindavan and Gokul,

65
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,542
the way you are enjoying yourself,

66
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:53,250
enjoying each other’s company, enjoying the bliss of God.

67
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:56,542
Then He showed also by killing Kaliya,

68
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,208
by killing Putana and other people,

69
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:06,500
that if anybody tries to trouble such joyous children of God,

70
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:12,750
He is the one who will definitely protect

71
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:17,375
and kill all such evil forces which are troublesome.

72
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:22,709
But later on He becomes the king,

73
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,250
and when He becomes the king

74
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:30,999
He uses His powers in a different way.

75
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:35,417
First of all, if you see His own uncle, His own relation,

76
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,250
His own uncle, mother’s brother, was Kansa,

77
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:41,792
and was such a bad man.

78
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:46,458
So Shri Krishna didn’t spare him, He killed him.

79
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,083
He killed so many people.

80
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:53,208
Before becoming the king, He killed so many people.

81
00:12:53,667 --> 00:13:00,959
Now what does that mean, that His own uncle He killed?

82
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:09,000
One quality that He has, which Christ had, we can say,

83
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:14,999
or so many saints had, is forgiveness.

84
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:19,208
He did not believe in forgiveness.

85
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:24,792
He’s the only one who said that, “I have to punish.”

86
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,500
We have to have somebody who should punish also.

87
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:30,625
If you are like Shiva,

88
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,834
then Shiva used to even love rakshasas

89
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,875
and in His innocence He used to give them also blessings.

90
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:45,875
But Shri Krishna did not believe in forgiveness at all

91
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:50,792
because it was important that there should be

92
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,333
somebody with a very stern mind,

93
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,583
with such a stern understanding that a devil is a devil,

94
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:01,417
and devil must be killed.

95
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,375
He has done in His lifetime,

96
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,750
if you see, killing of so many people.

97
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,583
That doesn’t mean that we have right to kill anybody.

98
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:16,792
He was Shri Krishna; we are not.

99
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:21,291
We have to forgive because we are human beings.

100
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:25,333
Once we forgive we transfer all our anger,

101
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:34,041
all our attitude of taking revenge, to Shri Krishna.

102
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,667
He takes over.

103
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:40,959
Once you say that “I forgive,” then He takes over,

104
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,250
because He does not forgive.

105
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:49,500
He will immediately take over from you

106
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,959
and if it is justifiable, if it is necessary

107
00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:00,000
He will punish the people who are torturing saints,

108
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,291
who are destroying the dharma.

109
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,917
Now it is very surprising

110
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:10,959
that whatever is preached by the person,

111
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:15,709
that area becomes just the opposite of it.

112
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,667
Is very surprising.

113
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:24,000
Like we said that Christ said,

114
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,458
“Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

115
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:30,709
Christians are the worst as far as their eyes are concerned.

116
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:37,750
In the same way, in the Hindu religion it is said that

117
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
everybody has the spirit.

118
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:47,250
Still the Hindus believe in the different castes and communities

119
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,250
and fight with each other.

120
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:57,875
Everything that was preached, just the opposite of it is followed.

121
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,999
If you read even Koran, in the Koran,

122
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,959
Mohammed Sahib has all the time

123
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,917
said about rahmat, means compassion.

124
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,000
But you don’t find it anywhere.

125
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,041
He has not said about shariat,

126
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:12,792
He has not said of many things

127
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:17,291
which are being practiced by Muslims, just on their own.

128
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,083
He never said that women should cover their face

129
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,667
or cover their heads,

130
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:26,542
but it is practiced and not practiced but vengeance.

131
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,458
So what it shows to us is this, that whatever is preached,

132
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:37,166
just the opposite of that people try to do.

133
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:44,542
And when such things happen, the dharma goes down.

134
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,625
Now as you know that Krishna, His country is America.

135
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,917
He rules over America.

136
00:16:53,333 --> 00:17:01,458
So it is a rich country because Shri Krishna is Kubera.

137
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:05,583
He is the Lord of wealth.

138
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,709
So, He has given wealth to America.

139
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:17,875
Then He is Vachana, means communication.

140
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:24,166
His another quality is that He is the one who communicated.

141
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:29,166
It was He who danced with gopis and gopas.

142
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:36,583
It was He who transferred His powers to them.

143
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:43,208
So the communication part is one of His greatest qualities

144
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,959
that is working in America.

145
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:51,542
So they are going just the opposite way

146
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:54,750
that if there is a war, say, with Saddam Hussein,

147
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,083
so America is going.

148
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,125
If there’s Korean War, America is going.

149
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,166
Everywhere there is any problem, America has to go.

150
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,750
I mean, one can ask question,

151
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,750
“Who are you? Why, why are you bothered?

152
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,041
Keep to your own country enjoying yourself.

153
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,250
Why are you sending troops all over?

154
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,000
Why are you looking after everyone?”

155
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,959
Even the formation of UN and all that is done

156
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:22,291
under the guidance of the Americans.

157
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,959
They play a very important part

158
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,917
in the formation of this United Nations

159
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:34,625
and one world and peace and all sorts of things.

160
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:41,458
But actually, if you see, the main thing that Krishna had taught,

161
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:44,333
they are missing.

162
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:46,375
They are all right for communication.

163
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,208
They are all right for establishing

164
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:53,375
relationships between countries.

165
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:57,959
But the worst thing they have done is that there is no dharma,

166
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,959
no idea of dharma, no morality.

167
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:06,542
Democracy without morality.

168
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:12,500
To talk of morality in America is something out of the blue.

169
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,500
They cannot understand anyone who talks of morality.

170
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,208
Now, of course, the pangs of their doings

171
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,625
is really torturing them.

172
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:30,125
And also they are realizing, some of them,

173
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,750
that because of immoral behavior

174
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:38,792
they have come to a point where

175
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:43,458
sixty-five percent people of that country who are Americans

176
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:50,208
may suffer from some disease or may just die out

177
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,917
at a very young age.

178
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:58,458
When it is coming

179
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:05,792
as a starking

180
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,000
information is a shock.

181
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:17,041
But despite that, despite all this,

182
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:20,542
they are still going on with it and thinking that

183
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:25,792
“No, no, no, it’s all right. It’s not for us. What is there to worry?”

184
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:30,417
Now His punishments have started,

185
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,792
which they don’t realize how the punishment has started.

186
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:39,750
Now supposing somebody is leading an immoral life

187
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:44,709
and as a result he develops some disease.

188
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:49,750
Now this disease is not curable.

189
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,667
They try everything to find out the ways and methods

190
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,542
of curing these diseases which are coming

191
00:20:56,917 --> 00:21:00,500
out of immoral living. They cannot.

192
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:07,083
It’s an impossible task for all the medical sciences of America

193
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:11,458
to find out how to cure these particular diseases

194
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,208
which are coming out of immorality.

195
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:17,542
But the worst part is that they cannot even say

196
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:21,834
that immorality is wrong.

197
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:28,166
They cannot even openly admit that immoral behavior

198
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,917
leads to these things.

199
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,917
And this immorality is completely neglected

200
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:41,125
in a country of Shri Krishna where He was born,

201
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:47,458
always He says, just to establish morality.

202
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,792
Artificial morality, that is there,

203
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:55,709
like the Islamic talk about or the Christians talk about

204
00:21:56,166 --> 00:22:01,375
or Hindus talk about, is artificial, where they are hypocritical.

205
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:04,166
They follow one code of conduct

206
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:11,667
and another they have for themselves secretly adopted.

207
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:15,750
But America is an open thing.

208
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:19,500
Whatsoever they are doing they are not hiding it.

209
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:22,083
They say, “We don’t believe in hypocrisy.”

210
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,166
So they are not hiding it.

211
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:28,500
And this has led this country, such a vast,

212
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,458
beautiful, rich, prosperous country,

213
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:35,375
into such a ditch that I do not know

214
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:38,500
how it is going to recover unless and until

215
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,375
it takes to Sahaja Yoga.

216
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:48,041
Now another thing what dharma does to a normal person?

217
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:51,750
A dharmic person is the one who is always

218
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:54,500
introspective by nature.

219
00:22:54,959 --> 00:23:01,792
He tries to see, “Am I doing things all right? Is it correct?”

220
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:07,333
He doesn’t allow his mind to justify wrong things.

221
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,875
That is one of the signs of a real dharmic person.

222
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,834
He may not be a Sahaja yogi.

223
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:19,333
But he will ask himself, “Is it right or is it wrong?”

224
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:25,083
But that capacity is completely gone in America.

225
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:28,458
They never try to introspect themselves.

226
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:32,999
On the contrary, they always say, “What’s wrong?”

227
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:37,125
Those people who go on like this

228
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:45,208
will definitely fall into a mess of things

229
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:53,125
that will have no moral conductor, moral guidance.

230
00:23:54,875 --> 00:24:02,125
It is introspection which gives you a awakened conscience.

231
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,999
It’s conscience which tells you, “This is wrong.”

232
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,500
They may be guided in one part.

233
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:11,542
For example, you see, they might say that

234
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:16,125
“We are all right in administration,” maybe, or,

235
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:22,999
“We are all right for, say, our railways, our shipping,

236
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:27,999
our other things, or maybe other economic banks

237
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:29,999
or whatever it is.”

238
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:33,333
But all these things are extremely superficial

239
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,250
for human beings and they are outside.

240
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:42,875
The inside is all managed by the conscience

241
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:48,999
and also through moral inspection of yourself.

242
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:52,041
People say, “Mother, what is this conscience is?”

243
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,917
This conscience is there.

244
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:59,667
It is there all the time, but a person who has to be

245
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:03,875
conscious about it. “I have a conscience”.

246
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:08,125
And this conscience has to answer.

247
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:12,250
That conscience that is within us is,

248
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:18,291
is the light of Shri Krishna within us even before realization.

249
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:22,333
As you know, the ascent takes place, of Kundalini,

250
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:26,959
through the Sushumna which is guided by Mahalakshmi.

251
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:31,041
She is the power of Shri Krishna.

252
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:36,583
By listening to your conscience

253
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:45,291
you develop a proper channel of Mahalakshmi within yourself.

254
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:48,208
But the people who have no conscience,

255
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:52,834
in a particular line it’s not so; it is in every line, in every way.

256
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:55,000
Otherwise, one chakra will be all right,

257
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:57,792
another chakra will be in jeopardy.

258
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:02,125
So the conscience has to be referred to,

259
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:05,917
which is beyond rationality. It is not rationality.

260
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:09,542
Something may look like rational to kill somebody

261
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:11,500
or to snatch somebody’s money

262
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:15,834
or to grab somebody’s land. May seem.

263
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:20,667
But conscience will tell you that this is not right.

264
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:24,500
At a time when people invaded so many countries

265
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:28,375
and tried to overpower them,

266
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:31,333
it was America which was the only country,

267
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:35,041
you must understand, never went out of their bounds

268
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,999
to become empires.

269
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:40,709
Very surprising, what kept them there.

270
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:44,041
Because at that time when all this nonsense was going on

271
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:49,542
all over the world, and that era when people

272
00:26:49,917 --> 00:26:51,834
didn’t mind subjecting other people,

273
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:56,291
taking away their lands and becoming this thing,

274
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,875
America had stopped at that time.

275
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:02,959
Before doing that, they had done once for all.

276
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:06,583
They had occupied the area, they became the landlords,

277
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,792
they became this. Of course they were foreigners.

278
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,333
But after having done that,

279
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:16,166
the era when the people started expanding their empire,

280
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:19,542
they did not do it.

281
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:23,750
Now what is the reason? Why they didn’t do it?

282
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,125
We should ask a question:

283
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,291
when others were expanding their empires,

284
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:32,625
why did not America do it?

285
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:35,500
The reason is very simple.

286
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:39,375
At that time some great people with great conscience

287
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,792
were born in that country

288
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,667
and they guided that country.

289
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:50,291
Like, you can say, Washington was there.

290
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:56,166
Of course, there were so many people, whom if I name there,

291
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,291
there will be a big list of those people.

292
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:01,709
But if you see their character, their life, the way they lived.

293
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:04,250
Abraham Lincoln, if you see his life,

294
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:07,625
full of conscience, full of conscience.

295
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:13,291
And they didn’t allow the nation to be drifted away

296
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:16,709
to the ambition of gathering other countries

297
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:19,375
and making them their slaves and ...

298
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:22,250
This they didn’t do.

299
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:28,542
So in the first place when the,

300
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,458
when, I should say, Columbus went there, conquered them,

301
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:37,000
and tried to … actually, he didn’t do much.

302
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:40,083
But Spanish and then others, and then Anglo-Saxons,

303
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:43,166
all of them, when they conquered that country,

304
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:46,291
once they settled down there,

305
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:52,166
as if that era was over for them once for all,

306
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:55,959
and then they started talking about freedom,

307
00:28:56,417 --> 00:29:00,667
of democracy, of higher values.

308
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:08,291
But the karmas of their past,

309
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:14,083
the way they killed so many aboriginals,

310
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:17,125
so many Red Indians,

311
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:21,667
will not be forgiven by Shri Krishna

312
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:27,542
unless and until now they take to Sahaja Yoga.

313
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:32,333
Despite that time when they did not try

314
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:36,166
to overpower other countries and to spread their empire

315
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:42,375
and do all kinds of cruelties, like Hitler, they didn’t do that.

316
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:46,041
And they always stood for something that is justice …

317
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:48,250
tried to, I mean, at least.

318
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:52,291
Then they became hypocritical also but on the whole,

319
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:55,667
on the face of it, they tried to show

320
00:29:55,999 --> 00:29:58,999
that they are for uniting the whole world.

321
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:04,083
They are against racialism, against fundamentalism, all these,

322
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:09,834
I mean, just some sort of an idealism they propagated.

323
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:16,625
But despite all that, all these ideas of self-destruction

324
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:19,542
started working in them.

325
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:24,959
So I would say it is nothing but their karmas

326
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:29,166
are working against them.

327
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:35,917
And that’s how the violence is so much rampant there.

328
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:39,041
So many diseases, so many things,

329
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:44,834
it is very remarkable that all these troubles have started

330
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:49,375
very, very recently in America,

331
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:55,583
because the exposure is coming up.

332
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:58,999
To add up to that, we had lots of false gurus

333
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:04,583
who went there and captured

334
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:08,417
innocent, simple people who were seeking the truth.

335
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:11,041
We have lost so many of them in America.

336
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:16,542
Also there, I would say, in the atmosphere where these

337
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,959
curses of the people whom they had killed,

338
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:25,250
which reacted, and they took to something that was wrong.

339
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:28,291
Why should they have taken to wrong things

340
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:32,125
as far as their personal life is concerned?

341
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:34,750
Freedom was given to them

342
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:39,250
but they thought freedom is there also to ruin themselves

343
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:43,000
or to make a mess out of their lives.

344
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:47,333
This is a wrong idea which worked in them.

345
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:50,125
Then the whole idea became collective.

346
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:53,208
When it became collective they found out that people

347
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:56,375
like all those things that are destructive.

348
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:58,917
So, we have Hollywood there,

349
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:03,000
we have all such organizations and musicians

350
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:10,500
and big, big, we can say, destructive forces

351
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:18,625
which have formed groups and militant organizations

352
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:26,250
which openly say that “We are that.”

353
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:33,458
For example, only in America we have satan’s,

354
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:38,125
satan’s organization, devils’ organizations.

355
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:42,917
Then there’s witchcraft. Openly.

356
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:48,625
Openly, they are registered organizations in America,

357
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:51,583
when nowhere in the world you can have such a thing

358
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:53,917
that this is a black magic organization,

359
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:55,875
this is a witchcraft organization,

360
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:59,458
openly they are registered there.

361
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:03,166
So to such an extent they have gone;

362
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:07,083
and accepted collectively.

363
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:12,208
The reason is the punishment.

364
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:18,333
That’s why America is the most difficult place for us,

365
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:22,125
for Sahaja Yoga.

366
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,208
One must have real sympathy for them.

367
00:33:25,709 --> 00:33:30,208
They are now passing through the phase of punishment,

368
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:35,583
because their forefathers did all kinds of wrong things

369
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
and they, too, never accepted Dharma as a principle of life.

370
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:45,000
They thought that Dharma means killing your freedom;

371
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:49,959
dharma means it takes away your personal, private life

372
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:56,083
into the hands of something else.

373
00:33:56,542 --> 00:34:01,500
So to establish Dharma in America,

374
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,000
what can we do?

375
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:07,166
I’ve been to America at least ten times

376
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:10,917
more than I’ve been to Russia

377
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:18,583
and I want to really somehow or other bring to their notice that

378
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:21,125
"You have lost your Dharma."

379
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,999
But this will never appeal to them

380
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:24,667
because they are very egoistical.

381
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:28,083
If you tell them like that, then they’ll be very angry.

382
00:34:28,542 --> 00:34:30,959
On the contrary, those who tell them, like Rajneesh

383
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:34,792
and all these people, “Oh, this, no dharma,” their weaknesses,

384
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:38,500
their egos are pampered. Then they are very happy.

385
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:41,500
So it’s a difficult task in that country

386
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:46,083
to make people understand that you are under punishment,

387
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:49,250
that this punishment you can only overcome

388
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,917
if you become Sahaja yogis.

389
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:55,959
With Sahaja Yoga their dharma will be awakened

390
00:34:56,417 --> 00:35:01,834
and all their punishments and all their curses will be over.

391
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,834
It is America which needs Sahaja Yoga much more

392
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:07,041
than any other country.

393
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,000
My concern for America is for the same reason.

394
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:14,000
I’m not saying so much about South America

395
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:16,875
but more about the North America.

396
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:20,375
But even in South America, what I found is

397
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:28,959
that it is a kind of a nation

398
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:36,999
where they have no guidance at all about Dharma, no guidance.

399
00:35:37,792 --> 00:35:40,709
Openly they are doing carnival, this, that.

400
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:46,333
I mean, how can you do it in a country, all those things?

401
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,291
They are following the footsteps of North America.

402
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,625
Like in North America they have that Halloween nonsense.

403
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:55,458
I mean, imagine openly on the street

404
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:57,750
doing Halloween nonsense.

405
00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,667
So they are following carnival.

406
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:03,041
To them, “Ah, what a thing it is to go to Rio,”

407
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:07,041
as if there is a very big achievement and going into that carnival

408
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:08,542
from all over the places.

409
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:13,208
From Australia people are coming down.

410
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:19,792
All this is working against them very much.

411
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:23,500
Their situation is so bad in so many ways

412
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,625
that it is not easy to explain why they are going to that limit.

413
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:37,250
Like thirteen-year-old girls are made into prostitutes in Brazil.

414
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:41,083
Openly.

415
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:46,000
All their trees are cut in Amazon. Openly.

416
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:49,500
Whole smuggling is done, openly.

417
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:52,375
Their politicians are corrupt.

418
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:56,208
There, I mean, so much of black magic there,

419
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:59,542
so much of black magic. Openly that.

420
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:06,000
They are just following the footsteps of North America.

421
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,458
The Dharma is like this Catholic Church is there.

422
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:15,417
What is it going to teach them Dharma, this Catholic Church?

423
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:18,999
So they go to church, they do everything

424
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:25,417
and they come back home with same ideas that they have.

425
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:29,999
There are countries and countries which are so very poor.

426
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:35,625
So that shows that Kubera’s attention is not on that country.

427
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:39,667
Normally, poor people are dharmic, normally.

428
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,458
Because you see, money gives them these ideas

429
00:37:42,917 --> 00:37:45,792
to do all nonsensical things and ego.

430
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:51,375
Normally, the poor people are dharmic but there it is different.

431
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:54,834
They indulge into black magic too much.

432
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:57,999
They were telling Me that it is the black magic

433
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:00,834
which came from Africa and they have accepted.

434
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,875
But so much it is developed in South America

435
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:08,417
that it is impossible to understand that

436
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,625
how they have accepted this nonsense

437
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:15,417
so easily to curse themselves.

438
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:18,625
Now, we have to understand that these problems

439
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:24,291
also exist within ourselves, on our Vishuddhi Chakra.

440
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:31,000
If we have to keep our Vishuddhi Chakra all right,

441
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:36,792
we have two sides as you know, is the left and the right.

442
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:44,999
So the right side is the Vishuddhi Chakra which is speaking,

443
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:48,583
which is talking about Dharma,

444
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:54,333
which is on the aggressive side, we can say.

445
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:58,709
Now those people who are aggressive,

446
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:01,000
who talk in an aggressive manner,

447
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:07,291
who are, say, trying to dominate others by their talks,

448
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,875
are the people who are right-sided.

449
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:16,875
I’ve seen people, those who really do wrong things.

450
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:21,417
Say, a person, a servant steals something.

451
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:25,999
You call him, he’ll be so rude to you that you’ll be amazed.

452
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:27,709
This man is so rude.

453
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:33,000
How can he, how can have been able to steal something?

454
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:37,542
He’s not afraid; he’s answering you back so nicely.

455
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,250
So those people who are right-sided

456
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:43,208
can cover up any sin that they have committed,

457
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:44,875
any wrong they have done,

458
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,625
any murder they have done, by their talk.

459
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:53,959
It could be a talk which is very aggressive, blatant.

460
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:58,500
People might think, “Oh, how can that be?

461
00:39:58,917 --> 00:40:02,083
This man is telling so loudly everything,”

462
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:05,542
and you just, you are stunned and you think,

463
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:08,959
“No, it’s not possible. How can a person who says this thing ?”

464
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:13,583
In this way we, too, as ordinary human beings,

465
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,542
indulge into all kinds of nonsensical things

466
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,917
and then we try to justify it by talking,

467
00:40:23,792 --> 00:40:25,667
wriggling out of it.

468
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,542
You know as many criminals, war criminals,

469
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:36,542
have come out of it by just talking,

470
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:40,375
by creating stories, by showing something like that.

471
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:43,834
That also is with all human beings,

472
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:47,291
they have this capacity to say something

473
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:51,959
by which to hide whatever wrong you are doing.

474
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:54,583
But it is never realized by them

475
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:59,709
that whatever harm you have done is not going to be forgiven

476
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:04,458
and will be less forgiven when you talk like this,

477
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:07,875
because Shri Krishna is finished.

478
00:41:08,417 --> 00:41:13,792
If you start justifying, rationalizing all your wrong things,

479
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:19,333
then you will be punished and you will be punished very badly

480
00:41:19,792 --> 00:41:24,417
in so many ways that you will not know how to get it out of it.

481
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:29,458
Physically, mentally, emotionally, every way you’ll be.

482
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:37,333
So our Right Vishuddhi we have to have a temperament,

483
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:42,250
a culture, a style, a behavior

484
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,500
which has got the quality of Shri Krishna,

485
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:51,083
which is called as madhurya, means melodious, melodious.

486
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:56,041
We should talk in such a manner that it should be melodious.

487
00:41:56,542 --> 00:41:59,583
The person who listens to you,

488
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:07,625
listens as if he’s listening to the flute of Shri Krishna.

489
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:12,375
The voice of a Sahaja yogi should be sweet like that.

490
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:18,166
When you talk to someone it should be melodious.

491
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,709
It should not be aggressive, at all,

492
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:24,083
but on the contrary it should be melodious.

493
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:28,458
It should not be sarcastic; it should not hurt another person.

494
00:42:28,959 --> 00:42:33,542
Any word that hurts others cannot be coming

495
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:36,500
from the proper type of Right Vishuddhi.

496
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:40,667
So in no way one should hurt.

497
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:45,875
I wish all the Sahaja yogis develop that melodious voice

498
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:49,834
of Shri Krishna as their Vishuddhi is awakened.

499
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:56,417
Madhurya, in his behavior, madhurya is – you see,

500
00:42:56,792 --> 00:43:01,417
while talking to someone there are so many gestures by which

501
00:43:01,834 --> 00:43:05,625
you can express your madhurya.

502
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:11,250
For example, specially in Italy and other places,

503
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:13,458
I’ve seen people use too much of their hands.

504
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:15,542
This is also Shri Krishna’s style.

505
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:17,750
So they use their hands in such a way

506
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:21,834
that sometimes you don’t understand what they are meaning.

507
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,500
And sometimes it can be quite aggressive also,

508
00:43:24,917 --> 00:43:26,500
the way they use their hands.

509
00:43:26,917 --> 00:43:29,834
Now, the hands must be used in such a way

510
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,250
that it should create madhurya.

511
00:43:33,709 --> 00:43:38,834
I’ve seen this in Russia or specially in Eastern blocs

512
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:42,625
where people, they have to express their love

513
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,750
– [just put like this, it’s cold] – if they have to say namaste.

514
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:50,709
The whole expression is so sweet,

515
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:57,375
and also their heart is very full when they see Me.

516
00:43:57,792 --> 00:43:59,834
So they don’t know how to express it.

517
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:04,542
So they just put their hands like this.

518
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:07,166
Or they feel shy, they do like this.

519
00:44:07,709 --> 00:44:11,792
Very, very sweet things they express through their hands,

520
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:17,583
through their eyes. It is the tears, you see,

521
00:44:17,999 --> 00:44:25,625
that really create such clouds of, I should say,

522
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:28,667
very dense clouds of compassion in My heart

523
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:33,625
when I see their eyes expressing their love for Me.

524
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:39,333
Everything, the tears, everything, that’s the face,

525
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:44,917
the eyes, the hands, all these belong to Shri Krishna.

526
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:48,542
So in their behavior, in their talking,

527
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,667
how they express themselves.

528
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:54,875
You can use the same eyes

529
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:57,333
for showing your temper and getting angry.

530
00:44:57,792 --> 00:45:00,583
Many people use eyes for controlling others.

531
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:04,458
They’ll put their eyes like this, stare at someone, try to control.

532
00:45:04,959 --> 00:45:11,166
They may use their eyes also for condemning someone.

533
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:15,999
Also sometimes they use, sort of spit at someone

534
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:22,625
or try to show the tongue to insult someone.

535
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:29,917
So in the behavior also we must have a kind of a sweetness.

536
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:33,500
Like when I went to, went to England first,

537
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:36,834
I was, you see, I learnt English in My own way.

538
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:39,291
But when I went there newly they said,

539
00:45:39,625 --> 00:45:41,709
“Now, if you have to say word like ‘thought’

540
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,709
you must say ‘thought’.” I said, “What?”

541
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:48,417
“You must take out your tongue and say ‘thought’”.

542
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:52,250
I said, “Is absurd. Why should you take out your tongue?”

543
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:55,792
He said, “Unless and until you take out your tongue like that

544
00:45:56,125 --> 00:46:00,583
is not something, proper expression.”

545
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So I said, “This is English. You have developed

546
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:06,458
some nonsensical things, to show tongue at it, everyone.”

547
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:08,792
Even a child, you know, when he gets angry

548
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:10,458
automatically he shows his tongue.

549
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:16,917
So you see all these expressions are – and making faces now,

550
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:20,458
as they say that ‘stiff upper lip,’ you see.

551
00:46:20,792 --> 00:46:24,000
You must have heard about that, with a nose like that, you see,

552
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:27,458
snooty nose or a face where you just make your faces

553
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:34,083
and make a crooked face just to tease someone

554
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:39,208
or to make an expression out of your nose.

555
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:41,000
Also people do it like this, you see,

556
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:44,291
to show as if you are sneezing at that person.

557
00:46:44,792 --> 00:46:47,333
All these things, expressions, are coming

558
00:46:47,834 --> 00:46:54,458
out of Shri Krishna’s grace, but the power of that is madhurya,

559
00:46:54,999 --> 00:46:58,250
is the sweetness, the melodiousness;

560
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:04,709
the rapport should be so sweet that that rapport should create

561
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:08,333
tremendous joy and tremendous happiness.

562
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:13,166
As you have heard the song of Baba Mama’s on My eyes:

563
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:17,667
only I looked at him, I say with that glance

564
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,125
– that generated that beautiful music in him.

565
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:25,542
So, as far as possible, as far as possible,

566
00:47:25,959 --> 00:47:29,458
try to put your eyes on the greenery; that’s the best.

567
00:47:29,959 --> 00:47:34,375
Then it soothes down and also you develop

568
00:47:34,834 --> 00:47:37,542
the soothing quality of the greenery.

569
00:47:37,999 --> 00:47:40,625
I always tell people that “Better see the greenery around,

570
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:42,291
how it soothes your eyes.”

571
00:47:42,792 --> 00:47:46,291
In the same way you should try to soothe

572
00:47:47,083 --> 00:47:49,542
the other person when you talk to that person.

573
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:51,500
The person must melt.

574
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:55,792
Instead of that, if you start arguing and fighting with that person,

575
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:57,375
that person will never melt.

576
00:47:57,709 --> 00:48:01,834
On the contrary, you’ll be adding fire, more fire to that person.

577
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:06,166
That was the quality of Shri Krishna, is the madhurya,

578
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:11,417
and that it is expressed in His lifetime

579
00:48:11,834 --> 00:48:15,875
how He beautifully managed to say things

580
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:22,500
in His own sweetness, specially in His childhood.

581
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:26,834
The another quality which Shri Krishna has, which

582
00:48:27,166 --> 00:48:33,333
we can express through our Right Vishuddhi, is diplomacy.

583
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:35,667
But there are two types of diplomacies:

584
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,542
one is genuine; one who is artificial.

585
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:43,667
In the genuine diplomacy you do not have to take to

586
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:48,041
a certain standard or you don’t have to read some books

587
00:48:48,542 --> 00:48:51,750
to know what is diplomacy.

588
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:55,333
Is a genuinely it comes to you.

589
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:59,000
It, the whole thing works very sweetly,

590
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:02,458
in such a genuine manner.

591
00:49:02,917 --> 00:49:05,667
I, I have used it many-a-times Myself,

592
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:08,500
and you all can use it also many-a-times.

593
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:11,917
That’s only possible if you don’t get angry with them;

594
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:15,041
not possible if you are angry.

595
00:49:15,542 --> 00:49:19,500
Now, there’s a story I’ve told you about some,

596
00:49:19,959 --> 00:49:21,291
this Gagangiri Maharaj.

597
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,709
I went to meet him and he was very angry

598
00:49:25,125 --> 00:49:26,834
because he could not stop the rain.

599
00:49:27,333 --> 00:49:28,625
He was supposed to stop the rain.

600
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:30,583
And I was all drenched.

601
00:49:30,959 --> 00:49:32,667
And he was so angry and he said that

602
00:49:32,999 --> 00:49:35,250
“Is it my ego You are trying to control?”

603
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:38,166
and like that he started little bit fighting with Me.

604
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,458
I said, “No, that’s not the reason.”

605
00:49:40,959 --> 00:49:44,166
He said, “Why? Why did You not allow me to stop the rain?

606
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,333
You are all drenched.”

607
00:49:45,667 --> 00:49:48,208
I said, “Because you are a sanyasi

608
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:49,834
and you bought a sari for Me.

609
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:51,999
I would not take a sari from a sanyasi.

610
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:54,458
So I had to get drenched, for your sake.”

611
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:59,417
The whole thing finished off.

612
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,208
The whole anger, temper, finished off.

613
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,542
This is how we have to melt people.

614
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,208
The diplomacy is not convincing anybody

615
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:16,375
with his intellect or by temper or anything

616
00:50:16,792 --> 00:50:22,709
but it is to melt away another person by your goodness,

617
00:50:23,208 --> 00:50:25,542
by your good words, by your sweet words,

618
00:50:25,959 --> 00:50:27,792
by your forgiving nature.

619
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:32,875
This quality He had and He tried this on many people.

620
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,999
It worked on some; it did not work on some.

621
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:38,000
He didn’t feel it’s a failure.

622
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,500
It’s the reaction of the another person

623
00:50:40,917 --> 00:50:43,000
which is important to be seen.

624
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:46,917
So this quality of Right Vishuddhi you should have,

625
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:52,083
is to talk to others and melt them away.

626
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:56,542
I hope in America people develop this quality

627
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,875
and try to improve relations with each other.

628
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:04,208
Actually, to talk to they are very sweet, I must say.

629
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:06,250
They get very friendly with you.

630
00:51:06,625 --> 00:51:08,250
You give them any number of presents,

631
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:11,291
they’ll be very happy but they’ll never give you any present.

632
00:51:11,709 --> 00:51:13,667
You call them for dinner, anything,

633
00:51:14,083 --> 00:51:16,834
they’ll ten times they will come to your house for dinner

634
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:19,166
but they will never call you for dinner.

635
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:22,041
You see, they are very friendly as long

636
00:51:22,417 --> 00:51:23,959
as you are doing anything for them.

637
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:27,917
But when it comes to returning it they find it difficult;

638
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:31,917
they don’t do it. So, you see the whole thing amounts

639
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:35,542
to be a very sweet exploitation of another person.

640
00:51:36,041 --> 00:51:38,959
This is what is to be understood that by sweetness

641
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:42,750
you are not going to exploit anyone but by sweetness

642
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:47,000
you are going to melt that person and bring him to the level

643
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:52,834
that he can understand what is goodness.

644
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,291
Now, about South America, I’ve already told you

645
00:51:56,792 --> 00:52:01,375
that they are extremely simple and innocent people.

646
00:52:01,792 --> 00:52:04,667
They are very poor, simple, innocent,

647
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:08,125
but what has entered them into is this black magic,

648
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:12,417
and which they are now realizing, luckily,

649
00:52:12,834 --> 00:52:15,625
that this is black magic which is troubling them.

650
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:18,542
But somehow they have depended on it so much,

651
00:52:18,959 --> 00:52:20,041
on the left side.

652
00:52:20,375 --> 00:52:22,667
They feel very guilty about it; they feel very bad.

653
00:52:22,999 --> 00:52:25,375
All the time you find them absolutely guilty.

654
00:52:25,834 --> 00:52:27,333
Their whole behavior is that

655
00:52:27,792 --> 00:52:29,875
as if they have done something wrong

656
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:33,166
but they do not know how to correct themselves.

657
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:38,208
So for us is important not to feel guilty about anything.

658
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:41,250
We are all Sahaja yogis.

659
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:44,333
How can we have guilt after all, when we are the spirit?

660
00:52:44,709 --> 00:52:46,458
Spirit cannot have the guilt.

661
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:48,709
So this guilt has to go away.

662
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:54,208
But by guilt what do we do, what we lose is the witness power,

663
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:57,750
because when there is a guilt we put it here, the guilt is there.

664
00:52:58,166 --> 00:53:00,667
But we cannot see.

665
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:04,375
We cannot witness what’s wrong

666
00:53:04,834 --> 00:53:06,792
and we do not want to face the difficulty,

667
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:10,999
our mistakes or the difficulty we have.

668
00:53:11,417 --> 00:53:13,500
Just put it as a guilt here, finished.

669
00:53:13,834 --> 00:53:15,834
Is stored up there nicely, guilt.

670
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:17,917
But we do not want to face it.

671
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:22,417
For example a man, say, or a woman is very cruel by nature.

672
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:26,333
Then suddenly she realizes that she has been cruel

673
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:28,709
or whatever it is. So she puts it down there,

674
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:30,917
“Oh, I’ve been very bad. I’ve been very cruel,

675
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:35,083
this thing, that thing.” But she doesn’t face it.

676
00:53:35,458 --> 00:53:37,875
Facing means she should know, “Why was I cruel?

677
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:40,333
What was the need for me? I should not have been cruel

678
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:44,166
and now I will not be cruel anymore.” That finishes off.

679
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:48,125
But, “I’m very guilty about it. I’m very guilty about it,”

680
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:50,583
doesn’t help. On the contrary, you know,

681
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:52,500
what are the problems are of the guilt,

682
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:57,208
and the same problems are today faced by South America.

683
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,583
When I went there I was surprised that in Brazil

684
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,375
the man who was the topmost there talked to Me in a manner,

685
00:54:06,792 --> 00:54:09,208
“Oh, we are, we know we have lots of defects.

686
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:11,709
We know we are no good,” this, that.

687
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:15,333
What I just say, why doesn’t he correct?

688
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,917
If he knows this is the mistake, this is the thing,

689
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:23,458
why shouldn’t he correct? Then he told Me that

690
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:26,375
“You write to me all the things You found wrong with us.”

691
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:28,583
And it was really very sweet of him.

692
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:32,625
So then one journalist came and we told him.

693
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:35,083
And now I think they are doing something about it.

694
00:54:35,417 --> 00:54:38,000
They are trying to improve it and things will improve definitely.

695
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:43,000
But on the contrary I found that Russia is very different.

696
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:46,583
In Russia they never said, “We are guilty,” or anything,

697
00:54:46,999 --> 00:54:49,542
nothing of the kind. They never said so.

698
00:54:49,999 --> 00:54:51,834
They said, “That time is over now.

699
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:55,417
We are in the kingdom of God. Finished.

700
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:59,792
So that is over. We are now in the Kingdom of God

701
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:03,834
and we have to enjoy life.” Everything positive.

702
00:55:04,166 --> 00:55:06,417
Never talked of their past, of their governments

703
00:55:06,792 --> 00:55:11,333
or this happened, or Stalin or Lenin or anyone.

704
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:14,875
They were not concerned. They were above it.

705
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:17,583
“So why should we worry?” They said, “Why should we worry?

706
00:55:17,917 --> 00:55:19,417
Let them fight. Let them do what they like.”

707
00:55:19,834 --> 00:55:22,458
They don’t want to know anything about their politics,

708
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:25,792
about their problems or anything.

709
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:28,000
They think, “Our problems are solved.

710
00:55:28,417 --> 00:55:30,166
We are now realized souls.

711
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:33,375
We are enjoying ourselves. Let us enjoy.”

712
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:37,000
Very straight-forward way of understanding Sahaja Yoga.

713
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,458
But I’ve seen people, they write to Me

714
00:55:39,834 --> 00:55:42,250
ten pages of their confessions as if I am a priest,

715
00:55:42,667 --> 00:55:46,000
Catholic priest, you see, all about their, what they have done,

716
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:48,458
this they have done, and I don’t want to read it.

717
00:55:48,875 --> 00:55:51,583
Just throw it or I burn it off.

718
00:55:52,041 --> 00:55:54,542
So they try to confess. There’s no need to confess.

719
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,709
There’s nothing to say. And not to dwell upon

720
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,250
what wrongs you have done, but now enjoy what you have got it.

721
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:06,208
It’s like this: supposing a beggar is made a king, all right?

722
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:09,999
Then he should enjoy his kingdom, should behave like a king.

723
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:12,333
But still he remembers his past more,

724
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,291
so anybody who passes by he says,

725
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:18,625
“Give me five rupees or five pounds.” It’s like that.

726
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,999
Once you are in the Kingdom of God,

727
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:23,458
know that you are in the Kingdom of God.

728
00:56:23,917 --> 00:56:28,750
But this black magic business is very, very dangerous

729
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:30,834
and it can act through anyone.

730
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:34,166
It can act through your relations, act through your friends,

731
00:56:34,542 --> 00:56:35,875
act through anyone.

732
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:39,458
So one has to be very careful that you do not become,

733
00:56:39,834 --> 00:56:42,709
because of your guilt business or whatever it is,

734
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:46,792
you become vulnerable to black magic.

735
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:49,875
It can ruin you. It can ruin your families.

736
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:53,208
Even if you are a Sahaja yogi it can ruin you.

737
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:57,291
So this guilt business has to be given up completely.

738
00:56:57,709 --> 00:57:00,208
You should not be guilty. Guilt is put into you.

739
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,291
Somebody can say, “Oh you are so bad.

740
00:57:02,709 --> 00:57:05,583
You didn’t do this for me. You didn’t do that,”

741
00:57:05,917 --> 00:57:07,834
or something like that. They put ideas.

742
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:10,500
Then you start feeling, “Oh, I should have done this for them.

743
00:57:10,792 --> 00:57:13,750
I should have. It was wrong on my part,” or something,

744
00:57:14,041 --> 00:57:15,000
and then the guilt starts.

745
00:57:15,375 --> 00:57:17,166
Instead of doing something for that person

746
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:20,458
or instead of understanding that this all nonsense,

747
00:57:20,917 --> 00:57:23,999
they go on brooding on that, brooding and then suddenly

748
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:30,250
they find they are in the trouble of getting possessed

749
00:57:30,667 --> 00:57:33,417
or being affected by black magic.

750
00:57:33,875 --> 00:57:37,583
So one has to forget it and get into the atmosphere

751
00:57:37,999 --> 00:57:43,000
where you know that you are now in the kingdom of God.

752
00:57:43,542 --> 00:57:47,083
For Shri Krishna, whatever is to be said is less than

753
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,583
what He’s said always, I always feel,

754
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:57,000
and that His main work is through our brain.

755
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:01,542
That is Virata. He works through our brain.

756
00:58:02,041 --> 00:58:04,291
And as Shiva works through our heart,

757
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:06,500
He works through our brain.

758
00:58:06,999 --> 00:58:12,583
And after Sahaja Yoga, after enlightenment,

759
00:58:12,999 --> 00:58:16,583
all the subtleties of the brain and the knowledge

760
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:20,709
starts manifesting and expressing itself.

761
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:22,959
But the greatest thing that happens,

762
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,166
that integration takes place in your brain.

763
00:58:25,583 --> 00:58:27,458
It’s not that your heart wants one thing

764
00:58:27,917 --> 00:58:29,792
and your brain wants another thing.

765
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:31,625
The integration takes place.

766
00:58:31,959 --> 00:58:33,542
And when that integration takes place

767
00:58:33,959 --> 00:58:37,208
it’s so easy to lead a very dharmic life.

768
00:58:37,667 --> 00:58:41,999
Even without thinking about it, without reading about it,

769
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:44,291
you just become dharmic.

770
00:58:44,667 --> 00:58:46,625
You are not to be told that you have to be dharmic.

771
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,208
Innately you become dharmic because your brain,

772
00:58:50,667 --> 00:58:54,834
which normally is used for rationality,

773
00:58:55,291 --> 00:58:57,166
for justifying all that is wrong,

774
00:58:57,625 --> 00:59:01,917
becomes dharmic, becomes divine.

775
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:05,792
This is the greatest thing that Shri Krishna does to you

776
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:11,083
is to make your brain, brain itself dharmic.

777
00:59:11,542 --> 00:59:20,625
It becomes a vehicle of understanding Dharma,

778
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:30,834
of leading a dharmic life and of standing firmly on Dharma.

779
00:59:31,291 --> 00:59:37,875
It’s the brain; it is the brain which really,

780
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:44,375
mostly, takes you away from Dharma, apart from black magic.

781
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:49,667
But once your Sahasrara is opened out,

782
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:55,667
Virata is expressed.

783
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:58,250
Then you are amazed at yourself.

784
00:59:58,625 --> 01:00:01,000
The one who was indulging into everything thinking,

785
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:04,000
“This is pleasure. This is my right. I should have done it.

786
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:06,083
Who else can tell me?” and all that,

787
01:00:06,417 --> 01:00:09,375
suddenly you become a prophet.

788
01:00:09,792 --> 01:00:12,959
This is the greatest blessing of Shri Krishna

789
01:00:13,291 --> 01:00:18,500
that He is Virat, and the Virat is your brain,

790
01:00:18,999 --> 01:00:23,083
and the brain of God Almighty is Virat.

791
01:00:23,542 --> 01:00:26,125
So this is what one has to realize,

792
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,999
that after realization a person gets ideas

793
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:33,959
which are always constructive, and if they are not,

794
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:35,959
then you are not yet a Sahaja yogi.

795
01:00:36,417 --> 01:00:40,709
Constructive and dharmic, that is very, very important

796
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:45,959
for us to understand, where is our mind going?

797
01:00:46,417 --> 01:00:53,250
Is it contradicting, it is telling something else than what it is?

798
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:58,417
We have to just keep a watch and you’ll be amazed to see

799
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:02,792
how your brain has changed its ways.

800
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:06,875
The upside brain has become normal.

801
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:13,999
This you can get very easily if you just meditate

802
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:20,458
every day and see for yourself how the expression

803
01:01:20,917 --> 01:01:26,083
of your Sahasrara is penetrating into your being

804
01:01:26,542 --> 01:01:29,542
and is acting in your life.

805
01:01:29,959 --> 01:01:33,750
Then all the powers of Sahaja yogi will be manifested

806
01:01:34,208 --> 01:01:38,208
and you don’t have to anymore doubt yourself,

807
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:40,917
and others will never doubt you.

808
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:43,500
May God bless you.
