1
00:01:36,915 --> 00:01:41,580
﻿It is such a pleasure, again, to come to Hampstead

2
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,858
and to the town hall of Hampstead.

3
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:51,180
Hampstead has a special place in the play of the Divine.

4
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:58,204
Perhaps the people living in Hampstead,

5
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:04,900
do no know the significance of this place.

6
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:16,378
But we know there have been great poets who have created,

7
00:02:16,622 --> 00:02:21,231
out of the beautiful atmosphere of this area

8
00:02:23,362 --> 00:02:27,740
and one of them was William Blake

9
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:32,180
who has said a lot about the future,

10
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:35,860
about the future ascent of man.

11
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,740
He is one of the greatest seers of modern times, I should say.

12
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:45,900
Into such details he has gone that it is surprising,

13
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:53,220
how a human being,

14
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:04,132
could reach that height of understanding of the Divine laws.

15
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:10,780
We understand the laws that are made by human beings.

16
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:17,390
These laws also have come to us,

17
00:03:18,536 --> 00:03:20,881
through our unconscious,

18
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:25,140
through that great energy within us,

19
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:29,904
which inspires:

20
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,060
how to regulate our lives,

21
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:43,420
how to improve and how to give the basics,

22
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:47,780
required securities in life.

23
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:52,500
The whole social structure was based,

24
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:55,986
on the laws,

25
00:03:56,846 --> 00:04:00,379
that we received from the unconscious.

26
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:04,620
If human beings think that they have got these through their mental projection,

27
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:06,820
they are sadly mistaken.

28
00:04:07,929 --> 00:04:13,020
Whatever you project through your mental effort is actually dead.

29
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,852
It’s already there; whatever is known to you is in the library,

30
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:21,500
you have to just read it.

31
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,700
But whatever new has to be known comes to you through the unconscious.

32
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:32,117
This unconscious knows the Divine laws,

33
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:37,820
and by the time it arrives at the human awareness,

34
00:04:38,465 --> 00:04:43,860
there are some distortions, there are some misunderstandings.

35
00:04:44,953 --> 00:04:49,060
That’s how we go on improving our systems,

36
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,048
our governments, our ideas –

37
00:04:53,623 --> 00:04:55,623
how to change,

38
00:04:56,109 --> 00:05:00,431
how to be more peaceful,

39
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:05,459
how to be more congenial with each other,

40
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,660
how to keep countries together,

41
00:05:09,253 --> 00:05:13,380
bound in some basic things.

42
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:17,653
But alas, what we find,

43
00:05:17,853 --> 00:05:21,260
that human beings have separated themselves,

44
00:05:22,352 --> 00:05:27,141
nations have separated themselves, the whole world,

45
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:31,900
is on the brink of breaking into pieces.

46
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:39,820
The laws that are based, actually,

47
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:45,460
basically, on the fact that man must love man,

48
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:53,820
sometimes start creating hatred amongst human beings.

49
00:05:56,208 --> 00:06:00,382
But Divine laws never change. They are eternal laws.

50
00:06:00,904 --> 00:06:04,940
They are the laws that are made,

51
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:10,420
for only our well-being.

52
00:06:11,635 --> 00:06:13,635
Nothing bad can come through them.

53
00:06:16,953 --> 00:06:21,820
And to understand these laws we have to enter into,

54
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,189
the Realm, the Realm of God,

55
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:31,900
into the Realm of where they operate, to understand them.

56
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:36,820
For example, to understand the laws
of England, I had to come to England.

57
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:43,340
In the same way, you have to enter into
the Kingdom of God to understand those laws

58
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:48,380
and you are amazed how effective they are,

59
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:51,060
how universal they are.

60
00:06:52,142 --> 00:06:54,823
Supposing there is a Sahaja Yogi in London

61
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:58,820
and one in China, another in Russia

62
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:02,900
and one in Australia,

63
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:05,580
they speak the same language,

64
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:09,140
they know the same thing,

65
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:15,743
because these are the laws manifested,

66
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:21,980
by the All-pervading universal Divine power of the love of God.

67
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:26,220
It cannot be contained into small pots,

68
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:30,580
into small nations,

69
00:07:31,304 --> 00:07:35,140
into small brains of human beings.

70
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,780
Those laws govern us everywhere.

71
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:45,980
For example a flower becomes a fruit under that law.

72
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:51,020
A seed becomes a tree under that law.

73
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,460
Your heart pulsates under that law.

74
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,620
Your food is digested under that law.

75
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:03,585
You are brought to your balances, also, under that law.

76
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:09,786
For example, you are an extrovert, you work
very hard and you think of the future all the time –

77
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,540
your heart will be attacked.

78
00:08:13,857 --> 00:08:18,940
Supposing you work too much, means you work 
with your brain, your heart will be attacked – a balance.

79
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,060
If you work with your heart too much,

80
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,460
you are en emotional person, you weep too much, cry too much,

81
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:31,100
then your brain goes out. Look at the balance!
The heart should go out but the brain goes out.

82
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:35,620
All these balancing forces are worked out,

83
00:08:36,344 --> 00:08:40,420
by this All-pervading Power of love.

84
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:44,460
Now many people have talked
about this All-pervading Power of love.

85
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,253
Everybody says, “This is love”. There’s a big organisation coming up,

86
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:53,488
every third day, I find a organisation of love!

87
00:08:56,421 --> 00:09:01,389
This All-pervading Power, has been felt by so many before,

88
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,913
but when they wrote of it others took,

89
00:09:05,113 --> 00:09:08,590
a key from that, or a clue from that,

90
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,860
and started dead organisations in the name of All-pervading Power.

91
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:19,340
Now, this All-pervading Power is a very subtle thing.

92
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,142
At this human level you cannot feel it,

93
00:09:22,343 --> 00:09:26,313
it’s a fact, you cannot feel this All-pervading Power at all.

94
00:09:26,513 --> 00:09:30,260
If you say, “I feel it!” then you are denying the reality.

95
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:33,860
If you want to live with unreal things,

96
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,700
dishonest to yourself, then nobody can help!

97
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:41,140
But if you are honest you have to know,

98
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,020
that this All-pervading Power – when you have –

99
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,483
you yourself become collectively conscious.

100
00:09:47,683 --> 00:09:51,860
You yourself have a different awareness than what you have.

101
00:09:53,936 --> 00:09:59,108
Now people might say, “Alright, 
We have felt that different awareness!

102
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,260
We are there!” The other day
somebody told me that, “I am God-realised!”

103
00:10:07,736 --> 00:10:12,900
I said, “Alright, now there must be 
something special about you to be God-realised.”

104
00:10:13,692 --> 00:10:18,700
And when we talked about things
I was amazed what he was saying!

105
00:10:19,121 --> 00:10:23,169
And I just couldn’t believe how could he believe into such a,

106
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,562
thing as pronouncing that he was God-realised.

107
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:34,420
So we have to understand that, when these laws operate,

108
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:39,300
they operate but we do not know about them, we cannot feel it.

109
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:43,580
At the most we might see a flower becoming a fruit

110
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,460
but can we say how it becomes?

111
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:50,493
It’s a living process.

112
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:54,020
All living processes can be only reported,

113
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,500
but they cannot be explained.

114
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:58,917
For example, you can say,

115
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,785
the foetus is there,

116
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:06,820
the foetus has to grow and a child is born.

117
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
This is just reporting!

118
00:11:09,978 --> 00:11:14,740
But how can you explain that
a foreign body goes into a human being,

119
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,132
into the mother’s womb, and it is not rejected?

120
00:11:19,332 --> 00:11:24,187
According to all laws known, everything that
goes into the human body has to be rejected.

121
00:11:24,388 --> 00:11:29,300
But it’s not rejected, it is nurtured, looked after, loved.

122
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:34,020
And then at the right time it is thrown out of the body.

123
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:39,100
Who does all these things? 
We don’t want to know about it.

124
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,220
We have turned our faces to that.

125
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,740
We never explain that. We can report
that there is gravity in the Mother Earth

126
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:52,169
but how there is gravity and why
there is gravity, that we cannot explain.

127
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,098
Alright, this is being very honest I should say,

128
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,500
that whatever we cannot explain, we should accept it.

129
00:11:59,211 --> 00:12:02,860
And we have to now know is there any method,

130
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:08,140
to find out how these things happen, how it is worked out.

131
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:14,540
After all, in the realm of science,
you haven’t found out everything so far

132
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:17,789
and whatever you
have found out you have only found out,

133
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:22,100
the things that you can see, 
perceive, by this human awareness

134
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:26,660
but nothing beyond. You cannot explain anything.

135
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:30,900
And once you know that you cannot explain,

136
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,580
you just take it for granted and say that, “It’s alright.”

137
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:39,740
One of the things that we have 
taken for granted is our human awareness.

138
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:45,460
We do not want to think that there must be
some reason God has made us human beings.

139
00:12:46,877 --> 00:12:49,780
We know there is evolution, that we accept, thank God!

140
00:12:50,155 --> 00:12:55,540
Now no more somebody is going to
crucify me for saying that you are evolved!

141
00:12:56,538 --> 00:13:00,220
But nobody want to think why,

142
00:13:00,869 --> 00:13:06,020
why are we evolved to be human beings: to be crazy people?

143
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,220
To be paranoid?

144
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,900
Or to be just insured
in some insurance company? To die?

145
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,020
Or to love two, three children
and to leave all the money in their name?

146
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:26,300
Or some sort of a limited sphere that
we think of, in which we find satisfaction?

147
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:33,380
Was that the reason for this Universal 
Being to create us into a human being?

148
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,860
There must be some purpose, it cannot be purposeless.

149
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,900
Why did He create us? We must all think.

150
00:13:40,442 --> 00:13:44,260
Is it just to slog and run a rat race and then die?

151
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:46,780
Or is there something beyond?

152
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,300
And when people start thinking about something beyond

153
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:58,194
then some create an image
of God and say, “Alright, there is God.”

154
00:13:58,395 --> 00:14:02,980
Then they say, “Alright, if there is no 
God, there is some sort of a Cosmic power.”

155
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,780
Or they have given big, big names to all this unknown power.

156
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:13,361
It’s a simple name I give it is – Love of God.

157
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:16,782
That also many people use, you will be amazed.

158
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:20,460
‘Love of God’ – many people use it.

159
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:24,580
But when you know this love of God

160
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,140
then this love flows from you –

161
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:34,660
it just emits, it acts.

162
00:14:35,622 --> 00:14:39,740
It works out the way a flower becomes a fruit,

163
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,180
in the way all these things happen.

164
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:48,140
This flow of love acts

165
00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:52,940
and that action, you may call it ‘miracle’ or whatever it is,

166
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,940
but it’s very natural, because if it is flowing now,

167
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:01,380
on a level that is available to you,

168
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:06,273
it has taken you to a subtler level from where,

169
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:10,820
you are emitting this, you get connected.

170
00:15:11,357 --> 00:15:15,460
Say to that tremendous power of universal love,

171
00:15:16,224 --> 00:15:18,224
then it must act.

172
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,786
It’s easy to talk about it. I mean you can have people,

173
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:26,220
who can give lectures and lectures and lots of lectures about love.

174
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,505
Also you can see groups of people just moving in a wave,

175
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:36,060
like some drugged or

176
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:41,820
alcoholic people saying, “Oh, we 
are all in love you see! We are moving.”

177
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,880
But it doesn’t act! Love has to act!

178
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,220
If it is not acting then it is not God’s
love, it is some sort of a mental projection

179
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,005
or maybe your imagination that you are in love

180
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,438
and you are in a romantic situation or some sort of a thing like that!

181
00:15:59,638 --> 00:16:04,300
It’s something like any other human romantic adventure.

182
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:08,247
This is not Reality.

183
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:14,220
Love of God, in Reality, acts, manifests.

184
00:16:15,543 --> 00:16:17,620
And how does it manifest?

185
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,860
As Mohammed Sahib has said,

186
00:16:23,118 --> 00:16:27,940
that, “At the time of Resurrection, your hands will speak.”

187
00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:32,339
Their mouth only speaks, not the hands.

188
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:37,460
With the mouth they will say, “Alright, 
this is in love of God we are doing this.”

189
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:44,380
Sometimes I see all these plays going on,

190
00:16:44,913 --> 00:16:47,699
or we can say the circus going on.

191
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:53,700
I am amazed how can they befool 
themselves and befool others for nothing at all.

192
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:58,131
When this dynamic love flows it acts

193
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,940
because this is the vital love.

194
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:06,820
This is the love which has energy of giving energy to others.

195
00:17:10,023 --> 00:17:14,860
This is the love that combines all the energies of the world.

196
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:21,606
And if this love, cannot do the work,

197
00:17:22,036 --> 00:17:27,813
of those energies, what’s the use of having this love or talk about it?

198
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:31,272
So the time has come for people now

199
00:17:31,473 --> 00:17:36,220
to face it directly and see it directly, what it is.

200
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:39,860
But the most surprising thing is,

201
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:45,120
that human beings don’t like the Truth, they don’t like it normally.

202
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:51,784
If they are put some show, of artificiality,

203
00:17:53,553 --> 00:17:56,620
you will get thousands of people here sitting down.

204
00:17:56,858 --> 00:18:00,275
You may get the whole of Delhi caught up into it;

205
00:18:00,568 --> 00:18:02,980
some sort of an artificial thing

206
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,260
which has no relationship with God and his love,

207
00:18:06,646 --> 00:18:09,107
that is very much more appreciated.

208
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:15,300
Because people think by that they don’t have to achieve something;

209
00:18:16,218 --> 00:18:19,300
there’s nothing to be done about it.

210
00:18:20,313 --> 00:18:22,073
For example,

211
00:18:22,376 --> 00:18:26,465
if I say I am going to take out a diamond from the air

212
00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:31,060
then thousands will be impressed,
especially in the developing countries,

213
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,580
where they think diamond is the last word for God to give us!

214
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,967
It’s a headache you know that.

215
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:41,241
Thank God the diamonds have now gone down in value!

216
00:18:42,043 --> 00:18:45,646
So now they will take out something else from the air!

217
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:50,736
But there are many who are mad after 
such people who materialise things and give you.

218
00:18:50,936 --> 00:18:55,620
I mean, one should use the brains! God has given us for using it!

219
00:18:57,554 --> 00:19:03,340
Do you think that God is interested in giving us diamonds?

220
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,158
Then there are people who will tell you,

221
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:13,940
“Alright, if you stand on your head for ten days, every day,

222
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:19,580
then you will have your Realisation, you will become a great man.”

223
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:24,700
So they will do it, because it’s a challenge to the ego.

224
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,928
But after ten days, having all the headaches and all that,

225
00:19:28,128 --> 00:19:32,540
you go to the gentleman: he’ll say, “No, these were your karmas!

226
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:36,060
You had some blockages.

227
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:40,855
And this happened and that happened, that’s why you didn’t get it!”

228
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,528
So you do it with a double energy,

229
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:48,700
the same thing again for ten days.

230
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,192
Within one month you are starved, finished, and you might develop,

231
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:57,082
epilepsy or something and finish off in a lunatic asylum – could be, anything.

232
00:19:58,423 --> 00:20:00,500
There could be some other type

233
00:20:00,745 --> 00:20:05,380
who would say, “Alright we must all 
meditate. Meditate here, meditate there.”

234
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,385
You cannot meditate! You have to be in meditation:

235
00:20:09,586 --> 00:20:14,480
means you have to be in that subtle 
awareness where you are collectively conscious.

236
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,420
It’s an awareness. It’s a higher awareness than what you have.

237
00:20:20,882 --> 00:20:24,688
Now then they start meditating
– meditate on this, meditate on a light,

238
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:27,100
meditate on your head and all that.

239
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:32,524
You are to be connected first.

240
00:20:33,728 --> 00:20:36,060
Even prayers are the same thing.

241
00:20:36,544 --> 00:20:42,420
If you are praying, praying like mad, God must be fed up, first of all.

242
00:20:42,778 --> 00:20:46,041
If not, if He is not fed up with you,

243
00:20:46,241 --> 00:20:50,700
at least one should find out, 
“Are we at least connected with God?”

244
00:20:52,453 --> 00:20:56,740
How are we to believe that
whatever we are talking is heard by Him?

245
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,580
What is the proof?

246
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,820
We have to first of all establish that there is a rapport

247
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,103
already established between us and God.

248
00:21:12,303 --> 00:21:16,500
If it is not so, then you are dishonest.

249
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:22,540
Because, if you are a scientist, you must first verify,

250
00:21:23,258 --> 00:21:28,060
that whatever you are doing, you are doing in a proper way.

251
00:21:29,323 --> 00:21:33,140
I would say most of the people who have been now,

252
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,740
going to different groups and churches and this and that,

253
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,540
are thinking, “What are we doing? Are we doing something sensible?”

254
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:47,500
What have we being doing?
What did our forefathers do? Is it correct?

255
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:53,020
Did it lead us anywhere or did we lead others anywhere?

256
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,434
Why not ask this question?

257
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,220
You see, nowadays, I have seen some people,

258
00:21:59,512 --> 00:22:03,397
sit down and plan out how to make 
it more interesting for people to come.

259
00:22:03,597 --> 00:22:07,504
I mean, they may start,
for example, a discotheque in a church

260
00:22:07,704 --> 00:22:10,420
or anything, to make it more entertaining!

261
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:14,460
I mean, is that the way you are going to reach God?

262
00:22:15,937 --> 00:22:20,820
That could be the attitude of any 
sect which is not yet connected with God!

263
00:22:22,156 --> 00:22:28,220
That’s why I would say that, we, all of us, have to face ourselves

264
00:22:28,643 --> 00:22:33,220
and ask ourselves honestly, “Are we connected to God or not?”

265
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,340
Now, how are we to know whether we are connected or not?

266
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,900
I mean if you believe you are
already connected I have nothing to say!

267
00:22:42,552 --> 00:22:46,302
Because this argument can,

268
00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:50,860
take me away to such an extent
that I will have no time for others!

269
00:22:51,255 --> 00:22:56,098
The other day one gentleman took half an
hour just arguing and I had to work you know!

270
00:22:56,426 --> 00:23:02,020
And he kept me busy very selfishly and I said, “Now will
you please stop it and come and see me some other time!”

271
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:04,303
And the others were all waiting!

272
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,380
So we have to find out how far,

273
00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:17,220
do we know that we are connected to God.

274
00:23:18,783 --> 00:23:21,420
How are we going to find out,

275
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,312
that is very, very simple. Very simple it is.

276
00:23:28,513 --> 00:23:33,138
How do you find out that this is receiving my mouth,

277
00:23:34,364 --> 00:23:37,780
My mouth piece that it is receiving my sound?

278
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:42,200
That on the other side a person can hear;

279
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:44,740
that means this is working alright.

280
00:23:46,932 --> 00:23:51,540
Now if I ask a question and that person can answer it,

281
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,900
that means he is listening to me and this is working alright.

282
00:23:57,513 --> 00:24:02,020
Now supposing my talking on this mic,

283
00:24:02,922 --> 00:24:08,265
is giving some recording there, say on a graph,

284
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,350
and when that person asks the question,

285
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:18,180
my answer again goes in the graph which answers his question,

286
00:24:18,735 --> 00:24:22,636
then he will definitely believe that the
connection is there. Isn’t it? It’s a simple thing.

287
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:25,037
That’s the way we do it everyday.

288
00:24:28,261 --> 00:24:31,140
There is no question of blind faith.

289
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:34,560
So when your hands speak,

290
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,537
you ask a question, it’s very simple.

291
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:41,260
You see, for people it has to be something very serious!

292
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:45,188
Oh, you must discuss it

293
00:24:45,388 --> 00:24:47,475
and talk in a very serious manner!

294
00:24:47,675 --> 00:24:51,882
The whole is thing is extremely serious as if
there is a big operation is going to take place:

295
00:24:52,082 --> 00:24:55,320
your stomachs are going to be cut out
and something is going to be pushed into it

296
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:58,381
and then your Realisation is going to be worked out!

297
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:01,620
But look at the flowers how they become the fruit.

298
00:25:02,455 --> 00:25:04,624
And how did you become a human being?

299
00:25:04,824 --> 00:25:07,244
Without any seriousness about it!

300
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:12,256
Of course, it is not frivolous, but it is cheerful!

301
00:25:12,457 --> 00:25:16,580
And the whole thing, if you understand, that this operation,

302
00:25:17,425 --> 00:25:20,500
is happening because you are made for it,

303
00:25:21,317 --> 00:25:23,317
because,

304
00:25:26,004 --> 00:25:28,088
you are built-in for it.

305
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:30,859
All these things are within yourself!

306
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:37,134
Just it is a matter of connecting you to the mains.

307
00:25:37,697 --> 00:25:43,020
And when that thing has to happen it should be the simplest

308
00:25:43,255 --> 00:25:49,355
because you have already reached a certain point,
only from this point you have to go one step forward.

309
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:55,582
For that you need not spend thousands 
of years writing books and this and that.

310
00:25:56,223 --> 00:26:00,222
But people can’t understand. They have a big objection that,

311
00:26:00,423 --> 00:26:05,315
“How Sahaja Yoga is just available to people who just come there,

312
00:26:05,515 --> 00:26:09,820
their Kundalini rises and they just 
get Realisation?” I say, “Why not?”

313
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:15,500
According to them you must read 
some books on law, income tax, everything

314
00:26:15,887 --> 00:26:19,582
and then find out about God, ultimately.

315
00:26:19,783 --> 00:26:25,380
Or maybe you should belong to some union or something, to political party and all that you should do,

316
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:30,525
and then if you come to Sahaja Yoga,
then you are rightly place for Sahaja Yog.

317
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:32,558
It’s not!

318
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:36,780
What books do we read for our breathing?

319
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:43,580
What knowledge do we have for our breathing? 
Nothing. We breath, that’s all! Isn’t it? Simple as that!

320
00:26:44,108 --> 00:26:48,946
In the same way your Realisation, is absolutely living and simple.

321
00:26:49,146 --> 00:26:54,660
For that, you don’t have to waste 
your energy on all these artificial things.

322
00:26:55,203 --> 00:26:58,420
It’s a living process of a living God.

323
00:27:01,227 --> 00:27:03,817
And then it is to be verified.

324
00:27:04,018 --> 00:27:06,648
So as Mohammed has said, correctly,

325
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,500
that, “Your hands will speak.”

326
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,420
Means what?

327
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,490
To be very frank,

328
00:27:15,315 --> 00:27:18,420
I must say I am very fortunate, compared to all of them,

329
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,540
because in modern times you cannot crucify me.

330
00:27:22,197 --> 00:27:24,100
And Mohammed Sahib,

331
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,660
was given poison and tortured all his life. That won’t happen to me.

332
00:27:30,622 --> 00:27:34,420
You cannot cut short my life as you did that of Christ.

333
00:27:36,016 --> 00:27:40,112
In four years what could he do to these fishermen?

334
00:27:40,312 --> 00:27:43,260
What could he tell them? Four years is nothing!

335
00:27:43,655 --> 00:27:47,540
I was working on seven British,

336
00:27:47,952 --> 00:27:50,155
intelligent people,

337
00:27:51,217 --> 00:27:53,740
for four years – struggling with them –

338
00:27:54,092 --> 00:27:58,020
so what are four years for a person like Christ?

339
00:27:59,826 --> 00:28:02,900
Whatever he tried to say, in a nutshell,

340
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:07,940
has to be explained.

341
00:28:09,015 --> 00:28:12,340
We must find out some other methods by which,

342
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,700
it can be complimented.

343
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:20,045
But anybody who says you have to go
to some other books to find out about him –

344
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:22,940
oh – they will be very angry!

345
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,178
They will not have it. They will have
their own mental projections about it

346
00:28:27,378 --> 00:28:30,300
and they’ll produce it before you saying, “See! This is it!”

347
00:28:31,238 --> 00:28:35,420
And that’s how people are 
surprised why none of them are near him

348
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:40,226
how they lead such a horrible life and call themselves,

349
00:28:40,683 --> 00:28:44,062
the followers of Christ or followers of Mohammed or followers,

350
00:28:44,262 --> 00:28:47,620
of any other great incarnations on this earth.

351
00:28:48,651 --> 00:28:52,020
The reason is there is no relationship,

352
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,140
there is no rapport.

353
00:28:58,271 --> 00:29:02,260
If there was there would have been no problems

354
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:07,060
because they are all related to each other. As Christ has said,

355
00:29:07,727 --> 00:29:12,180
“Those who are not against me are with me.” And who are those?

356
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:15,980
I mean you didn’t give him a chance to talk much

357
00:29:16,545 --> 00:29:20,660
and whatever he has said, he has tried to point out,

358
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,791
as much as possible, what is going to happen in the future.

359
00:29:25,047 --> 00:29:27,260
He has talked of the future.

360
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:32,140
He has said, “I’ll send you a counsellor, I’ll send you a redeemer.”

361
00:29:32,803 --> 00:29:37,365
He has talked about this, but what about looking out for that?

362
00:29:37,566 --> 00:29:39,379
Instead of that people are satisfied:

363
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:43,941
Sunday morning, get ready, go to 
church, come back home – finished!

364
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:48,900
Then they get angry, then become communist!

365
00:29:50,637 --> 00:29:54,462
They think if this is hell, the other is heaven! That’s equally the same!

366
00:29:54,663 --> 00:29:56,663
No difference at all.

367
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,940
Deny God! By denying God are you going to find him out?

368
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,940
Like a lady who says, “I love my husband,”
and goes for a divorce! Something like that.

369
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,702
It’s absurd.

370
00:30:09,903 --> 00:30:13,412
If you love your God and you want to find him out

371
00:30:13,613 --> 00:30:15,786
then how can you deny Him?

372
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:19,740
Alright, some people are wrong but you should find Him!

373
00:30:20,894 --> 00:30:25,482
Within you resides this great power of God, which is the Spirit;

374
00:30:25,682 --> 00:30:29,581
which is described by all the great scriptures of the world.

375
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:35,700
Once you get to that Spirit, once that light,

376
00:30:36,561 --> 00:30:42,300
the great light of your own Spirit 
shines in your attention, you are amazed!

377
00:30:42,825 --> 00:30:44,917
The whole thing gets integrated:

378
00:30:45,117 --> 00:30:48,700
your physical, mental, emotional being gets integrated.

379
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,460
That’s how you get rid of your diseases automatically.

380
00:30:55,614 --> 00:30:59,460
Your Spirit does everything. People sometimes thank me.

381
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,020
I said, “What is there to thank 
me? I mean I haven’t done anything.”

382
00:31:03,785 --> 00:31:08,498
You are like a lamp and there is the Spirit,

383
00:31:08,698 --> 00:31:14,500
only the Spirit has come into your attention by
Kundalini awakening, which is your own Mother.

384
00:31:15,822 --> 00:31:19,580
You can do it the same way, you can do the same work.

385
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,300
So there is nothing to thank me about it.

386
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,700
And when it happens,

387
00:31:26,571 --> 00:31:31,020
you become collectively conscious, again I say – you become!

388
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:39,860
The other day I had a phone call from someone who is a patient,

389
00:31:40,236 --> 00:31:44,700
and one of the Sahaja Yogis has been able to cure that patient.

390
00:31:46,427 --> 00:31:51,239
The lady, she’s from India – she said,

391
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:56,860
“Mother I have been to many 
sadhus and saints and real saints and seers,

392
00:31:58,219 --> 00:32:03,540
but none of them do any upkaar,”
means they do not try to help us out,

393
00:32:03,873 --> 00:32:07,922
“See, we have to go, touch their
feet and all that, but nobody does this!

394
00:32:08,123 --> 00:32:11,789
And look at this Sahaja Yogi, for
not paying a single pie to him, nothing,

395
00:32:11,989 --> 00:32:16,060
he comes every second day and he’s cured me completely!

396
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:18,798
And he’s enjoying that.

397
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,940
He doesn’t ask for money, he 
doesn’t take tea, he just comes home and

398
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:27,700
tells me how to do it and just it has
awakened now and he’s trying to establish it.”

399
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,940
Nobody does that! If you go to
them they’ll give you a big lecture:

400
00:32:32,811 --> 00:32:35,890
“Don’t do this and don’t do that!”

401
00:32:36,717 --> 00:32:42,256
All kinds of commandments they 
come out with, but they never help us.

402
00:32:43,276 --> 00:32:45,810
Upkaar has no translation,

403
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:51,058
in English language, I’m sorry to say, but it
means ‘gracious helping’ in the concrete form.

404
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:55,500
You see graciousness is also we can say, “I’m gracious”

405
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,300
but may not do anything about it, you see.

406
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,500
I could be gracious without doing anything about it.

407
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:03,700
I can say I’m compassionate

408
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:06,743
but may not do anything out of compassion, you see.

409
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:11,680
Or you can say that, “Oh, she’s very 
compassionate!” But what has she done?

410
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:16,700
It’s a concrete thing that you do out of your compassion; is upkaar.

411
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:23,399
And that’s what she said and I was amazed really: what are they doing all these saints

412
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,300
who are such great born-realised souls.

413
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,580
In India we have many saints, you will be surprised; everywhere I find there are saints.

414
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:35,573
They are quite satisfied with themselves but 
they are not bothered that they have to help others:

415
00:33:35,774 --> 00:33:38,820
and a gracious help;

416
00:33:39,137 --> 00:33:41,086
which could be health,

417
00:33:41,492 --> 00:33:44,420
could be their well-being,

418
00:33:44,741 --> 00:33:47,700
could be their family relationships,

419
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:51,340
or could be their spiritual ascent.

420
00:33:51,728 --> 00:33:53,715
But spiritual ascent is the main thing!

421
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:57,580
If that happens everything works out automatically.

422
00:33:57,892 --> 00:34:01,180
Like when the light is put in, you see everything clearly.

423
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,860
In the same way, once this thing happens, it should work out.

424
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,736
I think there is no compulsion of anything.

425
00:34:10,936 --> 00:34:13,660
Whatever type they are they can come to Sahaja Yoga.

426
00:34:15,031 --> 00:34:17,100
Drunkards have come to my programme

427
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,020
and shouted at me at the top of their voices; they have.

428
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:26,460
Fanatics have come to my 
programme with a Bible, about to hit on my head!

429
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:33,220
People have come from all walks of life and all types of people.

430
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:37,780
But once they are changed they know this is the Spirit

431
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,020
and this is what we have to have.

432
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:45,340
If you are a seeker you get it much faster.

433
00:34:46,009 --> 00:34:50,268
If you are a superficial person you will 
come only for sickness or something, then your -

434
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:54,460
you will feel - curiosity will be 
awakened, then you will become a seeker

435
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,340
and ultimately you will get your Realisation.

436
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,458
It takes time for some people like that.

437
00:34:59,658 --> 00:35:04,380
If you are already conditioned and 
you have fixed ideas about yourself,

438
00:35:04,797 --> 00:35:08,580
that God is like this or God is like that,

439
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:12,580
then you have to come out of it a little bit, gradually;

440
00:35:13,055 --> 00:35:16,260
and then you see for yourself what it is.

441
00:35:17,644 --> 00:35:20,500
Sitting in my car, if I had been thinking about this hall,

442
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,580
I would have never have been able to see what sort of a hall it is

443
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:28,220
but when I came in I can see it clearly!

444
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:30,500
But supposing,

445
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:35,580
I was stuck up with the ideas that I 
had about God or Realisation or anything,

446
00:35:35,936 --> 00:35:37,940
I would have been just there,

447
00:35:38,256 --> 00:35:41,100
not here to see what it is like.

448
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:44,453
So all these things, all the blockages,

449
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:48,820
do retard the speed of Realisation, no doubt,

450
00:35:49,878 --> 00:35:53,900
but all of you have to have Realisation because the time has come.

451
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,820
This is the special time

452
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,420
when all of you must have your Realisation.

453
00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:05,211
What will happen if you do not have your Realisation? Many people ask me.

454
00:36:07,492 --> 00:36:11,300
I cannot see any answer to the collapse of human beings,

455
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,620
collapse of all this Creation,

456
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,940
if people do not get their Realisation.

457
00:36:17,372 --> 00:36:20,300
This is the complete emancipation of human beings!

458
00:36:21,669 --> 00:36:24,980
All the diseases of the world are because of that,

459
00:36:25,618 --> 00:36:29,140
all the political, economic problems are because of that.

460
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,740
All other calamities are because of that.

461
00:36:34,213 --> 00:36:38,100
The nature is trying to teach you, make you understand.

462
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,926
Your own temperament is reacting against you.

463
00:36:42,774 --> 00:36:44,581
You are restless.

464
00:36:44,852 --> 00:36:47,740
The whole atmosphere looks so dark.

465
00:36:48,516 --> 00:36:52,056
That is the time when you start looking out for God.

466
00:36:52,341 --> 00:36:55,521
If everything is fine, nobody is bothered about God!

467
00:36:56,138 --> 00:37:00,260
These modern times, called as Kali Yuga, are the best suited

468
00:37:01,241 --> 00:37:05,806
and that’s why many people who are seeking God are born

469
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:11,740
on this earth and they are a special category of the seeking.

470
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:17,366
They are called as ‘seekers’ but how 
many of them know what they have to seek?

471
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:22,346
They stick on to things which are absolutely absurd,

472
00:37:22,546 --> 00:37:25,500
which has nothing to do with God.

473
00:37:26,973 --> 00:37:30,599
Like a guru says that you can seek God

474
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:37,635
through sex relationships is absolutely wrong. You cannot.

475
00:37:41,562 --> 00:37:45,100
Because it is available to everyone!

476
00:37:45,615 --> 00:37:51,591
Every person has got it,

477
00:37:52,475 --> 00:37:57,904
every animal has got it and the more 
you are an animal the more you become that.

478
00:37:58,855 --> 00:38:01,824
You need not run away from it, no doubt,

479
00:38:02,024 --> 00:38:05,460
but you must have a sane, proper life,

480
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,300
a sane married life, a balanced life,

481
00:38:10,451 --> 00:38:12,180
then it works out.

482
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:16,468
As you will grow in Sahaja Yoga then you will see how much harm it is done,

483
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:19,940
to us, to our innocence,

484
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:25,500
the way we have played around with our sex life.

485
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,871
It does harm us.

486
00:38:28,071 --> 00:38:31,317
It can be seen in nature also

487
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:37,018
how we suffer from diseases and other kinds of problems,

488
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:40,220
because we have lost our innocence.

489
00:38:40,924 --> 00:38:43,460
It’s alright to say, “What’s wrong?!”

490
00:38:44,307 --> 00:38:46,580
But no, there is wrong;

491
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,317
believe me there is wrong.

492
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,860
But before Realisation I don’t want to say anything about it.

493
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:56,660
For example, people would say, “What’s 
wrong in smoking?” when I first came to England.

494
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,300
Now they know it’s wrong.

495
00:38:59,552 --> 00:39:02,379
Or about drinking, they know it’s wrong.

496
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:08,180
But I don’t say, “You don’t drink, you 
don’t smoke, or don’t have all those habits.”

497
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,199
I don’t say that.

498
00:39:10,721 --> 00:39:14,860
You just get your Realisation, then I will talk to you.

499
00:39:16,568 --> 00:39:18,980
Before Realisation all questions start,

500
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,780
“Why not this? Why Mother said so?”

501
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,100
“Why this?” and “Why that?”

502
00:39:26,251 --> 00:39:28,740
But once you get your Realisation

503
00:39:29,274 --> 00:39:32,860
then you don’t say that, you just give it up.

504
00:39:33,652 --> 00:39:37,620
Today only somebody, before coming here, 
came to see me and he said he has given up drinking.

505
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,113
I said, “How?”

506
00:39:39,314 --> 00:39:43,460
He came from India and he thought he 
was a Englishman, you see now he must drink!

507
00:39:43,913 --> 00:39:46,939
And he used to drink everything. 
He became an expert on that, you see.

508
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,541
He was about to write a book on that! I mean, there’s a science of it!

509
00:39:50,741 --> 00:39:52,523
I said, “How is it you have given up?”

510
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,994
He said, “Mother, I just can’t drink now anymore! What to do?”

511
00:39:56,194 --> 00:40:00,260
He just laughed. I said, “Can’t drink 
at all?” He said, “Just can’t drink Mother!”

512
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:06,140
I said, “What happens?” He said, “Oh, I feel 
horrible! It smells like this and smells like that and smells.”

513
00:40:08,401 --> 00:40:13,820
I think he gets the smell of the molasses 
or something, from where it has originated.

514
00:40:15,365 --> 00:40:17,411
I don’t say anything about those things.

515
00:40:17,612 --> 00:40:21,900
Many people have told me that, “Mother, in 
Sahaja Yoga you cannot come if you are drinking.”

516
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:26,580
No, no, you drink a lot. Even if you 
have got drunk today doesn’t matter to me

517
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:31,728
because once your Spirit is awakened it will look after you.

518
00:40:31,928 --> 00:40:34,100
You have that thing within you.

519
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,481
That correcting point is within you. That joy-giving point is within you.

520
00:40:38,681 --> 00:40:42,620
That emancipating point is within you.

521
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,580
That ennobling point is within you. I don’t have to tell you.

522
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,923
Just awaken it and you will be amazed how powerful you became.

523
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:53,321
All your habits drop out.

524
00:40:56,861 --> 00:41:00,540
All your slavery drops out

525
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:02,980
and you become a free man,

526
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:06,740
absolutely powerful to handle yourself the way you like.

527
00:41:08,247 --> 00:41:10,585
This is what it is, the Self-realisation.

528
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:14,620
It should act, within and without.

529
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:20,220
It acts within you and also without – on other people.

530
00:41:20,915 --> 00:41:23,100
If there is a Realised-soul,

531
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:26,661
he acts on others – automatically.

532
00:41:26,862 --> 00:41:29,936
He need not speak, he need not say anything.

533
00:41:30,136 --> 00:41:34,180
But it has an effect of making that person relaxed

534
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,940
and see a balanced view of the whole thing.

535
00:41:41,351 --> 00:41:45,940
Things change very fast for a Sahaja Yogi,

536
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:51,983
once he knows the technique of manoeuvring this wonderful power.

537
00:41:52,631 --> 00:41:55,728
First you have to get it, then establish it

538
00:41:55,928 --> 00:41:58,300
and then to know how to arrange it

539
00:41:59,045 --> 00:42:00,815
and organise it.

540
00:42:01,016 --> 00:42:05,166
Once you know that, you yourself become 
the guru. There is no need to have these gurus,

541
00:42:05,366 --> 00:42:11,060
for whom you have to pay such a lot of money and 
sell your houses and take out your children from schools.

542
00:42:11,494 --> 00:42:16,494
You become the guru. But you become the guru who is a real guru.

543
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:21,354
The guru who knows all about oneself,

544
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,820
all about the Divine Power

545
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:30,904
and all about the real knowledge of how to impart,

546
00:42:31,104 --> 00:42:35,368
this joy of Spirit.

547
00:42:37,634 --> 00:42:42,980
I think this lecture has to be stopped now

548
00:42:43,275 --> 00:42:48,020
because I have spoken so many times,

549
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:53,500
even in Hampstead; and much more in Caxton Hall.

550
00:42:55,857 --> 00:43:01,140
And there are people here who are 
great Sahaja Yogis sitting down before me,

551
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:06,260
who look just like you, but if you see them and 
talk to them you will find out they are a different type.

552
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:13,692
It’s difficult also for anybody to accept 
anybody of the same clan as a guru – very difficult.

553
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:18,782
So we had to send some English
Sahaja Yogis to India to talk about,

554
00:43:18,983 --> 00:43:23,421
Sahaja Yoga because if I talk they 
say, “Oh! She’s from our corner, you see.

555
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:28,260
I saw her the other day in the car,” or something.

556
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:35,420
But they are Sahaja Yogis and you all can become that.

557
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,900
There is nothing like superiority or inferiority.

558
00:43:39,178 --> 00:43:42,780
There’s nothing like feeling in any way less or more.

559
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,316
You are just going to become. You are just ready.

560
00:43:46,516 --> 00:43:49,900
They have come earlier so they have 
got it and now you are going to get it.

561
00:43:50,263 --> 00:43:53,700
These flowers will become fruit tomorrow

562
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,020
and the others will become the day 
after. What difference does it make?

563
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:01,422
Because in the Realm of God there 
is nothing like time, it is eternal life.

564
00:44:01,732 --> 00:44:07,000
It is eternal life where you enter, where there is no time, no space.

565
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,820
And that is the life one has to achieve.

566
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,660
But not by just lecturing or taking a lecture in,

567
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:19,899
or thinking that Mataji is quite a good lecturer or bad
 lecturer – whatever you may think – that’s not the way.

568
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:25,420
The time has come of actualisation. Of really getting it within you.

569
00:44:25,654 --> 00:44:29,340
That’s what it is. Of course for this you can’t pay.

570
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:35,460
You can’t pay for love. I mean, it’s very childish to say 
but some people think that, “How can it be we cannot pay?”

571
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,086
You don’t have to pay for it. You can’t pay.

572
00:44:38,286 --> 00:44:43,036
Payment means some sort of an 
inferior understanding of the whole thing.

573
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:49,701
This is Divine love. How much do these 
flowers pay to God for making them into fruits?

574
00:44:49,858 --> 00:44:52,930
And how much did you pay to become a human being?

575
00:44:53,335 --> 00:44:55,681
How much do we pay for breathing?

576
00:44:55,882 --> 00:45:01,142
Maybe in London you are paying because you 
have stopped all the air to come in! What to do?

577
00:45:01,275 --> 00:45:06,415
You have to pay for your own doing, for the 
undoing of it you have to pay: that’s a different point.

578
00:45:06,798 --> 00:45:10,140
But otherwise everything is available to us free

579
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,381
and God’s grace is available to us free. It has to be,

580
00:45:13,581 --> 00:45:17,581
because it is so vital it has to be free.

581
00:45:19,921 --> 00:45:25,327
The whole system of God’s working is is fantastic!

582
00:45:27,578 --> 00:45:32,197
When you become Sahaja Yogis 
you will be amazed to know that His,

583
00:45:33,116 --> 00:45:35,007
television system,

584
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:39,718
His intercommunication system, are so well developed

585
00:45:40,105 --> 00:45:44,123
that we cannot conceive with this mind

586
00:45:44,714 --> 00:45:48,525
how quick and efficient they are: they never fail.

587
00:45:48,725 --> 00:45:52,546
We may fail, but they never fail.

588
00:45:54,592 --> 00:45:58,780
For all of you who are here I am very much thankful

589
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:03,177
that you have listened to me so carefully,

590
00:46:03,377 --> 00:46:07,140
but take your Realisation and then go.

591
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,420
You have come here for Realisation; take your Realisation and go.

592
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:13,643
There is no fear of anything happening to you.

593
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:19,900
If you belong to some cult or to some group or to some ideas

594
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:24,980
you must know that you have to know yourself!

595
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:29,609
Otherwise how will you know others? You are in a confusion.

596
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:34,393
There are many people who come and fight for 
some cults or things like that – I am surprised at them.

597
00:46:34,593 --> 00:46:40,806
Why are you supporting anyone which has not given
 you anything? None of your powers are manifesting?

598
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:43,837
Have they given you some money? No! We have given them money!

599
00:46:44,037 --> 00:46:46,753
Then why are you paying money to fight for them?

600
00:46:46,954 --> 00:46:50,420
If there is a lawyer, if he fights for you, you have to pay him!

601
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,587
Have you seen any lawyer who will fight for you,

602
00:46:53,788 --> 00:46:56,145
for whom you have not given money?

603
00:46:56,345 --> 00:47:00,293
But the cult business and other things are such,

604
00:47:00,493 --> 00:47:06,417
that you are so brainwashed that you think it’s your duty to fight.

605
00:47:07,034 --> 00:47:11,220
But where are you? Have you 
known yourself? Do you know yourself?

606
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:14,279
Do you know your relationship with you and the whole?

607
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,652
Do you know your relationship with yourself and this,

608
00:47:17,853 --> 00:47:23,060
cult of yours which has put you 
into a group? You cannot have a group.

609
00:47:23,426 --> 00:47:27,420
You cannot form into groups. It’s a universal thing.

610
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:32,620
That cannot be formed into an organisation. It cannot be organised.

611
00:47:33,117 --> 00:47:38,642
If it is universal, if it has to do with the Divine love, you cannot organise.

612
00:47:38,842 --> 00:47:42,367
Only if it is something human, which is dead, you can organise it.

613
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:47,300
Alright, do what you like! You have 
secretaries, president, this that and the other.

614
00:47:47,747 --> 00:47:51,153
But anything that is living, you cannot organise.

615
00:47:51,353 --> 00:47:54,208
If you try to organise it dies.

616
00:47:54,409 --> 00:47:58,551
And that is why one should understand God’s love,

617
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:01,687
that flows sometimes as the sap in a tree;

618
00:48:01,887 --> 00:48:07,068
which goes to all the places, from 
the roots it comes and goes all over,

619
00:48:07,268 --> 00:48:12,079
gives it’s love to the tree, to the bark,

620
00:48:12,815 --> 00:48:14,815
to the thorns,

621
00:48:15,188 --> 00:48:19,580
to the leaves to the flowers and ultimately to the fruit.

622
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,836
It doesn’t settle down into one.

623
00:48:22,036 --> 00:48:27,374
It doesn’t form a group, otherwise the whole tree dies

624
00:48:27,575 --> 00:48:30,167
and also that group dies with it.

625
00:48:30,367 --> 00:48:34,595
If the tree cannot live how can that group,

626
00:48:34,795 --> 00:48:37,562
of cells exist?

627
00:48:38,731 --> 00:48:42,140
Also, as you have seen in life,

628
00:48:42,434 --> 00:48:48,060
in the cases of cancer, one cell starts growing,

629
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,340
it starts growing big and big and big.

630
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:55,034
When it starts growing big it becomes very big

631
00:48:55,235 --> 00:48:58,909
and whosoever it touches, it forms a group with that.

632
00:48:59,109 --> 00:49:03,626
It becomes malignant. With that it tries to overpower others.

633
00:49:03,826 --> 00:49:06,556
You cannot overpower anyone with love.

634
00:49:06,756 --> 00:49:09,992
You do not want to overpower anyone. Why should you?

635
00:49:10,192 --> 00:49:15,300
There is no need to aggress anyone in 
this, nor to take any aggression from anyone.

636
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:21,140
It is the most balanced personality that you develop.

637
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:24,093
Because love cannot be forced on anyone.

638
00:49:24,293 --> 00:49:27,140
You have to ask for it otherwise it doesn’t work out.

639
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,462
You cannot force Sahaja Yoga on 
anyone. Supposing you come and tell me,

640
00:49:30,662 --> 00:49:34,540
“Mother my son hasn’t got Realisation, 
give him Realisation!” I cannot!

641
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,234
I cannot do it. It has to work out.

642
00:49:37,434 --> 00:49:41,380
Even my own son I may not be able to give Realisation too.

643
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:46,918
If he’s not getting it, he’s not getting 
it. You cannot give a certificate to that!

644
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,220
But the way people come, with the attitude, is as if,

645
00:49:52,579 --> 00:49:54,980
there can be an aggression

646
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,460
or there can be a demand.

647
00:49:57,757 --> 00:50:00,431
I am sorry, you cannot demand it!

648
00:50:00,632 --> 00:50:04,980
You have to get it, achieve it and deserve it, in a way.

649
00:50:05,181 --> 00:50:09,749
And that deserving comes through your only one

650
00:50:09,949 --> 00:50:12,622
and only one quality:

651
00:50:12,822 --> 00:50:16,191
that is the true seeking.

652
00:50:18,605 --> 00:50:21,381
If you are not truly seeking,

653
00:50:21,743 --> 00:50:25,243
then you will always run after things which are not truthful.

654
00:50:25,478 --> 00:50:29,300
If you are truly seeking, then you will discard all that is,

655
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,203
not the Truth and come to the Truth.

656
00:50:32,403 --> 00:50:35,324
If so, it works out,

657
00:50:37,276 --> 00:50:39,500
very well and very fast.

658
00:50:40,043 --> 00:50:44,487
So may God bless you all. Those who want to have Realisation,

659
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:49,209
have to be settled down a little bit

660
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:55,220
and they have to just put their hands towards me like that.

661
00:50:56,322 --> 00:51:01,593
Before that I don’t mind if you 
want to ask any questions. I don’t mind.

662
00:51:01,793 --> 00:51:04,761
But one should not ask questions

663
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:09,300
in such a way that you disturb the whole audience,

664
00:51:09,618 --> 00:51:15,328
you take away all their possibilities of 
getting Realisation, and try to show off.

665
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,512
And if you have to give a big lecture it is better

666
00:51:18,712 --> 00:51:22,720
you again hire this hall and get the people and give them a lecture.

667
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,856
But here people have come, 99%, to get Realisation.

668
00:51:28,056 --> 00:51:31,486
So one should not be like a dog in the manger policy, you see.

669
00:51:31,687 --> 00:51:34,011
If you don’t want to have it – alright, don’t have it.

670
00:51:34,211 --> 00:51:37,123
You can go away. As I told you I cannot force on you.

671
00:51:37,324 --> 00:51:40,357
I have not to achieve anything or gain anything from you.

672
00:51:40,558 --> 00:51:44,140
If you have to gain your own Self-realisation, you’d better have it.

673
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:48,540
But if you just are here to use this audience for your own purpose

674
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,740
then that’s not fair,

675
00:51:51,063 --> 00:51:54,572
that’s not fair at all, because then you can go

676
00:51:54,772 --> 00:51:59,500
and you can again hire this hall and address to the people.

677
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:05,210
I have seen, also, people standing outside and
 shouting and saying, “Oh, come to our organisation.”

678
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:09,180
Then why not advertise in the paper and get them for that?

679
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:12,817
This is not the way to be fair to anyone.

680
00:52:13,017 --> 00:52:15,237
We would not do that to any organisation.

681
00:52:15,437 --> 00:52:18,212
For example, if there is an organisation

682
00:52:18,413 --> 00:52:22,260
which is working out it’s methods – alright, let them work it out.

683
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:27,500
We’ll not go and visit that organisation and go on saying that, “This is wrong, that is wrong,” except,

684
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:32,654
when there are people who belong to that
organisation who have come to Sahaja Yoga

685
00:52:32,854 --> 00:52:36,980
and have achieved something then they want 
to tell others – that’s a different point altogether.

686
00:52:37,191 --> 00:52:42,780
But this is not fair and I would 
request you that please don’t try to waste the,

687
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:46,580
time of other people who are genuine, who are seeking.

688
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:51,103
If you want to ask any nice, good 
question, you are welcome; you should ask.

689
00:52:51,303 --> 00:52:54,580
I mean, I am open to all your questioning, no doubt about it.

690
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:56,650
Thank you very much.

691
00:52:59,857 --> 00:53:04,740
So, any questions please ask. 
Somebody has to be here to communicate to me.

692
00:53:15,437 --> 00:53:17,860
Anyone has any questions?

693
00:53:29,738 --> 00:53:35,700
Alright! So just a simple thing is to put your hands towards me.

694
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,324
I am sure Graham must have told you about,

695
00:53:38,525 --> 00:53:41,420
these finger tips have got the five centres,

696
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:46,180
and six and seven centres. These are 
right and left sympathetic nervous systems,

697
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:50,700
within us which have got these centres working here.

698
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:55,460
Now, whatever I say, you need not believe in me altogether.

699
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:59,360
But also should not deny me 
because I am not doing anything to you.

700
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:03,398
Just to expect something that will happen to you

701
00:54:03,598 --> 00:54:07,241
which I do not want to tell you 
because, you see, people come with an attitude

702
00:54:07,441 --> 00:54:11,207
as if I am going to mesmerise them 
and take away something from you.

703
00:54:11,407 --> 00:54:13,697
And then they think, “Oh, why this and why that?”

704
00:54:13,897 --> 00:54:18,018
I do not want to take anything 
from you whatsoever, take it from me.

705
00:54:18,686 --> 00:54:20,940
And I do not want anything from you.

706
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:25,103
Only thing is, if you cooperate with me a little, it will work out.

707
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:29,679
But if you do not want to have it it’s better 
to leave the hall and leave others in peace.

708
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,700
I would request you to do that.

709
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,420
Now put your, just, hands like this. Straight like this.

710
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:38,500
Simple hands, like this, and close your eyes.

711
00:54:39,755 --> 00:54:42,796
And please don’t open your eyes till I tell you.

712
00:54:42,996 --> 00:54:45,981
Before doing that I hope you take out your shoes

713
00:54:46,181 --> 00:54:49,060
because the Mother Earth helps us a lot

714
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:52,660
and we have a nice wooden floor we can do it.

715
00:55:01,953 --> 00:55:04,401
Please keep your eyes shut, that’s very important.

716
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:08,820
Don’t open your eyes because when
 the Kundalini rises above the Agnya,

717
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,980
it does not rise because,

718
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:19,380
if your eyes are open it does not rise.

719
00:55:34,842 --> 00:55:36,488
This is your own.

720
00:55:37,549 --> 00:55:41,300
Everything is within yourself, which you have to get.

721
00:55:44,312 --> 00:55:47,972
As it is, in every Western country I have seen,

722
00:55:48,172 --> 00:55:52,700
the first blockage is that everyone feels guilty.

723
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:56,980
Now I have to again request you not to feel guilty.

724
00:55:57,475 --> 00:55:59,220
There’s nothing to feel guilty.

725
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:05,020
After all you are a human being means 
you are at the epitome of the Creation of God,

726
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:08,384
and what is there to feel guilty,

727
00:56:08,947 --> 00:56:13,031
when God is the ocean of forgiveness,

728
00:56:13,232 --> 00:56:17,420
ocean of compassion, ocean of love?

729
00:56:17,745 --> 00:56:21,140
Then what is there to feel guilty about? For what?

730
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:24,820
You just have to say, in your heart,

731
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,199
at least thrice, genuinely,

732
00:56:27,399 --> 00:56:31,024
that, “Mother I am not Guilty.” Genuinely I say, again.

733
00:56:34,835 --> 00:56:39,900
Put the hands towards me and not
 towards yourself or towards your hands.

734
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:44,860
Straight please. And now, just say, “Mother I am not guilty.”

735
00:56:46,053 --> 00:56:48,980
Please put them straight! On your lap will be alright.

736
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:51,460
Be relaxed! Be relaxed!

737
00:56:53,051 --> 00:56:54,740
Be relaxed!

738
00:56:56,541 --> 00:57:01,700
There should be no tension about 
anything. It will just work out. It is all within you.

739
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:07,900
It is not going to take any time. And if you have 
any diseases and troubles, as a result you will be cured.

740
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:05,053
Please keep your eyes shut, because you see,

741
00:59:05,253 --> 00:59:09,900
it’s no question of curiosity or anything 
but it has to work out. It’s very hot today.

742
01:01:06,657 --> 01:01:09,100
Now put your right hand, without opening your eyes,

743
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:12,473
please put it on the heart.

744
01:01:12,673 --> 01:01:17,340
Right had on the heart, without 
opening your eyes. Please put it on the heart

745
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:22,916
and ask a question in your heart, a question –

746
01:01:23,116 --> 01:01:27,220
this is the establishment of the rapport – a question,

747
01:01:27,692 --> 01:01:31,980
“Mother am I the Spirit?” Ask a question, “Am I the Spirit?”

748
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:36,140
Right on the heart please.

749
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:39,500
“Mother am I the Spirit?”

750
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:43,438
Some have put it higher some have put it lower so put it just,

751
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:46,079
on the heart where you feel the beat.

752
01:01:47,188 --> 01:01:50,563
And please ask a question, “Mother am I the Spirit?”

753
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:56,879
Which you are!

754
01:02:01,665 --> 01:02:03,740
“Am I the Atma?”

755
01:02:22,515 --> 01:02:26,740
Now put the same right hand on top of your head, on top,

756
01:02:27,955 --> 01:02:31,340
touching it in the centre of the fontanelle bone area,

757
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:35,680
where the fontanelle bone is, 
where you had a soft bone in the head.

758
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:39,940
Just it is little on the front side.

759
01:02:40,195 --> 01:02:45,461
It is more on the front side. Now press 
it with your fingers, in the central parting.

760
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:50,100
Press it with your fingers and turn it clockwise.

761
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,020
