1
00:24:55,002 --> 00:25:04,931
Today we are really sitting in very close
relationship with the nature.

2
00:25:04,931 --> 00:25:13,192
The whole thing, as you can see very clearly,
is done by villagers and in a very simple

3
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:32,922
way and I’m sure you must all be enjoy-ing
it very much.

4
00:25:32,922 --> 00:25:43,672
Today being the first puja in Maha-rastra,
we have to do Ganesha Puja, but one has to

5
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:55,042
understand how it is so impor-tant in Maharastra
that people worship Ganesha.

6
00:25:55,042 --> 00:26:07,312
As you know there are … eight Ganeshas are
there around this area and this triangle of

7
00:26:07,312 --> 00:26:17,412
Maharastra which has got on one side one big
mountain.

8
00:26:17,412 --> 00:26:24,272
On the other side we have another mountain
which, of course, is not in Maharastra.

9
00:26:24,272 --> 00:26:26,441
And also on top we have another moun-tain.

10
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:37,102
So like a triangle which is made like a Mooladhara
means the Kundalini itself.

11
00:26:37,102 --> 00:26:40,792
So the Ku ndalini of the whole world resides
in this area.

12
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:47,892
That’s why it is called, we should say,
as Maharastra, as the country which is very

13
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:50,542
great, the nation which is very great.

14
00:26:50,542 --> 00:27:01,982
But I don’t know how far Maharastrans realize
that they are sitting in the land of Maharastra.

15
00:27:01,982 --> 00:27:17,832
This land which is vibrated by Shri Ganesha
has its own simplicity, has its own vibrations,

16
00:27:17,832 --> 00:27:23,732
a different style, a differ-ent type.

17
00:27:23,732 --> 00:27:35,142
The best part of Maharastra is that it gives
you a very good attention.

18
00:27:35,142 --> 00:27:47,271
With Ganesha so much vibrating, the attention
becomes very concentrated and this concentration

19
00:27:47,271 --> 00:27:57,122
helps you in so many ways and that is why
it is said that Ganesha was created to spread

20
00:27:57,122 --> 00:28:04,082
or to emit auspiciousness and holiness.

21
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:08,842
Actually, if there is holiness there is auspiciousness.

22
00:28:08,842 --> 00:28:21,161
For Ganesha is t he one actually who cleanses
everything, cleanses everything because it

23
00:28:21,161 --> 00:28:29,322
is innocence and the innocence that cleanses
you takes away all kinds of conditionings

24
00:28:29,322 --> 00:28:35,051
and egos that are distracting your attention.

25
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:42,672
So the attention which is so wobbly otherwise
in other places can settle down very well

26
00:28:42,672 --> 00:28:51,812
in Maharastra because of Shri Ganesha’s
blessings that this country has, that people

27
00:28:51,812 --> 00:28:55,622
have very good attention.

28
00:28:55,622 --> 00:29:04,242
With that good attention you can really do
so many things like now, for example, you

29
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,902
can see the software.

30
00:29:06,902 --> 00:29:08,221
Good mathematics.

31
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:16,472
They’re very good at music because all these
things require tremendous attention.

32
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:26,671
Art, dancing, anything which requires tremendous
attention, that has to come only through Ganesha.

33
00:29:26,671 --> 00:29:30,822
Because they say Ganesha is a giver of wisdom.

34
00:29:30,822 --> 00:29:33,882
He’s a giver of wisdom.

35
00:29:33,882 --> 00:29:39,322
Means just His wisdom becomes just a dharma,
becomes a part and parcel of your being.

36
00:29:39,322 --> 00:29:41,192
You become just wise.

37
00:29:41,192 --> 00:29:43,551
Now somebody may ask, ÒMother how to become
wise.

38
00:29:43,551 --> 00:29:46,942
It’s very difficult to say how to become
wise.

39
00:29:46,942 --> 00:29:50,702
It is just that it happens that you become
wise.

40
00:29:50,702 --> 00:29:54,231
So, though He’s a child, He’s so matured.

41
00:29:54,231 --> 00:29:56,132
He’s so wise.

42
00:29:56,132 --> 00:30:08,811
And He’s not only that, but He emits wisdom
and this wisdom is an in-nate quality of anyone

43
00:30:08,811 --> 00:30:14,931
who is a Sahaja Yogi because in him, also,
Shri Ganesha has been awakened.

44
00:30:14,931 --> 00:30:22,692
So he becomes a wise person, very wise, and
with wisdom what does he achieve? He achieves

45
00:30:22,692 --> 00:30:33,852
a balance, a proper ascent and also he understands
that this ascent is for his benevolence, for

46
00:30:33,852 --> 00:30:37,641
the benevolence of his country, benevolence
of the whole world.

47
00:30:37,641 --> 00:30:40,711
He understands the importance of Sahaja Yoga.

48
00:30:40,711 --> 00:30:44,162
Without this wisdom, one cannot understand.

49
00:30:44,162 --> 00:30:53,762
And this wisdom is within us, just absolutely,
in-nately built in.

50
00:30:53,762 --> 00:31:00,382
Only thing is we have to use the storehouse
of this wisdom that is within us.

51
00:31:00,382 --> 00:31:05,811
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga, it starts emitting
and you start feeling and you start understanding

52
00:31:05,811 --> 00:31:07,271
what this wisdom is.

53
00:31:07,271 --> 00:31:10,541
You give up all your stupid, childish things.

54
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:13,841
You give up all your attachments.

55
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:19,581
You give up many of your, say, things that
you don’t like which doesn’t behove you.

56
00:31:19,581 --> 00:31:22,982
You feel that you should give up, but you
cannot.

57
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:28,972
But, with Sahaja Yoga, it just hap-pens automatically
and you just see in your light what is needed,

58
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:30,461
what is not needed.

59
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:33,272
In that wisdom you throw away whatever is
wrong.

60
00:31:33,272 --> 00:31:40,222
So that a great work this Ganesha has to do
within ourselves.

61
00:31:40,222 --> 00:31:46,551
This manifes-tation of Ganesha within us is
very important, I think, not that it is only

62
00:31:46,551 --> 00:31:53,442
the blessings, but also the foundation stone
of spiritual life is Shri Ganesha.

63
00:31:53,442 --> 00:32:01,352
That’s why IÔve been very anxious that
we should find out proper schools for our

64
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,352
children.

65
00:32:02,352 --> 00:32:06,542
They should have proper education and t Ëhey
should be looked after because their Ganesh

66
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:08,102
Tattwa is already there.

67
00:32:08,102 --> 00:32:13,192
Only thing we have to nourish it, we have
to look after it and make it grow.

68
00:32:13,192 --> 00:32:16,341
Once that happens then children are safe.

69
00:32:16,341 --> 00:32:19,201
Then nothing, nothing can harm them.

70
00:32:19,201 --> 00:32:22,222
Nothing they will absorb which is wrong.

71
00:32:22,222 --> 00:32:26,352
They will never be again in the wrong path.

72
00:32:26,352 --> 00:32:32,581
But if from early childhood, you did not have
this kind of training or this kind of understanding

73
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:40,651
about Kundalini or about wisdom part of it,
you can never, later on, easily assimilate

74
00:32:40,651 --> 00:32:41,651
it.

75
00:32:41,651 --> 00:32:49,371
For that, you really require a great effort
and understanding that you have to have this.

76
00:32:49,371 --> 00:32:51,651
It’s so beauti-ful.

77
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:57,002
You must get this attention and you must get
this innocence within.

78
00:32:57,002 --> 00:33:03,031
With Sahaja Yoga, as you see, it’s working
out very fast and people are getting, really,

79
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:08,701
very wise and I can see the wisdom writ large
on their faces.

80
00:33:08,701 --> 00:33:20,051
In this wisdom what do we find here? You see,
on any line that we move, we can find that

81
00:33:20,051 --> 00:33:29,262
most of our problems are coming from human
beings because ecological problem, or any

82
00:33:29,262 --> 00:33:33,922
problem we think of, comes from human beings.

83
00:33:33,922 --> 00:33:39,651
Or other programs that you have in your own
country, as you have seen, that they are such

84
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:44,542
problems that it’s sort of endless and they
cannot change them.

85
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:49,971
You feel very nice sitting underneath this
because you are fed up … that you have and

86
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:58,622
the prob-lems that it causes to you and the
way it is now becoming very artificial.

87
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:10,502
But in these circumstances, one has to understand
that the… wisdom plays such a part in life

88
00:34:10,502 --> 00:34:16,981
that whatever may happen outside, whatever
may be the trend, whatever may be the fashion,

89
00:34:16,981 --> 00:34:22,122
whatever maybe the people are all changing
into, you do not change.

90
00:34:22,122 --> 00:34:23,812
You change within.

91
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:32,762
Once you are changed within, then you have
full idea as to what is expected o f others,

92
00:34:32,762 --> 00:34:39,512
what they should do, what you are doing and
how to deal with them and how to talk to them,

93
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:43,822
how to tell them, how far to go with them
– everything.

94
00:34:43,822 --> 00:34:49,862
All this comes through wisdom.
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, you are very

95
00:34:49,862 --> 00:34:55,351
capable people, you have achieved a lot, you
know everything, you know all about chakras.

96
00:34:55,351 --> 00:34:57,101
You know practically everything.

97
00:34:57,101 --> 00:34:59,581
I don’t have to tell you anything.

98
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:06,081
Despite all that, one should have also the
wisdom how to deal with others, how to talk

99
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:16,002
to others, how to behave towards others, how
not to control anyone, not to say something

100
00:35:16,002 --> 00:35:19,302
that would be rather harsh or hurting.

101
00:35:19,302 --> 00:35:26,942
Because, if you are trying to spread Sahaja
Yoga, this is the only way we can go forward,

102
00:35:26,942 --> 00:35:30,901
is to look after everyone with great compassion.

103
00:35:30,901 --> 00:35:41,351
Now, we might think that wisdom is there with
us and we know how to do so many things with

104
00:35:41,351 --> 00:35:45,421
our wisdom and now we are absolutely wise.

105
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:50,692
Agree, with Sahaja Yogis, now they have become
really very, very wise and they know how to

106
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:56,432
use their wisdom.
But still, faith in themselves really has

107
00:35:56,432 --> 00:36:00,461
to be of the Nirvikalpa state.

108
00:36:00,461 --> 00:36:05,101
That is only possible also through Shri Ganesha
because He is in Nirvikalpa.

109
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:07,932
He has Nirvikalpas, nothing.

110
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,322
He doesn’t have to question anything.

111
00:36:10,322 --> 00:36:12,721
He doesn’t have to ask for anything.

112
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:14,502
He is just there.

113
00:36:14,502 --> 00:36:17,271
And He’s in complete Nirvikalpa.

114
00:36:17,271 --> 00:36:26,791
Complete, absolutely into a state where He
is not at all attached, nor is He worrying

115
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:28,981
about things, nothing of the kind.

116
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:33,952
He is just in Nirvikalpa and in that Nirvikalpa
He worships Mother.

117
00:36:33,952 --> 00:36:42,271
Small, small stories can show He how you were
so sure of Hims }elf, how He had courage and

118
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:48,722
how He worked out everything so intelligently.

119
00:36:48,722 --> 00:36:53,252
But when you are doing something, you can
be in two minds.

120
00:36:53,252 --> 00:37:00,692
You can be not so decisive, but He was and
He is, always very decisive that He knows

121
00:37:00,692 --> 00:37:03,901
what is to be done like the – this is the
point.

122
00:37:03,901 --> 00:37:06,622
So, in wisdom you don’t have to think, argue.

123
00:37:06,622 --> 00:37:12,132
I’ve seen many people who say, Mother, you
see, we were thinking, then we had vibrations.

124
00:37:12,132 --> 00:37:19,492
We didn’t know what to do, this, that, how
to do, how to correct, how to work it out.

125
00:37:19,492 --> 00:37:23,471
Now, I must say this is a state.

126
00:37:23,471 --> 00:37:28,762
It is not a state to be achieved, but it’s
a state.

127
00:37:28,762 --> 00:37:30,021
Means you are there.

128
00:37:30,021 --> 00:37:36,171
It has to be innately built in yourself, this
state of wisdom.

129
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:45,711
But you can also work it out by just concentrating
on yourself and trying to find out Òwhat’s

130
00:37:45,711 --> 00:37:51,242
the matter with me, what happens, why, why
is it I’m like this.

131
00:37:51,242 --> 00:37:58,112
The introspection can help you a lot to be
extremely wise, but Ø easier method is to

132
00:37:58,112 --> 00:38:06,332
worship the principle of innocence within
yourself.

133
00:38:06,332 --> 00:38:15,562
For example now, we are dealing with, supposing,
somebody who is a thief, say.

134
00:38:15,562 --> 00:38:17,802
He’s a thief now.

135
00:38:17,802 --> 00:38:20,661
What should you do with a thief.

136
00:38:20,661 --> 00:38:26,642
After you have found out whatever was lost,
the material you had, after that, what are

137
00:38:26,642 --> 00:38:33,182
you to do is just to forget about it completely.

138
00:38:33,182 --> 00:38:39,851
Once it has happened, then you have to just
forget, not to worry about it too much, Oh,

139
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:47,351
this has happened, that has happened and how
to make this point all right and this gentleman

140
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:48,351
is not all right.

141
00:38:48,351 --> 00:38:49,351
This, that.

142
00:38:49,351 --> 00:38:56,981
Just forget it.
So the wisdom is also in forgiving.

143
00:38:56,981 --> 00:39:00,961
That why Christ talked about forgiveness?
Just forgive.

144
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:04,391
There’s no sense in remembering.

145
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:07,882
This person said so, this person did so, that
happened so.

146
00:39:07,882 --> 00:39:13,052
Just forget it and once you start forgetting
all these things, you know, you’ll remember

147
00:39:13,052 --> 00:39:16,762
right things and useless things you’ll just
forget.

148
00:39:16,762 --> 00:39:23,411
You don’t remember who has insulted you,
who has troubled you, who has be íen misbehaving.

149
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:27,601
I don’t even think about people who have
gone out of Sahaja Yoga, talking ill about

150
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:29,552
Me, saying things, this, that.

151
00:39:29,552 --> 00:39:30,721
It’s all right.

152
00:39:30,721 --> 00:39:34,312
Let them say whatever they like, I am not
bothered.

153
00:39:34,312 --> 00:39:38,451
But what bothers Me more, that if they do
like this, I don’t know what will happen

154
00:39:38,451 --> 00:39:39,541
to them.

155
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:45,053
That’s the only wisdom part of it, that,
you see, when I forgive everyone I … forgive.

156
00:39:45,053 --> 00:39:47,682
I have nothing to say.

157
00:39:47,682 --> 00:39:52,662
But then also a thought comes in, that if
they’re doing like this, then what’s going

158
00:39:52,662 --> 00:39:54,442
to happen to them.

159
00:39:54,442 --> 00:40:02,572
They’re doing this to some one who’s so
good, who’s so religious, so highly placed

160
00:40:02,572 --> 00:40:04,562
in spiritual life.

161
00:40:04,562 --> 00:40:09,822
Then you can’t play about but somebody’s
playing, then what you have to do is to really

162
00:40:09,822 --> 00:40:16,052
forgive because one thing is built-in in Sahaja
Yoga that who tries to trouble you they will

163
00:40:16,052 --> 00:40:19,841
be trouble also.
So try to forgive at least, at least you soothe

164
00:40:19,841 --> 00:40:20,841
them down.

165
00:40:20,841 --> 00:40:22,182
All right, I forgive you.

166
00:40:22,182 --> 00:40:24,782
So soothe them down.

167
00:40:24,782 --> 00:40:30,911
Like this kind of a wisdom you should have,
not to get after people, not to pester some

168
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:42,572
one, not to be very strict, not to be very
sort of – I should say – pursue the matter.

169
00:40:42,572 --> 00:40:47,002
Whatever is it, that point you should finish
off and just don’t worry.

170
00:40:47,002 --> 00:40:51,752
I was telling just now that there is a servant,
supposing.

171
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:54,192
Now, he steals your money, all the time.

172
00:40:54,192 --> 00:40:56,641
You know he steals your money.

173
00:40:56,641 --> 00:41:01,101
Now what to do if he’s stealing your money?
One thing is to get out, to ask him to get

174
00:41:01,101 --> 00:41:02,101
out.

175
00:41:02,101 --> 00:41:03,221
Then you have another one.

176
00:41:03,221 --> 00:41:05,831
Then again you get him out and get another
one.

177
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:12,562
Go on like that because they’re poor people….
Now even if you’re careful, still they might

178
00:41:12,562 --> 00:41:18,461
steal, so what you should do is just to forgive
the person and put the money in such a place

179
00:41:18,461 --> 00:41:20,562
that he cannot reach.

180
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:22,092
Finished.

181
00:41:22,092 --> 00:41:23,541
As simple as this.

182
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:28,221
You should just find out what doe s he steal.

183
00:41:28,221 --> 00:41:29,962
Oh, that’s all.

184
00:41:29,962 --> 00:41:36,731
Then you keep it one side.
But don’t worry about all the time that,

185
00:41:36,731 --> 00:41:43,452
Now, how am I to save myself from this thief
or how am I to punish him? Just don’t think.

186
00:41:43,452 --> 00:41:48,771
These incidents are just like a breeze coming
any way.

187
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:51,262
These relationships are just like that.

188
00:41:51,262 --> 00:41:52,901
There’s no depth in it.

189
00:41:52,901 --> 00:42:00,951
They’re not going to bring any kind of unhappiness
or happiness, whatever it is, if you go on

190
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:06,272
lingering about them.
So, the first thing is live in the present.

191
00:42:06,272 --> 00:42:09,292
The wisdom is in living in the present.

192
00:42:09,292 --> 00:42:12,921
Present, we are here, so forget the past.

193
00:42:12,921 --> 00:42:18,301
Now, if I say forget the past, then they say,
How to do it? How to forget the past.

194
00:42:18,301 --> 00:42:22,431
Again, I would say, meditation is the only
way.

195
00:42:22,431 --> 00:42:28,532
You give up your left and you give up your
right and you are just standing in th e centre,

196
00:42:28,532 --> 00:42:35,051
enjoying the wisdom, enjoying the joy of your
being.

197
00:42:35,051 --> 00:42:45,852
So, the best part of our lives is spent in
bothering, in getting upset, in getting worried,

198
00:42:45,852 --> 00:42:50,171
getting after some one.

199
00:42:50,171 --> 00:42:55,561
Where is the time? Just think like that.

200
00:42:55,561 --> 00:43:01,191
Now supposing some one says something to Me
and then others will say, Mother, you must

201
00:43:01,191 --> 00:43:02,191
do something about it.

202
00:43:02,191 --> 00:43:03,801
You must punish that person.

203
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:13,612
Where is the time? We have to awaken the kundalini
of thousands and thousands and thousands and

204
00:43:13,612 --> 00:43:21,862
here we are just worried about something nonsensical.
So our wisdom is finished.

205
00:43:21,862 --> 00:43:26,282
We have no wisdom at all.

206
00:43:26,282 --> 00:43:30,372
Even at the highest level you can see people
don’t have wisdom.

207
00:43:30,372 --> 00:43:44,701
Highest level of realization I’ve seen people
who do not have wisdom in the sense that

208
00:43:44,701 --> 00:43:51,592
they want to run away, they just get fed up,
take sanyasa, finished, go to Himalayas, live

209
00:43:51,592 --> 00:43:52,592
there happily.

210
00:43:52,592 --> 00:43:55,232
There’s no wisdom in that also.

211
00:43:55,232 --> 00:44:00,522
So living in the present you don’t also
feel tired because you don’t think of the

212
00:44:00,522 --> 00:44:07,112
past and the future and you live very well
and in great happiness, you improve things

213
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:12,291
and you don’t think of the future, what
is going to happen to me or anything and that’s

214
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:19,982
how you save lot of troubles of others, as
well as yours.

215
00:44:19,982 --> 00:44:30,422
So this wisdom is to live in the present,
is now that you ask somebody, How are you?

216
00:44:30,422 --> 00:44:31,712
All right.

217
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:35,032
And he’s not in the present.

218
00:44:35,032 --> 00:44:41,132
You ask somebody, Are you enjoying yourself?
Not in the present.

219
00:44:41,132 --> 00:44:46,622
You ask somebody, Are you happy? No.

220
00:44:46,622 --> 00:44:49,642
Then you are not in the present.

221
00:44:49,642 --> 00:44:57,332
You ask some one that, Are you hungry? Maybe,
may not be.

222
00:44:57,332 --> 00:45:03,232
Maybe they don’t know even in the present
if they are hungry or not.

223
00:45:03,232 --> 00:45:08,372
It’s so much that they’re lost in the
past and in the future, that’s the sign

224
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,922
of unwise behavior, unwise line.

225
00:45:10,922 --> 00:45:16,892
If they don’t know whether they’d like
to have their food or not.

226
00:45:16,892 --> 00:45:22,772
But those who are really in the present forget
all these small, small things.

227
00:45:22,772 --> 00:45:27,362
They’re just in the present and in the present
whatever they have to do, they just do it.

228
00:45:27,362 --> 00:45:30,362
This is a very good practice.

229
00:45:30,362 --> 00:45:35,732
One has to to practice wisdom through living
in the present.

230
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:39,602
Just say, What am I to do right now? What
am I to do.

231
00:45:39,602 --> 00:45:44,002
Like you’re getting out of the house.

232
00:45:44,002 --> 00:45:48,622
Many people leave half way – Oh, my God,
I have left my passport.

233
00:45:48,622 --> 00:45:50,582
They’ll go back.

234
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:53,102
Then again, some time they will come out.

235
00:45:53,102 --> 00:45:55,062
My God, I have left my spectacles.

236
00:45:55,062 --> 00:45:56,692
Again go back.

237
00:45:56,692 --> 00:45:59,712
Then again they will come back and say, I
have lost this.

238
00:45:59,712 --> 00:46:00,782
I should have this.

239
00:46:00,782 --> 00:46:03,932
These kind of people are very, very common.

240
00:46:03,932 --> 00:46:08,782
So at that style when you are leaving the
house, say, at that time, if you’re in the

241
00:46:08,782 --> 00:46:14,712
present, then you just think, What have I
to take? Just say, One, two, three, four,

242
00:46:14,712 --> 00:46:15,712
five.

243
00:46:15,712 --> 00:46:19,311
Yes, this is is what I have to take and this
there.

244
00:46:19,311 --> 00:46:29,321
That’s how you can really establish yourself
in wisdom, itself, means the wisdom acts by

245
00:46:29,321 --> 00:46:30,321
itself.

246
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:31,902
It’s a power.

247
00:46:31,902 --> 00:46:33,171
Wisdom is a very big power.

248
00:46:33,171 --> 00:46:36,542
If you are a wise person, it’s a power.

249
00:46:36,542 --> 00:46:42,791
It can combat any kind of ignorance, any kind
of attacks, any kind of stupidity.

250
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:50,022
It’s such a tremendous power that one has
given us that we are wise and this wisdom

251
00:46:50,022 --> 00:46:58,462
you should try to really, to develop it and
mature it properly within ourselves.

252
00:46:58,462 --> 00:47:01,832
So today’s Shri Ganesha’s Puja is there.

253
00:47:01,832 --> 00:47:07,062
Now you should ask for wisdom and for that
we have to be in the present.

254
00:47:07,062 --> 00:47:11,061
Every way we should be in the present.

255
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:17,962
If you can try, you can be because your kundalini
has been awakened and you can be all the time

256
00:47:17,962 --> 00:47:26,212
in the present, but today you should first
try and get the kundalini established in the

257
00:47:26,212 --> 00:47:27,822
present.

258
00:47:27,832 --> 00:47:31,252
May God bless you.
