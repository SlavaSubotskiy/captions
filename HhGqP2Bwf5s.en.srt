1
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,298
All this being said on My birthday,

2
00:01:29,091 --> 00:01:32,050
really embarrasses Me,

3
00:01:32,424 --> 00:01:37,008
because it's all being already

4
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:42,758
scheduled, it was all timed out.

5
00:01:43,298 --> 00:01:45,716
It had to happen this way.

6
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:49,925
And the time has come now that

7
00:01:52,382 --> 00:01:59,133
this whole world has to take to global understanding.

8
00:02:01,217 --> 00:02:04,258
Human beings, I was surprised,

9
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:09,298
are how anxious in those difficult times

10
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:13,674
to get to the truth; because very difficult

11
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:18,633
to carry on with the truth, when there's untruth all along.

12
00:02:19,298 --> 00:02:23,298
And the way people get after you when you talk of truth,

13
00:02:23,674 --> 00:02:28,841
is also a very hazardous task to fight them

14
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,591
those who are just always

15
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:38,217
going to cruelties,

16
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:42,298
to untruth, to aggressiveness.

17
00:02:43,382 --> 00:02:46,800
These are all self destructive elements.

18
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:51,298
Also we have other self destructive elements within us,

19
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:55,716
like drinking, smoking,

20
00:02:56,382 --> 00:03:02,175
we can say also other things, like drug taking. But people do it.

21
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:05,217
Just they do it. Not that they don't know,

22
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:11,175
but they just do it because of the influence of the time.

23
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,298
And that is what is the Kali Yuga,

24
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:19,925
where we destroy ourselves and try to destroy others,

25
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:25,382
and have a kind of a funny temptation for this

26
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:29,298
not only that, also we enjoy all these.

27
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:35,466
All this cruelty, all this aggression we enjoy.

28
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,508
Now when do we say that the Kali Yuga is over, we should know

29
00:03:41,258 --> 00:03:43,841
something about Kali Yuga.

30
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:49,258
Kali was one of the deities,

31
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:54,382
who was supposed to bring in Kali Yuga,

32
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:57,091
and all the problems of Kali Yuga.

33
00:03:57,341 --> 00:04:01,298
Firstly it creates illusions, "bhranti".

34
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:06,008
It creates illusions. People will not understand

35
00:04:06,217 --> 00:04:09,298
who is a real person, who is an unreal person.

36
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:13,298
So we have many false gurus as you know.

37
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:16,716
We have many false propagandists.

38
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,508
We have many people who talk big

39
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:22,008
but there's nothing in them.

40
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:27,175
This is one type of a "bhranti" that Kali Yuga creates.

41
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:32,298
Once it so happened, that Nala and Damayanti too

42
00:04:33,258 --> 00:04:36,424
were in love with each other. They were husband and wife.

43
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:40,674
And Damayanti was separated from Nala,

44
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:46,091
by this horrible thing called Kali.

45
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:52,299
This Kali fellow has being doing this kind of work,

46
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:55,466
used to create problems in the minds of people,

47
00:04:55,925 --> 00:04:59,758
disturbing families, disturbing nations, disturbing

48
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:04,591
all the good wishes and the good feelings among human beings.

49
00:05:05,508 --> 00:05:11,508
So once this gentleman, one we call Kali was caught up,

50
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:16,758
by Nala, Nala, the one who hated him.

51
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:21,758
And Nala said that, "Why don't you allow me to kill you?

52
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:25,883
You should be killed because you are such a horrible person,

53
00:05:26,091 --> 00:05:30,549
you create such bhranti, you create such problems for people.

54
00:05:31,175 --> 00:05:35,175
He said, "If you want to kill me, you can kill me

55
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:38,883
but first listen to my importance, to my mahatmya.

56
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:42,217
"What is your mahatmaya? What is your importance?"

57
00:05:42,549 --> 00:05:46,424
He said, "My importance is, that when I'll come on this earth,

58
00:05:47,008 --> 00:05:50,549
when I'll rule on this earth, I know there will be bhranti,

59
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:53,758
there will be chaos, there will be problems,

60
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:57,591
but people will be so much fed up with that,

61
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:00,716
that they will seek the truth.

62
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:05,382
And those people today who are going to the hills and dales

63
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:09,050
to find out the truth, will be there

64
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:14,091
as ordinary human beings, as householders.

65
00:06:14,298 --> 00:06:17,298
And they will find the truth,

66
00:06:18,424 --> 00:06:20,341
definitely they'll find the truth.

67
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:24,175
It has been already predicted by Kali himself.

68
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,674
So as you see lots of chaos is there, lots of problems are there,

69
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:32,883
and when you see people you can't understand,

70
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:37,217
how such people who are educated, intelligent,

71
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:39,883
supposed to be at the helm of affairs,

72
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:43,549
can go about with wrong ideas, with wrong things.

73
00:06:44,298 --> 00:06:46,800
The problem is this Kali Yuga.

74
00:06:47,008 --> 00:06:52,341
This creates this funny situation, in our lives.

75
00:06:53,298 --> 00:06:58,050
Firstly it creates a situation where a person starts thinking,

76
00:06:58,298 --> 00:07:02,175
he's very insecure and he must take to some way,

77
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:04,925
of protecting himself.

78
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,508
And then where he goes to, is the place where he will be destroyed,

79
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:15,008
before he knows even that he'll be destroyed.

80
00:07:16,091 --> 00:07:19,217
The second point is that we have

81
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:23,466
a great sense of jealousy.

82
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:30,298
That sense of jealousy is even more heighten by this Kali Yuga.

83
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:34,091
We feel jealous for everything,

84
00:07:34,424 --> 00:07:38,508
which it shows our inferiority complex, or I don't know what it is?

85
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,674
But we start feeling jealous and out of jealousy we start

86
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:45,466
hating people without any rhyme and reason.

87
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,091
So many countries have this problem.

88
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:53,299
It's at the top, politicians,

89
00:07:53,591 --> 00:07:57,508
they indulge into this kind of a hatred for other people,

90
00:07:57,883 --> 00:08:01,883
without understanding what is the

91
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:05,925
achievement of the other person is, how he has achieved,

92
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:08,758
and "Why should I be jealous?"

93
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:14,841
Then we have, another thing is apart from that is,

94
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,008
which is the worst thing as Krishna has said, is the temper.

95
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:24,508
Hot tempered people, you see, cannot see the truth,

96
00:08:25,258 --> 00:08:28,716
because at the slightest provocation

97
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:33,091
they become hot-tempered and start hitting others

98
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:36,633
and beating others or saying horrible things

99
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:41,258
which should not be said. Now, this is another

100
00:08:41,674 --> 00:08:46,008
criteria for every Sahaja Yogi to know,

101
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:53,716
how far he is out of this sense of "krodha", is the anger.

102
00:08:56,217 --> 00:09:00,050
To be angry it shows that you have

103
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:06,466
no peace within and that you get angry for

104
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:11,091
just to attack another person, which is not necessary.

105
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:16,382
Even keeping quiet you can be very much effective.

106
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:21,341
There's a story about Chinese people that

107
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,050
in China there was a fight going on between

108
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:31,382
some people, and they said, "Let's have the cocks fight for us".

109
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,133
So they had a cock fight.

110
00:09:34,298 --> 00:09:39,008
So one fellow took a cock to a Zen fellow and he said that

111
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:43,258
"What, what should I do, if this cock has to fight?"

112
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,008
And he said that, "Very simple,

113
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:51,008
you teach the cock to be absolutely quiet."

114
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:54,133
He said, "I can't do that." He said, "All right, give me the cock."

115
00:09:54,298 --> 00:09:57,925
And he taught the cock how to be quiet,

116
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:01,217
whatever is happening, whosoever is attacking him.

117
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:06,633
When he went into the arena, many cocks started attacking him,

118
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,258
and he was just standing quietly, watching at everyone.

119
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:14,841
This settled the thing because everybody ran away and they thought

120
00:10:15,008 --> 00:10:17,591
he is such a powerful thing, he's not saying anything. So not

121
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:25,382
attacking not reacting that we achieve anything.

122
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:30,424
Actually reaction is a very great enemy of human beings,

123
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:32,758
that we react to everything.

124
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,466
We should not react, we should just become silent.

125
00:10:36,758 --> 00:10:40,091
And then this power, which I tell you about,

126
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:44,341
is the power of Paramchaitanya, acts.

127
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:47,841
If you want to react, all right. It says, "Go ahead".

128
00:10:48,175 --> 00:10:52,841
But if you leave it and you just become quiet,

129
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:57,674
silent, it acts. It acts so well.

130
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,591
It can act sitting down here, it can act somewhere else.

131
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:08,091
It is such a tremendous power. It is such an effective power.

132
00:11:08,298 --> 00:11:12,008
It is such an understanding, knowledgeable power,

133
00:11:12,217 --> 00:11:16,091
and above all it loves, it loves you.

134
00:11:16,674 --> 00:11:21,091
So when this power comes into existence in a way,

135
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:23,549
I would say it has been always existing,

136
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:27,633
but when effective, in the Krita Yuga it is effective,

137
00:11:28,424 --> 00:11:32,466
by that you'll be amazed how things happen.

138
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:35,800
Everybody tells Me, "Mother this miracle has taken place,

139
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:38,133
that miracle has taken place. "

140
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:41,341
So, I know it's not miracle. It is Paramchaitanya,

141
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:44,925
which is doing all the work, all the beautiful things,

142
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:49,091
which is trying to help you and trying to suggest its love.

143
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:54,091
You see, it is something we can't see

144
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,966
something we cannot conceive with this mind.

145
00:11:58,382 --> 00:12:02,050
But it is beyond the mind that it works.

146
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:06,633
I was surprised in Russia specially, I had to face the scientists.

147
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:12,217
Then the scientists were so, so much equipped, so much deep and

148
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:16,298
they understood so well, even in a place,

149
00:12:20,716 --> 00:12:24,133
you can call it a place of great learning,

150
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:28,091
one of the oldest universities, St. Petersburg University.

151
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:32,883
There also I don't know, what made they gave Me

152
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:38,008
the highest reward. For what? I didn't know.

153
00:12:38,298 --> 00:12:41,549
But they said, "You are even higher than science."

154
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:44,508
So this they called as cognitive science.

155
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:47,050
They gave a name as cognitive science.

156
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:50,591
"So Mother Your whole knowledge is of cognitive science."

157
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:55,674
Only thing is, if I tell you something then you can verify it.

158
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:58,716
The scientists can verify it.

159
00:12:58,883 --> 00:13:02,674
Everybody can find it out if it so or not.

160
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:06,883
But if you put this test to all these false gurus,

161
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:11,175
you will see that they, they don't have any scientific basis.

162
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:16,424
They have no way of giving you any explanation,

163
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:20,091
as to why this is happening and what is happening?

164
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,091
I had to face all of them all over the world.

165
00:13:24,298 --> 00:13:26,966
And I was surprised they recognized Me.

166
00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:31,633
And they said, "Mother this is cognitive science" and like that,

167
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:35,341
they gave Me, everywhere they gave Me awards and things like that.

168
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:38,633
I never knew what is cognitive science is.

169
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,716
But this is the knowledge that you get beyond your mind.

170
00:13:43,298 --> 00:13:45,633
With your mind you get is your

171
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:50,508
biased, maybe full of jealousy, maybe full of anger.

172
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,298
But beyond the mind even you get this knowledge that is absolute.

173
00:13:56,175 --> 00:13:59,091
Nobody can challenge it, absolute knowledge.

174
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:04,424
For example, I'll tell you one thing and if you see this model

175
00:14:05,382 --> 00:14:07,591
from the right side to the left side,

176
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:10,008
there it will look like a swastika.

177
00:14:10,424 --> 00:14:13,050
I made a model for them, to show them.

178
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:16,633
And if you see it from the left side on the right side

179
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:19,008
it will be "aum" written down.

180
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:21,883
And if you see from down upward,

181
00:14:22,298 --> 00:14:26,591
it is a cross, that means,

182
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:32,800
Shri Ganesha, who is on Mooladhara, incarnates as Christ.

183
00:14:34,175 --> 00:14:36,591
So they made a picture, they made a model,

184
00:14:37,298 --> 00:14:39,758
the scientists, and they found out

185
00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:43,716
that what I said is true and this model

186
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:47,925
really can be shown. I mean one of them is like this,

187
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:51,633
that whatever you know, whatever you say,

188
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:55,758
should be verified by even scientists.

189
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:58,716
I do not discard science.

190
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:01,966
Science is amoral, whatever you may say.

191
00:15:02,258 --> 00:15:05,549
But once they come to Sahaja Yoga, these scientists,

192
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:07,841
they just get transformed.

193
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:11,758
But scientists, in other countries, I don't know about our country,

194
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,549
in other countries have reached such a state, such a state,

195
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:20,716
that they want to know what is beyond.

196
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:24,298
All of them come to India, why? Why don't they go to Japan?

197
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:28,758
Why don't they go to China, why don't they go to America?

198
00:15:28,925 --> 00:15:31,716
To find the truth they come to India.

199
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,549
So in India this cognitive science existed long time back,

200
00:15:36,758 --> 00:15:39,633
of which we are not aware.

201
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:44,298
Like I must say, Indians suddenly became very westernized,

202
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:48,674
after independence somehow, all Gandhiji's ideas,

203
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:51,674
and everything was put on the shelves.

204
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:55,424
So, we, we didn't know what was so great in our country.

205
00:15:55,758 --> 00:16:00,800
Such a great "sampada", such a great power

206
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:05,800
existed in this country and they knew so many things,

207
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:11,674
so many things about, some things that science do not know.

208
00:16:12,382 --> 00:16:15,258
Now it is for science to find out,

209
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:17,925
whatever they have said it's true or not.

210
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,633
I have seen this, it's very simple,

211
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,674
if you really know the truth and you tell a scientist

212
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,175
he'll get after it and he'll work it out.

213
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:31,341
It's not one example, there can be hundreds I can give you,

214
00:16:31,508 --> 00:16:33,800
where I've told them something. They said, " All right."

215
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:37,298
"You verify, you find out, by your scientific methods."

216
00:16:38,382 --> 00:16:42,758
And they found it, they found it. There's so many ways

217
00:16:43,091 --> 00:16:46,508
of finding it out, you have in science.

218
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,133
But they don't know what to find.

219
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:52,050
They are just going on in this one, that one.

220
00:16:52,217 --> 00:16:54,716
They are going to the moon, they are going to this thing.

221
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:58,800
That's not the way. First you find out what you have to find

222
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:02,091
and then see if it is there or not.

223
00:17:02,591 --> 00:17:05,591
I was surprised in the West, though we call them

224
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:09,091
very much sort of advanced and all these things,

225
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:12,966
but as far as spirituality is concerned they are nowhere.

226
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:18,341
Their cognitive science faculty is very poor compared to us.

227
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:23,966
But our also is zero because we have all become westernised now.

228
00:17:24,508 --> 00:17:26,966
All our ideas are westernised

229
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:29,549
and we take all the knowledge from outside.

230
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,674
And even those who want to do something

231
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:37,966
about Indian culture and all that, they are so small,

232
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:42,633
they are so incapable of

233
00:17:43,298 --> 00:17:46,716
telling them what it is. It has nothing to do

234
00:17:46,883 --> 00:17:50,382
with a fundamentalist idea, nothing of the kind.

235
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:54,758
But it is a fact, it's the truth. it's the reality,

236
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,217
which they don't know themselves. They just want to proclaim,

237
00:17:58,424 --> 00:18:02,591
the Bhartiya Sanskriti, Indian culture,

238
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:04,633
but there is nothing like that.

239
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:08,133
Because unless and until you are a realized soul

240
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,508
and you have reached that state,

241
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,298
till then you do not know anything

242
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:18,091
about the mysteries of Paramchaitanya.

243
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:23,382
So for every Indian it is very important to take to Sahaja Yoga.

244
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:27,758
Also for all the people all over the world.

245
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:31,299
Everywhere as she told you about Russia, the condition is very bad,

246
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:37,091
but still I must say the Sahaja Yogis are very much happy there.

247
00:18:37,841 --> 00:18:41,674
The way, when I was there once there was this coup was on,

248
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:44,466
and everybody was worried and we saw lots of

249
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:46,466
tankers passing, this thing and all.

250
00:18:46,883 --> 00:18:50,091
So I asked these Russian Sahaja Yogis,

251
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:54,382
they are more than I think one lakh,

252
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:57,050
much more than one lakh, I don't know how many they are.

253
00:18:57,217 --> 00:18:59,591
So I asked them, "Aren't you worried,

254
00:18:59,883 --> 00:19:01,758
what is happening in your country?"

255
00:19:01,883 --> 00:19:04,091
He said, "Mother we are not". I said, "Why?"

256
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:06,549
"Because we are in the kingdom of God,

257
00:19:06,716 --> 00:19:09,050
why should we worry about Russia?"

258
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:13,716
You see, this also is a temperament that changes.

259
00:19:13,883 --> 00:19:15,883
and a person doesn't tell lies,

260
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,966
but he really feels that way and that's how

261
00:19:19,175 --> 00:19:22,800
he gets rid of all these nonsensical ideas

262
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:27,716
of religion, cast, nation, this, that.

263
00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:31,633
It separates human beings from human beings.

264
00:19:32,591 --> 00:19:35,633
But artificially you cannot join them.

265
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,091
Many people start talking, "No, no, we should not have

266
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:42,091
all these different things, we should have one."

267
00:19:42,508 --> 00:19:44,508
You can't, you can't have.

268
00:19:45,758 --> 00:19:49,466
Because temperamentally human beings are not made like that,

269
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:54,591
You see, we had a little discussion there in Italy,

270
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,091
with other religious groups,

271
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:00,966
and they said, "We, we don't want one religion,

272
00:20:01,258 --> 00:20:03,298
one global religion, we don't want."

273
00:20:03,508 --> 00:20:06,549
I said, "Why? Because you want to fight, that's why?

274
00:20:06,758 --> 00:20:09,217
Why you don't want one religion?

275
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:12,341
One religion is that you are a human being,

276
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:15,466
and you are a wonderful human being,

277
00:20:15,758 --> 00:20:18,424
and that you can be one with the Divine.

278
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:24,133
This is your religion which is promised and has to work out.

279
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:28,091
And, but they wouldn't accept. But the people are changing.

280
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:31,966
They are transforming themselves so fast

281
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,549
that I am surprised in a country like Turkey,

282
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:37,217
we have two thousands Sahaja Yogis.

283
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:43,091
And they are converting so many. So all these funny ideas that,

284
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:46,424
all these priests, mulaahs and all those have created,

285
00:20:47,298 --> 00:20:52,050
are going down. And what is coming up?  Even we have lots of these

286
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:56,841
people in India, panditas, and shastras and this and that,

287
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,633
they don't know anything I would say, because unless and until

288
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:05,758
they feel the Paramchaitanya, their all talking is baseless.

289
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:11,758
So all these problems which are created by fighting,

290
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:16,633
by aggressiveness, showing off or whatever you may call,

291
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,133
can be corrected with Sahaja Yoga

292
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:21,633
because your attention goes beyond the mind.

293
00:21:23,258 --> 00:21:25,133
You go beyond the mind.

294
00:21:25,298 --> 00:21:28,674
This Agnya chakra opens and you go beyond the mind

295
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:31,133
and then you are one with this divine power.

296
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:33,758
Once you are one with the divine power,

297
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:38,466
how it works for you in small, small ways.

298
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:40,466
I mean you all have experience,

299
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,716
you are all Sahaja Yogis so I need not tell you,

300
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:48,008
but everyone can tell so many examples, by which

301
00:21:48,466 --> 00:21:51,966
he knows that it's the Paramchaitanya which has worked it.

302
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:57,341
So first and foremost thing of every seeker of truth

303
00:21:57,591 --> 00:22:01,674
who is a real person, is to first get Self-Realization.

304
00:22:02,175 --> 00:22:05,925
That is the essence of spirituality, all over the world,

305
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:08,716
even if you read Bible, if you read Koran.

306
00:22:08,883 --> 00:22:12,008
Nobody has read them that's the best part of it.

307
00:22:12,217 --> 00:22:16,008
And they are trying to say things which are very shameful.

308
00:22:16,716 --> 00:22:19,966
which are not there and they are fighting for that.

309
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:24,091
With all these things they have helped us very much to show,

310
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:29,508
that the essence of all these religions is one and out of that will

311
00:22:30,258 --> 00:22:34,883
one day people will take to Self Realization.

312
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:40,424
Once they take to Self Realization, then they have to grow.

313
00:22:40,591 --> 00:22:43,341
Once they have grown into it, they can see.

314
00:22:43,508 --> 00:22:46,466
All of you know, you are all Sahaja Yogis sitting here,

315
00:22:46,674 --> 00:22:50,298
you know how much you have gained and how much you have achieved.

316
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:53,800
So to give Me the credit, I don't know,

317
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,758
it's not really true, because,

318
00:23:01,716 --> 00:23:04,091
we had great saints in some countries,

319
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,382
great saints in this country, in every country,

320
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:10,549
you know we had sufis in so many countries.

321
00:23:10,716 --> 00:23:15,091
They all have tried to say, that take your Self Realization.

322
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:17,633
"Know thy Self."

323
00:23:17,966 --> 00:23:21,050
They all have said the same thing, "Know thy Self".

324
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:24,298
But nobody is doing that, that's a different point.

325
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:28,466
But actually all those who were Realized souls, whether they were

326
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:32,591
from a Muslim religion or a Hindu religion or a Christian religion,

327
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:37,382
any religion in any country if they were Realized souls,

328
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,175
they said the same. Because truth is the same.

329
00:23:41,883 --> 00:23:45,633
They said the same thing, "First know thy Self"

330
00:23:46,298 --> 00:23:48,549
and then you will know the truth.

331
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:52,883
So this is the essence of our life

332
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:55,925
that we have to know ourselves.

333
00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:00,925
Once we know ourselves, you are beyond everything, because

334
00:24:01,175 --> 00:24:07,841
what happens that you become like an ocean becomes in this,

335
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:11,883
like a drop becomes in the ocean.

336
00:24:12,091 --> 00:24:16,008
How it disappears... In the same thing it will happen.

337
00:24:16,341 --> 00:24:19,591
And once it happens, you'll be surprised,

338
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,716
that you are really one with everyone. Who is the other?

339
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:29,883
You are one with everyone, that's how we find in Sahaja Yoga.

340
00:24:30,091 --> 00:24:33,758
It's a, many people say, it's a big charisma

341
00:24:33,883 --> 00:24:36,424
it's big this thing. Nothing of the kind.

342
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:39,382
You have your own Kundalini,

343
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:43,758
you have own possibility, of becoming Self Realizing.

344
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:47,716
Now, that is the blessing of Kali Yuga.

345
00:24:48,175 --> 00:24:50,298
In the Kali Yuga, this was going to happen

346
00:24:50,341 --> 00:24:52,008
and that's what it is happening.

347
00:24:52,175 --> 00:24:54,883
That's why thousands of you are getting Realization.

348
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:57,591
Before, only one would get from one person,

349
00:24:57,758 --> 00:25:00,424
and those gurus were also very strict, you know, they

350
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:03,298
would not give it to some ordinary person.

351
00:25:03,424 --> 00:25:08,258
They used to take them to task and judge them first.

352
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,008
And then they would give Realization.

353
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,758
But in Sahaja Yoga we don't do anything.

354
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:16,133
You just have to get into Sahaja Yoga, that's all.

355
00:25:16,508 --> 00:25:19,424
Now, as it is, I'm surprised that

356
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:23,549
how intellectuals and this and that try to find faults,

357
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,841
without knowing that they don't know anything.

358
00:25:27,758 --> 00:25:30,633
They have to become Self-Realized people.

359
00:25:31,008 --> 00:25:34,758
Then, whatever they will do, that will be,

360
00:25:34,925 --> 00:25:38,298
definitely very constructive, very helpful,

361
00:25:38,758 --> 00:25:41,716
and peace giving, and harmony giving to the whole society.

362
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:45,091
But first of all it has to be within you.

363
00:25:45,298 --> 00:25:48,298
If it is not within you, how can you give it to others.

364
00:25:48,925 --> 00:25:53,091
I've been watching how Sahaja Yoga has grown from one person

365
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:54,966
to all these, so many of them.

366
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:58,008
And we have so many others, in other countries also.

367
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:02,966
This all has shown that the time has come

368
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:05,549
for the whole world to change.

369
00:26:05,758 --> 00:26:10,758
And this transformation is the most important thing,

370
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:13,341
what we should aim at.

371
00:26:13,508 --> 00:26:16,424
Forget about everything. Forget about politics, economics,

372
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:20,008
this, that, but get transformation.

373
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:24,424
Once you are transformed, you know how to do the right thing,

374
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:28,298
how to do the things

375
00:26:28,424 --> 00:26:31,091
that will help you and the society.

376
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:34,925
All these you already have seen in your life,

377
00:26:35,298 --> 00:26:40,008
and whatever is happened, is none of My only effort

378
00:26:40,217 --> 00:26:43,091
but there have been so many who have been doing this.

379
00:26:43,298 --> 00:26:47,341
Only if you can say anything is Me, is that I found out

380
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:51,050
a way by which en masse Realization can be given.

381
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:54,633
Many people can get it. Because any discovery,

382
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,050
supposing there's electricity and if it cannot be used

383
00:26:58,298 --> 00:27:00,258
en masse, it is useless.

384
00:27:00,341 --> 00:27:04,591
So that's the only thing I've been able to achieve in My life,

385
00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:07,966
that en masse Realization can be given.

386
00:27:08,298 --> 00:27:12,341
And that has happen, as you know very well. It's very simple.

387
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:15,758
And once one person gets Realization,

388
00:27:15,883 --> 00:27:18,008
he can go and give Realization to others.

389
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:19,674
Now first, they were telling Me,

390
00:27:19,841 --> 00:27:22,633
"Mother, we are in seventy countries working".

391
00:27:22,883 --> 00:27:26,091
Now they are telling Me, "We are in eighty countries". How?

392
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:28,841
Somebody went there and he did in that country,

393
00:27:29,008 --> 00:27:31,175
he went there, he did in other country.

394
00:27:31,298 --> 00:27:34,883
So, just imagine how simple it has become.

395
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:38,758
How simple it is for Me. At this age I can't go

396
00:27:39,008 --> 00:27:41,091
to seventy, eighty countries,

397
00:27:41,298 --> 00:27:43,841
but it has passed there, it has gone there.

398
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:48,133
It has given the blessings of the Divine.

399
00:27:48,382 --> 00:27:50,674
So, while you are here,

400
00:27:50,883 --> 00:27:54,382
you should know here only we had Nizzamuddin Aulia.

401
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:58,091
Now Nizzamuddin was here and here we had Damdam Sahib.

402
00:27:58,298 --> 00:28:00,883
All these were great saints.

403
00:28:01,883 --> 00:28:05,091
And they talked of love, they talked of understanding,

404
00:28:05,298 --> 00:28:08,633
but talk becomes talk for them because the others who are listening,

405
00:28:09,008 --> 00:28:11,341
have no understanding about.

406
00:28:12,466 --> 00:28:17,466
So we are recipients of their blessings, their beauties

407
00:28:17,633 --> 00:28:22,050
and their greatness, is only when we are Sahaja Yogis,

408
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:24,758
or we are Realized souls.

409
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,299
So I bless you all with whole My heart and with whole My soul

410
00:28:28,883 --> 00:28:35,091
and I have been trying to work out in a way,

411
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:38,716
that I was surprised, in America, it is spreading so fast,

412
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,091
otherwise all the false gurus have been to America.

413
00:28:42,591 --> 00:28:47,050
But now it is something great that is happening, suddenly,

414
00:28:47,298 --> 00:28:50,091
so, I told them I'll come and stay in America,

415
00:28:50,298 --> 00:28:55,633
for about two two months at least, for their satisfaction.

416
00:28:55,966 --> 00:28:58,674
Now, staying anywhere is not so important.

417
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:04,716
What is important is that people should understand,

418
00:29:06,258 --> 00:29:08,466
they should humble down

419
00:29:08,674 --> 00:29:11,508
and they should know, "No, we still we have to know the truth".

420
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:15,674
If once this humility comes in, it will work out.

421
00:29:16,175 --> 00:29:18,758
It will work out in any person,

422
00:29:19,298 --> 00:29:23,091
anyone, whatever may be the cast, religion,

423
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:25,674
race, makes no difference.

424
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,133
So may God bless you again and again, and I bless you from My heart.

425
00:29:31,298 --> 00:29:34,716
Thank you very much for this felicitation. Thank you.
