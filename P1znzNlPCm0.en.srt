1
00:00:03,394 --> 00:00:08,102
Today is a great day for all of us

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,310
that we are celebrating Navaratri today

3
00:00:23,643 --> 00:00:30,643
and all of us are meeting after such a long time of My tour.

4
00:00:36,143 --> 00:00:39,477
When in Italy I said that

5
00:00:39,768 --> 00:00:48,601
England is the heart of the universe,

6
00:00:48,851 --> 00:00:51,685
they would not accept it.

7
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:54,851
They were very shocked at this statement.

8
00:00:55,102 --> 00:01:01,726
They couldn't believe that England could be the heart of the universe.

9
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,726
One of the reasons was that they felt that

10
00:01:12,977 --> 00:01:19,977
that the English people were invaded once by Romans,

11
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:27,810
and Romans at that time also had felt

12
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,060
that English were very bumptious people.

13
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:34,851
They would not even accept the defeat

14
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,643
with the grace of a person who is lost.

15
00:01:38,893 --> 00:01:42,851
Even if they were lost, they used to be bumptious.

16
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,560
So they could not believe how could it be

17
00:01:45,768 --> 00:01:48,685
that the English is the heart of the universe.

18
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:53,685
If this is the heart, what's the situation of the universe?

19
00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:00,352
And then they described to Me at length the bumptiousness of the English,

20
00:02:00,935 --> 00:02:07,435
and then I felt I have known something like that Myself.

21
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:14,102
Now, when we are celebrating the greatest of greatest this Navaratri,

22
00:02:14,352 --> 00:02:17,643
there must be something special about it,

23
00:02:17,893 --> 00:02:23,435
that we have to cleanse this heart completely,

24
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:27,685
fully

25
00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:34,352
and make it so pure that it purifies all the blood

26
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,310
that passes through the whole of the body.

27
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:43,185
So the cells of this heart,

28
00:02:43,435 --> 00:02:47,185
which has made this great organ,

29
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:54,851
has to be the best, because the cells of the heart

30
00:02:55,768 --> 00:03:04,352
within a human body are the best cells,

31
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:09,060
the highest quality, the most sensitive.

32
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:18,601
And it's the heart that expresses the Anahata,

33
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:24,977
the sound that is without percussion.

34
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:31,519
While we find

35
00:03:31,726 --> 00:03:37,060
that there are some people of caliber, there are,

36
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:42,810
but others talk more, show off more,

37
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,810
and do not have the caliber.

38
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,851
Now to achieve that caliber should be possible

39
00:03:54,143 --> 00:03:59,560
because you are born on the special land of England.

40
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:04,851
That possibility must be built within you.

41
00:04:05,143 --> 00:04:08,977
But then what is lacking?

42
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:15,060
Why is it, that with all the possibility,

43
00:04:15,352 --> 00:04:18,643
with all the great background,

44
00:04:18,893 --> 00:04:24,810
with all the merits to be here,

45
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:27,185
why is it we find

46
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:34,435
that Sahaja yogis for years together do not come up to many others.

47
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:37,893
What is the reason?

48
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,018
Heart, if you see, has a pulse rate

49
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:47,685
and it moves with a certain sound,

50
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:51,394
and you can even get it on to a graph

51
00:04:51,643 --> 00:04:53,893
and it is so systematic,

52
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:57,851
it is so regularized, it is so disciplined,

53
00:04:58,143 --> 00:05:01,519
that even a slightest murmur,

54
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:06,394
or slightest change shows on the graph.

55
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:10,560
Is a very sensitive thing.

56
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:16,102
And that is what is lacking here, is that discipline of the heart.

57
00:05:16,352 --> 00:05:20,851
It's an erratic, funny heart

58
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,060
which swells up in ego.

59
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,102
And whatever one may talk,

60
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:30,477
this is another reading people have,

61
00:05:30,685 --> 00:05:34,435
that whatever you may tell them, that time seriously they listen to you

62
00:05:34,643 --> 00:05:38,810
and second moment it has no effect on them.

63
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:44,643
So this is another thing we should see that if it is within us,

64
00:05:44,893 --> 00:05:50,643
let us understand that what we lack is disciplining.

65
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:58,519
And that disciplining has to come, otherwise our caliber cannot improve.

66
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:08,102
But for all that, I think what we should have is innate intelligence.

67
00:06:08,394 --> 00:06:11,685
No education, innate intelligence.

68
00:06:11,977 --> 00:06:18,977
Innate intelligence to understand that our caliber has to improve.

69
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:27,810
Now here pulsates the Spirit,

70
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:34,726
the Spirit and not the Power.

71
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,601
The witness,

72
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:42,477
the one that watches,

73
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:45,643
that is the reflection of God,

74
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:53,018
who is the Spectator of the work of the Devi.

75
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:56,435
Actually what happens

76
00:06:56,643 --> 00:07:01,726
that without rising up to that status

77
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:03,102
if we also say,

78
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,726
"All right, we are also watching because we are the Spirit,"

79
00:07:09,726 --> 00:07:15,143
then we do not achieve that caliber.

80
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,977
And with all the blessings,

81
00:07:18,227 --> 00:07:25,227
like seven auras of the heart, we have got seven ashrams.

82
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:35,519
We do not understand that we all have to discipline ourselves.

83
00:07:36,394 --> 00:07:38,935
Only to take advantage

84
00:07:39,185 --> 00:07:43,352
or to be in the Sahaja Yoga

85
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:46,935
to claim that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

86
00:07:47,185 --> 00:07:55,185
is not a sign of being a cell of the heart.

87
00:07:59,143 --> 00:08:01,143
And warning has to be given now.

88
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:04,185
Very important is at this juncture

89
00:08:04,394 --> 00:08:08,185
when Sahaja Yoga is now taking off, remember this,

90
00:08:08,435 --> 00:08:11,810
the speed has been gained and it is taking off.

91
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:16,601
Those who will be left behind, will be left behind.

92
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:21,102
So don't get into bumptiousness.

93
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:24,060
First is your character, as everybody says,

94
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,519
"They are very bumptious."

95
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,143
Try to be humble

96
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:39,352
and then understand that you have to be in the plane

97
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,394
and not left behind on the grounds.

98
00:08:44,893 --> 00:08:48,559
It is moving fast.

99
00:08:50,102 --> 00:08:57,435
Now the most fortunate thing is

100
00:08:57,726 --> 00:09:00,352
that today is the Navaratri

101
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:03,643
and that I should be in London

102
00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:08,060
and this Navaratri Puja should be performed here.

103
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,810
No other country is that privileged,

104
00:09:11,102 --> 00:09:15,060
because this is the highest puja,

105
00:09:17,977 --> 00:09:22,977
the greatest ritual, which you can attend.

106
00:09:26,893 --> 00:09:31,018
So why do we do Navaratri?

107
00:09:33,643 --> 00:09:39,185
In the heart, to do Navaratri is to accept

108
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:45,269
the powers of the Shakti,

109
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:51,060
to realize the power

110
00:09:51,477 --> 00:09:56,102
that all these chakras have got in themselves,

111
00:09:57,185 --> 00:09:59,519
and that when they are enlightened

112
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:03,394
how you can express all these powers

113
00:10:03,643 --> 00:10:06,601
of these nine chakras within ourselves;

114
00:10:06,893 --> 00:10:11,143
the seven chakras plus the heart and the moon makes it nine.

115
00:10:11,352 --> 00:10:13,185
But I would say that

116
00:10:13,394 --> 00:10:18,519
seven of these and on top of that we should say two more centers,

117
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:24,435
which Blake has described surprisingly as nine centers, clearly.

118
00:10:24,685 --> 00:10:26,935
Just now I cannot talk of the higher two centers,

119
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:32,726
but let us at least talk of the seven centers.

120
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:36,352
The power of these centers,

121
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,559
have we been able to develop within ourselves?

122
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,893
How can you do it? You have no time.

123
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:48,810
You are all busy people and bumptious.

124
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:53,893
So now to develop these powers

125
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:58,685
we have to concentrate on these chakras.

126
00:10:59,018 --> 00:11:01,685
Everywhere I went, I was surprised,

127
00:11:01,935 --> 00:11:04,768
the questions they asked Me, the way they were.

128
00:11:05,018 --> 00:11:09,685
Nobody talked about their family,house, jobs or

129
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,726
any other nonsensical thing like

130
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:16,601
unemployment and all that.

131
00:11:16,851 --> 00:11:17,601
They just asked Me,

132
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:22,143
"Mother, how do we develop the power of this chakra,

133
00:11:22,352 --> 00:11:24,810
or that chakra or that chakra?"

134
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:29,352
And I asked them, "How is it you are asking about a particular chakra?"

135
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:33,394
They said, "Because we find this is missing in us,

136
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:40,018
specially in me this one is not all right."

137
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,601
This is another negativity to make My throat all right.

138
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,185
Now for a realized soul

139
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,685
there is no need for Me to discipline you or to tell you all these things,

140
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:34,185
because I hate to talk in this tone to you today.

141
00:12:34,435 --> 00:12:39,394
But I have discovered, that if I do not warn you now,

142
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:44,643
tomorrow you will blame Me that I did not warn you.

143
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:49,726
Take it as a serious warning.

144
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:55,643
Now after Realization

145
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:59,726
there is no need for Me to discipline you at all,

146
00:12:59,977 --> 00:13:02,643
because you have got the light,

147
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:08,435
you have known what is Realization,

148
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:14,018
you have known what it means to be realized,

149
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:18,102
and you have also known how much you have gained out of it,

150
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:22,768
how much your personality has improved.

151
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:30,977
But, there is something more that has to be done.

152
00:13:32,893 --> 00:13:35,143
Is to see for yourself,

153
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:39,935
if you have really disciplined yourself or not.

154
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:42,768
There is no need for any leader to tell you,

155
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:47,310
there is no need for any ashram fellow to tell you,

156
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:51,477
there is no need for anyone to tell you.

157
00:13:51,685 --> 00:13:55,560
It is you, who is a realized soul,

158
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:58,768
you are your own master,

159
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:04,685
you are your own guru. Imagine you are all gurus,

160
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:10,810
great gurus and satgurus, respected saints

161
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,185
where all the angels have to shower you with flowers.

162
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:18,394
Think of it.

163
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:24,601
And here you are bumptiously giving lectures, talking bumptiously.

164
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:29,060
Very embarrassing even for the deities.

165
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:34,726
They don't know what to do, whether to garland you or to shut your mouth.

166
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:41,726
Here you are who have been,

167
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:03,977
here you are in such a great position

168
00:15:04,227 --> 00:15:07,519
that you have got Realization.

169
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:12,519
That only thing you have to accept

170
00:15:12,768 --> 00:15:18,935
the beauty of this great yoga,

171
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:26,726
that you just enlighten your own powers,

172
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:29,768
which are on these seven chakras.

173
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:36,643
Now let us see the first chakra, belongs to the power of Gauri,

174
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:43,269
the power of the Mother of Shri Ganesh.

175
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,060
Gauri's power.

176
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:50,768
Tremendous they are, aren't they?

177
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,851
Because of Her power you have got your Realization.

178
00:15:55,143 --> 00:15:58,601
Now what have we done

179
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:04,559
to enshrine that power within ourselves?

180
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,435
Today, if it is the first day of Navaratri,

181
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:12,310
let us see what have we done?

182
00:16:15,394 --> 00:16:22,269
Have we been able to develop our innocence within ourselves?

183
00:16:25,893 --> 00:16:29,185
When people talk, they are so sharp.

184
00:16:29,477 --> 00:16:32,643
How can you be sharp, if you are innocent?

185
00:16:32,935 --> 00:16:35,851
They are so bumptious.

186
00:16:36,102 --> 00:16:38,977
How can you be that, if you are innocent?

187
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:40,810
People play games.

188
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,060
How can you do that, if you are innocent?

189
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:46,435
Harm each other.

190
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:50,435
How can it be, if you are innocent?

191
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,851
So first of all you have to see yourself,

192
00:16:54,102 --> 00:16:57,559
that the power of innocence, if it has to live,

193
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:01,893
all the rest of the nonsense has to go away.

194
00:17:04,601 --> 00:17:07,143
If you want to have the innocence,

195
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:12,560
all that is anti-innocence has to be dropped out.

196
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,394
I can understand about people, who are ignorant,

197
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:18,810
who have ignorance.

198
00:17:19,102 --> 00:17:23,060
Then in ignorance, of course how will they talk of innocence.

199
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,935
But you are not ignorant people. You are knowledgeable,

200
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:29,768
you've got your enlightenment.

201
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:33,102
And the power of innocence is so great.

202
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:37,810
It makes you absolutely fearless, not bumptious, but fearless.

203
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:43,352
And the greatest thing of innocence is that you are respectful.

204
00:17:44,893 --> 00:17:48,269
The sense of respect,

205
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,310
if it is not developed within you,

206
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:56,977
if you cannot develop the sense of respect for other Sahaja Yogis,

207
00:17:57,227 --> 00:18:01,352
for other people, for the ashrams, for the discipline

208
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,227
and your own self-respect,

209
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:10,310
then it is of no use, even talking of Sahaja Yoga,

210
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:14,143
because that is the very beginning of it.

211
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:18,810
First you do not respect, all right, you are bumptious, all right,

212
00:18:19,102 --> 00:18:25,060
you are in a big fool's paradise, as they call it,

213
00:18:25,352 --> 00:18:27,768
riding a fast horse,

214
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:31,269
all that is there is all right, is forgiven.

215
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,977
But once you have seen the light,

216
00:18:34,227 --> 00:18:40,018
you must try to get rid of all the snakes

217
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,477
that you have been holding on to.

218
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,685
Is a simple thing.

219
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:53,601
In your childlike nature only,

220
00:18:54,227 --> 00:18:58,102
you can receive the blessings of Gauri, otherwise you cannot.

221
00:18:58,394 --> 00:19:01,060
You have to be really childlike,

222
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:07,060
otherwise it is absolutely useless, no use telling you anything,

223
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:09,435
because you think you're too clever.

224
00:19:09,643 --> 00:19:11,977
To such a person, who thinks he is too clever,

225
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,560
what's the use of talking to such a person,

226
00:19:13,768 --> 00:19:17,310
because he already knows everything.

227
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,227
So the first power when you develop,

228
00:19:20,477 --> 00:19:25,269
you must learn to sit on the Mother Earth, first of all.

229
00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:27,851
You must respect the Mother Earth,

230
00:19:28,102 --> 00:19:31,601
because the first chakra is made out of the Mother Earth.

231
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:37,726
Try to be more settled down with yourself on Mother Earth.

232
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,810
And the respect.

233
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:46,851
See the trees when they get their flowers,

234
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:49,018
they are not so respectful,

235
00:19:49,227 --> 00:19:52,310
but when they are laden by the fruits,

236
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,851
they bow down to Mother Earth.

237
00:19:58,102 --> 00:20:03,768
In the same way when you have got the fruits of Sahaja Yoga,

238
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:07,394
you all must bow down.

239
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:14,519
And innocence has a special capacity

240
00:20:14,726 --> 00:20:19,102
to make a person extremely peaceful,

241
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,143
extremely peaceful.

242
00:20:22,394 --> 00:20:27,977
All the anger, temper, violence -

243
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,685
if a person doesn't have innocence,

244
00:20:31,977 --> 00:20:36,851
it cannot come in you,

245
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:40,185
because a person who is not innocent

246
00:20:40,477 --> 00:20:45,893
is either sly or aggressive.

247
00:20:47,227 --> 00:20:49,810
He cannot have peace within his heart.

248
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,269
But a innocent person is not bothered, innocently he lives,

249
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:59,768
he enjoys everything in complete peace and harmony.

250
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:09,935
But this violence comes when a person becomes clever.

251
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,477
He thinks, "I am so clever, the another one is so stupid,

252
00:21:13,685 --> 00:21:17,394
I have a right to shout at that person."

253
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:23,685
And the one who is not innocent is never wise.

254
00:21:23,977 --> 00:21:27,310
He may be to look at look sharp, but he is not wise.

255
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:31,685
Wisdom comes only with innocence.

256
00:21:31,977 --> 00:21:35,893
And how much wisdom have you gathered?

257
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:41,477
That is what one has to see.

258
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:45,810
When your power

259
00:21:46,143 --> 00:21:50,477
of innocence increases, wisdom is apparent.

260
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:54,435
People say, "That fellow is very wise."

261
00:21:54,685 --> 00:21:58,477
For example if somebody is crying about his wife,

262
00:21:58,726 --> 00:22:01,102
a wise person will say, "Oh, Baba,

263
00:22:01,352 --> 00:22:04,310
just look at this, still busy with his wife."

264
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,559
Another one is crying about his house or something.

265
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:11,601
He will say, "Oh, look at this one, still busy with the house."

266
00:22:12,685 --> 00:22:16,810
There is no end to it.

267
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:25,519
I've known people who get so swollen up

268
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,269
that they think they must give a big lecture for one hour,

269
00:22:31,477 --> 00:22:32,560
on Sahaja Yoga.

270
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:36,185
Unless and until they have given one hour lecture,

271
00:22:36,477 --> 00:22:41,601
they do not think their ego has manifested itself fully.

272
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,477
But a wise person,

273
00:22:44,768 --> 00:22:50,227
he doesn't have to talk or speak or do anything.

274
00:22:50,477 --> 00:22:53,559
He impresses his silence,

275
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:58,559
his wisdom on others much more easily.

276
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,060
That is what we have to see,

277
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:04,685
have we been able to discipline ourselves?

278
00:23:04,935 --> 00:23:09,310
Because our growth is very much in the beginning of it.

279
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:13,185
We have to grow quite a lot

280
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,352
And people don't understand this point

281
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,394
in an atmosphere of egoistical temperament

282
00:23:21,643 --> 00:23:26,435
that you have to grow, you have not yet grown.

283
00:23:26,643 --> 00:23:30,310
You have to grow a lot.

284
00:23:30,935 --> 00:23:32,643
And when you grow

285
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:39,352
you find this wisdom really fragrant with compassion.

286
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:44,060
Your wisdom is fragrant with compassion.

287
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:49,185
Such beautiful compassion

288
00:23:49,477 --> 00:23:53,310
can emit through your being,

289
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:56,726
that anybody who comes in contact with you,

290
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:00,810
will feel your auspiciousness.

291
00:24:01,768 --> 00:24:08,726
But, again, you must give due respect

292
00:24:08,977 --> 00:24:12,269
to your Self Realization and to your Self.

293
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,477
That is the first thing you have to do, is to meditate.

294
00:24:16,726 --> 00:24:20,685
Somebody sent Me a letter and I saw the vibrations were horrid.

295
00:24:20,977 --> 00:24:23,352
I said, "What's the matter with this gentleman?

296
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:27,559
His vibrations are so horrid, what is he doing?"

297
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:31,394
Then I found out that he says he doesn't need any meditation.

298
00:24:31,643 --> 00:24:36,143
He has already reached the fourteenth heaven,

299
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:40,310
so he doesn't need any meditation, doesn't have to do any meditation.

300
00:24:41,768 --> 00:24:46,519
Is easy to explain, but whom are you explaining?

301
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:50,394
You have to explain to yourself,

302
00:24:50,643 --> 00:24:54,935
only yourself, nobody else wants your explanation.

303
00:24:55,435 --> 00:24:57,269
It's like missing the plane.

304
00:24:57,477 --> 00:24:58,810
When you miss the plane

305
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:03,810
whom are you going to explain, the plane has left.

306
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,768
So then you have to explain yourself only.

307
00:25:08,018 --> 00:25:13,560
You will tell the air, or to the gangway,

308
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,559
or anything that, "Oh baba, it happened like that,

309
00:25:16,726 --> 00:25:20,269
there was this thing, I had no time, there was a jam, this, that."

310
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,893
But the plane is gone.

311
00:25:24,477 --> 00:25:28,143
Whom are you explaining?

312
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:38,018
So everyone should meditate every day.

313
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,810
That is a very important thing,

314
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:47,768
which people are doing in all the countries where I am not.

315
00:25:48,102 --> 00:25:52,269
Because I am in England, people take Me for granted.

316
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,559
"Mother is doing everything."

317
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:59,559
So I get up at 4 o'clock, take My bath, meditate for you all.

318
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:02,102
I better start doing that again.

319
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,018
Otherwise you have no time to meditate.

320
00:26:04,227 --> 00:26:07,560
So at least let Me meditate for your sake.

321
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:10,352
So everyone must today promise to Me

322
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,643
that they will meditate every day.

323
00:26:14,935 --> 00:26:17,893
Get up in the morning!

324
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:20,643
"We can't get up in the morning."

325
00:26:20,851 --> 00:26:24,559
The whole world can get up, why not the English?

326
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,601
But when it was the war of Waterloo,

327
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:30,477
they were the first to arrive there.

328
00:26:30,726 --> 00:26:34,726
They won the war because they were so punctual.

329
00:26:34,977 --> 00:26:38,851
What has happened to their punctuality today?

330
00:26:46,185 --> 00:26:50,519
We are not drinking, we do not have hangovers,

331
00:26:50,726 --> 00:26:54,143
we don't sleep late,

332
00:26:54,435 --> 00:26:56,768
so why shouldn't we decide today

333
00:26:57,018 --> 00:27:01,810
that, "Every morning I'll get up and do my meditation.

334
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:07,810
And while meditating I must concentrate on myself and not on others.

335
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,726
And see for myself what is catching,

336
00:27:10,935 --> 00:27:12,935
where am I catching, which chakra I am catching,

337
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:15,394
what have I to do?"

338
00:27:15,643 --> 00:27:18,060
So on this day of Navaratri,

339
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:21,227
today as the first day,

340
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:28,102
the Gauri's power must be enlightened within us, and they must express.

341
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:33,851
And they are tremendous. I cannot describe them in one lecture.

342
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,310
Think of the Primordial Kundalini.

343
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,018
She acts in the Mother Earth,

344
00:27:40,227 --> 00:27:42,559
She acts in the universe,

345
00:27:42,851 --> 00:27:45,352
She acts in the animals,

346
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:48,685
She acts in the matter,

347
00:27:48,893 --> 00:27:51,352
She acts in the human beings,

348
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,477
and now She acts in you.

349
00:27:58,352 --> 00:28:01,601
She is the One who decides

350
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:05,310
the face and the figure that you are going to have.

351
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:09,269
She is the One who decides what child you should have.

352
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:10,477
She is the One

353
00:28:10,643 --> 00:28:15,560
who gives you the particular type of a child that you need.

354
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:20,477
She is the One who has got you all these beautiful children.

355
00:28:20,726 --> 00:28:21,559
She is the One

356
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:26,102
who has given you these sparkling faces and sparkling eyes.

357
00:28:26,394 --> 00:28:29,185
All this She has done for you,

358
00:28:29,477 --> 00:28:34,185
but what about the Power that you have within yourself.

359
00:28:34,477 --> 00:28:37,143
How much have you manifested that?

360
00:28:37,435 --> 00:28:40,185
The Primordial is working very hard, no doubt.

361
00:28:40,477 --> 00:28:42,685
But what about you, the individuals,

362
00:28:42,977 --> 00:28:45,643
who have got their own Kundalini awakened?

363
00:28:45,935 --> 00:28:49,560
How far you have opened Her out.

364
00:28:49,935 --> 00:28:53,060
And what is Kundalini, is a simple thing as you know.

365
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:56,060
Is the true desire.

366
00:28:56,269 --> 00:28:59,227
So true desire to perfect yourself, to grow yourself.

367
00:28:59,435 --> 00:29:04,435
If it is really true desire, nothing else is important.

368
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,435
All other desires are secondary and tertiary.

369
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:16,935
The most important desire is to grow.

370
00:29:17,227 --> 00:29:20,935
And for whose advantage ? Is the advantage of yours

371
00:29:21,185 --> 00:29:25,601
and in your advantage only, the advantage of the whole world rests.

372
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:31,310
Sahaja Yogis today represent the growth of this universe,

373
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:35,310
the growth of the human race.

374
00:29:35,601 --> 00:29:37,352
Do you follow this point

375
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:41,559
that you are playing such an important role,

376
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:45,726
role at such a crucial time

377
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:50,310
when the world is about to collapse?

378
00:29:54,102 --> 00:29:58,477
And you have great seers like William Blake,

379
00:29:58,726 --> 00:30:03,559
you had such great people who have talked about this time.

380
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:07,810
They have built it up, traditionally we have built up all this -

381
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,685
now, in England.

382
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:20,060
The work of ages that has brought this England to gestate...

383
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:25,643
Now, do you realize

384
00:30:25,935 --> 00:30:32,227
that the position of English Sahaja Yogis is very important.

385
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:43,143
But lack of wisdom and bumptiousness

386
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:49,227
without understanding your Self,

387
00:30:49,477 --> 00:30:54,519
how can you talk so loud?

388
00:30:54,726 --> 00:30:59,935
How can you think of organizing everything

389
00:31:00,227 --> 00:31:05,977
when you yourself are so weak, so bumptious?

390
00:31:08,143 --> 00:31:12,768
So today I am not going to take the count of the people,

391
00:31:13,018 --> 00:31:16,477
who meditate every day or not.

392
00:31:16,726 --> 00:31:17,977
But I can tell you this much,

393
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:22,519
next year those who do not meditate everyday,

394
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:25,435
you will not be here anymore.

395
00:31:25,685 --> 00:31:28,726
Take it from Me.

396
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:32,643
Is a fact.

397
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:37,977
Every day you must meditate.

398
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,227
Discipline yourself.

399
00:31:40,435 --> 00:31:45,559
Now you have come to a new perspection, perspective.

400
00:31:45,768 --> 00:31:47,519
You have come to a new vision.

401
00:31:47,768 --> 00:31:52,768
Now when you see that vision, when you know the vision,

402
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,935
you cannot just stand there.

403
00:31:56,227 --> 00:31:59,269
Get into it!

404
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:13,143
Everyone says, Damle was saying too, everybody says

405
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:18,559
that, "Mother you have spent so much time for these English.

406
00:32:19,102 --> 00:32:22,143
Why so much time for them?"

407
00:32:29,935 --> 00:32:34,060
Maybe you might be thinking that because you are very great,

408
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:37,060
that's why I have to serve you people.

409
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:40,559
Think the way you like.

410
00:32:41,768 --> 00:32:46,935
But the most important thing is that you are on the land of Heart,

411
00:32:47,227 --> 00:32:52,018
and I have to cleanse you more, much more than others.

412
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:56,269
But it's just the other way round. Others are going so fast.

413
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,477
I am amazed, their vibrations, their sensitivity, their understanding.

414
00:33:01,643 --> 00:33:06,977
And they have just mastered it; every one of them.

415
00:33:08,643 --> 00:33:13,935
Here, it is becoming a very centralized stuff

416
00:33:14,143 --> 00:33:16,935
and everybody doesn't want to understand Sahaja Yoga,

417
00:33:17,185 --> 00:33:21,018
but everyone wants to give a lecture.

418
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,060
There is no respect for elders.

419
00:33:28,477 --> 00:33:32,685
No respect who is older who is younger,

420
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,559
and somebody who thinks that

421
00:33:34,768 --> 00:33:38,102
because they got Realization before others they are higher,

422
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:44,810
then remember one word of Christ, that, "First will be the last."

423
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:52,477
So try to understand that it is you who has to grow,

424
00:33:52,726 --> 00:33:56,935
it is you who has to manifest these powers.

425
00:33:57,143 --> 00:33:58,726
Manifestation of the power,

426
00:33:58,977 --> 00:34:02,810
I don't know how far you have understood.

427
00:34:03,477 --> 00:34:06,519
When a person who has Gauri's power,

428
00:34:06,768 --> 00:34:09,394
as soon as he enters a hall or any place,

429
00:34:09,601 --> 00:34:14,601
everybody's Kundalini rises, just to salute.

430
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,810
When you have Gauri's power

431
00:34:26,102 --> 00:34:31,519
then you stand out because you have that innocent,

432
00:34:31,726 --> 00:34:37,227
lustless, greedless, beautiful, sparkling eyes

433
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:39,060
and wherever you turn your eyes,

434
00:34:39,352 --> 00:34:45,102
even one glance would raise the Kundalini, immediately.

435
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,018
People who suffer from cancer, suffer from this disease, that disease,

436
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,185
all can be cured in no time

437
00:34:52,394 --> 00:34:57,185
if you have developed only one power of Gauri.

438
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:04,559
All your problems can be solved.

439
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,102
Negativity will go away

440
00:35:07,352 --> 00:35:12,185
and you will become like a lotus.

441
00:35:13,352 --> 00:35:17,643
Beautiful, fragrant,

442
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,477
overpowering all kinds of negativity.

443
00:35:22,643 --> 00:35:27,643
Here it is, "That fellow just touched me

444
00:35:27,935 --> 00:35:31,477
and now I have become egoistical."

445
00:35:32,102 --> 00:35:34,601
If there is one fellow who is egoistical,

446
00:35:34,893 --> 00:35:38,060
he just talks to another person, the person goes egoistical.

447
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,851
I mean this is not the way to be sensitive.

448
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:45,601
You have to be sensitive to God and not to bad things.

449
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:52,935
But we are more akin, more vulnerable to bad than to good.

450
00:35:55,310 --> 00:36:00,477
So the power, the power of assimilation of good,

451
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:05,477
the power of emission of good,

452
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:11,935
all these powers are just in your complete reach.

453
00:36:13,143 --> 00:36:18,269
But all this should not become a praise

454
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:21,143
but should become a kind of a challenge,

455
00:36:21,394 --> 00:36:26,643
a kind of a beautiful curiosity

456
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:30,352
and an advancement for you.

457
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:34,269
But we are going down, I must tell you,

458
00:36:34,477 --> 00:36:37,352
we are going down in England.

459
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:39,977
Because we have some funny tags,

460
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:44,352
funny people who are all the time with tags.

461
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:48,102
Such people will have to be warned,

462
00:36:48,394 --> 00:36:53,352
and later on may be declared, as these people have decided,

463
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:57,310
should be declared as blacklisted.

464
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,893
It's a very sad day today for Me

465
00:37:03,102 --> 00:37:05,102
and that is why the whole place is filled with -

466
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,477
I mean I had no mind to have the puja here,

467
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:08,935
because I am really very sad.

468
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:12,726
Because when I see the vibrations, when I see the way things are,

469
00:37:12,977 --> 00:37:15,768
people are just in a picnic way in England,

470
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,519
I feel so unhappy, you don't know.

471
00:37:23,143 --> 00:37:30,143
I have always been extremely enamored,

472
00:37:31,726 --> 00:37:36,559
and I have already put up a big show of appreciating your efforts.

473
00:37:36,851 --> 00:37:41,935
But if you see in the substance of it;

474
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:46,601
just see the substance, you watch within yourself.

475
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:51,643
Each individual should see the substance that is within us.

476
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:54,685
We are worried about a friend,

477
00:37:54,977 --> 00:38:00,559
a fiancèe or a wife or a husband or this and that.

478
00:38:00,851 --> 00:38:04,185
That's not the caliber.

479
00:38:09,185 --> 00:38:12,519
The caliber is very low and is going down lower.

480
00:38:12,726 --> 00:38:15,310
That's not a good thing, is not good.

481
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:20,227
If My love and compassion is spoiling you, I better pull you out of it.

482
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:23,477
Because you are capable

483
00:38:23,685 --> 00:38:26,227
of your merits to be born in this country.

484
00:38:26,435 --> 00:38:29,185
You are capable of very great heights.

485
00:38:29,435 --> 00:38:32,185
I know that.

486
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,643
Of very great heights, which you can achieve.

487
00:38:35,851 --> 00:38:39,394
But not by talking about it or thinking about it,

488
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:45,102
but by becoming that great power,

489
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:49,269
to become that power.

490
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:51,601
And see the collective blessings people have

491
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:55,227
and I was amazed when they told Me, they have got this blessing,

492
00:38:55,435 --> 00:38:56,810
they have got that blessing.

493
00:38:57,018 --> 00:39:01,643
I mean unlimited blessings they have got.

494
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:06,394
And why can't we have that here?

495
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:10,018
What's the problem with us?

496
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:15,060
If we are not collective, if there is a problem between ourselves,

497
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:18,685
that means there is some sort of an ego still in-between

498
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:22,143
that is keeping us out.

499
00:39:24,601 --> 00:39:30,102
So let us now, promise within our heart

500
00:39:30,394 --> 00:39:33,143
that this has to go into our heart,

501
00:39:33,435 --> 00:39:38,935
a very deep feeling for ourselves,

502
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:42,643
that by God's grace we are born at such a juncture

503
00:39:42,935 --> 00:39:45,768
when this thing has happened,

504
00:39:46,102 --> 00:39:49,394
that we are the people who are beneficiaries

505
00:39:49,643 --> 00:39:53,477
of the blessings of God that we have got our Realization,

506
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:56,726
that we have risen so high.

507
00:39:57,018 --> 00:40:02,352
But now let us spread our wings, but we are cutting them down.

508
00:40:02,685 --> 00:40:04,559
Don't become small-minded people,

509
00:40:04,726 --> 00:40:07,227
worried about small, small things here and there.

510
00:40:07,477 --> 00:40:10,477
Nothing is important.

511
00:40:10,893 --> 00:40:13,768
If you see in your previous lives, you have had all kinds of foods,

512
00:40:13,977 --> 00:40:15,559
you have had all kinds of trips,

513
00:40:15,726 --> 00:40:20,477
you have done every kind of marriages, you have done every kind of

514
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:24,601
other nonsensical thing that people waste time with.

515
00:40:24,893 --> 00:40:28,102
It's over now, finished. Now you do something new.

516
00:40:28,352 --> 00:40:31,893
How many people you have married in previous lives

517
00:40:32,143 --> 00:40:35,310
and how many houses you had in previous lives

518
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:38,935
and how many pleasures you have had,

519
00:40:39,227 --> 00:40:42,352
finished now - finish it.

520
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:50,477
This is a special time, the best time of Ritambhara

521
00:40:50,685 --> 00:40:54,810
where you have to grow. That's the point is, the season is that.

522
00:40:55,143 --> 00:40:58,768
In this season if you do not grow,

523
00:40:59,227 --> 00:41:01,977
you won't grow.

524
00:41:02,269 --> 00:41:06,018
You have to take full advantage.

525
00:41:06,435 --> 00:41:09,726
With full intensity

526
00:41:10,018 --> 00:41:12,559
you have to do Sahaja Yoga.

527
00:41:12,851 --> 00:41:14,935
That doesn't mean that you give up your jobs, or anything.

528
00:41:15,143 --> 00:41:18,559
If you are intense in Sahaja Yoga, you will be intense in everything.

529
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:21,435
But there is no intensity.

530
00:41:21,643 --> 00:41:23,227
Munich I decided just,

531
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:26,143
I don't know if Warren has told you - Munich

532
00:41:26,435 --> 00:41:27,935
"You didn't tell them about Munich?"

533
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:31,310
All right - Munich. I decided last minute,

534
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:32,601
because there was a horrid one

535
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:35,060
who had come from Munich and had told Me

536
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:39,435
that Munich's seekers will ask such questions.

537
00:41:39,726 --> 00:41:41,394
I didn't like them at all. She was very arrogant.

538
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:43,060
I said I am not going to Munich.

539
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:47,601
But in Vienna I just felt the vibrations of Munich.

540
00:41:47,893 --> 00:41:51,560
And I was amazed. I said, "All right, I am going to Munich."

541
00:41:51,851 --> 00:41:53,726
We had to run up and down to get My visa,

542
00:41:53,935 --> 00:41:57,977
this thing. Everything worked out, as usual.

543
00:41:58,352 --> 00:42:01,685
And in that short time, three days,

544
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:04,018
four hundred people were there.

545
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:09,810
And so intense, I tell you, so intense, even children, so intense,

546
00:42:10,102 --> 00:42:14,102
and they were listening to every word I was saying,

547
00:42:14,352 --> 00:42:17,227
and picking up as pearls,

548
00:42:17,477 --> 00:42:19,810
precious as diamonds,

549
00:42:20,018 --> 00:42:23,768
every word they were noting it down.

550
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:27,643
And when they had their Realization they were just stunned people.

551
00:42:27,935 --> 00:42:31,601
Imagine the Germans, coming over you people, English.

552
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:34,851
What will happen to you?

553
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,352
They are people of determination.

554
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,851
If they decide to do good, they'll do lot of good.

555
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,893
They are not like this.

556
00:42:46,185 --> 00:42:48,310
And then when I left them,

557
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:52,310
for one hour they were in the hall, just stunned,

558
00:42:52,601 --> 00:42:55,768
discussing about Sahaja Yoga.

559
00:43:00,227 --> 00:43:02,977
But here as soon as I go away,

560
00:43:03,185 --> 00:43:05,685
people start discussing something so nonsensical.

561
00:43:05,977 --> 00:43:09,477
I hear it. I know the vibrations and everything.

562
00:43:09,685 --> 00:43:13,977
We are not intense, we must increase our intensity.

563
00:43:14,227 --> 00:43:17,893
That is what is called as Shraddha.

564
00:43:19,685 --> 00:43:23,977
Is important, very important.

565
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:31,643
And I am sure this year you will make it a point

566
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:37,185
to do intense understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

567
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:41,601
That intensity is lacking.

568
00:43:42,018 --> 00:43:46,185
May be there is something gone wrong with you in the past

569
00:43:46,477 --> 00:43:50,018
and you are conditioned about it, or you think about it.

570
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:53,726
How can I do it, it is too much.

571
00:43:53,977 --> 00:43:58,977
You can do it, everything, you forget the past, forget the past.

572
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:03,726
Past has no meaning whatsoever in Sahaja Yoga.

573
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:09,310
You are being completely renovated

574
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,102
but just use your mechanism.

575
00:44:13,394 --> 00:44:14,935
I have worked so hard with you people

576
00:44:15,143 --> 00:44:17,435
that nothing wrong with your mechanism.

577
00:44:17,685 --> 00:44:21,559
Only thing you have no faith in yourself.

578
00:44:22,185 --> 00:44:23,851
And those who do not have faith in themselves

579
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,185
are always bumptious people.

580
00:44:27,893 --> 00:44:33,060
So first of all station yourself within your Spirit,

581
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:38,893
within your heart and try to develop your powers,

582
00:44:39,185 --> 00:44:42,102
inner powers, not of talking and showing off,

583
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:45,352
but inner powers.

584
00:44:50,394 --> 00:44:54,269
Still so many are possessed, you know that.

585
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:57,143
It's a shameful thing

586
00:44:57,352 --> 00:45:00,810
that even now in the temple of God there are people

587
00:45:01,102 --> 00:45:05,685
who are possessed by horrible evil things.

588
00:45:05,935 --> 00:45:08,685
How can it be?

589
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:14,768
You are the carrier of all these, even now, how can it be?

590
00:45:19,018 --> 00:45:22,269
So one has to be very intensely there,

591
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,935
and those today who are looking to be nothing,

592
00:45:25,143 --> 00:45:27,477
will grow into something so great,

593
00:45:27,643 --> 00:45:30,310
that you will be amazed at yourself.

594
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:34,185
"How is it I have become so great?"

595
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:39,269
But the first and foremost thing is disciplining.

596
00:45:40,893 --> 00:45:43,643
Discipline yourself.

597
00:45:43,893 --> 00:45:46,352
When it comes to eating, some people eat too much.

598
00:45:46,601 --> 00:45:49,477
When it comes to talking, some people talk too much.

599
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:53,310
Or they do not talk at all, or they eat not at all.

600
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:55,685
All this is indiscipline.

601
00:45:55,977 --> 00:45:59,102
But going higher to this spiritual life,

602
00:45:59,394 --> 00:46:02,102
best thing is to take the discipline from your Spirit

603
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:04,310
and you are disciplined automatically.

604
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,018
Let the Spirit rule you.

605
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,726
It's possible. It's possible,

606
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,227
because I have seen in such a short time

607
00:46:15,477 --> 00:46:19,768
and when I have been there for such a short time,

608
00:46:20,018 --> 00:46:22,185
I don't even know their names.

609
00:46:22,477 --> 00:46:24,559
Here practically I know all of you,

610
00:46:24,768 --> 00:46:28,851
by your names, and by your vibrations also.

611
00:46:29,185 --> 00:46:32,726
And they have gone up so much.

612
00:46:33,726 --> 00:46:36,060
So, today is a great day.

613
00:46:36,352 --> 00:46:38,685
Of course a great privilege.

614
00:46:38,977 --> 00:46:44,352
Always you are privileged people, like House of Lords.

615
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:46,601
Is true, but may be,

616
00:46:46,893 --> 00:46:51,810
one day may come when this House of Lords may be banished completely.

617
00:46:52,102 --> 00:46:55,477
You have to behave like lords.

618
00:46:58,143 --> 00:47:01,601
That is why My humble request is

619
00:47:01,851 --> 00:47:05,060
that you must learn

620
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:08,559
to worship discipline.

621
00:47:08,893 --> 00:47:10,893
I don't say, "Do this, do that."

622
00:47:11,185 --> 00:47:13,435
You know what is to be done.

623
00:47:13,601 --> 00:47:15,559
And then on top of that, you should not tell Me,

624
00:47:15,726 --> 00:47:18,726
"I know, I should have, I know."

625
00:47:18,977 --> 00:47:23,851
When you know, why don't you do it? You are empowered.

626
00:47:24,143 --> 00:47:28,601
Today let us, with full confidence in ourselves

627
00:47:28,893 --> 00:47:30,560
and in our ascent,

628
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:34,394
let us with full intensity attend this Puja

629
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,519
and in our hearts decide

630
00:47:36,768 --> 00:47:40,477
that, "I am going to discipline myself."

631
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:48,143
May God bless you.
