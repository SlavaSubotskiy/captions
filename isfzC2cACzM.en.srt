1
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:56,593
Today we have assembled here to celebrate the Sahasrara Day

2
00:03:56,858 --> 00:04:04,667
which was opened in 1970 on this date.

3
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:20,159
I find this beautiful canopy is like our Sahasrara,

4
00:04:22,299 --> 00:04:25,939
and so very apt

5
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:33,958
to have this beautiful arrangement for Sahasrara Day.

6
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:46,239
We have to understand what happens when the Sahasrara opens.

7
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:53,759
When the Kundalini passes through the five centers,

8
00:04:53,958 --> 00:05:00,879
it enters into the area which we call as limbic area.

9
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:08,798
This area is all surrounded by thousand nerves.

10
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,999
And when these nerves get enlightened,

11
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:20,419
they look like flames of vibgyor colors, seven colors,

12
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:33,929
and very mildly, beautifully shining, emitting peace.

13
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:44,059
But when the Kundalini starts emitting its vibration

14
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:49,368
on the sides,

15
00:05:59,743 --> 00:06:07,107
all these nerves get enlightened gradually

16
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:17,890
and start moving on all directions, opening the Sahasrara.

17
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:23,125
And then the Kundalini

18
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:42,273
emerges out through the fontanel bone area

19
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:46,747
which we call as Brahmarandhra.

20
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,859
Randhra means "the hole"

21
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:58,028
and the Brahma is the all-pervading Power of God's love.

22
00:06:58,188 --> 00:07:09,442
So it enters into the subtle energy which is all-pervading

23
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:13,002
which we do not feel normally.

24
00:07:13,503 --> 00:07:22,520
But then the Chaitanya, the vibrations

25
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:36,874
which are the part and parcel of this energy, all-pervading Power,

26
00:07:37,034 --> 00:07:41,728
the Paramachaitanya,

27
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:49,211
they start entering into our brain;

28
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:58,002
and showering their blessings, in the limbic area they assemble.

29
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:07,889
Now the limbic area is connected to all the area of the brain

30
00:08:08,049 --> 00:08:12,840
and also to the nerves.

31
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:20,442
So it starts flowing onto the nerves,

32
00:08:20,602 --> 00:08:26,451
giving you the new awareness of collective consciousness

33
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:29,562
called as samuhik chetana.

34
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:34,520
So you get a new chetana, a new awareness

35
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:45,601
which is showered upon your limbic area.

36
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:55,864
The working of these Chaitanya waves is very interesting.

37
00:08:56,024 --> 00:09:05,520
They are normally formed like small commas,

38
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,241
but then they go into different forms.

39
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:17,201
They make themselves into swastikas,

40
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:25,121
as the four-limbed symbol of innocence.

41
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:35,489
Or they become the Aumkara, as you know how Aum is written,

42
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:47,329
which is the symbol of our doing, our awareness.

43
00:09:47,961 --> 00:10:01,186
So when they form the swastika they try to nourish the left side,

44
00:10:01,346 --> 00:10:05,738
and when they form the Aumkara they nourish the right side.

45
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:11,499
Left and right sympathetic nervous system they nourish.

46
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:21,281
But Sahasrara is to be kept open

47
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:25,520
it's rather difficult for people

48
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,775
because it's a vicious circle.

49
00:10:28,935 --> 00:10:34,281
First these vibrations should enter into your brain

50
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:39,570
through the Brahmarandhra when it is opened out,

51
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,115
and they should nourish your nerves

52
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:50,225
by which your left and right side open out;

53
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:58,755
and so more Chaitanya can flow down all these centers.

54
00:10:58,915 --> 00:11:06,646
But if your Sahasrara is not properly opened,

55
00:11:06,806 --> 00:11:11,334
this process doesn't take place.

56
00:11:11,494 --> 00:11:17,787
As a result of that, the chakras don't open,

57
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:31,975
the Kundalini only as very few strands is kept in the spinal cord,

58
00:11:32,135 --> 00:11:43,478
and the new strands cannot rise because your chakras are not open.

59
00:11:43,638 --> 00:11:52,321
So in Sahaja Yoga it is very important to keep your Sahasrara open,

60
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:56,760
otherwise there's a vicious circle.

61
00:11:57,744 --> 00:12:02,355
To keep the Sahasrara open is in a way very easy,

62
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:05,811
as well as difficult.

63
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:09,238
As you have known in the Devi Mahatmyam

64
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:16,673
that at Sahasrara, Mahamaya comes.

65
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:22,057
She is a Mahamaya: not easy to recognize Her,

66
00:12:22,217 --> 00:12:24,895
not easy to know Her.

67
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:27,867
She lives just like you,

68
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:31,243
She moves just like you,

69
00:12:31,403 --> 00:12:38,521
and you can never make out Her real nature.

70
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:42,660
She is in the form of Mahamaya.

71
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:54,282
So at the Sahasrara, to recognize the Mahamaya is another vicious circle.

72
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:56,962
You may say that why should it be Mahamaya?

73
00:12:57,122 --> 00:13:02,570
should have been better as starkingly some other form.

74
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,377
But any other form could not have worked out Sahaja Yoga

75
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:10,531
in modern times;

76
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:16,808
because people would have been frightened and upset

77
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:20,247
and they would never have taken to Sahaja Yoga,

78
00:13:20,407 --> 00:13:22,839
because they had no discretion already

79
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:26,440
within them to know what is right, what is wrong.

80
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:33,148
That is why it had to be in the Mahamaya form.

81
00:13:33,308 --> 00:13:38,792
In the Mahamaya form you have to recognize.

82
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:43,576
This is another test because Mahamaya you cannot recognize,

83
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:47,270
while you have to recognize.

84
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:54,259
But in Sahaja Yoga you have seen so many photographs

85
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:58,852
which should convince you people mentally

86
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:02,943
about this Mahamaya swarupa.

87
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:08,925
You can see mentally, you can understand there's something very different.

88
00:14:09,085 --> 00:14:12,477
Even when I came to Napoli,

89
00:14:12,637 --> 00:14:16,673
the policeman and everybody was given a photograph

90
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,991
and they all recognized that there is something very different,

91
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:24,395
they all wanted to shake hands with Me.

92
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:27,383
This is one way.

93
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:32,356
Another way is that you start seeing the blessings,

94
00:14:32,516 --> 00:14:38,085
and you start seeing how you become so progressively

95
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:43,725
better materially, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

96
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:50,646
Still on a mental level most of the people recognize.

97
00:14:50,806 --> 00:15:01,765
But unless and until it is recognized in the heart,

98
00:15:02,878 --> 00:15:07,205
it's no recognition.

99
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:22,445
Already the heart is surrounded by seven auras of the seven chakras.

100
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:29,764
And the spirit, the Atma, resides in the heart.

101
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:36,125
As it is, on top of your head here

102
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:41,486
resides the God Almighty, Sadashiva.

103
00:15:41,646 --> 00:15:47,225
So when Kundalini touches that point

104
00:15:47,385 --> 00:15:50,303
your spirit gets awakened

105
00:15:50,463 --> 00:15:55,742
and the light of the spirit starts spreading,

106
00:15:57,743 --> 00:16:03,712
and it starts acting on your central nervous system;

107
00:16:03,872 --> 00:16:09,600
because automatically the vibrations,

108
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,479
the Chaitanya flow into your brain

109
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,254
who enlighten your nerves.

110
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:30,685
But still the recognition on the heart is not there.

111
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:36,287
Even without that you start feeling the cool breeze,

112
00:16:36,447 --> 00:16:39,425
you can raise the kundalini of others

113
00:16:39,585 --> 00:16:42,953
you can cure people,

114
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:46,148
you can do many things,

115
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:53,748
but still it is not yet felt in the heart so much.

116
00:16:56,309 --> 00:17:01,845
That's why we have music, art

117
00:17:02,005 --> 00:17:11,974
all these things start opening your heart.

118
00:17:12,134 --> 00:17:14,173
But still it is not recognition,

119
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:20,722
because recognition is a mental activity of the heart.

120
00:17:20,882 --> 00:17:25,300
How can heart have a mental activity?

121
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:31,728
This is another problem you all can face, and I know that

122
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:37,075
that recognition, if it is a mental activity of the heart,

123
00:17:37,235 --> 00:17:39,995
how do we do it?

124
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:46,528
Say, if you are a Christian born in a Christian family,

125
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:49,563
as soon as you see the photograph of Christ,

126
00:17:49,723 --> 00:17:54,218
immediately you feel it is Christ, you see - something here.

127
00:17:54,378 --> 00:17:58,207
Or if you are a Hindu, if you see the photograph of Shri Rama,

128
00:17:58,367 --> 00:18:01,808
immediately you know it's Shri Ram, you see - there's a kind of a thing,

129
00:18:01,968 --> 00:18:06,168
recognition in the heart.

130
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:13,082
But the recognition of somebody living with you

131
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:15,995
is very, very difficult,

132
00:18:16,155 --> 00:18:24,315
and you live on the cusp of your mental activities only.

133
00:18:24,475 --> 00:18:29,262
But to go deep down into your heart,

134
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:33,688
"What should we do?" people tell Me.

135
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:40,250
"Mother, how should we get into our heart?

136
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:48,171
How this mental activity can be performed through the heart?"

137
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:55,491
Now you must remember that heart is absolutely connected with brain,

138
00:18:57,209 --> 00:19:00,338
absolutely connected.

139
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:07,708
It's not disconnected thing if it was, it would not have worked out.

140
00:19:08,635 --> 00:19:16,105
When heart fails, after some time brain also fails;

141
00:19:16,265 --> 00:19:21,637
the whole body goes out of order.

142
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:15,105
So this mental activity of the heart is to be understood this way,

143
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:22,253
that as soon as you see the danger,

144
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,802
without even thinking, in a reflex way

145
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:33,524
your heart starts pumping more blood and you get palpitation.

146
00:20:37,065 --> 00:20:39,595
You don't have to think, there's no mental activity;

147
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:42,365
just you see supposing a tiger standing before you,

148
00:20:42,525 --> 00:20:46,185
immediately the heart will start pumping.

149
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:50,193
It's a reflex action.

150
00:20:51,904 --> 00:20:56,547
Now how this activity takes place, one may say,

151
00:20:56,707 --> 00:20:59,955
is that because it is built in within you

152
00:21:00,115 --> 00:21:03,483
that as soon as you see some emergency

153
00:21:03,643 --> 00:21:09,228
your sympathetic nervous system goes into activity,

154
00:21:09,722 --> 00:21:12,701
and you start feeling the fear,

155
00:21:12,861 --> 00:21:18,222
you start feeling that there should be some protection,

156
00:21:18,382 --> 00:21:21,222
that you should do something about it.

157
00:21:21,382 --> 00:21:24,951
But you do not think, you just run,

158
00:21:25,111 --> 00:21:27,622
you run as fast as possible.

159
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:29,184
You don't think about it

160
00:21:29,344 --> 00:21:31,428
"what I should do, where I should run?"

161
00:21:31,588 --> 00:21:38,180
just you go on running away from the danger.

162
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,707
And how do you do that?

163
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:46,826
Because it is built in within you, all this, in your brain

164
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:53,177
that as soon as the heart starts pumping too much blood,

165
00:21:53,337 --> 00:21:59,954
it should just make the legs work and the hands work and you should run.

166
00:22:00,114 --> 00:22:05,301
Or we can say it is in the central nervous system built in,

167
00:22:05,461 --> 00:22:07,781
the fear.

168
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:16,463
Any reaction, any response like that is built in within you.

169
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:25,382
But the response to the spirituality is not yet manifested.

170
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:34,986
It is manifested. It is all built, no doubt,

171
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:39,745
but it is not yet manifested.

172
00:22:40,618 --> 00:22:44,689
And how will it manifest?

173
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:50,360
That's what people ask Me, "Mother, how will it manifest?"

174
00:22:51,253 --> 00:22:57,528
Through your past

175
00:22:57,688 --> 00:23:00,328
you have learnt that you have to be afraid of this,

176
00:23:00,488 --> 00:23:02,528
you have to be afraid of that.

177
00:23:02,688 --> 00:23:05,787
Also in this lifetime you have learnt many things.

178
00:23:05,947 --> 00:23:09,627
For a child may put his hand to the candle, won't feel, be frightened;

179
00:23:09,787 --> 00:23:14,041
but a grown-up would, because of an experience.

180
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:18,328
With the experience gradually you built in

181
00:23:18,488 --> 00:23:26,127
that reaction of reflex within you, so that you'll try to save yourself.

182
00:23:27,344 --> 00:23:32,460
Now what experience you should have

183
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:38,133
to build that in your heart, is the point.

184
00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:47,696
And the experience is of your own divinity,

185
00:23:47,856 --> 00:23:54,841
of your own spirituality.

186
00:23:57,136 --> 00:24:04,859
Once you start developing that experience,

187
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:09,697
then you know that you are a divine person.

188
00:24:09,857 --> 00:24:18,132
Unless and until you are aware fully that you are a divine person,

189
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:25,092
howsoever faith you may have in Me, the recognition is not complete

190
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:29,299
because who is recognizing Me is a blind person.

191
00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:32,889
If a blind person is recognizing Me,

192
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:37,870
it won't have that response of the heart.

193
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:43,122
So first you have to recognize yourself to be a divine person,

194
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:46,841
to have faith in yourself.

195
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:52,101
We do not have faith in ourselves, though we are Sahaja Yogis

196
00:24:52,261 --> 00:24:57,020
If there’s any problem, they will write a letter to Me.

197
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:01,542
If they are sick they’ll write a letter to Me.

198
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:07,260
If there’s any family questioning they’ll write to Me

199
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:13,888
If there’s somebody bothering them with some questions they’ll ask Me.

200
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,598
But if you become introspective and meditative

201
00:25:21,758 --> 00:25:25,065
then you touch that divinity within you.

202
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:30,779
When you touch that divinity you know you are a divine person.

203
00:25:30,939 --> 00:25:33,319
So, in Sahastrara Puja, actually,

204
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:38,562
you have to recognise your own divinity, that you are divine,

205
00:25:38,722 --> 00:25:42,067
by experiencing your divinity.

206
00:25:42,227 --> 00:25:47,034
How do you experience your divinity?

207
00:25:48,177 --> 00:25:54,642
That you give realisation to others.

208
00:25:54,802 --> 00:26:00,055
It’s a great experience to give realisation to others.

209
00:26:00,215 --> 00:26:03,288
Not only that, you give realisation

210
00:26:03,448 --> 00:26:06,719
but you can tell about their chakras,

211
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:09,524
you know what’s wrong with them

212
00:26:09,684 --> 00:26:15,864
you are quite confident. And mentally you know

213
00:26:16,024 --> 00:26:20,229
that, “Yes, yes, it’s working” you’ll say,

214
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:23,613
without getting involved into it as “I do it!” You’ll say,

215
00:26:23,773 --> 00:26:29,338
“Mother, it’s working. It’s happening. It’s this thing, that thing.”

216
00:26:29,498 --> 00:26:37,945
But you never introspect, “How is it I am working?

217
00:26:39,175 --> 00:26:43,737
How I’m working it out?

218
00:26:43,897 --> 00:26:47,177
How I can feel it?

219
00:26:47,337 --> 00:26:51,680
What has happened to me?

220
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,057
What has improved in me?

221
00:26:55,217 --> 00:26:58,057
What has sharpened in me?

222
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:02,496
What is the development in me?

223
00:27:02,656 --> 00:27:07,229
What is the transformation?”

224
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:12,988
Once you start thinking about it

225
00:27:13,148 --> 00:27:22,828
the experience of your own being, then a kind of a feeling

226
00:27:22,988 --> 00:27:26,847
feeling – toward the Mahamaya, develops.

227
00:27:27,007 --> 00:27:29,818
Feeling. Again, I say ‘feeling’.

228
00:27:29,978 --> 00:27:36,133
Like feeling of fear, feeling of happiness, feeling of depression.

229
00:27:36,293 --> 00:27:42,876
Any feeling you develop. And this feeling,

230
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:49,566
you could call a feeling of gratitude, feeling of love,

231
00:27:49,726 --> 00:27:55,966
feeling of oneness, feeling of joy.

232
00:27:56,126 --> 00:28:01,765
All this starts working in your heart

233
00:28:01,925 --> 00:28:12,908
and then you feel the responses.

234
00:28:14,424 --> 00:28:20,369
If, supposing, the sea is responding to moon

235
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:24,594
that means it has that mobility in it to respond.

236
00:28:24,754 --> 00:28:28,129
A stone will not react to the moon.

237
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,564
In the same way: in your heart

238
00:28:30,724 --> 00:28:34,932
these waves of these feelings are created

239
00:28:35,092 --> 00:28:38,111
by the experience of spirituality,

240
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:44,379
by the experience of your own being.

241
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:49,380
And then you start expressing them.

242
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:56,939
And I could make it out. Such a person may not be so much talkative,

243
00:28:57,099 --> 00:29:02,707
may not know much about Sahaja Yoga, but in the heart,

244
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:08,612
in the heart he feels a response.

245
00:29:08,772 --> 00:29:15,856
Is something to be achieved because you know

246
00:29:16,016 --> 00:29:20,314
that the center of heart is placed here.

247
00:29:20,474 --> 00:29:25,849
The peetha, the seat, of the Heart, is on Brahmarandhra.

248
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:29,857
If your heart is not open,

249
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:37,156
in the heart if you do not have those responses built-in,

250
00:29:39,576 --> 00:29:43,590
they need not be of awe or fear.

251
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:49,171
But a natural protocol that develops.

252
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:52,211
Then you can never do wrong

253
00:29:52,371 --> 00:29:58,201
because you know what ever is good in your heart.

254
00:29:58,361 --> 00:30:00,639
Supposing you love somebody from your heart

255
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,028
you are not going to harm that person.

256
00:30:05,188 --> 00:30:09,867
In the same way, when you start feeling those responses

257
00:30:10,027 --> 00:30:11,627
in your heart,

258
00:30:11,787 --> 00:30:13,918
you can never do wrong because

259
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:17,367
they are now manifesting which were built within you.

260
00:30:17,527 --> 00:30:21,758
Because there was spirituality, there was that divinity

261
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:27,733
which was built in. Now it is manifesting.

262
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:32,581
And then you do not worry about things

263
00:30:32,741 --> 00:30:37,068
and you do not do anything outwardly.

264
00:30:37,228 --> 00:30:43,894
It is said in Upanishads like Shandilya Upanishad, Kathopanishad

265
00:30:44,054 --> 00:30:48,023
that once you know the Brahma,

266
00:30:48,183 --> 00:30:52,303
then all the outside things like wearing a thread of Yagyopaveeta

267
00:30:52,463 --> 00:30:57,615
and all that, should be thrown away – it’s not necessary –

268
00:30:57,775 --> 00:31:01,634
because now you got the sutra (thread) within yourself.

269
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:05,751
Then you should give up all those outward things

270
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:11,177
because inside is all built-in now, is expressing itself.

271
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:14,029
And such a person automatically

272
00:31:14,189 --> 00:31:20,535
becomes a yogi of very high caliber.

273
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:26,376
There was one gentleman in Calcutta, His name is Mr. Khan,

274
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:32,724
though he is a Hindu gentleman and a great scientist of physics.

275
00:31:33,494 --> 00:31:39,859
He was developing those feelings

276
00:31:40,874 --> 00:31:47,373
and one day he was taking his bath in a bathtub and fell down

277
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:53,868
on his back. And it completely broke and some of the splinters

278
00:31:54,028 --> 00:32:00,054
went into the brain and he was in complete coma.

279
00:32:00,214 --> 00:32:06,670
So much so that doctors gave up complete hope about him, saying that,

280
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:13,455
“He can never come back to life.” And he was in the intensive care.

281
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:21,662
But just before falling he called – responses – “Ma!” That’s all.

282
00:32:21,822 --> 00:32:26,318
Then I was in Delhi. They informed Me that he has fallen

283
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:31,080
and this is what has happened. I said, “Alright.”

284
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,028
I just paid attention to him. Gave a bandhan.

285
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:40,347
Next day he opened his eyes. The doctors could not believe it.

286
00:32:40,507 --> 00:32:44,645
And then they removed him to the another ward

287
00:32:44,805 --> 00:32:47,421
where Sahaja Yogis went and said, “We’ll give you vibrations.”

288
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:50,065
He said, “But I’m not feeling any pain, nothing.”

289
00:32:50,225 --> 00:32:54,091
He’s looking ten years younger now and so different.

290
00:32:54,251 --> 00:32:59,702
Now the experience: this is a complete thing for him now.

291
00:32:59,862 --> 00:33:06,862
He is absolutely into his divinity. So he says, “Mother,

292
00:33:07,022 --> 00:33:13,929
I am a person now who doesn’t think about anything.

293
00:33:14,089 --> 00:33:17,902
About life, death, anything. About my children.

294
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:22,281
Now I know who You are. I know that I am under your protection.

295
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:24,895
I don’t have to worry.”

296
00:33:25,055 --> 00:33:29,559
Another case was a Dr. Worlikar who had a very bad heart

297
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:37,377
so they made a by-pass for him. A great devotee.

298
00:33:37,537 --> 00:33:40,776
And his by-pass went out of order perhaps

299
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:44,875
and he had a very massive heart attack. He, again, went into coma.

300
00:33:45,035 --> 00:33:48,641
They put him in the hospital. His aorta, in the beginning,

301
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:52,482
was eighty per cent clogged. So only twenty per cent was opened.

302
00:33:52,642 --> 00:33:58,588
There was no hope. So they did this by-pass for him

303
00:33:58,748 --> 00:34:03,141
and he just said, “Please send word to Mother.”

304
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:07,962
That he need not have done also but doesn’t matter.

305
00:34:08,122 --> 00:34:14,128
And I just put bandhan to him. I was in Australia.

306
00:34:14,288 --> 00:34:18,303
He, again, was a given-up case.

307
00:34:18,463 --> 00:34:21,908
And they said, “Now, how can we have another by-pass.

308
00:34:22,068 --> 00:34:24,634
This pass is finished now, what should we do?”

309
00:34:24,794 --> 00:34:27,035
They were about to operate him and thinking about it

310
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:29,995
when he opened his eyes and he told the doctor.

311
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:32,315
“Doctor, I am feeling all right. I don’t know what has happened.

312
00:34:32,475 --> 00:34:36,431
I’m feeling perfectly all right. Can I sit up?”

313
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:40,922
So the doctor couldn’t understand. He felt his heart.

314
00:34:41,082 --> 00:34:45,478
He said, “His heart is doing very well. What has happened?”

315
00:34:45,638 --> 00:34:48,328
So, they put him on the test and they found out

316
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:52,902
that his old aorta was opened out completely which never happens

317
00:34:53,062 --> 00:34:57,616
in the history of medicine.

318
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:03,792
Now this experience that he had about

319
00:35:03,952 --> 00:35:10,119
is also because of his divinity that I could work on him

320
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:12,459
– the connection was so good –

321
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:14,985
and it worked.

322
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:21,609
But if you mentally go on analysing everything

323
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:26,018
and mentally understanding Sahaja Yoga

324
00:35:27,236 --> 00:35:32,007
you cannot reach that state of divinity

325
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:36,583
from where you receive all the blessings.

326
00:35:36,743 --> 00:35:41,120
It starts pouring on you in every way.

327
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,529
If you hear the way these people were helped

328
00:35:44,689 --> 00:35:49,209
as far as the money was concerned,

329
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:52,889
as far the buildings were concerned,

330
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,680
the transport was concerned – everything –

331
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,251
as if somebody’s working it out.

332
00:35:59,411 --> 00:36:03,732
Even if you are mentally Sahaja Yogis, all these things work out.

333
00:36:03,892 --> 00:36:09,182
But you are definitely helped when your divinity

334
00:36:09,342 --> 00:36:13,727
is manifesting in a very, very big way,

335
00:36:13,887 --> 00:36:21,742
in a such a big way that it is not possible otherwise.

336
00:36:21,902 --> 00:36:24,682
These are not miracles.

337
00:36:24,842 --> 00:36:27,750
For human beings these might be miracles,

338
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,992
but for God it is not.

339
00:36:30,152 --> 00:36:33,264
After all the whole world He has created,

340
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,624
the whole Universe He has created,

341
00:36:35,784 --> 00:36:38,293
universes of universes He has created

342
00:36:38,453 --> 00:36:42,297
so what is so great for Him?

343
00:36:42,929 --> 00:36:51,575
But this is the faith with experience not a blind faith.

344
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:55,262
Faith with experience.

345
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:59,735
And through introspection, “Why do I do this?

346
00:36:59,895 --> 00:37:05,457
Why should I do like this?” “Why shouldn’t you do like that?”

347
00:37:05,617 --> 00:37:08,492
This introspection should start.

348
00:37:08,652 --> 00:37:14,967
When you are introspecting then this depth moves further

349
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:17,111
but more through meditation.

350
00:37:17,271 --> 00:37:22,529
That’s why I always tell you that please get up in the morning

351
00:37:22,689 --> 00:37:25,112
and do your meditation and get up in the evening

352
00:37:25,272 --> 00:37:28,655
and do your meditation. At least before going to bed,

353
00:37:28,815 --> 00:37:31,783
you should get to it.

354
00:37:31,943 --> 00:37:36,958
That’s the only way you can go deeper into your divinity

355
00:37:37,118 --> 00:37:43,438
which is the source of all creativity, source of all the innocence,

356
00:37:43,598 --> 00:37:48,758
is the source of all the knowledge

357
00:37:48,918 --> 00:37:53,791
and the source of all the joy.

358
00:37:53,951 --> 00:37:57,462
So when you get it into your Sahastrara

359
00:37:57,622 --> 00:38:00,457
– yes, it is true Sahastrara was opened out

360
00:38:00,617 --> 00:38:03,749
because of that you got this mass realisation.

361
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:04,972
That’s true.

362
00:38:05,132 --> 00:38:09,754
But now the quality has to go up. Quantity is quite big.

363
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:12,820
The quality has to grow of the Sahastrara.

364
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:21,181
And the Sahastrara is the only instrument

365
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:26,405
which is going to work out Sahaja Yoga in the modern times.

366
00:38:26,565 --> 00:38:35,270
If we realise that heart plays the most important role in Sahastrar.

367
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:38,885
Just here is the heart center.

368
00:38:39,045 --> 00:38:43,965
How important it is that you have to recognise through your heart

369
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:46,155
otherwise this centre won’t open.

370
00:38:46,315 --> 00:38:49,142
Then how do you get your realisation?

371
00:38:49,302 --> 00:38:51,320
What a beautiful connection made:

372
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,807
that this centre here is the seat of the heart,

373
00:38:54,967 --> 00:38:58,716
is the peetha of the heart. And this has to open out.

374
00:38:58,876 --> 00:39:01,505
Then only does Kundalini comes in.

375
00:39:01,665 --> 00:39:06,295
So all this machinery is connected and made in such a manner

376
00:39:06,455 --> 00:39:10,695
that you have to understand the importance

377
00:39:10,855 --> 00:39:17,244
of heart connected through this brain

378
00:39:17,404 --> 00:39:22,812
which is absolutely integrated with heart.

379
00:39:22,972 --> 00:39:27,793
Sahastrara is the one to be preserved

380
00:39:27,953 --> 00:39:31,655
by putting left to the right, right to the left and

381
00:39:31,815 --> 00:39:36,540
everything, opening it out but by recognition.

382
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,872
With introspection also, you can ask,

383
00:39:39,032 --> 00:39:40,753
“Why can’t I recognise that way?

384
00:39:40,913 --> 00:39:44,501
Why can’t I do that way? What is my interest?”

385
00:39:44,661 --> 00:39:47,315
Now, if you come to Sahaja Yoga for making

386
00:39:47,475 --> 00:39:51,857
some sort of a power game, you want to have a power,

387
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:55,762
you are finished. You want to have money or some sort of a business,

388
00:39:55,922 --> 00:39:58,677
you are finished. Anything else you try

389
00:39:58,837 --> 00:40:02,597
like making something for your children or for your marriage

390
00:40:02,757 --> 00:40:08,437
or family or any such outward things if you come to Sahaja Yoga

391
00:40:08,597 --> 00:40:12,996
this won’t work out. But just to expand your heart,

392
00:40:13,156 --> 00:40:15,557
to spread your love to everyone,

393
00:40:15,717 --> 00:40:19,157
to feel their love within your heart and then

394
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:25,317
to put yourself into a position when it responds,

395
00:40:25,476 --> 00:40:29,796
the heart responds, to divinity within you and

396
00:40:29,956 --> 00:40:40,114
to your Mother with full mental activity of the heart.

397
00:40:40,275 --> 00:40:44,511
Today’s subject may sound rather difficult for you to understand

398
00:40:44,671 --> 00:40:48,871
but I had to say this one day because we are quite satisfied

399
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:52,551
with a little of the Kundalini coming out of our head.

400
00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:55,551
There’s so much to come out. So much divinity is there

401
00:40:55,711 --> 00:40:58,671
which has to come out and if you have to ascend

402
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,911
and if you are the foundation of that new age

403
00:41:02,071 --> 00:41:07,223
which is going to transform the whole world we’ll have to work hard.

404
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:10,858
We shouldn’t say, “I don’t know how to get up in the morning.

405
00:41:11,018 --> 00:41:15,790
I don’t know.” You are on a warpath. You are soldiers now.

406
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,523
And you have to work it out if you have to fight

407
00:41:19,683 --> 00:41:25,457
the forces of ignorance and darkness.

408
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:31,817
This has to be worked out. This has to be paid attention to.

409
00:41:31,977 --> 00:41:37,699
So what you have to do is absolutely decide within yourself today

410
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:41,142
that, “We are going to work it out in such a way

411
00:41:41,302 --> 00:41:44,822
that we will all become very powerful Sahaja Yogis

412
00:41:44,982 --> 00:41:50,539
and through us the whole world is going to be saved.”

413
00:41:50,699 --> 00:41:55,338
It’s a very important thing for all of you to understand.

414
00:41:55,498 --> 00:41:58,621
Today is the Sahastrara Day which, of course, I agree

415
00:41:58,781 --> 00:42:04,981
that I opened the last chakra. But, further to go, to grow,

416
00:42:05,141 --> 00:42:08,631
you have to get to meditation

417
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:13,239
where you become silent and your Tree of Life will grow

418
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:18,243
in silence, not in a turmoil. If you understand that,

419
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:23,846
please work it out in such a manner that you all become

420
00:42:24,013 --> 00:42:31,458
completely aware of your divinity by which you can see.

421
00:42:32,966 --> 00:42:37,494
If you have to see the image you have to have a very good mirror.

422
00:42:37,654 --> 00:42:43,057
In the same way, if you have to feel the Mahamaya

423
00:42:43,217 --> 00:42:50,023
you have to have a complete, pure, divinity manifesting in you.

424
00:42:50,245 --> 00:42:51,365
May God bless you.
