Shri Mahakali Puja, "Ascent". San Diego (USA), 19 June 1989.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Today we have decided to have Mahakali Puja.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:17,920
Now we must understand the Mahakali is in totality

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,840
is a reflection of Adi Shakti in totality;

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,160
or we can call it that Adi Shakti is in charge,

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,400
She's managing all these three powers.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,960
But Her manifestation in totality is Mahakali

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,160
in the sense that it is the desire of God Almighty.

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,160
So first She's Adi Shakti in charge of all the three powers

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:59,800
and that's why we can say that when She is in a potential stage

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,760
She is Mahakali and then She divides Herself into two other forces

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,920
as Mahasaraswati

14
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:20,680
and the ascending force that we call,

15
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,080
or as a parasympathetic nervous system

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,120
expressed in us is the Mahalakshmi force.

17
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,080
So She has actually all these forces in Herself,

18
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,880
Mahakali has all these forces but She manifests,

19
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,520
She desires to act and when She wants to act

20
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,840
Her potential force becomes these two other forces.

21
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,400
So when we do the Puja of Mahakali, we must understand

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,800
that inbuilt within this force within us is desire;

23
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,040
so we can desire anything, if we want we can desire everything,

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:14,160
we can desire say the joy, we can desire the knowledge,

25
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,440
we can desire to be compassionate and love and we can desire also

26
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,920
the destruction of those which are negative forces.

27
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,920
But the Mahakali force is the one

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,400
which is working out the constructive force

29
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,600
but in that constructive force only there has to be destruction,

30
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,040
because if you are constructing something and there is destruction

31
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,240
which is trying to destroy your construction then you have to

32
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,160
destroy that destructive personality;

33
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,040
and this is what people sometimes misunderstand

34
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,680
and they think that Mahakali force is negative force

35
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,760
or is a force of destruction, it is, but in a very positive way

36
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,240
and if you understand this part of Mahakali force

37
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,080
then you will understand that if you have desires

38
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,520
to construct yourself properly in Sahaja Yoga

39
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,800
then you should also have the desire to destroy

40
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,320
whatever is standing against your construction.

41
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,200
So one by one we should see within ourselves what sort of things

42
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,040
that drag us down and thus they do not give us this desire.

43
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,600
If this desire becomes intense then you start immediately

44
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,040
seeing what are the forces that are destroying your ascent.

45
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,440
So we have to ascend is the point, our goal is to ascend,

46
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,080
our destination is to ascend; so our desire should be

47
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,720
that we should ascend and construct our being in such a manner

48
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,160
that we can receive all the...

49
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,720
so we should understand that we have to be prepared

50
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,320
to destroy many things within us,

51
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:36,240
if we have to become great evolved personalities

52
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,880
As you have seen in evolution itself you had huge big animals

53
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,440
like mammoth this that and they they could not cope with the evolution

54
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,560
so they were all destroyed, so many thing were destroyed,

55
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,120
and this destruction is built in within us,

56
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,480
when we ascend we just start seeing that these are the forces

57
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:10,080
which are destroying us and that our destruction is so much

58
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,400
that if we do not desire the destruction of these destructive forces

59
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,440
we'll be finished.

60
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:23,080
So at the same time, when we are ascending higher we have to know

61
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,880
what we have to destroy. For example even in living forces

62
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,400
when a flower becomes a fruit,

63
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,920
lots of things which were the part of the flower get destroyed,

64
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,680
automatically, but that is done in the will of God

65
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,000
by His own understanding. So it's absolutely perfect.

66
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,880
So in Sahaja Yoga when we desire something, we must know

67
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:06,600
what we desire, first fix your goal and then relate it to that.

68
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,360
Now there are many deviations in life, like you are going

69
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,160
to the airport, our attention should be we have to reach the airport

70
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,360
and whatever are distractions are distractions;

71
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,000
we should not get lost with it,

72
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,640
if you get lost with those distractions,

73
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,880
then we cannot achieve our goal in time.

74
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:33,000
So one has to understand first of all that our goal is to ascend

75
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:40,680
and for that the distractions are on our way, because of ourselves,

76
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,320
because of ignorance, because of darkness,

77
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,080
because the light is not so much.

78
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,840
The first destroying factor that is within us

79
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,560
is the Shri Ganesha's power

80
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,720
and this Shri Ganesha is the power of Mahakali.

81
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,600
She first planted Shri Ganesha to emit holiness on this Earth,

82
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,160
so the whole thing could be vibrated

83
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:15,240
and as you know one aspect of Shri Ganesha is also Omkara,

84
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,480
means this vibratory awareness which flows everywhere.

85
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,280
So these vibrations have four sides in it:

86
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:34,560
one is that these vibrations establish holiness,

87
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,120
auspiciousness through Mahakali power;

88
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:49,560
then these same vibrations also comfort us through Mahakali power.

89
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,240
Vibrations do not give you desires as such, if you see,

90
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,280
they do not give you desires,

91
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:05,240
but they give you proof of your desires being fulfilled.

92
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Supposing you want somebody to be cured, this is your desire

93
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,600
and you give vibrations to that person; so it's a means,

94
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,360
so it is also the action part which is there in those vibrations,

95
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,320
but this action also comes from desire.

96
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,720
If you don't have desire you won't act,

97
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:41,600
so the desire is so important even to establish your own path,

98
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,520
to establish your forward march, if your desire is poor,

99
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,120
if you're half hearted you can't work it out.

100
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,240
Half hearted people cannot achieve anything in Sahaja Yoga,

101
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,520
it's not meant for half hearted people, it's meant for people

102
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:06,320
who are brave, who have intense desire,

103
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:13,600
who are intelligent and who are auspicious.

104
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:23,000
But in case you do not have intense desire,

105
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,920
then the pure desire doesn't work

106
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,680
and you do not get your realisation; also after getting realisation

107
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,040
unless and until you have desire to ascend,

108
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,320
very strong intense desire to ascend, you cannot ascend.

109
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,680
So for all Sahaja Yogis it is necessary to first of all

110
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,840
early in the morning, while taking the name of Ganesha,

111
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,440
must say what is my desire, this is my goal,

112
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:58,400
this is what it is, all activity must be surrendered for this work.

113
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:07,000
So now how our desires are curbed, first of all

114
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,440
through conditionings. We have certain conditionings.

115
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,880
After Sahaja Yoga people become very affectionate,

116
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,840
so immediately even if in the west - where the family is

117
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,080
not so important, children are not so important,
selfishness is there,

118
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,360
people think about themselves only, they cannot think of others -

119
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:40,760
even in those countries, it starts developing a kind of a,

120
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,600
another cocoon of myness, my child, my house, my home, my family;

121
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,640
then the attention starts working on that,

122
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,880
you become half hearted towards your ascent, because you're ascending

123
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:09,200
in a way so called and also you are spreading out.

124
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,880
Then the concern goes to other conditionings we have.

125
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,080
Like the other day I met one fellow he said that "Mother,

126
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,280
I'm a Sahaja Yogi, I know but I can't get over the idea of Christ",

127
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,640
I said "Who has asked you to get over idea of Christ?

128
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,720
Christ is there, in Sahaja Yoga very much,

129
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,480
but understand it in its own comprehensive way

130
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,080
and see for yourself!".

131
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,840
But this conditioning is of thoughts. Supposing if you have read

132
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,400
too many books, if you have gone through...

133
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,200
supposing you are a born Hindu or a born Christian

134
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,640
or born Jew or anything, so the conditioning is there.

135
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,320
You were born as a human being, you got this stamp later on

136
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,120
that you are a Hindu or a Christian or anything.

137
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,360
These stamps you did not carry when you were born.

138
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,720
Supposing the child was lost, he could be any religion,

139
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,960
so these are not really your innate religions,

140
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,880
this is just a stamp you have got, like Christian or anything.

141
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,680
Then you have another conditioning, that you belong to this nation,

142
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,120
that nation, like we have, we have America, this, that, that,

143
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,480
but still these are stamps. You were born in America,

144
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,040
that's why you are an American, anybody who is born in America

145
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,720
is not different from anybody else.

146
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,440
Only thing according to the climate of a particular place,

147
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,560
you might have your complexion, your height, your face and all that,

148
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,200
but that doesn't mean that innately this is meant for America,

149
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,360
it could be anywhere.

150
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,720
Then all these conditionings within us start acting on our language,

151
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,240
on our styles, on our lives in every way.

152
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,880
Then we start becoming Americans,

153
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,800
so these are the effects of the outside that come in us

154
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,320
and then we say we the Americans,

155
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:27,680
but if you scratch them inside body's the same, heart is the same,

156
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,320
the blood is the same, everything is the same,

157
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:37,440
there's nothing different, it's even not skin deep.

158
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,120
But in the brain it has gone that "I am an American".

159
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,080
Then all these things that are in that society,

160
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:53,200
for example in America so many things are allowed so that's alright,

161
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,560
in India many things are allowed, that's alright,

162
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,240
like that we start accepting the society, the norms of the society

163
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,480
and the conditioning starts.

164
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,960
But with all that, this desire is there, the pure desire to ascend.

165
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,280
I think you put these lights little ahead because they are so,

166
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,280
paper there and with my force, light is going behind,

167
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,960
no, no, not that one please, because they are facing that fan,

168
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:44,360
could bring them down here, still quite close to that fan you know,

169
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,680
you can put them anywhere, you can put them here if you want,

170
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,240
you see because my, the air is blowing that way and they are all going that way.

171
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,960
So the desire within us to ascend comes to us

172
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,640
also as a reaction to all these things,

173
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,680
when we see as Americans what's happening to our country,

174
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,680
what's happening to the people, what's happening to our surroundings

175
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,920
and then we get a shock. Oh God! What is this?

176
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,520
Then we also see this is artificiality, like in England

177
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,120
you have to wear a tail coat, you have to wear this,

178
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,640
you have to have this kind of spoon, this kind of a glass, this that

179
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,720
so reaction builds in; so you start anti-culture,

180
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,600
anti-culture to get rid of artificiality.

181
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,000
Well the desire behind it is, is to seek the reality.

182
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,680
To seek reality then they have hair just like primitive people,

183
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,920
they live like primitive people and the reaction is built in

184
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,960
behind all that is the same desire, is to ascend.

185
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,200
So this Mahalakshmi power is acting within us,

186
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:28,640
it is giving us all kinds of shows, we can say, alright you want to have,

187
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,920
say variety of things, go ahead with it, then you go crazy you see

188
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,440
what is this going on, why should we be so mad about it.

189
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:54,320
Now they want to have, a, you want to have say, your children,

190
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,800
your home, your houses; then you just get fed up with it, because

191
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,080
children become arrogant, they become horrid, they trouble you,

192
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,480
then you say, "Oh God! I'll never have any children any more!"

193
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,680
Then you have wives and you find wives horrible and husbands horrible,

194
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,120
then you divorce, you go on divorcing, divorcing, divorcing

195
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,240
and then you find it's useless, it doesn't work out,

196
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,160
nothing seems to work out, you feel so frustrated

197
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,160
and that action and reaction works on your desires.

198
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,960
So your desires go on changing,

199
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,720
especially when we are wanting to be affluent,

200
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:47,320
people become affluent and then they find the problems of affluence,

201
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,840
so a reaction is built in,

202
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,080
those who witness those problems of the rich,

203
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,520
they don't want to be that rich, nothing doing.

204
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,600
So in every way the desire to achieve things works out,

205
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,000
like some people want to have power, they go into politics,

206
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,600
fight it, get it done and done forever.

207
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,120
So lives after lives it goes on.

208
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,760
Then you are born in modern times when I am here

209
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:30,600
and now your only strong desire is to become The Spirit - I hope it is.

210
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:39,400
So now all these back things are to be crossed over,

211
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,280
they are finished, now what should we do for our realisation,

212
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,480
what action we should take?

213
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,680
The first action is to develop your Mahakali power,

214
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,480
by one power you destroy all that is nonsensical,

215
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:08,160
destroy all that is impeding you, troubling you, blocking you,

216
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,480
destroy all that, just I don't want it.

217
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,720
Because I have seen Sahaja Yogis suddenly go off,

218
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,720
like you have to go to the airport, suddenly you find

219
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:28,520
they have fallen into one of the gutters. "What happened?"

220
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,440
"Mother, we felt like going there", but why?

221
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,800
So keep your attention on that point.

222
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,400
Some people get married, in Sahaja Yoga also,

223
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,880
they have a desire to marry, have children, this thing,

224
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,840
but in that also they get fixed up. Marriage is not the end,

225
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,440
it's just one of the means to be balanced.

226
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:05,200
So we have to have desire that we have to achieve something

227
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,640
so go on destroying all that is within us, within us is there are

228
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:19,240
six enemies as they say, is anger, then greed, jealousies, violence,

229
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,280
all these are within us, so have to destroy these six enemies.

230
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,640
But what's the power of a Mahakali is that she destroys

231
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,920
all the enemies that stand in your way,

232
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,760
all the rakshasas, all the devils all the negative forces,

233
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,800
she tries to destroy, so that your [path] should be all right;

234
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,680
but while She is destroying all of them

235
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,480
if you are sticking on to them, what can She do?

236
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,560
So your desire should be pure and that you should say that all right:

237
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,880
"We want to achieve that", and she is working it out for you.

238
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,640
This is the first thing, Her job.

239
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,520
Then the second job is that She comforts,

240
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,600
She gives you comforts, of every kind.

241
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,120
The first comfort She gives you is of your body,

242
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,280
your body becomes comfortable, means all your diseases and

243
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,200
all your troubles are destroyed. You find that your body becomes

244
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,560
healthy, you feel younger, you get energy

245
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,960
and you can work out your realisation.

246
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,920
This is the first thing She does for you: is to give you comfort.

247
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,800
Then she also gives you comfort of the Spirit,

248
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:48,920
so that you do not ask for artificial comforts,

249
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,080
you can live anywhere, you can live in a jungle, you are comfortable;

250
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,480
if you live in the most busiest place you are comfortable,

251
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,720
so you are comfortable everywhere and that sort of a comfort

252
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,400
she can establish within you.

253
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:16,840
Then the highest of all Her boon is that She gives you the joy,

254
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:26,200
joy of every kind, joy that emits from everything, from everyone.

255
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,680
So that is the highest you get when you keep your desire,

256
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,800
the flame of your desire burning, till you reach that state

257
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:46,400
of spiritual attainment, then you find that no more desire is left;

258
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,800
but only one, if it is any, that "let the whole world be realised".

259
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,840
Like a drunkard, you see, he wants to enjoy his drinking with others,

260
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,480
like that you become, you are drunk in your joy and

261
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,760
why not others enjoy, so you work for it.

262
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,720
But human beings, I have seen, they move like a yo-yo,

263
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,800
they achieve their spiritual attainment they have the joy

264
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,400
and then they go back to help people, they get caught up with them,

265
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,000
they are not strong enough; because the Mahakali power is not strong.

266
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,320
And another is the weakness of the Mooladhara.

267
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,680
Weakness of the Mooladhara makes you imbalanced

268
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,320
and in that imbalance you lose your will.

269
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,720
So one has to be very careful that our Mooladhara must be fixed properly.

270
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,320
There are so many ways by which you can fix up your Mooladhara

271
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,680
and you must fix up your Mooladhara first;

272
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:02,600
then your desire absolutely moves like a kite moves in the sky,

273
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,880
stuck to Mooladhara and you can move into any direction

274
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,200
to any height, wherever you go you are quite in charge,

275
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,320
you know how you are moving.

276
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,080
It can bind your attention, everything. So what we say that

277
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,480
the roots are very important first to be established

278
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,640
for the growth of your desire upward, like a tree.

279
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,920
So they go hand in hand, Mahakali power and Ganesha's power

280
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,040
go hand in hand because that's the foundation;

281
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,240
if it is based on that foundation, desires grow much stronger

282
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,960
and stronger and effective and they do not deviate.

283
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:00,640
Every sort of desire is fulfilled till you reach that state where

284
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,600
there's no other desire left but to enjoy, you just enjoy,

285
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,320
without any desire, desirelessly you enjoy.

286
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,800
And that state is to be enjoyed, just to be enjoyed.

287
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,800
What is there to talk about it? What is there to say about it?

288
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,720
You just are lost in the ocean of enjoyment

289
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:35,600
and that should happen everywhere and that's what you are worshipping.

290
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,280
So now I hope you have hundred and eight names of Mahakali,

291
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,600
and if you have the hundred and eight names of Mahakali

292
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:49,640
you will see one by one that her these stages are working out for you,

293
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,360
how manifest that you can see in those names.

294
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,880
So now first we'll have a one Atarva Sheersha

295
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,480
and then we can have these hundred and eight names.

296
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,920
