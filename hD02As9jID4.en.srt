1
00:02:21,804 --> 00:02:27,177
Today, I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis of the world.

2
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:38,409
 First, I used to bow to all the seekers of the Truth

3
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:46,686
 and today, all those seekers of Truth

4
00:02:47,977 --> 00:02:54,233
 have shown that truth is love, and love is truth.

5
00:02:55,942 --> 00:03:02,189
With the power of love, you have been able to establish

6
00:03:02,942 --> 00:03:09,665
 a beautiful place for Sahaja Yoga in England.

7
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:25,474
 I must congratulate you all for fulfilling your desire

8
00:03:26,491 --> 00:03:33,160
 so beautifully, working it out together

9
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:44,219
 and the collectivity

10
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:50,791
 which you have achieved – not only in England, but all over the world.

11
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:58,489
 All of you feel so responsible that Shudy Camps

12
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:05,009
 should be a perfect piece of art,

13
00:04:06,168 --> 00:04:08,493
the perfect piece of love,

14
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:15,412
 perfect piece of peaceful atmosphere.

15
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,876
 There’s dedication, no doubt,

16
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:34,929
 but apart from dedication, the collective oneness, the integration

17
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:43,803
 of your feelings is beautifully demonstrated.

18
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:51,991
 Even Indians wanted to send you something

19
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:59,905
 for Shudy Camps and it was not ready before I left,

20
00:05:00,205 --> 00:05:06,289
 so they were saying that they will be able to give you
 when you come there for your tours.

21
00:05:06,595 --> 00:05:12,723
 Every country wanted to express their love.

22
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:25,651
 They say love begets love; I loved you, no doubt,

23
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:34,540
but in so many faces, when you see the reflection of that Divine Love,

24
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:43,639
 it is multiplied beyond My expectation.

25
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:49,904
 I cannot describe My joy:

26
00:05:50,777 --> 00:05:57,777
you can sing, dance, jump,  say “Jai” – I also feel like saying your “Jai”,

27
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:03,695
 and singing like …

28
00:06:07,704 --> 00:06:11,458
 This is the beginning of our collective effort

29
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:16,612
and we have to go further and further with this.

30
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:24,644
Tomorrow is a great day for Me, as well as for you –

31
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:31,728
 it has to be one step forward;

32
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:41,074
very substantial step forward and you must be looking forward to it.

33
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:49,702
 I am sure something will work out in the inner building of Shudy Camps,

34
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,769
 in every Sahaja Yogi’s heart.

35
00:06:55,816 --> 00:07:01,645
All that is expressed outside has to be expressed within,

36
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:04,626
 and that is what we have to achieve.

37
00:07:05,703 --> 00:07:08,189
May God bless you!
