1
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,880
Sorry (inaudible) this is (inaudible)

2
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,800
you'll spoil the carpets, be careful

3
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,040
Please be seated.

4
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,200
It’s all right.

5
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I hope you can hear Me all the way, can you?

6
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,040
Come forward a little bit, perhaps.

7
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,360
Today is a very

8
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,200
joyous that all of us are here in Turkey,

9
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,360
to celebrate the Puja of Fatima.

10
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,320
As you know about Her that She was the daughter

11
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,640
of Mohammed Sahib and was married to Ali,

12
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,600
and She had two children, Hassan and Hussein,

13
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,360
who were ultimately killed in Karbala

14
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,040
by the fanatics,

15
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,240
who were that time called themselves Sunnis.

16
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:15,400
All this happened because there were fanaticism,

17
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,960
and the fanaticism

18
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,160
that makes person thinks always

19
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,680
that they are on the right

20
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,680
and they have every right to be

21
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,320
angry, to persuade, to convince another party,

22
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,200
another person.

23
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,960
And these fanaticisms grew

24
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,200
since long – it’s not a new thing.

25
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,400
It is so obvious now that our main problem

26
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,440
in this world is of fanaticism.

27
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,640
Fatima lost Her two children,

28
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,720
and She was the embodiment of

29
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,120
Gruha Lakshmi.

30
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,240
She resides in our Left Nabhi.

31
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,320
So for all the diseases that are connected with the spleen,

32
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,760
all the problems that are connected with your Left Nabhi

33
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,400
can be only corrected by Fatima.

34
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,560
So you have to keep Fatima awakened within yourself.

35
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,360
That we are here in the Islamic culture,

36
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,240
we can say, this is place of Islamic culture;

37
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,680
and in the Islamic culture a housewife was given

38
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,080
a very, very important place.

39
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,960
At the time of Mohammed Sahib

40
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,080
there were struggles and fights

41
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,720
and wars going on between different tribes.

42
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,680
As a result many, many

43
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,680
young men were killed.

44
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,440
Only quite old people survived,

45
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,000
and also so many women.

46
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,880
This is the reason why Mohammed said that

47
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,120
“You can marry four wives, five wives;

48
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,120
but you cannot allow them to remain

49
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,800
unmarried or they will have extramarital relationships.

50
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,360
That will be the greatest fall for Islam,

51
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,720
for that religion.”

52
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,760
So He understood that unless and until

53
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,960
women are kept absolutely chaste,

54
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,960
absolutely pure,

55
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,920
there cannot be the Kingdom of God.

56
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,680
In Sanskrit there’s a saying,

57
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,400
“Yatra narya pujyante, tatra ramante devata”:

58
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,320
meaning “Where the women are respected,

59
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,800
are worshipped and they are worshipful” –

60
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,040
not that they are to be worshipped,

61
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,080
but they are respectable –

62
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:45,480
“there only exists the Kingdom of God.”

63
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,160
So, so much responsibility is on women.

64
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,360
So from Fatima’s life we have to know that

65
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,400
She did not go out of Her house

66
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,080
and She remained a housewife,

67
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,720
and She made Her two children grow up

68
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,040
in such a manner that they had to fight the war

69
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,680
against fanaticism.

70
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,760
Her husband also was there.

71
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,920
This is how a woman of a housewife

72
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,720
is shown to be so powerful that though

73
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,360
she’s in the house, though she’s –

74
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,400
looks to be just a mother,

75
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,200
but how powerful she is.

76
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,440
But these days a new type of ideas have come up.

77
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,120
Men also have been very nasty

78
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,080
and very aggressive with women.

79
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,440
As a result we find there’s a big

80
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,680
opposition to men,

81
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,440
and a kind of a big rift has been created

82
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,640
between men and women.

83
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,720
Also the men, the way they started becoming licentious,

84
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,360
perverted,

85
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,320
going to bad women,

86
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,240
the good women also thought,

87
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,120
“Why not we also become like that?”

88
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,080
and they also started doing wrong things

89
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,680
which they should not have done.

90
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,200
That’s how the whole society crumbled down.

91
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,080
Now, the men are responsible for the politics and the economics

92
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,600
and also the nation, as administrators,

93
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,640
but women are responsible for the society.

94
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,840
Whether she’s in the house or she’s outside,

95
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,480
whether she’s working in the house or outside,

96
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,040
she is responsible for

97
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,240
the maintenance of the society.

98
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,600
And there it looks as, sometimes to a woman,

99
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,120
that she’s dominated,

100
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,120
that her husband dominates her,

101
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,040
that the husband’s family dominates her,

102
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,800
but it’s the quality of a woman

103
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,760
that brings up the level of the society.

104
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,200
Not only the level,

105
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,560
but also in the family she is then respected.

106
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,440
It’s a very important role as a housewife;

107
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,320
perhaps we never realize it.

108
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,920
Now we see so many lights here,

109
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,720
electricity is there running.

110
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,640
But what is the source of this electricity?

111
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,240
Is it not much more important than these lights?

112
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,920
So men are nothing but, we can say, the kinetic energy,

113
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,880
but what is the potential is the woman of the house.

114
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,600
But these days it’s becoming a very funny situation.

115
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,640
I was surprised when I went to

116
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,240
Italy also, that

117
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,360
how women have made themself cheap.

118
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,480
And they want to look attractive to every man.

119
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,920
What is the need?

120
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,760
It’s a joyless pursuit into which men are going,

121
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,120
and women are making themselves absolutely cheap.

122
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,800
This cheapness of women

123
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,720
is not going to give them any strength or joy.

124
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,680
I know one feels very unhappy

125
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,360
the way men treat them.

126
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,240
But you must have your own personality,

127
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,880
you must have your own understanding

128
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,960
that you are a woman, you are shakti,

129
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,360
and nobody can suppress the shakti.

130
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,720
But if you do not keep to your own

131
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,080
personality or your chastity,

132
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,640
then you cannot achieve

133
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,160
your goal in life.

134
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,560
And your goal in life is to give power to your son,

135
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,920
to your husband,

136
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,200
to all the society the woman gives power.

137
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,440
I am also a woman, as you know,

138
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,360
and I also have a family.

139
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,120
With all the powers that I have,

140
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,760
I never showed them that I have those powers.

141
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,280
I always listened to My husband, obeyed him

142
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,680
though sometimes he was very unreasonable also.

143
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,000
And he also came from a society

144
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,640
which was more Islamic-oriented.

145
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,200
But that was just a joke for Me,

146
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,200
because I thought

147
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,160
“He’s just like a child

148
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,880
and I have to be

149
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,280
very patient with him.”

150
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,560
He always says that because of My powers

151
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,440
he earned everything in life.

152
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,320
Always, in the presence of everyone he says so.

153
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,880
I don’t know that part, but definitely

154
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,600
I feel very satisfied with My own married life.

155
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,360
I never think the way other people think

156
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,680
that we must try to dominate the husband,

157
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,360
we must fight him, we must have a right to do this.

158
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Our right is within ourselves, within our powers.

159
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,280
Also the men must realize that they have to respect women.

160
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,760
I mean, not to such an extent that she tells you

161
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,080
to do something wrong,

162
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,760
and you just get lost with this – that’s not the way.

163
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,040
That’s slavishness.

164
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,480
Men have to be men.

165
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,120
It in no way means the women are dominated by men.

166
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,200
I do not say it that way;

167
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,920
because if you have your own powers,

168
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,880
ultimately whatever may be the husband,

169
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,800
he’ll have to come and

170
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,160
understand what you want.

171
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,320
He’ll have to know what you are.

172
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,400
I have seen it many-a-times in My own lifetime

173
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,600
that it has done that way.

174
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,120
I would never say anything.

175
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,040
Supposing he gets angry, I would keep quiet.

176
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,880
All right.

177
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,920
After all he has to fight outside

178
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,080
and he has to take out temper on Me

179
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,400
that he couldn’t do:

180
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,120
if he does this to others they will beat him,

181
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,880
so it’s better he takes out temper on Me.

182
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,560
And I never, never felt that way

183
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,000
that he’s dominating Me.

184
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,080
Only thing I thought, he’s taking out his temper.

185
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,920
But I’ve seen that whenever

186
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,280
I said something to him, he thought about it.

187
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,560
In his lifetime I’ve taken eleven decisions;

188
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,960
and all these decisions

189
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,280
he still remembers one by one

190
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,720
and knows that it was very, very important.

191
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,240
Other things I never tell him what to do.

192
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,400
Whatever was most important is the principle.

193
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,160
Now, he also realized that

194
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,960
I have a very important mission.

195
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,360
So he gave Me money, he gave Me time, gave Me all freedom.

196
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,440
But first I had to establish Myself

197
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,640
as a very sensible, devoted wife.

198
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,800
The men as a whole are very different type,

199
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,800
you must understand.

200
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,280
They are extroverts,

201
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,120
and whatever the women care

202
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,040
too much for, they do not.

203
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,760
It’s all right,

204
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,000
because women and men are complementary.

205
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,360
Like Ali was there outside working everything out,

206
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,240
while Fatima Bi in the house, home,

207
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,960
who never went out,

208
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,720
but he knew his source of energy

209
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,440
from where it was coming.

210
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,280
Because women were never respected as shakti,

211
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:28,240
they started getting drifted into this Western modern ideas

212
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,760
that “we have to fight men,

213
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,800
they are problematic, they are troubling us

214
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,760
and we should take revenge.”

215
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,160
That’s how society cannot work out.

216
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,640
Responsibility of the women is much greater

217
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,160
than that of men.

218
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,040
Men have to just go to offices,

219
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,680
work it out something, come back home.

220
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,440
Women have to lifelong generate the energy

221
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,760
for the growth of the children,

222
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,720
the protection of the husband,

223
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,160
for all the sensible things that she has to do.

224
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,320
That’s why in India we say,

225
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,640
“A woman is to be absolutely respected,

226
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,120
and she has to be respectable.”

227
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,560
Moreover it is not only in India,

228
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,160
I’ve seen it all over that women

229
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,200
are always respected if they are housewives.

230
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
For example,

231
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,600
I go with My husband to some function.

232
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,440
I’m respected as much as he is respected.

233
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,480
For example,

234
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,880
his deputy won’t be respected as I am respected,

235
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,120
his secretary won’t be respected.

236
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,880
No one.

237
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,200
I, as his wife, is respected the same way because I’m his wife.

238
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,200
Nobody looks down upon Me

239
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,560
because I’m somebody’s wife.

240
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,800
Is all over it is like this.

241
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,760
I’ll give you a case of a lady I knew.

242
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,640
She used to think she’s a very smart person, you know,

243
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
always looked after her body and just

244
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,760
to be thin and all that,

245
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,400
and she wanted to attract all the men

246
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,640
and all kinds of things,

247
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,520
she would wear, you see, jeans and,

248
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,960
you know, quite old lady.

249
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,400
And her husband was a big man

250
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,920
he was a chief cabinet secretary,

251
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,160
very senior to us.

252
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,880
So one day we were all invited for a dinner.

253
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,720
So, she was not there.

254
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,280
So many asked him, so many people,

255
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,240
“Where is your wife, where is your wife?”

256
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,280
He said, “I don’t know where she is.

257
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,800
She was to come here.”

258
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,760
I was also thinking where is she, where is she gone,

259
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,760
because there was a seat for her, a special seat.

260
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,360
So before sitting for the dinner

261
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,040
I went for, I went into the bathroom.

262
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,800
And there the poor thing was sitting on one corner.

263
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,640
I said, “Why are you sitting here?”

264
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,040
So she said, “They made me sit here.

265
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,280
I don’t know what to do.”

266
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,320
So I brought her out. I said,

267
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,120
“Why did you make her sit there?”

268
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,920
And she was thinking she’s very smart

269
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,560
she’s done her hair nicely,

270
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,320
she’s looking like an actress.

271
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,000
“Oh, is she the wife?” I said, “Yes.”

272
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,640
“Oh, my God! We thought she’s the secretary.

273
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,240
How could she be? She has no dignity of her own,

274
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,960
the way she was dressed stupidly.

275
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,560
How can we believe that she’s the wife?

276
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,800
She has no dignity as a wife of a Indian

277
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
gentleman so highly placed.”

278
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,960
And poor thing was sitting there for half-an-hour,

279
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,240
smoking.

280
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,760
They couldn’t believe it. Then they asked Me,

281
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,880
“Are You sure she’s his wife?”

282
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,640
I said, “Yes, I’m sure.”

283
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,920
I mean, she came to the table, nobody got up for her.

284
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,360
And they still thought, all the rest,

285
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,200
she’s the secretary who has come.

286
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,120
Then we had to tell them, “that’s his wife.”

287
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,640
She was thinking she’s a smart young lady, you know;

288
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,320
at that old age behaving stupidly.

289
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,960
So even in the West a woman is respected

290
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,600
if she’s a good housewife.

291
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,360
Anywhere, she is respected.

292
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,800
I was surprised also that

293
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,760
I knew somebody very highly placed,

294
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,480
a minister in the cabinet

295
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,000
of England,

296
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,000
and he was

297
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,080
supposed to be little wayward

298
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,040
and nobody would take notice of him.

299
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,120
Nobody would. “Don’t look at him!”

300
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,480
I was not so good at the scandals

301
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,080
that they had in the all diplomatic circles,

302
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,800
but I said that “Why don’t you talk to this man?”

303
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,760
“No, not worth it.”

304
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,040
I said, “Why?”

305
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,560
They said, “He’s horrible. He is not a good man.”

306
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,040
“Yes, but why? What has he done?”

307
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,760
They said, “He’s a flirt,

308
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,000
and he is looking at other women

309
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,080
and he’s doing all kinds of things,”

310
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,920
and they told stories about him. My God!

311
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,120
Such a big man like a minister –

312
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,800
why is he behaving like this?

313
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,760
Like a stupid donkey, he is going about …

314
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,600
Nobody would shake hands with him.

315
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Even men would not look at him.

316
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,600
Now, of course, a new society is forming of all these

317
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,400
stupid people. That’s different.

318
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,280
But one Sahaja Yogi

319
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,840
who will visit these places

320
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,040
will be amazed how stupid they are.

321
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,480
They can make it out.

322
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,000
All of them catch on their Left Nabhi,

323
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,760
whether they are women or men.

324
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,800
But it’s more dangerous for men if they have a wife like that.

325
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,400
Now, the Left Nabhi if it catches, what happens?

326
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,000
What diseases you'll have?

327
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,840
The first and foremost is blood cancer.

328
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,320
With the Left Nabhi you can get blood cancer.

329
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,240
Women think they can dominate their husband,

330
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,120
they can do this to their husband,

331
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,920
they can put them right, but they don’t know

332
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,400
they are causing a serious disease like blood cancer.

333
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,720
I know of somebody who was suffering

334
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,400
from blood cancer, but we cured him

335
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,480
and then we discovered his Left Nabhi was still bad.

336
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,760
Again and again he was getting relapse.

337
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,720
Then we found out it was his wife.

338
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,160
She was such a dangerous woman for him.

339
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,360
And he wouldn’t leave her, wouldn’t leave her.

340
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,840
So I told him, “I will not treat you again

341
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,360
if you live with that woman.

342
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,920
Better throw her out, or you send her somewhere else.

343
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,640
But if you are going to live with this woman,

344
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,640
I’m not going to treat you.”

345
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,600
He also called her and I told her on her face

346
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,040
that “You’re a very dominating, horrible shrew woman,

347
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,920
and if you try to torture your husband,

348
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,800
he cannot be cured.”

349
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,080
But she went on.

350
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,760
And then, the end result was horrible, horrible, horrible.

351
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,840
He developed a big spleen like that,

352
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,960
all of it was taken out, and doctors told that

353
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,040
“within six months you’ll be finished.”

354
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,240
So on both the cases, I would say,

355
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,360
the wife tried to dominate the husband,

356
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,000
and husband getting attached to that wife still.

357
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,880
It’s recent case I’m telling you.

358
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,280
Now, we are husband and wife

359
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,120
because we love each other, we are complementary.

360
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,840
Woman is a woman, man is a man.

361
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,560
Men should not expect women to be like you – very fast,

362
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,480
and women should not expect men to be like you –

363
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,280
very, I should say, noble.

364
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,360
They are qualities of a woman and the qualities of a man.

365
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,960
But the greatest power of a woman is her chastity.

366
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,600
If her chastity is disturbed,

367
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,560
then she is a dangerous person,

368
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,640
very dangerous.

369
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,160
She can not only harm her husband,

370
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,400
but also her children, her society.

371
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,960
We come from a culture which is very akin

372
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,160
to Islamic culture also.

373
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,440
Indian culture is like that.

374
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,760
In the Indian culture women respect their chastity

375
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,520
more than anything in this world.

376
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,160
They can give up everything, but not their chastity.

377
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,840
And once - there’s a story

378
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,840
I must tell you, very interesting,

379
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,040
about a very beautiful woman called Padmini.

380
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,000
She was the wife of a king.

381
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,360
And there was a horrible Muslim king who wanted

382
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,760
to see this woman, because he heard she was very beautiful.

383
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,040
See, this is, was a funny thing.

384
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,920
And she came, and he came to that kingdom

385
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,480
and he said, “I must look at this lady, otherwise

386
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,160
I’ll destroy the whole kingdom.”

387
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,480
Now people said, “This he can’t do, she’s our queen.

388
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,000
She can’t, he can’t see our queen like that.”

389
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,560
She just thought, “All right. He need not see me,

390
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,360
but he might see my reflection.”

391
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,720
So she stood before a mirror

392
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,760
and he saw her reflection.

393
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,000
Then he became even more mad

394
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,520
and he said, “I must have this woman.

395
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,680
If you don’t give her to me,

396
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,560
then I’ll destroy all of you.”

397
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,960
Imagine a king doing all this nonsense for a woman –

398
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,000
shows what a useless fellow he was.

399
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,280
So he brought all his army, everything,

400
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,680
and settled down near the fort

401
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,920
where these people were, and sent a message that

402
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,400
“if you don’t send this lady to me,

403
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,080
then I’m going to attack.”

404
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,680
They were not prepared, didn’t know what to do,

405
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,840
so they said that “Let us go and fight him.

406
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,240
We cannot allow our queen to be given to him.

407
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,640
This is a question of our prestige.”

408
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,480
They took a hundred palanquin.

409
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,600
Do you understand palanquin?

410
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,680
They took a hundred palanquin.

411
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,840
And in those hundred palanquins there were four warriors

412
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,400
sitting with these arms and their machines,

413
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,680
and there were two who were carrying them.

414
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,160
And they said, “All right. The queen is coming with her

415
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,560
hundred maids.”

416
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,040
The Muslims that time were, the Muslim king was

417
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,800
having his drinks and things, very happy

418
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,200
that the queen is going to come.

419
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,600
So these people went there

420
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,960
and came out of their palanquins and started fighting.

421
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:28,320
They had told these women that “In case we win,

422
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,240
by five o’clock in the morning we’ll lit a fire

423
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,360
and you will see the fire,

424
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,160
then you’ll know that we have won the case.

425
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,120
But if we do not win, then you should know

426
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,000
for definite that we have not won the battle.”

427
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,000
They were only, say, four hundred people or six hundred people,

428
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,520
and thousands were with this man and he had

429
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,280
guns and cannons and everything.

430
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,520
So they started fighting.

431
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,480
In that fight

432
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,040
that Muslim king won -

433
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,120
because he had so much of power -

434
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,080
and most of these people died. Even the king was killed.

435
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,400
There was no fire lit at five o’clock,

436
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,240
so these women saw there’s no fire lit.

437
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,080
So they made a huge big platform, a pyre,

438
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,680
they climbed down to the pyre and lit the fire,

439
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,560
and they all died. Three thousand women died,

440
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,840
because they didn’t want other men to touch them.

441
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,480
Any other man coming and touching them

442
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,680
means their chastity is finished.

443
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,600
There are many, many stories of this kind in India.

444
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,680
So, how they respected their chastity!

445
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,520
It’s easy, you see, to fall to some sort of a,

446
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,840
another

447
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,360
temptation,

448
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,040
but if this is your power,

449
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,760
why you should submit yourself

450
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,840
to something which is so useless?

451
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,000
In Sahaja Yoga we have to realize.

452
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,680
Men also must know that if their

453
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,920
wives are so chaste and so good,

454
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,240
they must respect them.

455
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,240
They should also realize that they have also rakhi sisters,

456
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,480
which is that we are very chaste people.

457
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,080
We respect the chastity of a rakhi sister

458
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,680
and we do not want to in any way to comply with anyone

459
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,280
who does not respect the chastity.

460
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,200
Then the men also become chaste.

461
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,360
When the women are chaste men also become chaste.

462
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,840
And this chastity is your main power,

463
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,080
is this chastity is the one is the power of Shri Ganesha.

464
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,160
And when you get this Shri Ganesha’s power,

465
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,920
you know how powerful you become

466
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,800
with the innocence that is awakened within you.

467
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,160
So without the chastity the women cannot achieve

468
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,080
anything in Sahaja Yoga.

469
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,760
One has to give up all the past ideas,

470
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,360
all the past things, and also the way there is bombardment

471
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,920
from the newspapers, from the media, from everything.

472
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,840
Recently I read a beautiful book,

473
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,720
so big as that, has come out that Media Versus America.

474
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,360
In that they have said that how this media has put

475
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,680
ideas into the heads of women and men,

476
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:51,160
decrying the utility of married life

477
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,360
how they have killed the married life.

478
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,400
They marry, then divorce; they marry, then divorce.

479
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,920
The same thing goes on all the time.

480
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,440
In Sahaja Yoga, of course, it’s not that bad.

481
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,680
We had eighty-six weddings this time. Eighty-six.

482
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,880
Out of which one was about to fizzle out;

483
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,040
that also is established.

484
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,760
In Sahaja Yoga it’s much better.

485
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,680
People understand the importance of married life.

486
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,040
It’s a drama, but also it is tapas,

487
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,960
it is a tapasya with which you understand

488
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,960
your own powers.

489
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,960
I would say a man is like the sun, but

490
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,160
the woman is like the Mother Earth.

491
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,000
The difference is like this:

492
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,160
that the sun shines, gives light,

493
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,200
it gives also nourishment to the Mother Earth in a way;

494
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,240
and the Mother Earth gives everything,

495
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,800
she bears so much of things,

496
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,560
she bears all our sins.

497
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,040
So a housewife is like the Mother Earth.

498
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,680
She gives joy to everyone, to her husband,

499
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,840
to her children. She doesn’t think about herself.

500
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,160
She doesn’t think "how I could achieve great things

501
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,040
through my beauty maybe, through my body,

502
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,560
through my education,

503
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,120
through my

504
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,240
powers that I’ve got" – no, she doesn’t.

505
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,240
What she thinks, "how I can make others powerful,

506
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,440
how I can give them power, how I can help them."

507
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,280
This is the typical

508
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,760
ideology of a woman.

509
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,120
If it is not so, then she’s not a woman.

510
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,960
I mean, she feels – if somebody says,

511
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,000
“I want to come to your house for dinner,”

512
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,600
she feels very happy. “Oh, that’s very good.

513
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,600
Now then, what should I cook? What should I do?”

514
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,560
This is a woman’s attitude.

515
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,000
Once we had a group of people, about twenty-five

516
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,800
of them had come to see Me.

517
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,960
I was sitting with them in an open space,

518
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,080
and then I sent word to My daughter that they are here and

519
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,040
it might be late, so better prepare dinner for them.

520
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,960
After the thing I said, “There dinner is for you, let's go.”

521
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,280
They said, “How?” I said, “All right.”

522
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,400
She was so overjoyed, My daughter.

523
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,400
She had prepared all kinds of things,

524
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,560
her friends also came to help her.

525
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,520
And they were surprised, all these foreigners, that

526
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,880
“How, Mother, she’s so happy about it?

527
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,000
If I tell my wife” – that’s the beginning of Sahaja Yoga –

528
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,080
“that even three persons are coming for dinner,

529
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,240
she’d go round and round and round ...”

530
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,040
I said, “Why?”

531
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,520
“ … and she’d grudge and grumble,

532
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,240
and she’d show all her temper with the people.”

533
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,000
I was quite surprised.

534
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,960
In Sahaja Yoga that’s how we live.

535
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,000
We want to give love, and

536
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,120
men have to appreciate that love and enjoy that love;

537
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,200
whether you are a brother or a husband

538
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,000
or a son, any way, the woman’s love is for you.

539
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,680
And she gives you that love that makes you absolutely,

540
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,360
not only joyous but also religious.

541
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,080
Because it’s a relative thing.

542
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,000
If a woman starts misbehaving,

543
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,360
that’s the worst for the society:

544
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,120
men also start misbehaving.

545
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,440
Men, as it is, are extroverts.

546
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,720
So to control them,

547
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,960
put them as householders,

548
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,840
women must know how to keep them.

549
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,280
It’s not easy to run a house,

550
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,720
it’s not easy to run your family,

551
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:04,240
it’s not easy to look after your children – very difficult.

552
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,160
And those who have those qualities are the best women

553
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,840
and they really achieve it.

554
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,960
I mean, you can think of your mothers,

555
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,760
how much they loved you,

556
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,840
all the men and the women.

557
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,200
Why? Why do you think of your mother so much?

558
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,640
Because she sacrificed everything,

559
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,880
but without showing that she was sacrificing.

560
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,280
She did so much for you, so you could...

561
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:39,760
Woman’s potential to love is tremendous,

562
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,640
tremendous!

563
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,040
And this is what we have to learn from Fatima.

564
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,800
She gave Her two children to be killed.

565
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,440
She knew, because She was, after all, Vishnumaya.

566
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,160
She was the incarnation of Vishnumaya.

567
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,120
She knew Her children will be killed,

568
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,200
but still She sent Her children,

569
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,200
“All right. Doesn’t matter.

570
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,000
Even if I know that they are going to die, it’s all right."

571
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,600
Such bravery, such courage,

572
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,120
such understanding of the duty of Her children.

573
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,120
Today we remember them as Hassan and Hussein.

574
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,520
Supposing She had said, “No, no, no, no, don’t go

575
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,800
for the war. Stay at home.”

576
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,800
And if She had forced them not to go,

577
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,120
then they would not have gone.

578
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,840
We would not have talked about them today, isn’t it?

579
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,880
In any case, they would have been dead sometime,

580
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,480
but the death of a hero they got because of their mother.

581
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,600
Of course, they were also a kind of incarnations,

582
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,000
but the way She gave them absolutely complete

583
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,840
encouragement, “Go and fight for the right thing.”

584
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,800
Because these fundamentalists

585
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,280
were trying to bring their fanaticism.

586
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,560
So today is a day I have to tell men also

587
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,040
that you must learn to respect a woman who is chaste.

588
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,520
Please understand, if your wife is a chaste woman,

589
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:26,800
then you have no right, in no way to trouble her.

590
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,000
Not that she should be respectable

591
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,720
but you should see that everyone respects her,

592
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,160
nobody insults her, should stand by her,

593
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,760
be identified with her.

594
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,560
But if she’s not a chaste woman

595
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,320
and if she is that kind, better keep out.

596
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,760
I do not have that much courage to say that

597
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,440
“All right. Go ahead with her and I’ll look after.”

598
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,280
It’s very difficult.

599
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,920
I don’t know what complications might come.

600
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,680
With all these experiences

601
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,000
one learns one thing for definite,

602
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,520
that woman is much more inward,

603
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,840
she has much more powers,

604
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,720
she is much more wiser than other people are,

605
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,040
if she keeps to her chastity.

606
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,480
That’s the point on which all her

607
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,360
movement rotates, all her personality rotates.

608
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,560
She may be anything.

609
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,600
We had women – like there was a lady who was

610
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,040
only seventeen years of age, and she became a widow.

611
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,960
Widow she became at the age of seventeen,

612
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,520
and she fought a very horrible king called as

613
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,600
Aurangzeb, and she saw to it that he was battled;

614
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,360
her name was Tarabai.

615
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,480
We have women in India of different, different,

616
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,760
say, characters in a way,

617
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,800
fighting in different, different ways,

618
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,360
but they were first and foremost were housewives.

619
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,200
All their powers were there as housewives.

620
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,640
So do not look down upon

621
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,520
the housewife.

622
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,720
When I’m traveling in the plane,

623
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,760
they ask Me, “Mother, what is your profession?”

624
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,200
“Housewife.”

625
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,720
My profession is housewife.

626
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,560
I’m a housewife of a very, very big family.

627
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,760
I’m looking after My children,

628
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,960
I’m loving them, they love Me,

629
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,640
and this profession is the best, I think,

630
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,480
because it is so joy-giving,

631
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,440
it’s so beautiful.

632
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,280
It’s love.

633
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,960
It’s so energy-giving.

634
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,200
And at this age also I never feel My age,

635
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,400
because I am the Mother of so many of you.

636
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,760
And it never comes to My head that I’m old now

637
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,680
and I must do so-and-so, I must take rest

638
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,320
and I must not do this work or that...

639
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,240
Because this feeling of love

640
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,520
for My children: I have to nourish them,

641
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,600
I have to look after them,

642
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,640
because all My powers I have to give them.

643
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,480
I never try to show off My powers to you in any way.

644
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,160
It’s only you, who should imbibe all My powers.

645
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,560
That’s the only desire I have,

646
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,960
that you should be as powerful as Myself.

647
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,480
Of course you discover it that I have powers,

648
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,280
but as far as I am concerned

649
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,040
I want that you should forget as to

650
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,280
what powers I have, but you should yourself

651
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,800
have all these powers within yourself,

652
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,360
so that you can save the world.

653
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,720
That’s the only thing I want to give you.

654
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,000
And I want to assure you that you all can have

655
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,840
everything that I have; only thing if you can retain –

656
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,160
simple thing in life – that we have to be righteous people.

657
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,280
We cannot play about, we cannot misbehave.

658
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,960
Nowadays so many things are coming up,

659
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,640
things that men are doing and women are doing;

660
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,600
we are not.

661
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,200
In the evolutionary process,

662
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,520
as we may say that there were some monkeys - chimpanzees

663
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,800
that became human beings. But no,

664
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
in between there were some other human beings

665
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,200
that came in, which vanished.

666
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,040
So, very few people will become Sahaja Yogis,

667
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,160
who will be saved.

668
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,640
All the rest will be not there -

669
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,960
they’ll be neither monkeys nor human beings, finished.

670
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,560
These are all self-destroying things

671
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,720
which kills the family,

672
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,720
which kills the chastity within us,

673
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,840
and then we are left high and dry.

674
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,880
We are nowhere. We have diseases, we have troubles,

675
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,600
we have problems. So be careful,

676
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,240
very, very careful.

677
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,040
And this special puja for

678
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,080
Fatima Bi is

679
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,880
puja of Vishnumaya.

680
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,560
Also the guilt that works on the Left Vishuddhi

681
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,240
can be cured if you develop your chastity.

682
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,680
You’ll never feel guilty,

683
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,040
because that’s such a virtue you have.

684
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,760
In that virtue you will never, never feel guilty,

685
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,840
and you can stand up to any nonsense

686
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,280
because you are standing on the truth of chastity.

687
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,720
Today it’s special day, I would say, when we are

688
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:03,400
worshipping this great ideal of chastity that is Fatima Bi.

689
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,600
May God bless you.

690
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,800
Right, so now we have very few children …

691
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,280
How many children we have?

692
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,200
Come along, come along, come along.

693
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,880
Let’s sing the Ganesha Stuthi.

694
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,720
All right, you can sing the Ganesha Stuthi.

695
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,160
Let’s say the Ganesha’s mantra,

696
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,000
and then we’ll sing the Ganesha Stuthi,

697
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:41,120
and after that we’ll have the hundred-and-eight names.

698
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:26,160
This stone, feroza, comes from Iraq,

699
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:32,000
and Fatima used to wear quartz, no doubt about it.

700
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:35,840
This one is called as a quartz;

701
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,080
it’s called as feroza.

702
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:41,680
And full of it, it’s there in Iraq, so many.

703
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:47,240
She used to wear this feroza, it’s absolutely correct.

704
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:22,040
Also this, for your information, ...

705
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:24,920
these vases also come from Iraq,

706
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:27,640
also from the same place where She was.

707
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:31,400
So just see the coincidence,

708
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,760
exactly, at this time, to come from Iraq.

709
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:40,000
May God bless that country and may there be peace.

710
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:23,040
There’s another suggestion that everybody cannot

711
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:28,760
go to India, so people can’t get married, you see.

712
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:32,320
So we’re thinking of also organizing marriages,

713
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:37,080
when – during Diwali Puja.

714
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:40,880
But you won’t have such a wide choice, that’s the point is.

715
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:44,960
Doesn’t matter. Those who want to get married

716
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:49,160
should send Me forms filled in,

717
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:51,960
and send it to Guido.

718
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:58,760
And another thing is that we can’t have

719
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:03,720
the same elaborate way as we have it in India. We try,

720
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:06,600
but still you know it’s very difficult.

721
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:08,560
It’s a different country.

722
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:11,760
We’re trying to find out things

723
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:14,840
that can be worked out.

724
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:17,240
In any case

725
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:22,200
we’ll organize the marriages, because you don’t want

726
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:27,040
another type, ... a simple type, you want to have Indian style.

727
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:32,760
So I’ll go to India before Diwali,

728
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:35,440
try to organize things for you.

729
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:38,600
May God bless you.

730
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:03,760
Thank you very much for everything.

731
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:09,960
I’m sorry I couldn’t get presents

732
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,320
for all of you - all of you this time.
