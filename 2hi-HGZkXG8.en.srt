00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,960
Agnya very badly on her.

401
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,280
For the balance.

402
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,280
Yogies: [FRENCH] - So you take some vibrated

403
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,120
sindoor and also lemon and chillies will be good for this kind of [UNCLEAR]

404
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,960
She's caught up with Agnya chakra.

405
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,360
What about his grandparents?

406
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,959
Does he go to his grandparents?

407
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:30,960
What's it?

408
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,959
Yogi: He says the parents of the mother

409
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,280
Yogi: are not interested eh..

410
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,960
Yogi: in Sahaja Yoga the.. - Parents of the mother? - Yogi: Yeah.

411
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,439
But, does he go to them?

412
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,960
Yogi: Very often - Ahh, that's it.

413
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,960
And he's a Catho.. they're Catholic? - Yogi: [FRENCH]

414
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,240
Yogi: Well, You know

415
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,959
Yogi: not really - just registered.

416
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,200
That's how he's catching from them

417
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,200
in the.. Agnya, very badly.

418
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,960
Yogi: [FRENCH]

419
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,960
So, you shouldn't allow him to go too much there now.

420
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,440
Yogi: [FRENCH]

421
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,440
And when he sleeps you put this sindoor on his -

422
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,960
- I'll give you vibrated -

423
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,960
and lemon and chillies - very badly caught up

424
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,960
and he must improve now - Like right now, is the case is just like Wyson

425
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:01,960
Good idea!

426
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:02,960
Hmm!

427
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,000
You be careful about the baby.

428
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,960
otherwise he'll become very adamant - his Agnya is just jutting out -

429
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,160
you can see clearly.

430
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,120

431
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,200

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,960
He'll become very..

433
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,000
Hmm!

434
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,960
So better stop as far as possible, slowly.

435
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,080
Gradually reduce, I mean.

436
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,960
Now, see!

437
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,240

Brass bowl?

481
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,320
Never use it for yogurt.

482
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,760
[UNCLEAR]

483
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,720
Never use brass.

484
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,320
We have a silver one?

485
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,960
You've got yogurt here?

486
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,960

The thing [UNCLEAR] of yogurt.

492
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,960

Yogi: [UNCLEAR] yes, Mother. - Yes.

495
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,120
It's a very simple thing

496
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,960
that yogurt should not be used in that

497
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,960
but you can use it in this one. This is another metal.

498

I don't know what you call this is

499
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,960

What do you say?

512
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,400
Brittle is

513
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,960
something that breaks into little- little pieces.

514
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,960
something that.. - Yogi: [FRENCH] - just the opposite of malleable.

And I must tell you about this Shalivahana dynasty - you can see it

835
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,960

836
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,360
Because they invited Me -

837
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:42,960
where these people now which was destroyed by earthquake.

838
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,120
Another place called as

Yogi: [FRENCH]

841
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:54,080
and where eh.. the one dynasty the

01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,240
one of the

843
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,600
eh.. king which ruled

844
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,200
in Ching

845
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:02,799
so we have seen the court there three years [UNCLEAR]

846
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,960
Yogi: [FRENCH]

847
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,760
And the Nandgaon was

848
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:13,320
used by Shivaji's Mother's side

849
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,560
because they were hounded by

850
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,040
the eh.. by Aurangzeb.

851
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,400
They are called as Jadhavas.

852
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:37,760
Jadhavs.

853
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:43,280
The word comes from Yadav which was Krishna's vansh.

854
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,920
And eh.. so My mother comes from that family

855
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,120
And only Shalivahanas used to

856
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:58,280
only marry Jadhavas or Jadhavas would marry the Shalivahanas.

857
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,960
So now, these people invited Me there

858
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,240
and they have given Me a huge land.

859
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:13,400
They wanted to give Me first 176 acres of land

860
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:16,200
uhh, but I refused to take.

861
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:19,240
So, I just said give Me 11 acres for the time being

862
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,760
in My mother's dynasty

863
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,120
Yogi: A - My mother's place.

864
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,240
That is the place we are going to use to establish our

01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,280
all projects.

866
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,800
Yogi: - for the village development also.

867
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:56,799
And the other one the

868
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:00,080
one in My father's place is 300

869
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:01,960
acres of land

870
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:06,120
and his own, whole place where he lived - they want to give all that to Me.

871
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,320
So, that place which is a

872
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:21,000
the place where they lived, you see , I would like to use it

873
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:22,440
for a music academy

874
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,080
in the name of My father -

875
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,960
for all our sahaja yogies to learn music.

876
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:42,320
And I don't know what to do with the 300 acres so you better give Me idea.

877
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,440
Now, we've got another 30 acres of land

878
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:53,160
near Neera that you've got.

879
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:00,280
Then we have got another land

880
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:04,760
in Poona itself that she has given it to Me personally.

881
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:14,200
Then we have got another land, near Karzat, about 7 acres

882
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,960
Ah.. now, there's one already we have

883
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:26,200
eh.. been given by the government

884
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:29,160
1 acre of land in Sitkorni at Bombay.

885
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:38,400
And one land we had, very beautiful one, of 1 acre of land

886
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:40,240
uh.. they were giving us

887
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,719
but then they discovered that if they give us this land

888
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:49,240
ah.. the, the gentleman, who is the owner, will get about 500 acres of land free.

889
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:53,400
so, they're demanding now give us atleast 10 acres of land for us.

Chief Minister of Maharashtra is anxious to give us the land whatever is given to us.

893
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:14,160
And now, in Delhi also, they have given us a 750

895

Yogi: We're still to do something with it, Mother. - Now we've got the land.

898
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:39,080
This year was the land year -

899
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:40,840
next year will be the building year.

900
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:52,240

901

914

foreign sahaja yogies, all of them,

915
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:45,759
have to donate

916
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:48,480
51 pounds each, in this year, that's all.

917
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:04,960

918
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,960
I can raise the price. - Yogi: [FRENCH]

919
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:11,480
Eh. that is the not very difficult, I hope,

920
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,440
and if it is difficult for some

921
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:17,840
it's all right but - Yogi: [FRENCH]

922
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,880
you see, Indian sahaja yogies

923
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:21,360
have got 8 lakhs

924
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,480
and Delhi sahaja yogies have got 6 lakhs.

925
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,960
Bombay sahaja yogies 8 lakhs - 6 lakhs.

926
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,960
So, it doesn't look nice from all of us to give

927
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:45,240
only

928
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:54,880
and the garland [YOU KNOW?]

929
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:00,440
So, I personally think that you should try to collect 51 pounds each

930
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:12,400
and you give them the account we have, together.

931
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:48,920
