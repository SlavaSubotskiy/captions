1
00:00:02,985 --> 00:00:04,365
It's a great day

2
00:00:05,645 --> 00:00:07,445
for Me to come to Italy

3
00:00:08,345 --> 00:00:09,665
to celebrate

4
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:11,885
Ganesh Puja

5
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:25,135
The nature

6
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:26,445
which we see around

7
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,665
is the blessing of the Ganesha only

8
00:00:29,665 --> 00:00:32,465
because He is the one who prays to the Mother Earth

9
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:34,685
that

10
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:37,645
she should grant her blessings upon

11
00:00:37,645 --> 00:00:38,645
human beings

12
00:00:56,065 --> 00:00:57,315
It is He

13
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,565
who moulds

14
00:01:00,755 --> 00:01:03,275
all the elements of the nature

15
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:14,505
and moulds them to create life.

16
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:22,805
As you call them, these are all carbohydrates.

17
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:32,355
Now the carbohydrates have got carbon and hydrogen.

18
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:40,295
Carbon is coming

19
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,495
from Shri Ganesh

20
00:01:43,055 --> 00:01:45,325
and hydrogen is coming from Mahakali.

21
00:01:52,285 --> 00:01:55,335
And that is how this universe is created

22
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:58,875
in this beautiful way all around us.

23
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:07,575
Now,

24
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:13,195
these carbohydrates need oxygen which is given to us by the Sun,

25
00:02:13,495 --> 00:02:14,665
by the right side.

26
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:28,695
Thus, you know that in the night

27
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:32,065
these trees emit hydrogen

28
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,840
and in the day time they generate oxygen.

29
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,840
This is all the trick of Shri Ganesha who is sitting in between

30
00:02:57,895 --> 00:03:00,215
Now it is He who becomes the Sun.

31
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:07,035
He ascents from the

32
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:09,925
deep down seat

33
00:03:10,795 --> 00:03:12,295
below the Kundalini,

34
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:15,335
rises on the left hand side of Mahakali,

35
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:19,375
goes up and settles in the Surya,

36
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,895
that is the Agnya.

37
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:41,205
So, Mahakali which is the Primordial Energy

38
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:45,925
is absolutely transcended by Him.

39
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:57,255
As the child of Mahakali

40
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,755
He is absolutely dedicated and devoted to Her.

41
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:12,255
And that is how He is the master of the Mahakali power,Lord of.

42
00:04:18,395 --> 00:04:20,915
That means He is the Lord of subconscious mind.

43
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:27,735
He is the Lord of all the 'jadas'.

44
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:29,935
Jada,

45
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:32,165
that is, you can say the dead.

46
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:36,105
Not the dead but 'jada' is the one

47
00:04:36,105 --> 00:04:39,535
matter which has not - matter and the dead.

48
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:45,925
You must understand the word 'jada'.

49
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:51,240
Very important. Jada means all that is the matter which is not moving,

50
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,640
without life.

51
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,880
So He can transcend

52
00:05:05,495 --> 00:05:06,495
this

53
00:05:07,095 --> 00:05:08,355
great power

54
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:12,175
and become the lord of that power

55
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:13,525
by one

56
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,260
very small little wisdom He has.

57
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,940
Now that small little wisdom is

58
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:40,425
surrender.

59
00:05:46,315 --> 00:05:51,765
And the surrender is to be understood in it's proper sense.

60
00:05:56,845 --> 00:05:57,885
Surrender

61
00:05:58,255 --> 00:06:00,665
is signifying,

62
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,540
no giving up anything.

63
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,180
Because whenever you try to give up or take up you are using your ego.

64
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,220
But surrendering means

65
00:06:28,225 --> 00:06:29,965
giving up the ego itself.

66
00:06:37,195 --> 00:06:40,405
So, all the ideas of giving up something

67
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:43,105
or taking in something, disappear.

68
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:56,075
Keep your eyes open because you see I'm talking about

69
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:58,835
the subconscious  and I don't want you to keep your eyes close, that's a sign

70
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,620
of going into subconscious.

71
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,080
This has to be recorded in your conscious mind.

72
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:20,585
Now when we surrender,

73
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:27,065
we have to see how Ritambara Pragnya,

74
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:28,405
which is the power

75
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:32,395
of Mahalakshmi, the essence of Mahalakshmi,

76
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:33,645
how She helps you.

77
00:07:46,895 --> 00:07:49,625
Like situations we should accept

78
00:07:55,535 --> 00:07:58,435
Say, this morning, it was Amavasya,

79
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,445
it's the day when if you worship

80
00:08:03,505 --> 00:08:07,485
Shri Ganesha, it's very deep.So, I wanted to have

81
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:11,895
from the end of Amavasya to start the puja.

82
00:08:26,615 --> 00:08:29,205
Now, that's why the water finished;

83
00:08:29,205 --> 00:08:30,415
it would not start

84
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,400
I could not take my bath.

85
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:47,040
Because I have said- if I had said that we'll have puja at lunch time, many would have felt, "Oh God, now no lunch".

86
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:03,665
But that was the right time to start the puja,

87
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:04,865
so there was no water

88
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,660
and I had to wait for the water.

89
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,320
And a simple thing like that happened

90
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,280
but it achieved

91
00:09:22,335 --> 00:09:24,425
the right time.

92
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:39,275
Now when you start

93
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:41,355
accepting situations,

94
00:09:42,955 --> 00:09:45,955
then you realize that all the situations

95
00:09:45,955 --> 00:09:47,265
are created

96
00:09:48,515 --> 00:09:52,605
not by anything else but Ritambara Pragnya Herself.

97
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:13,895
But ego is such a thing, that it wants to do the way it likes.

98
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:31,595
So people start doing things against the plans of the Divine.

99
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:40,285
And all the time they are in friction

100
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,920
and in trouble, going against.

101
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,700
And thus, they have to take a double speed to fight.

102
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:05,685
But going against the Divine, we are going against our ascent.

103
00:11:12,015 --> 00:11:15,305
These egos develop as a result

104
00:11:15,615 --> 00:11:18,425
of our upbringing, atmosphere

105
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:21,885
and as a natural idea to assert.

106
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:28,095
These as our conditioning and our upbringing

107
00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:33,015
and also as a natural idea we have to assert others.

108
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,960
Natural idea

109
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,840
No assertion, assertion means pressing others,

110
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:11,725
dominating others.

111
00:12:14,185 --> 00:12:17,155
Now this domination part come to us

112
00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:20,715
from the matter because the matter dominates the Spirit.

113
00:12:30,905 --> 00:12:33,815
It dominates us through giving us comfort,

114
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:36,435
false notions, false ideas.

115
00:12:44,995 --> 00:12:47,405
It dominates through our desires

116
00:12:51,195 --> 00:12:53,345
It dominates through lust and greed.

117
00:13:01,065 --> 00:13:03,845
Also it dominates us

118
00:13:04,735 --> 00:13:06,115
through a very

119
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:07,865
subtle way

120
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:11,295
by possessing us through bhoots as we call them.

121
00:13:25,235 --> 00:13:26,985
And this is what

122
00:13:27,385 --> 00:13:28,385
we see how

123
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,635
Shri Ganesha ascended

124
00:13:31,495 --> 00:13:35,965
as Christ to show us how we have to ascend

125
00:13:36,305 --> 00:13:39,255
out of all this mire of matter.

126
00:13:55,825 --> 00:14:01,455
As He is ascending we catch hold of this feet and we also ascend with Him.

127
00:14:10,385 --> 00:14:12,845
Though He is a child, He is very powerful

128
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:15,635
and he can take us to that level

129
00:14:15,745 --> 00:14:18,685
where the Spirit resides.

130
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:31,015
Now the first thing that we have to know is about sex.

131
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:42,285
In the west, sex has become an obsession with people

132
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,900
as if it's a religion.

133
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,500
And if they cannot be sexually active

134
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,295
or if they are not having any sex activities,

135
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:00,425
they think they are all wasted.

136
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:04,165
They are good for nothing.

137
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:15,915
The whole atmosphere is built up like that through your medias, through your televisions

138
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,745
All kinds of things are put in to your head to feel

139
00:15:18,745 --> 00:15:21,460
that your inferior if you are not dealing with sex.

140
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,005
And when we get attached to

141
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:50,465
this kind of a stupid idea that our life is only meant for sex enjoyment,

142
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,700
we start descending downward instead of descending upward.

143
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,060
What is that? Lizard

144
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:09,065
I don't like them very much

145
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,125
Alright, doesn't matter

146
00:16:11,865 --> 00:16:14,565
It's a very different type of a lizard than an Indian

147
00:16:15,155 --> 00:16:16,165
Better looking

148
00:16:17,985 --> 00:16:18,985
Yogi : Smaller

149
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:24,815
Ah, she's green.

150
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,240
You don't get green. Alright so

151
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,500
So, to descend down

152
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:45,755
is very easy,

153
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,375
to fall is the easiest.

154
00:16:49,105 --> 00:16:50,125
And when

155
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,625
the idea of sex all the time hover our mind,

156
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,055
our attention gets so much filled with it,

157
00:16:57,055 --> 00:16:59,625
that even with our eyes, with our thoughts,

158
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:03,265
with our mind, our head, everything it is nothing but

159
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,120
just this filth in our head.

160
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,260
So, for the young people, when they get married

161
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:38,015
the best thing is, they should realize the importance of sex

162
00:17:38,485 --> 00:17:41,635
is not so great.

163
00:17:54,975 --> 00:17:56,405
And they should start

164
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:59,835
understanding that it is not a sin

165
00:17:59,835 --> 00:18:01,595
but it is not also everything.

166
00:18:09,095 --> 00:18:11,675
Then also women must know that

167
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,765
they are on this earth to give

168
00:18:15,475 --> 00:18:18,745
place for the Realized souls to be born.

169
00:18:28,095 --> 00:18:31,475
And in the name of Ganesha, they should have innocent children.

170
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:41,305
But when these Realized sould are born in the west, they do not keep their pure form

171
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:44,235
because the parents are in a funny shape.

172
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:59,455
And though the Ganesha has done all the best

173
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,725
that is possible to get the best children

174
00:19:02,915 --> 00:19:05,665
in the womb of the Realized mothers,

175
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:09,305
they get really absolutely affected.

176
00:19:24,235 --> 00:19:27,295
And we start hurting them by our

177
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:30,595
ill behaviour, by our wrong ideas.

178
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:46,805
So when you are pregnant, one should read Ganesha's stotram,

179
00:19:46,805 --> 00:19:49,735
must do puja of Ganesha and try to remain pure

180
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:51,595
as far as sex is concerned.

181
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:08,785
Moreover, we start thinking about

182
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:10,560
something that is so spontaneous.

183
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,375
What is there to think about it? Just an Indian won't understand this

184
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:27,845
they won't understand in the village what is there to think about sex, it's so spontaneous.

185
00:20:27,845 --> 00:20:29,900
It's like thinking about going to the bathroom.

186
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,920
It's a joyless pursuit and imaginary ideas

187
00:20:58,805 --> 00:21:01,835
So one has to be very very alert,

188
00:21:02,065 --> 00:21:04,765
that we are now saints, we are Yogis

189
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:07,865
and we are not going to waste our energy

190
00:21:07,865 --> 00:21:09,125
in this kind of a joyless pursuit.

191
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:23,865
What is it there?

192
00:21:28,695 --> 00:21:29,695
What's it?

193
00:21:30,325 --> 00:21:31,795
It's a beetle, Ah

194
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:35,065
can't be afraid of beetles.

195
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,900
Alright, now

196
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,920
when we understand our life as so important,

197
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,420
for the imancipation of humanity,

198
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:52,725
for giving light to others,

199
00:21:53,585 --> 00:21:58,945
for saving the whole world from the disaster, it is awaiting

200
00:21:59,605 --> 00:22:00,825
and we realize that.

201
00:22:14,755 --> 00:22:18,055
How can we waste?

202
00:22:18,225 --> 00:22:23,755
How can we waste our energy, our attention into such a

203
00:22:23,755 --> 00:22:25,055
spontaneous thing like that?

204
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,845
Specially for old people

205
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,695
there is no need to think about it anymore, forget it,

206
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:42,865
you are very happy that you are alright there.

207
00:22:43,315 --> 00:22:46,755
Now, just devote your time to something great.

208
00:22:58,655 --> 00:23:00,795
Actually, I miss nothing, whatsoever.

209
00:23:08,335 --> 00:23:09,765
The spiritual joy

210
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:12,095
is so much greater

211
00:23:12,405 --> 00:23:15,665
and it's so eternal that we should not seek all this.

212
00:23:15,665 --> 00:23:19,705
On the contrary, whenever such thoughts come in we should sublimate it.

213
00:23:36,525 --> 00:23:39,985
You will see once you start doing that, your

214
00:23:40,095 --> 00:23:42,885
your sensitivity, your perception

215
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,240
joy will be thousand fold.

216
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:00,840
And gradually

217
00:24:00,845 --> 00:24:02,495
you will get over it

218
00:24:08,895 --> 00:24:10,585
because it is such a

219
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:13,915
temporary pleasure,

220
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,505
that's why people run after it.

221
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:19,345
If it was something of eternal nature, one would not

222
00:24:19,455 --> 00:24:20,455
again go to it.

223
00:24:31,065 --> 00:24:36,195
But it is in human nature, it is natural, so

224
00:24:36,195 --> 00:24:42,165
it is being sanctified and one can have it till you are young.

225
00:24:42,165 --> 00:24:45,595
But then gradually, you must make your pure

226
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,125
existence so purified

227
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:51,675
that they should not enter into your mind at all.

228
00:25:12,555 --> 00:25:19,385
So when you catch hold of the feet of Shri Ganesha, which are very tiny sweet little things,

229
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:22,595
you should know that you should be yourself little lightweight,

230
00:25:22,595 --> 00:25:26,525
otherwise, if you are having all these problems upon yourself,

231
00:25:26,995 --> 00:25:29,505
He wouldn't like and He might just  again

232
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:30,625
throw you down.

233
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,335
And that your attention should be purified by attention towards Shri Ganesh

234
00:25:59,695 --> 00:26:02,495
Only people who are

235
00:26:02,495 --> 00:26:05,265
this kind really also enjoy sex,

236
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:08,255
otherwise they cannot because they have so many perversions in their heads,

237
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,600
I don't know what are they upto.

238
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,720
And that is why

239
00:26:25,965 --> 00:26:27,235
they rise above,

240
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:32,135
that is why they get fed up with it

241
00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:33,405
after sometime.

242
00:26:43,015 --> 00:26:48,485
And they mature properly in their own age, otherwise you will find even

243
00:26:48,485 --> 00:26:49,895
eighty years old people

244
00:26:50,705 --> 00:26:53,575
shaking their hand on their sticks you see,

245
00:26:53,785 --> 00:26:56,165
still looking at young girls,

246
00:26:56,165 --> 00:26:57,355
it's something I cannot understand.

247
00:27:11,785 --> 00:27:13,665
And they look so stupid,

248
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:16,045
they look so stupid.

249
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,560
Everybody laughs at them.

250
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,600
And young people make fun of them.

251
00:27:27,555 --> 00:27:30,795
But they feel as if they have become

252
00:27:30,795 --> 00:27:33,655
something like a hero or

253
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:35,805
in that old age suddenly.

254
00:27:43,485 --> 00:27:45,545
Like they showed once a

255
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:47,875
film

256
00:27:48,565 --> 00:27:52,025
of all the very, very old eighty, eighty above,

257
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:55,875
actors and actresses coming to do shake dance

258
00:27:56,205 --> 00:27:58,915
in a party. To do shake dance

259
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,600
in a party.

260
00:28:11,615 --> 00:28:14,045
And from the limousine, they got down

261
00:28:14,045 --> 00:28:15,605
since then they were shaking.

262
00:28:21,215 --> 00:28:27,405
And when they came and tried to show they were very much in love and all that, looking

263
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:32,065
so stupid that those who watched them were laughing and were rolling with laughter.

264
00:28:47,165 --> 00:28:49,565
It is so ridiculously clownish,

265
00:28:50,445 --> 00:28:52,995
but they said we are honest.

266
00:29:07,385 --> 00:29:09,775
So even if you do these things

267
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:16,100
openly or with secrecy or whichever way you do it, it's stupid.

268
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,200
And that is how,

269
00:29:26,705 --> 00:29:29,965
when you are not matured of your age

270
00:29:30,825 --> 00:29:33,725
you are not respected by your children,respected by

271
00:29:33,725 --> 00:29:38,015
anybody who is younger. He thinks you are stupid because you are not matured enough.

272
00:29:48,975 --> 00:29:51,855
Now when the fruits are

273
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:54,015
in the flower form,

274
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:58,745
that time all the fertilization takes place.

275
00:29:59,795 --> 00:30:03,015
Then at the fruit time they grow as fruits and not as flowers anymore.

276
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:19,335
Flowers become fruits

277
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:24,015
At the time of flower stage, there is fertilization,

278
00:30:24,015 --> 00:30:27,425
but not at the time of fruit, you see. Fruit trys to grow

279
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,920
Fertilization is where they

280
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,320
So this is what,

281
00:30:58,325 --> 00:31:01,295
that maturity is very important

282
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:06,080
to reach, that is only possible if you really catch hold of the feet of Shri Ganesh.

283
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,045
So you remain innocent even in your old age.

284
00:31:29,695 --> 00:31:32,565
With all this understanding,

285
00:31:33,235 --> 00:31:36,065
Shri Ganesha gives us wisdom

286
00:31:36,885 --> 00:31:38,485
by which we mature.

287
00:31:45,055 --> 00:31:46,055
So that thing is there

288
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:48,305
in the room, I think I have got that thing

289
00:31:48,805 --> 00:31:51,055
decoration.

290
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:54,425
Now the people

291
00:31:55,805 --> 00:31:58,745
who are indulging into lust

292
00:31:59,405 --> 00:32:00,425
have to

293
00:32:00,925 --> 00:32:05,065
see that they mature in their understanding.

294
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:18,615
Then the people who are too much possessive

295
00:32:19,735 --> 00:32:24,675
of their things, of their possessions, of their

296
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:35,360
children must also understand that Shri Ganesha gives us wisdom

297
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,820
to understand,

298
00:32:37,845 --> 00:32:40,375
that this is not yours.

299
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:06,340
So what is carbon is nothing but a burnt wood, that is

300
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,200
everything is burnt away.

301
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,920
The wisdom that you get

302
00:33:21,155 --> 00:33:27,435
is that everything that you see as your own is not yours.

303
00:33:27,635 --> 00:33:34,095
Everything you have to leave here and go away. You can't take even this paper with you.

304
00:33:49,785 --> 00:33:52,075
So why are we attached to them,

305
00:33:52,585 --> 00:33:58,345
let us use it for its own purpose for expressing our joy.

306
00:34:08,095 --> 00:34:10,085
Now, I'll give you a very

307
00:34:11,595 --> 00:34:12,965
beautiful example.

308
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:19,765
See now how Ritambara Pragnya works.

309
00:34:24,325 --> 00:34:26,685
See, this necklace that you see

310
00:34:26,685 --> 00:34:28,500
was made in Italy

311
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,880
by some realized soul.

312
00:34:39,675 --> 00:34:40,675
Then,

313
00:34:41,475 --> 00:34:43,055
this necklace,

314
00:34:43,955 --> 00:34:47,105
I don't know how it went to India.

315
00:34:53,705 --> 00:34:54,705
Now,

316
00:34:55,485 --> 00:34:58,565
the Australians wanted to give me

317
00:34:58,865 --> 00:34:59,865
a

318
00:35:00,255 --> 00:35:01,615
Mangal sutra of

319
00:35:02,145 --> 00:35:04,235
diamond like this, the other one I have.

320
00:35:12,165 --> 00:35:15,235
And they had collected ten thousand rupees,

321
00:35:15,295 --> 00:35:18,555
but even half of this size we could not buy

322
00:35:18,555 --> 00:35:21,685
because there was only one shop open on a sunday.

323
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:23,315
situation

324
00:35:35,455 --> 00:35:38,455
So I looked around and I found

325
00:35:38,455 --> 00:35:41,485
a very nice gold Mangal sutra

326
00:35:41,485 --> 00:35:46,415
made out of coral because Australia is Ganesha's land.

327
00:36:03,165 --> 00:36:06,185
I felt tremendous vibrations around,

328
00:36:06,185 --> 00:36:07,915
so I went on the back

329
00:36:09,445 --> 00:36:12,385
because they said, "it is very cheap". So, I said, " alright"

330
00:36:12,585 --> 00:36:14,915
And there this was placed

331
00:36:14,915 --> 00:36:17,025
and these earrings there.

332
00:36:17,455 --> 00:36:19,435
So, we bought all these,

333
00:36:20,115 --> 00:36:22,505
plus the Mangal sutra,

334
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:25,475
plus one more piece which I have in coral

335
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:26,475
in the same amount.

336
00:36:48,335 --> 00:36:51,425
It's not yet finished,

337
00:36:51,515 --> 00:36:54,085
then it was misplaced

338
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:56,925
in Australia,it went into my box

339
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:59,795
which was to come to London.

340
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,360
So, I couldn't bring it to London

341
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,640
Now, Thelma came

342
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:26,945
from Australia

343
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:29,575
and she brought it with her

344
00:37:29,575 --> 00:37:32,605
and it is now in Italy

345
00:37:32,605 --> 00:37:33,605
by the artist

346
00:37:34,025 --> 00:37:36,805
whose spirit could be seeing this

347
00:37:37,395 --> 00:37:40,345
to gratify him, not only that,

348
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:43,805
but also that it is the day of Shri Ganesh

349
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,380
from Australia.

350
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,960
Yes, from Australia,

351
00:38:10,995 --> 00:38:13,955
this is sent as your brothers,

352
00:38:13,955 --> 00:38:17,075
the thing they bought made in Italy,

353
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,600
on the day of Shri Ganesh. Can you have more combinations?

354
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,020
Your brothers and sisters

355
00:38:51,135 --> 00:38:53,995
from Ganesha's place, you see, the Ganas

356
00:38:54,455 --> 00:38:56,115
have sent it to

357
00:38:56,515 --> 00:38:57,625
Devas here

358
00:38:58,495 --> 00:39:01,635
for the celebration, you are the Devas and they are the Ganas.

359
00:39:19,635 --> 00:39:20,635
And these are ten,

360
00:39:22,335 --> 00:39:24,745
ten, eleven and twelve.

361
00:39:25,315 --> 00:39:28,035
So this represents the heart,

362
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,515
the dharma, ten

363
00:39:32,885 --> 00:39:33,885
and all

364
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,200
put together is the heart.

365
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,800
The whole of Europe

366
00:39:52,435 --> 00:39:55,825
and in addition to these two is the twelve, it's the heart : England.

367
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:06,985
All are represented here

368
00:40:10,985 --> 00:40:13,975
Now you should be able to read through

369
00:40:14,655 --> 00:40:17,665
the beautiful working of

370
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,825
Ritambara Pragnya which is very subtle.

371
00:40:20,235 --> 00:40:22,845
And then you'll start enjoying the little, little things

372
00:40:22,845 --> 00:40:25,695
it plays to make you very happy

373
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:30,185
and to give you what some artist must have done it long time back,

374
00:40:31,285 --> 00:40:33,105
which his desire was

375
00:40:33,495 --> 00:40:34,495
to fulfill.

376
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,325
No, this is also we should say,

377
00:41:02,325 --> 00:41:03,780
is the work of Shri Ganesha.

378
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:15,220
He resides as Omkara in the Ritambara Pragnya.

379
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:26,625
He resides on the electromagnetic forces as the vibrations in the matter,

380
00:41:33,385 --> 00:41:34,385
in every atom.

381
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:44,520
He resides in every ripple of our emotions which gives us joy.

382
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,460
And he resides

383
00:42:03,745 --> 00:42:06,905
as a beautiful decoration of the Kundalini because

384
00:42:06,905 --> 00:42:09,825
she has the red and gold colour just like my sari.

385
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,400
So, as the colour of Kundalini he resides.

386
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,140
But at Sahastrara,

387
00:42:30,765 --> 00:42:33,295
he becomes the joy.

388
00:42:38,385 --> 00:42:41,365
At Muladhara as the fragrance,

389
00:42:46,175 --> 00:42:49,115
and every memory of mine

390
00:42:49,115 --> 00:42:52,505
should give you fragrance because he is the Lord of memory.

391
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:04,735
So, this is how he manages everything

392
00:43:04,735 --> 00:43:06,205
so beautifully.

393
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,125
He is such a innocent

394
00:43:16,425 --> 00:43:18,865
person who plays around

395
00:43:19,105 --> 00:43:20,105
his beauty

396
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,780
to make us happy.

397
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,915
Our children should also make us very happy

398
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,300
if we have brought them up properly.

399
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,180
But if we have been

400
00:43:46,185 --> 00:43:48,875
all the time busy with lust and greed,

401
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,040
the children cannot be good children.

402
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,400
They cannot represent

403
00:44:04,705 --> 00:44:06,855
Ganesha tatwa as it should be.

404
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:17,435
So, today is a great day

405
00:44:17,435 --> 00:44:20,275
that we are establishing Shri Ganesha

406
00:44:20,275 --> 00:44:21,545
in Italy.

407
00:44:30,955 --> 00:44:33,205
We did this in Switzerland

408
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:34,940
and now in Italy.

409
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,940
This should give you

410
00:44:42,105 --> 00:44:43,515
the power of innocence,

411
00:44:43,965 --> 00:44:46,925
the power of purity,

412
00:44:46,925 --> 00:44:47,925
the power of wisdom.

413
00:44:58,255 --> 00:45:01,405
It should give you the art of playfulness of joy.

414
00:45:13,815 --> 00:45:20,745
And that special quality of turning everything into something

415
00:45:20,935 --> 00:45:21,935
fragrant.

416
00:45:29,755 --> 00:45:30,755
May God bless you all.
