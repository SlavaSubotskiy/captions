1
00:21:48,231 --> 00:21:54,161
Warren’s words have really moved my heart,
and if England is my heart, England should

2
00:21:54,161 --> 00:22:09,331
also feel moved: that’s the spirit of Shri
Ganesh.

3
00:22:09,331 --> 00:22:22,231
And I must say that I have seen so many things
in Warren, which are very heartening.

4
00:22:22,231 --> 00:22:37,191
Whenever I have felt desperate about things,
you see, seeing him I felt I must do something

5
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:54,430
more, because he really loves me very much,
I have seen that, with complete selfless dedication.

6
00:22:54,430 --> 00:23:09,201
But dedication is a word which doesn’t have
that beauty of love.

7
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:18,981
I mean if I’m sitting down he’ll immediately
worry if I have got the tea, or if I need

8
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:25,780
some heating, or little things here and there,
and I watch — I’m surprised.

9
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:34,460
Like any other Sahaj Yogi he’ll be jumping
up here and there and finding out things to

10
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,621
adjust.

11
00:23:36,621 --> 00:23:48,710
And even if I really once say that, “Maybe,”
he just doesn’t do it, just doesn’t do

12
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,710
it.

13
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,921
He said, “That’s it, settled!”

14
00:23:50,921 --> 00:23:56,031
I have never seen him asking me to give him
time to meet him, never.

15
00:23:56,031 --> 00:24:02,630
Not even once he said, “Mother I must come
and see you!” nothing, never!

16
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:12,711
I have not known how much money he spent all
throughout his trip.

17
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:15,351
I don’t know, really.

18
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:21,401
And I was wanting somebody to say that, “Mother
we must pay for his travel!” because he’s

19
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:25,651
really spent all his money.

20
00:24:25,651 --> 00:24:31,211
And I was happy that David brought this point
to me, I was very happy.

21
00:24:31,211 --> 00:24:46,630
One thing I feel [is] that you cannot ask
for love, that’s something you cannot do.

22
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:56,061
It’s a very difficult thing to ask somebody
to love, but that, I think, is the point one

23
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,220
should see.

24
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:08,160
When you think of Shri Ganesh, you just have
to know that He loves the Mother so much that

25
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:15,213
even a slightest hint, He knows what I want,
He knows.

26
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:19,951
He knows me too well.

27
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:34,041
He’s not at all so compassionate as myself,
because He cannot forgive those who try to

28
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:36,701
insult me, He cannot.

29
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:42,061
Those who try to cheat me, those who try to
be arrogant or egoistical.

30
00:25:42,061 --> 00:25:47,500
He doesn’t, he doesn’t believe in that,
He cannot.

31
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,500
He wants to punish.

32
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:54,151
He’s ready to punish, very anxious to punish
such people.

33
00:25:54,151 --> 00:25:55,651
But if I say, “No.

34
00:25:55,651 --> 00:25:58,811
Spare him,” He listens to me.

35
00:25:58,811 --> 00:26:07,391
That’s His quality: He cannot bear anything
against me, cannot bear!

36
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:15,091
And left to Him, I think I don’t know how
many Sahaj Yogis would have been there.

37
00:26:15,091 --> 00:26:20,001
Even to say, “No Mother!” itself, He cuts
you out on that point.

38
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:28,721
But I don’t want that it should happen,
because He doesn’t know that you are still

39
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:35,781
needing help, and attention, and tremendous
compassion.

40
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:42,231
But you can only know your Mother through
shraddha, through faith.

41
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:46,181
And what he says is true.

42
00:26:46,181 --> 00:26:47,881
And why this faith?

43
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:54,791
I mean you see miracles every day, not only
today: such games, such play, such things

44
00:26:54,791 --> 00:27:01,321
going on; how I have been able to express
myself slowly.

45
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:03,401
I don’t want to give you any shocks.

46
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:18,621
So in a very beautiful manner I have tried
to bring forth the play of the Divine.

47
00:27:18,621 --> 00:27:26,651
But I feel that, even now, people get into
arguments: if I say, “No, this won’t work

48
00:27:26,651 --> 00:27:27,651
out.

49
00:27:27,651 --> 00:27:32,581
That’s not good,” I have to spend at least
four, five hours going round and round and

50
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:39,171
bringing the point to the heads of people
that, “No, that’s not good, that won’t

51
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:40,521
help you."

52
00:27:40,521 --> 00:27:42,581
But once I asked him, “How is it you are
so obedient?”

53
00:27:42,581 --> 00:27:46,091
I mean, whatever I say he, just he gets a
hint, he’ll agree.

54
00:27:46,091 --> 00:27:51,131
He said, “Mother I once learned a lesson:
that’s my own marriage.

55
00:27:51,131 --> 00:27:56,721
And you didn’t say no, but you did say to
me that, ‘If it makes you happy.’

56
00:27:56,721 --> 00:28:01,421
you didn’t say, ‘It will make you joyous,’
and I have learned a lesson from that."

57
00:28:01,421 --> 00:28:04,861
But we don’t learn our lessons is [what]
the point is.

58
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:13,141
We don’t learn our lessons.

59
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:18,861
We argue: that comes from ego.

60
00:28:18,861 --> 00:28:23,031
If we have superego we, we make others mad!

61
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:31,181
Like somebody came from America and he was
just mad that he must come and see me.

62
00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:33,261
And I’m so busy, I have no time, you know
that.

63
00:28:33,261 --> 00:28:35,531
I have to correct this book, I have to correct
that book.

64
00:28:35,531 --> 00:28:39,041
Now we have to do this Advent, and that is
to be done.

65
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:43,521
I have to look after my household, and this
and that.

66
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:46,171
I am so busy.

67
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:49,331
But the person really made them mad, that
he must see me!

68
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:53,141
Now if you come from America, that doesn’t
mean that you must see me, because you never

69
00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:54,331
took time with me.

70
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:56,431
I am busy here now.

71
00:28:56,431 --> 00:29:03,751
When I went to America, it’s all right,
which is true.

72
00:29:03,751 --> 00:29:10,471
And we do not realise that what we are doing
[is] that we don’t love Mother, we don’t

73
00:29:10,471 --> 00:29:11,471
love Her.

74
00:29:11,471 --> 00:29:17,231
We think of our needs, our impressions, our
talking, it’s a fact.

75
00:29:17,231 --> 00:29:22,251
Like somebody I asked, “All right you speak,
you are a good speaker."

76
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:26,351
All right, the person starts speaking, and
he becomes egoistical.

77
00:29:26,351 --> 00:29:31,761
How can you be?

78
00:29:31,761 --> 00:29:35,521
If you just start giving a good speech, you
become egoistical.

79
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:38,381
Somebody made good photographs, so I said,
“These are good photographs."

80
00:29:38,381 --> 00:29:39,381
He becomes egoistical!

81
00:29:39,381 --> 00:29:42,891
You cannot praise anyone in this country — it’s
the worst thing [for them].

82
00:29:42,891 --> 00:29:43,901
He says, “Agnya is clear."

83
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:47,581
I don’t know what sort of an Agnya is clear
here! you cannot praise.

84
00:29:47,581 --> 00:29:48,761
I mean I try to be nice.

85
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:50,931
I say, “Oh your photographs are very nice."

86
00:29:50,931 --> 00:29:54,191
Immediately the person becomes egoistical.

87
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:58,201
You give some work to someone, “All right
you do this work, postering."

88
00:29:58,201 --> 00:30:01,111
Somebody is doing that: his ego goes up!

89
00:30:01,111 --> 00:30:02,111
What is this?

90
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:03,961
Like a balloon?

91
00:30:03,961 --> 00:30:05,911
There’s no depth.

92
00:30:05,911 --> 00:30:07,851
There’s no gravity.

93
00:30:07,851 --> 00:30:09,151
Now why?

94
00:30:09,151 --> 00:30:10,151
This is the question.

95
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:13,271
He asked me many a times, “Why it happens
Mother?”

96
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:19,580
The reason is — I told them the other day,
I think they have a tape on this; you can

97
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:25,621
go through that — a simple thing is that,
that we have lived a superficial life here.

98
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:29,080
We are superficial people.

99
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:36,641
Because the society is such, this machine
has made us like this, and we have read books.

100
00:30:36,641 --> 00:30:37,840
We have pampered egos.

101
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,051
Our forefathers went and fought in other countries
thinking no end of themselves.

102
00:30:42,051 --> 00:30:44,400
Then we had this war.

103
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:50,101
With the war we became also nonsensical, either
aggressive, or we have become with superego.

104
00:30:50,101 --> 00:30:51,351
We have bhoots.

105
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:53,460
We have conditionings.

106
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,700
All these things are there.

107
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,510
We are not our genuine self, is the point.

108
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:07,531
So I think the being that is going to be enlightened
by your Spirit is covered with ego, and on

109
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:12,281
top of that is a sheen of that superficial
being that you are.

110
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:15,421
So Mother says [something] — “All right!”

111
00:31:15,421 --> 00:31:17,460
Mother did this — ”All right!”

112
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,831
Nothing goes inside I feel.

113
00:31:20,831 --> 00:31:24,090
There’s no love.

114
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,931
If you are in love with someone, even if the
person is in that vicinity anywhere…you

115
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:31,700
know Mother is in London, just think, “Mother
is in London."

116
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,700
Just think!

117
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,741
If you love me, just think.

118
00:31:34,741 --> 00:31:42,391
What a happy thought it is: “She’s in
England!”

119
00:31:42,391 --> 00:31:49,551
It’s a happy thought.

120
00:31:49,551 --> 00:31:50,551
Think on those lines.

121
00:31:50,551 --> 00:31:56,590
But it does not work out because that genuine
thing, the genuine thing that is inside, is

122
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,171
covered with ego or superego.

123
00:31:59,171 --> 00:32:01,971
your bhoots are in between.

124
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:07,650
So what happens [is] that you live with that
superficial nonsense.

125
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,650
Nothing goes inside.

126
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:13,801
It’s all [at] that level.

127
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:18,691
You ask anyone, they’ll say, “I’m all
right.

128
00:32:18,691 --> 00:32:20,621
I’m like this."

129
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:21,621
Why?

130
00:32:21,621 --> 00:32:23,700
Nothing goes inside, why?

131
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,051
Because, the genuine self is lost.

132
00:32:28,051 --> 00:32:32,471
What is going to enlighten you is not your
artificial thing.

133
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:42,101
You know artificial fibre, if you have artificial
fibre, it doesn’t penetrate anything.

134
00:32:42,101 --> 00:32:47,161
It can penetrate into everything, but nothing
can penetrate into it.

135
00:32:47,161 --> 00:32:54,281
Like that, that artificial thing on us, and
we live with it, all the time.

136
00:32:54,281 --> 00:32:59,510
Now why he said about Maharashtra [is] because
Maharashtrians are not exposed to artificiality,

137
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,941
they don’t know what is artificiality.

138
00:33:00,941 --> 00:33:05,721
People think they are stupid, they are foolish,
they are no good for business, they are not

139
00:33:05,721 --> 00:33:08,250
good for this, they are not good for that.

140
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:14,650
But the main thing is that their genuine being
is not covered with any nonsenses: “I am

141
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,791
something!”

142
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:21,221
I have never seen Warren feeling that way,
and that’s something surprising.

143
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:27,960
I have never seen him feeling that he’s
important, that he should be near me, he should

144
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,271
be in my company — never!

145
00:33:29,271 --> 00:33:35,090
Never even I have heard him anywhere around.

146
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,770
I have to call for him.

147
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:44,370
Unless and until I call him, he’ll never
come before me.

148
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:50,510
He wants to see if I need him, otherwise he’s
not bothered.

149
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:55,881
He just feels that I’m around, “Mother
is somewhere."

150
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:59,411
Unless and until [I call him].

151
00:33:59,411 --> 00:34:02,991
But if I tell him, “Warren I want…”
wherever he may be, he’ll just rush and

152
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:03,991
come.

153
00:34:03,991 --> 00:34:04,991
It’s a very good example for you.

154
00:34:04,991 --> 00:34:06,900
I am happy there are some examples of this
kind.

155
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:14,171
There are many others; I am not saying it’s
only Warren.

156
00:34:14,171 --> 00:34:20,361
And then, if you take up any responsibility
in Sahaj Yoga, then you start thinking you

157
00:34:20,361 --> 00:34:24,640
are great, you are a great Sahaj Yogi: you
have done this, you have put the postering,

158
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,210
you have done this.

159
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:33,640
This shows the calibre, shows the calibre.

160
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:41,801
People from absolutely dead conditions have
risen so high, and while people from quite

161
00:34:41,801 --> 00:34:46,551
normal conditions are nowhere there, just
they are just there, why?

162
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:47,551
The Calibre.

163
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:49,671
Now everybody has that calibre.

164
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:53,250
What I am trying to say: every one of us have
the calibre.

165
00:34:53,250 --> 00:35:04,661
But it is not evident in everyone because
the amount of covering they have.

166
00:35:04,661 --> 00:35:10,101
Everybody has capacity to love, everyone has
capacity.

167
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:15,601
But if you have covered yourself completely
with artificiality you cannot love.

168
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:18,921
Now if you ask me, “Mother, how to love?”

169
00:35:18,921 --> 00:35:21,671
what am I to tell you?

170
00:35:21,671 --> 00:35:23,830
I love you, no doubt.

171
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,291
I love all of you.

172
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,351
I love you very much.

173
00:35:29,351 --> 00:35:31,191
I am bothered about you.

174
00:35:31,191 --> 00:35:37,301
But what I find then, when I am bothered about
somebody, that person starts taking advantage.

175
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:45,601
I don’t mind [if you] take advantage, but
by taking advantage that person goes down

176
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,791
completely.

177
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:54,361
If I am bothered about something, then [that]
one immediately starts thinking they are very

178
00:35:54,361 --> 00:36:01,051
important, that, “Mother is so much bothered
about me!”

179
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:11,890
Now try to understand that this is a country
which is my heart, is my heart itself.

180
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:18,130
And Sahastrara is nothing else but it’s
heart.

181
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:25,041
Have you noticed how it is nicely managed
already that, if Kundalini has to break, it

182
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:29,070
has to break through the heart chakra?

183
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:34,770
If your heart is not all right, it cannot
break, your Kundalini at Sahastrara.

184
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,960
Have you seen that?

185
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:49,380
That the Brahmarandhra, the last opening,
is on the heart chakra.

186
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,691
I know everyone very well.

187
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:54,171
There are people who are mediums with us.

188
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:57,001
I know that.

189
00:36:57,001 --> 00:37:00,330
But they don’t know they’ll go to Hell.

190
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:05,471
It’s a very dangerous time you are in — be
careful!

191
00:37:05,471 --> 00:37:15,661
And that makes me feel even worse when I think
that they don’t know on what horrible times

192
00:37:15,661 --> 00:37:22,361
your feet are dangling.

193
00:37:22,361 --> 00:37:25,241
So don’t play games!

194
00:37:25,241 --> 00:37:34,140
I know English language has its own styles
and things, English mannerism has its own

195
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,911
ways, methods.

196
00:37:35,911 --> 00:37:41,691
Forget that you are English!|

197
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:48,700
That’s the best way.

198
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:54,070
English think that, “We are different people.

199
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:59,551
We are of the heart you see — great people!”

200
00:37:59,551 --> 00:38:03,250
In Italy I told one journalist lady who had
come, very good lady.

201
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:07,430
She said, “Mother one thing I didn’t like
the sentence you said that, ‘England is

202
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,460
the heart.’

203
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,161
Agh, how can it be?

204
00:38:12,161 --> 00:38:13,161
Horrible?”

205
00:38:13,161 --> 00:38:15,851
She couldn’t believe it.

206
00:38:15,851 --> 00:38:20,650
She said, “Only because you said I tolerate
it, but anybody else saying it I would not

207
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:21,851
tolerate!”

208
00:38:21,851 --> 00:38:35,210
So how far we have gone down as English, you
must see the reputation of English abroad.

209
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:40,541
And advancement we have made is to reach the
status of punk rocks!

210
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:53,551
So when there is such a situation in a country,
how serious we have to be about it.

211
00:38:53,551 --> 00:38:57,911
Because this country is going to save the
world or is going to mar the world, because

212
00:38:57,911 --> 00:38:59,841
it is at the Sahastrara.

213
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:02,461
Where Mother is to be accepted.

214
00:39:02,461 --> 00:39:10,561
Whether Mother is to be settled and worshipped
and adored.

215
00:39:10,561 --> 00:39:20,071
But do we have that seriousness of understanding
that we are born at a time when the responsibility

216
00:39:20,071 --> 00:39:21,711
is much more on us?

217
00:39:21,711 --> 00:39:25,681
We don’t realise that we are born in the
heart, means our responsibility is much, much

218
00:39:25,681 --> 00:39:31,301
more than other people have.

219
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:38,671
On the contrary, “We are born on the heart,
so we are great people!” — finished!

220
00:39:38,671 --> 00:39:47,671
There are certain things which you follow,
simple things, is going to help you.

221
00:39:47,671 --> 00:39:54,131
The other day I met somebody who had a nonsensical
thing like a Hamsa [catch].

222
00:39:54,131 --> 00:39:56,191
I said, “Hamsa, how can you have?

223
00:39:56,191 --> 00:39:57,571
Are you putting oil everyday?

224
00:39:57,571 --> 00:39:59,081
Are you putting ghee everyday?”

225
00:39:59,081 --> 00:40:00,111
He said, “No!”

226
00:40:00,111 --> 00:40:04,221
I said, “Why?

227
00:40:04,221 --> 00:40:10,291
Is a simple thing like that, why don’t you
do everyday?”

228
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:11,641
“Mother is here.

229
00:40:11,641 --> 00:40:15,671
She’ll look after us."

230
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:22,311
The responsibility is not felt because there’s
no seriousness about it! you don’t know!

231
00:40:22,311 --> 00:40:31,091
The job is great, you can do it, you have
the calibre.

232
00:40:31,091 --> 00:40:33,211
face yourself up, every one of you.

233
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:34,801
It’s not facing others.

234
00:40:34,801 --> 00:40:37,131
face yourself up!

235
00:40:37,131 --> 00:40:49,521
And I find, really I must say Italians, really
I must say what Warren says, is true, it’s

236
00:40:49,521 --> 00:40:52,171
true.

237
00:40:52,171 --> 00:40:58,701
We have Antonio with us in the house, I see:
He’s very different from all other English

238
00:40:58,701 --> 00:40:59,851
people.

239
00:40:59,851 --> 00:41:03,301
He’s very different.

240
00:41:03,301 --> 00:41:07,641
He’s so balanced, he’s so much there.

241
00:41:07,641 --> 00:41:13,011
Then, then there are some people, funny people,
I have seen, they have been with us, so far,

242
00:41:13,011 --> 00:41:16,611
so: They will go and do this course, they
will go to this, that.

243
00:41:16,611 --> 00:41:18,921
It’s nonsense going on all the time!

244
00:41:18,921 --> 00:41:21,931
And one person like that can spoil all of
them.

245
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:26,941
We have so many stupid people on the periphery
in Sahaj Yoga in England.

246
00:41:26,941 --> 00:41:30,561
We do not have so many numbers anywhere else
on the periphery.

247
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:36,231
We have tremendous people, as well as some
people who are really horrid.

248
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:43,991
I was trying to make a black list everywhere,
and we had the maximum number in England!

249
00:41:43,991 --> 00:41:50,151
Maximum number in England.

250
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:55,461
Now when I am going and leaving you here,
you see my heart wrenches really sometimes,

251
00:41:55,461 --> 00:41:57,471
because I know you are not yet matured enough.

252
00:41:57,471 --> 00:41:59,941
But why not mature?

253
00:41:59,941 --> 00:42:07,981
Because there’s no seriousness about it.

254
00:42:07,981 --> 00:42:10,901
Then they will come, “We need a leader,
somebody."

255
00:42:10,901 --> 00:42:11,901
Why?

256
00:42:11,901 --> 00:42:16,801
Why do you want somebody to hit you on your
head all the time, to tell you things like

257
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:17,801
that?

258
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,681
With your own dignity, why not come up?

259
00:42:19,681 --> 00:42:26,901
Now I am going, you all have to work it out.

260
00:42:26,901 --> 00:42:33,031
So when you go to India, even Indians say
that English are the worst.

261
00:42:33,031 --> 00:42:34,961
There’s the certificate.

262
00:42:34,961 --> 00:42:40,831
And you have to be the best people, better
than even Australians!

263
00:42:40,831 --> 00:42:45,871
They’re so simple.

264
00:42:45,871 --> 00:42:48,711
Because now we are at Sahastrara, working
at Sahastrara.

265
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:50,951
Do you see?

266
00:42:50,951 --> 00:42:53,951
Why I have to say all these things?

267
00:42:53,951 --> 00:43:02,591
Because you are born, you are born in this
country.

268
00:43:02,591 --> 00:43:06,171
You are the people.

269
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:09,491
But whatever I say is, “Mother speaks very
well.

270
00:43:09,491 --> 00:43:11,281
Let’s have a tape.

271
00:43:11,281 --> 00:43:13,251
All right, very nice to hear!

272
00:43:13,251 --> 00:43:15,851
It’s a great entertainment you know, Mother
is talking!

273
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:17,311
She talks very well."

274
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:20,241
[But] it doesn’t go inside, anything!

275
00:43:20,241 --> 00:43:21,241
It doesn’t go.

276
00:43:21,241 --> 00:43:32,231
It’s like a plastic on top, complete plastic
cover.

277
00:43:32,231 --> 00:43:40,871
So one has to learn certain things, a few
things, like Vishuddhi Chakra: now English

278
00:43:40,871 --> 00:43:43,941
don’t talk, but they move their heads too
much.

279
00:43:43,941 --> 00:43:51,071
If they say yes, they’ll go on saying yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

280
00:43:51,071 --> 00:43:52,651
All the time their necks are moving.

281
00:43:52,651 --> 00:43:58,231
I mean they have long necks, and they must
go on moving their necks all the time.

282
00:43:58,231 --> 00:44:02,001
There’s no need.

283
00:44:02,001 --> 00:44:06,661
Why to bend your neck so much?

284
00:44:06,661 --> 00:44:12,651
Even if they say something, “Yes, yes, yes,
yes."

285
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:16,721
Like they’ll say, “Today’s programme
went very well."

286
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:17,761
“Yes, yes, yes!”

287
00:44:17,761 --> 00:44:20,701
Themselves certifying it.

288
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:28,981
But they don’t see, because they don’t
want to see it, that’s Vishuddhi Chakra.

289
00:44:28,981 --> 00:44:33,461
You don’t talk, because when you talk, horrible
things come out, so you’re so afraid of

290
00:44:33,461 --> 00:44:36,221
talking that you just don’t talk.

291
00:44:36,221 --> 00:44:39,921
But talk to yourself on the mirror, talk to
yourself.

292
00:44:39,921 --> 00:44:45,411
See how you can respect, how you can be kind,
how you could be nice.

293
00:44:45,411 --> 00:44:56,761
But no, the practice is more of sarcasm, more
of saying harsh things, horrible things, and

294
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:59,981
that’s it.

295
00:44:59,981 --> 00:45:04,911
It should have, I know is a flair, it should
have a beautiful thing.

296
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,561
It should not be serious sermon, no.

297
00:45:07,561 --> 00:45:11,331
But say something sweet and nice.

298
00:45:11,331 --> 00:45:19,861
It’s so evident when I say something sweet.

299
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:32,331
Like the other day, we were in France, and
I asked Guido, “You’d better speak in

300
00:45:32,331 --> 00:45:35,571
Italian and somebody should translate you."

301
00:45:35,571 --> 00:45:42,131
On the way I was just thinking, “Who will
translate Guido, because somebody who knows

302
00:45:42,131 --> 00:45:48,011
French and Italian well, who will do that?”

303
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:53,261
And when I entered the hall I saw Ruth you
see, standing there with her.

304
00:45:53,261 --> 00:45:54,522
I had not seen her.

305
00:45:54,522 --> 00:45:56,621
I didn’t know she was there.

306
00:45:56,621 --> 00:45:57,811
She had come all the way.

307
00:45:57,811 --> 00:46:03,511
And all the way she’s run from there, and
now she’s holding in her hand this mic,

308
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,371
and she is holding fort.

309
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:11,421
You know, my heart became so large, and I
really felt like embracing her.

310
00:46:11,421 --> 00:46:16,721
And the eyes you see, spoke what I felt.

311
00:46:16,721 --> 00:46:18,831
The way she came round you see, she was there.

312
00:46:18,831 --> 00:46:22,041
I was worried who will translate and there
she was.

313
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:31,711
you see I also get help like this, when people
love me I know I get help.

314
00:46:31,711 --> 00:46:36,811
But if they don’t love me there are obstructions,
problems, this, that.

315
00:46:36,811 --> 00:46:42,981
You get so fed up you don’t want to see
them, sometimes it happens.

316
00:46:42,981 --> 00:46:47,661
But if there is love, you know the whole communication
works through love, this subtle love.

317
00:46:47,661 --> 00:46:53,761
The whole ether has got this subtler love,
every matter has got this subtler love, everything

318
00:46:53,761 --> 00:46:54,761
has.

319
00:46:54,761 --> 00:46:58,771
And the whole thing goes into waves and you
just get the message.

320
00:46:58,771 --> 00:47:04,431
But if you are not on that reception point
or if you are not there nothing works: neither

321
00:47:04,431 --> 00:47:05,751
you nor me.

322
00:47:05,751 --> 00:47:08,051
It’s a mutual thing.

323
00:47:08,051 --> 00:47:10,111
I help you, but you help me too.

324
00:47:10,111 --> 00:47:12,631
What’s me is you.

325
00:47:12,631 --> 00:47:17,101
But you are not at that level because you
are on superficiality.

326
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:21,691
And because of this superficiality, also,
you are not collective.

327
00:47:21,691 --> 00:47:27,051
But the sense of collectivity is very, very
tricky also, one must understand.

328
00:47:27,051 --> 00:47:34,921
Some people start forming groups and they
think they have been collective.

329
00:47:34,921 --> 00:47:42,411
Forming a group is a sign of most uncollective
behaviour.

330
00:47:42,411 --> 00:47:47,841
But they think, “We have been very collective,
we have been very nice, you see!”

331
00:47:47,841 --> 00:47:50,261
Very happy people!

332
00:47:50,261 --> 00:47:57,321
So what I have to tell you is that you [should]
understand your responsibility.

333
00:47:57,321 --> 00:48:03,691
you are in the head office, in the head office.

334
00:48:03,691 --> 00:48:13,541
And the people who are not in the head office
are doing much, much better than you.

335
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:23,731
Then the whole office has to collapse

336
00:48:23,731 --> 00:48:51,001
(break in recording)

337
00:48:51,001 --> 00:49:03,261
It

338
00:49:03,261 --> 00:49:13,721
gives you a feeling of joy, but there is awe.

339
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:21,351
You love that awe, enjoy that awe.

340
00:49:21,351 --> 00:49:22,351
Mother is around.

341
00:49:22,351 --> 00:49:24,871
What are we doing?

342
00:49:24,871 --> 00:49:26,851
Where are we?

343
00:49:26,851 --> 00:49:35,171
And that’s the first sign, that’s the
first sign, that you are realising who is

344
00:49:35,171 --> 00:49:44,721
your Mother — first sign is.

345
00:49:44,721 --> 00:49:54,481
It is very easy just to jump into it, just
like your Kundalini awakening, I can tell

346
00:49:54,481 --> 00:49:56,851
you.

347
00:49:56,851 --> 00:49:59,661
And Americans you know are speedy people.

348
00:49:59,661 --> 00:50:05,621
I knew if they start, they have to just start
that’s the point.

349
00:50:05,621 --> 00:50:06,941
I know that.

350
00:50:06,941 --> 00:50:12,021
Americans have to just start, and they’ll
shoot off, and they shoot off very fast.

351
00:50:12,021 --> 00:50:13,321
They have speed.

352
00:50:13,321 --> 00:50:22,421
If they take the speed you must know then,
what they are capable of.

353
00:50:22,421 --> 00:50:29,021
There’s another one that’s coming up very
well, which I must tell you, is Munich.

354
00:50:29,021 --> 00:50:30,271
I didn’t want to go there.

355
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:35,611
There was a Polish, stupid, woman, she told
me all wrong about Munich people.

356
00:50:35,611 --> 00:50:40,001
So I thought, “If this is the sample, I’d
better not go."

357
00:50:40,001 --> 00:50:44,521
Then I felt the vibrations: and tremendous
vibrations!

358
00:50:44,521 --> 00:50:51,511
And the seriousness with which they were hearing
me, the intensity, as if there was a mathematical

359
00:50:51,511 --> 00:50:56,961
class or some sort of a science class I was
talking about, with complete attention, not

360
00:50:56,961 --> 00:51:01,031
even blinking.

361
00:51:01,031 --> 00:51:08,321
Absolute absorption of every word I was saying.

362
00:51:08,321 --> 00:51:11,831
I was amazed at these people.

363
00:51:11,831 --> 00:51:18,141
And once the Germans get to Sahaj Yoga, God
save you all!

364
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:23,721
I can assure you, you cannot come up to their
levels, because they have built up themselves

365
00:51:23,721 --> 00:51:24,721
like that.

366
00:51:24,721 --> 00:51:26,101
They are built up people.

367
00:51:26,101 --> 00:51:29,801
They are people of discipline.

368
00:51:29,801 --> 00:51:35,461
And when they will come to Sahaj Yoga you
will see what will happen.

369
00:51:35,461 --> 00:51:41,831
So all this lovey-dovey business, and this
kind of a what you call this, I don’t know

370
00:51:41,831 --> 00:51:44,131
in English word what you call.

371
00:51:44,131 --> 00:51:45,131
Sahaj Yogi: Wishy-washy.

372
00:51:45,131 --> 00:51:46,131
Shri Mataji: Wishy-washy is different.

373
00:51:46,131 --> 00:51:52,101
What I am saying is a person who is neither
here nor there: all the time bending like

374
00:51:52,101 --> 00:51:53,101
this.

375
00:51:53,101 --> 00:51:56,491
Lecha-pecha as we call in Hindi language.

376
00:51:56,491 --> 00:51:59,101
And also telling me, “I am like this!”

377
00:51:59,101 --> 00:52:01,561
All this nonsense!

378
00:52:01,561 --> 00:52:02,581
How many will be left out?

379
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:05,781
I don’t know.

380
00:52:05,781 --> 00:52:14,681
So, if I say anything, just know that I know
what it is.

381
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:18,881
I know what is going to happen.

382
00:52:18,881 --> 00:52:22,441
But you won’t learn your lessons, I know.

383
00:52:22,441 --> 00:52:23,850
If I told somebody, “Don’t.

384
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:31,091
Go back!” or, “Stay back!” that person
learns ultimately that, “This was the thing,

385
00:52:31,091 --> 00:52:32,091
correct.

386
00:52:32,091 --> 00:52:33,091
Mother said it."

387
00:52:33,091 --> 00:52:34,091
But how many times?

388
00:52:34,091 --> 00:52:41,631
Is the point now.

389
00:52:41,631 --> 00:52:44,681
So now, I am going away.

390
00:52:44,681 --> 00:52:51,181
I want to tell you that we all have to be
serious people.

391
00:52:51,181 --> 00:52:56,791
Whatever mistakes you have committed, forget
it.

392
00:52:56,791 --> 00:52:58,021
Be serious people!

393
00:52:58,021 --> 00:53:03,631
Those who are egoistical, trying to form groups,
are mediums, they talk like stupid people,

394
00:53:03,631 --> 00:53:09,511
trying to organise programmes in a stupid
way, giving big lectures, should come down

395
00:53:09,511 --> 00:53:11,061
to normal now!

396
00:53:11,061 --> 00:53:13,051
Nothing doing!

397
00:53:13,051 --> 00:53:16,731
Be serious!

398
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:19,591
We have to be alert.

399
00:53:19,591 --> 00:53:28,721
Those who will sleep now will lose completely.

400
00:53:28,721 --> 00:53:30,571
I must warn you.

401
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:31,681
It’s important.

402
00:53:31,681 --> 00:53:33,351
Time is short.

403
00:53:33,351 --> 00:53:37,971
You are important people, no doubt about it.

404
00:53:37,971 --> 00:53:44,471
But if you are no good, you will be losing
your position completely.

405
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:56,811
[On] the day when I am thinking of going to
India, for a Mother, she’s more worried

406
00:53:56,811 --> 00:54:00,241
about people who are still not there.

407
00:54:00,241 --> 00:54:01,761
She is always worried.

408
00:54:01,761 --> 00:54:09,051
Like a boat is going, has got many people
in the boat quite settled down, even from

409
00:54:09,051 --> 00:54:16,421
England, but there are many still half way
in the water, coming up, going down.

410
00:54:16,421 --> 00:54:19,431
You are not worried about the people who are
on the boat, but you are worried about the

411
00:54:19,431 --> 00:54:22,641
people who are still halfway.

412
00:54:22,641 --> 00:54:29,561
And that worry is on my head.

413
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:30,811
I am serious.

414
00:54:30,811 --> 00:54:32,141
The climate is serious.

415
00:54:32,141 --> 00:54:34,801
The weather is serious.

416
00:54:34,801 --> 00:54:41,661
How it rained and rained and rained today.

417
00:54:41,661 --> 00:54:45,531
The whole nature is bothered.

418
00:54:45,531 --> 00:54:55,211
Don’t think that only if you are educated,
uneducated, you come from this sort of a life

419
00:54:55,211 --> 00:54:57,171
or that — that’s nothing important.

420
00:54:57,171 --> 00:55:01,081
Spirit is above all these things.

421
00:55:01,081 --> 00:55:09,341
But to make the Spirit shine, to work on your
nerves, that sheen has to go away, otherwise

422
00:55:09,341 --> 00:55:14,871
it will never work.

423
00:55:14,871 --> 00:55:20,181
Whatever you do, it should please me, is one
of the ways.

424
00:55:20,181 --> 00:55:22,401
It should please me.

425
00:55:22,401 --> 00:55:30,531
That’s one of the signs.

426
00:55:30,531 --> 00:55:31,791
So how do we do it?

427
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:33,751
Put me in your heart!

428
00:55:33,751 --> 00:55:37,451
Just try to put me in your heart, it’s very
simple.

429
00:55:37,451 --> 00:55:39,171
I am before you now.

430
00:55:39,171 --> 00:55:45,161
I am in person.

431
00:55:45,161 --> 00:55:51,170
I was trying to give Realisation to one of
my relations just today.

432
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:53,121
And I said that, “You don’t close your
eyes."

433
00:55:53,121 --> 00:55:59,351
He said, “No, I’m not looking at your
face because when I see you, I feel you are

434
00:55:59,351 --> 00:56:01,370
my aunt.

435
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:07,001
But I am just looking at your feet so that
I shouldn’t feel anymore that you are my

436
00:56:07,001 --> 00:56:08,001
aunt.

437
00:56:08,001 --> 00:56:10,620
You are very great.

438
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:14,940
And your face is the one that puts me into
illusions."

439
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,230
He could see it’s a Mahamaya.

440
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:19,561
He said, “Only at your feet I look.

441
00:56:19,561 --> 00:56:24,890
And through your feet only I can get over
this barrier, this feeling."

442
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:36,631
In the same way when I am a Mahamaya, I know
I am, I had to be, but you have to put my

443
00:56:36,631 --> 00:56:53,451
feet into your heart, just my feet into your
heart.

444
00:56:53,451 --> 00:57:01,801
Because photo, face, everything might be an
illusion.

445
00:57:01,801 --> 00:57:14,350
Might be by seeing my face you do not get
over your barriers.

446
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:16,231
To say, “I must see Mother."

447
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:18,511
“I must do this."

448
00:57:18,511 --> 00:57:20,571
“Mother must come to my house."

449
00:57:20,571 --> 00:57:22,590
“She must have food at my place."

450
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,390
“She must visit my home."

451
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:35,140
All this is so stupid, I cannot understand
what’s the matter with these people!

452
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:37,991
Mother, please come in my heart.

453
00:57:37,991 --> 00:57:41,591
Let me clean my heart so that you are there.

454
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:44,321
Put your feet into my heart.

455
00:57:44,321 --> 00:57:51,191
Let your feet be worshipped in my heart.

456
00:57:51,191 --> 00:57:56,271
Let me not be in delusion.

457
00:57:56,271 --> 00:57:59,941
Take me away from illusions.

458
00:57:59,941 --> 00:58:02,581
Keep me in reality.

459
00:58:02,581 --> 00:58:07,600
Take away the sheen of superficiality.

460
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,981
Let me enjoy your feet in my heart.

461
00:58:10,981 --> 00:58:17,241
Let me see your feet in my heart.

462
00:58:17,241 --> 00:58:18,390
Only such people.

463
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:23,511
Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha have done that.

464
00:58:23,511 --> 00:58:30,110
So don’t you think you have to do it?

465
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:33,400
So humble down yourself!

466
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,691
Humble down yourself in your heart.

467
00:58:36,691 --> 00:58:39,521
Humble down in your heart.

468
00:58:39,521 --> 00:58:41,080
Enjoy your humility.

469
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,801
Enjoy your virtues.

470
00:58:43,801 --> 00:58:48,041
The greatest virtue of a Sahaj Yogi is humility.

471
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:54,890
Now, so many things you have seen to convince
you.

472
00:58:54,890 --> 00:59:03,711
But in no way it can mean any kind of subjection,
because what subjection you can give me?

473
00:59:03,711 --> 00:59:06,090
Think of that.

474
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:15,001
When every subjection is a blessing, what
subjection you are giving?

475
00:59:15,001 --> 00:59:21,031
Every feeling in the heart is a blessing.

476
00:59:21,031 --> 00:59:30,180
Just now you feel it and you feel the joy,
in your heart.

477
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,751
Then what is your subjection?

478
00:59:31,751 --> 00:59:33,971
About what?

479
00:59:33,971 --> 00:59:38,741
I can understand people who are just newly
come, who are good for nothing.

480
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:41,301
But you are not on the periphery.

481
00:59:41,301 --> 00:59:45,071
But some of them do go into periphery in no
time.

482
00:59:45,071 --> 00:59:47,560
You give them some work — finished!

483
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,600
If I am sweet to someone — finished!

484
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,170
If I see someone — finished!

485
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,660
I mean, this is too much.

486
00:59:52,660 --> 01:00:04,441
I can’t even be nice to you.

487
01:00:04,441 --> 01:00:10,851
If you do any mistakes or anything, then you
get your left Vishuddhi.

488
01:00:10,851 --> 01:00:14,491
You’ve done your mistake, all right, finish
it.

489
01:00:14,491 --> 01:00:15,751
You love me.

490
01:00:15,751 --> 01:00:20,221
Maybe there’s something wrong in the love
or maybe something has happened, doesn’t

491
01:00:20,221 --> 01:00:21,221
matter.

492
01:00:21,221 --> 01:00:23,560
“Now, I’m going to be cautious.

493
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,900
I’m not going to make any mistakes.

494
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,930
How could I do this mistake?

495
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:30,560
Because I was not fully in love.

496
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,861
If I had loved something, I would have not
done such a mistake!”

497
01:00:33,861 --> 01:00:36,411
All right, so develop your love.

498
01:00:36,411 --> 01:00:37,411
No.

499
01:00:37,411 --> 01:00:43,971
your will do, “I feel guilty because I have
done such a thing."

500
01:00:43,971 --> 01:00:45,781
So you miss this and that both.

501
01:00:45,781 --> 01:00:48,451
So your mistake becomes a barrier again.

502
01:00:48,451 --> 01:00:50,771
Don’t feel guilty about it.

503
01:00:50,771 --> 01:00:52,301
We have to progress further.

504
01:00:52,301 --> 01:00:53,491
Forget the past.

505
01:00:53,491 --> 01:00:54,491
Forget the past.

506
01:00:54,491 --> 01:00:55,491
Forget the past.

507
01:00:55,491 --> 01:00:56,491
We have to go further.

508
01:00:56,491 --> 01:00:58,361
We have to be serious people.

509
01:00:58,361 --> 01:01:06,331
When we talk, we should talk with that dignity
of that awe.

510
01:01:06,331 --> 01:01:17,670
That’s very important and once you develop
that awe your Ekadasha will disappear.

511
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:20,731
Ekadasha will disappear.

512
01:01:20,731 --> 01:01:27,501
Just think of the awe.

513
01:01:27,501 --> 01:01:45,551
See the silence and the joy, and the joy of
the awe is deep, very deep, like a sea.

514
01:01:45,551 --> 01:01:53,430
The sea on superficial level is very turbulent,
but inside is silent, absolutely silent.

515
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:55,491
Feel that depth.

516
01:01:55,491 --> 01:02:04,320
Without awe, you cannot go down.

517
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:12,050
I have sometimes even said little loudly some
things to Warren, I know, but it’s never,

518
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:13,840
never felt with him.

519
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:21,211
But with some people I have never said because
I know the person won’t take it from me.

520
01:02:21,211 --> 01:02:34,920
But he never feels that I have said anything
wrong or to hurt him in any way, that’s

521
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:45,080
the sign of complete awe.

522
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:53,711
And it’s just a wee bit of penetration,
a very little bit of penetration [that’s

523
01:02:53,711 --> 01:02:54,961
needed].

524
01:02:54,961 --> 01:02:57,160
Forget the self-importance.

525
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,871
Forget the greatness that you think about
yourself.

526
01:02:59,871 --> 01:03:07,410
When you become the zero then you become nirmala.

527
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:15,050
As long as you are like a cup, you are small.

528
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:23,021
When the boundaries of the cups are broken,
there’s no more a cup.

529
01:03:23,021 --> 01:03:26,791
And this is what today I have to tell you.

530
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:39,231
Today is the eleventh day and ten days, out
of which nine days were the periods of fights.

531
01:03:39,231 --> 01:03:44,110
Tenth day is the period of victory.

532
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:49,810
Now eleventh day is of enjoyment.

533
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:53,870
But how can the people who do not have the
awe, enjoy?

534
01:03:53,870 --> 01:04:00,370
I cannot understand.

535
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:07,261
Because Ekadasha forms the barrier.

536
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:11,541
And the barrier of Ekadasha, you know what
it is.

537
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:21,551
Feel the awe and you’ll go deep into your
heart, deep into your heart.

538
01:04:21,551 --> 01:04:28,981
Because you are at a point where just you
have to have the gravity to go down.

539
01:04:28,981 --> 01:04:37,711
[It’s] working out: try to keep that.

540
01:04:37,711 --> 01:04:45,481
Slowly and slowly you all have come up to
a point only thing is now develop your depth.

541
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:47,590
Go deep down.

542
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:52,711
I know there are frivolous people but they’ll
all be dropped out in no time.

543
01:04:52,711 --> 01:04:54,920
Don’t worry about them.

544
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,800
I know what people are doing, how they are
behaving.

545
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:08,081
I know every one of you very well, each one
of you.

546
01:05:08,081 --> 01:05:16,830
So, respect your body, respect yourself, keep
your hamsas all right at least.

547
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:24,241
And I am sure, if you become serious about
it…you need a serious understanding of the

548
01:05:24,241 --> 01:05:26,831
whole thing, that’s what is lacking.

549
01:05:26,831 --> 01:05:33,880
Because if you love someone, the whole thing
becomes an entire possession sort of thing,

550
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:43,951
the entire being is so seriously involved
into it that you cannot afford to miss anything.

551
01:05:43,951 --> 01:05:51,971
And that’s what is going to help you.

552
01:05:51,971 --> 01:05:59,670
But seriousness never means you are not enjoying.

553
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:04,610
Enjoyment is so deep: it’s pouring into
the heart.

554
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:07,370
I play with you.

555
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:10,951
I always try to say things that will please
you.

556
01:06:10,951 --> 01:06:15,860
And it should please you much more that I
have said — what today is that — how to

557
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:23,211
reach your depths, to reach that gravity that
will make you the gurus.

558
01:06:23,211 --> 01:06:32,461
Today I had to talk to you like a guru, because
I feel that now the time has come for all

559
01:06:32,461 --> 01:06:38,211
of you to become gurus of the right type.

560
01:06:38,211 --> 01:06:47,670
Not with egos or talking big and creating
a big sort of a show out of you.

561
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:59,491
But a definite depth within you that people
see that, “Here is a beacon of Mother."

562
01:06:59,491 --> 01:07:03,761
And it is so fantastic!

563
01:07:03,761 --> 01:07:11,581
The whole thing is so great, to be that.

564
01:07:11,581 --> 01:07:18,660
This is what the gurus used to do, first of
all, is to cleanse people, clear them out,

565
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:24,481
take out their barriers, make them take out
their egos, by hanging them round, putting

566
01:07:24,481 --> 01:07:29,100
them on top of a well, putting them down five,
six times, dipping them down.

567
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:33,691
They used to do all this for what?

568
01:07:33,691 --> 01:07:51,691
But now you can do it because I am before
you!Because I have come.

569
01:07:51,691 --> 01:08:02,111
This is the reason.

570
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:05,801
Understand what Warren has, so rightly, said.

571
01:08:05,801 --> 01:08:10,350
You might say that “Mother was working through
him."

572
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:12,340
Maybe.

573
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:17,031
But, I always work through you if you are
one with me.

574
01:08:17,031 --> 01:08:20,830
Even when I am speaking, you are speaking.

575
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:23,791
And when you are speaking, I am speaking.

576
01:08:23,791 --> 01:08:27,930
You know that.

577
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:39,920
But with all this, that awe is very important.

578
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:56,130
And that gives you the love that thinks: complete
integration of your heart and your brain.

579
01:08:56,130 --> 01:09:02,281
The love that thinks is thoughtful, the love
that thinks.

580
01:09:02,281 --> 01:09:08,910
And then the third integration: the love that
acts.

581
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:22,040
But first this integration must be brought
in: the love that thinks, which understands,

582
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:26,900
which feels.

583
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:34,971
And then the love that acts.

584
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:59,491
But the basic is the love — it starts from
the heart — is the love.

585
01:09:59,491 --> 01:10:06,491
I think you’d better take my tape today
and listen to it.

586
01:10:06,491 --> 01:10:07,851
Meditate.

587
01:10:07,851 --> 01:10:11,531
Meditate on that.

588
01:10:11,531 --> 01:10:24,410
I want to see my children in England develop
the depth in language, in speech, in feelings,

589
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:29,331
in expressions, in the personality.

590
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:36,180
It’s only the awe that will make it.

591
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:41,120
But awe which is not frightening, but awe
that’s joy-giving.

592
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,310
This is the integration of it.

593
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:54,021
Awe that is joy-giving is not frightening.

594
01:10:54,021 --> 01:10:57,331
Open your hearts!

595
01:10:57,331 --> 01:11:03,441
But it doesn’t mean you should be frivolous,
[but] with all the care.

596
01:11:03,441 --> 01:11:05,650
Have you seen a lotus opening?

597
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:14,180
How beautifully it opens: slowly, every petal
so careful not to hit each other.

598
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:16,781
Slowly it opens out.

599
01:11:16,781 --> 01:11:24,951
And then the fragrance starts pouring in,
in the most dignified manner.

600
01:11:24,951 --> 01:11:43,820
Such a flower only can be offered at the Lotus
feet of the Adi Shakti, isn’t it?

601
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:53,860
May God bless you.
