1
00:12:55,789 --> 00:13:18,419
First – we bow to Shri Ganesha
because Shri Ganesha is the source of innocence

2
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:20,328
within us.

3
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:30,069
So actually we bow to innocence within us.

4
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:43,459
And this innocence is the one [that] gives
you the enlightenment.

5
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:59,719
As I told you yesterday the light has innocence,
but this is innocent without knowledge.

6
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:06,369
But your light is innocent with knowledge.

7
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:14,569
We always think that the people who have got
knowledge can never be innocent, can never

8
00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:17,059
be simple.

9
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:25,139
And the idea we have got about innocence is
that a innocent person is always deceived,

10
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:34,789
can be befooled – and can be always taken
for granted.

11
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:48,539
But innocence is a power; it is a power which
protects you, which gives you light of knowledge.

12
00:14:48,539 --> 00:15:01,099
Knowledge that we have in the worldly sense
is how to exploit others, how to cheat others,

13
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:15,989
how to make money out of them, how to make
fun of others, how to look down upon others.

14
00:15:15,989 --> 00:15:25,389
But the light of innocence is the light by
which you know that love is the highest thing.

15
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:37,379
And it teaches you how to love others, how
to care for others, how to be gentle about

16
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:38,489
others.

17
00:15:38,489 --> 00:15:41,989
It also gives you the light within.

18
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:47,649
It’s just the other way round of this Avidya
that we have in this world.

19
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:50,418
Just the other way round.

20
00:15:50,418 --> 00:16:05,909
The Avidya outside teaches us competition,
how to put the other person down.

21
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:13,129
Because it has fear, it is insecured.

22
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:18,778
This knowledge is not secured – at all.

23
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:25,719
If it had security it would not have behaved
like this.

24
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:30,819
But the light of innocence knows everything.

25
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:35,979
It has no fear.

26
00:16:35,979 --> 00:16:44,749
When we say ‘children are innocent’ we
mean to say that they have that power of innocence.

27
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:53,549
Many times people have noticed if a child
falls from a height, it doesn’t die; while

28
00:16:53,549 --> 00:17:01,028
a young man may die with a much smaller height.

29
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:03,189
And the child is not afraid while falling.

30
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:13,479
He just enjoys, as if there is a parachute
coming down, you know, nicely.

31
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:17,479
And then when he falls down, also he just
gets up, laughs, smiles at everyone.

32
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:23,289
He doesn’t understand why everybody is worried.

33
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:29,558
Because in that innocence he knows that he’s
looked after, he’s protected.

34
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:39,548
He knows that there is a power, which is much
higher than him and he does not have to worry.

35
00:17:39,548 --> 00:17:47,438
Then we start putting ideas into the head
of the child, and that is how he starts losing

36
00:17:47,438 --> 00:18:00,898
his power of innocence and he becomes a coward,
he becomes a cunning fellow, he becomes an

37
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:07,898
unrighteous personality.

38
00:18:07,898 --> 00:18:18,058
But still we would say that the innocence
of children is [the] innocence of ignorance,

39
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:26,208
in a way, because they do not know the dangers
of life.

40
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:39,298
But the light of innocence knows all the dangers,
and also knows how to get rid of it, also

41
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:43,779
knows how to be away from such a person.

42
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:59,878
There was a wise man, who was going on a staircase,
and there was a stupid man coming from the

43
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:03,119
other side – foolish man.

44
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:09,278
So foolish people are always aggressive, that
is one of the signs, because they have inferiority

45
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:10,998
complex.

46
00:19:10,998 --> 00:19:17,869
So the foolish man says to the man who was
coming up, he says – [because] one had to

47
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:23,408
move on one side – so he says, “I don’t
move for fools!”

48
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:27,158
The foolish one says.

49
00:19:27,158 --> 00:19:34,419
So the wise man says, “I do,” and he moved.

50
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:47,730
(Laughter) That’s how the light of innocence
tells you how far to go with a person, how

51
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:57,428
far to talk to a person, how far to indulge
in another person’s personality or his problems;

52
00:19:57,428 --> 00:19:59,958
otherwise he recedes.

53
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:05,148
He understands that this gentleman is a stupid
fool so “I move for a fool like that.”

54
00:20:05,148 --> 00:20:13,138
He doesn’t pay attention to such a person,
he doesn’t bother about such a person.

55
00:20:13,138 --> 00:20:19,138
This is the light of innocence which gives
you discrimination.

56
00:20:19,138 --> 00:20:20,528
How far to go with others.

57
00:20:20,528 --> 00:20:24,928
I love a person, there are many, “I love
him”.

58
00:20:24,928 --> 00:20:25,928
Alright!

59
00:20:25,928 --> 00:20:31,888
The another person may kick you, may hit you,
may trouble you, may become absolutely horribly

60
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:41,699
possessed, but still you are just mad in love
with that person, without any self-respect.

61
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:48,548
This comes because there is no…you may be
innocent, in a way, in a worldly manner, but

62
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:51,009
you are not enlightened and innocent.

63
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:58,468
When you are enlightened and innocent then
your innocence is a power, which gives you,

64
00:20:58,468 --> 00:21:04,128
first thing, is discretion.

65
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:10,778
Supposing you take a light in your hand – now
you know whether it is a snake or a rope,

66
00:21:10,778 --> 00:21:14,718
but if there is no light in your hand, you
cannot see.

67
00:21:14,718 --> 00:21:21,088
But even, supposing it’s a snake, you might
run away, or if you are a stupid fool, you’ll

68
00:21:21,088 --> 00:21:22,708
say, “Alright, come and bite me.

69
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:30,119
I would like to see, how it works.”

70
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,739
(Child laughs.

71
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:43,359
Laughter) But if you are an enlightened person,
then you will tell the snake, “Now, let

72
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,579
me be alone.

73
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:45,579
Alright?

74
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:46,579
Bye-bye.”

75
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:51,049
(Laughter) And the snake will know and it
will go away.

76
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:59,579
Or if the snake is a sinister one, you may
just look at the snake and snake might run

77
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:00,729
off.

78
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:09,329
So this power of innocence is a very, very
important thing, and that comes to us through

79
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:12,919
our enlightenment alone.

80
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:24,539
So we are, say, in a state which is ignorant
and innocent – innocent and ignorant.

81
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:31,629
Then people are no more innocent nor ignorant,
but they are not enlightened – they become

82
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:32,629
cunning!

83
00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:40,349
If they don’t have both the qualities – they
are neither ignorant, so-called, they have

84
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:46,969
got knowledge, they are good at everything,
they are well known people, for their intelligence,

85
00:22:46,969 --> 00:22:50,649
brilliance, everything – so they are knowledgeable,
so-called.

86
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:57,549
So such people we could call as the people
who have got the knowledge, in the worldly

87
00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:02,559
sense, but they have no innocence.

88
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,179
So they start devising methods, the innocence
which is there, which puts a little control

89
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:11,989
over such a mind, is lost.

90
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:13,949
Because they think innocence is stupid, you
know?

91
00:23:13,949 --> 00:23:16,089
They don’t respect their innocence.

92
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:23,089
So they start manoeuvring people, doing violent
things, doing harmful things, saying nasty,

93
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:24,349
sarcastic things.

94
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:33,019
All these things the brain starts working,
because it cannot get back to its innocence.

95
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:36,479
So we don’t like such people later on, we
don’t want them.

96
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:43,439
Then they develop ideas that, “We are higher
people, we are chosen people, we are better

97
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:45,759
people,” then – they develop all these
ideas.

98
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,909
Then they, all of them club together.

99
00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:55,129
So ignorance is added as a so-called knowledge,
you see.

100
00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:59,739
Inside is completely ignorance, outside is
knowledge.

101
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:06,979
And added up – added up like that, they
do not want to seek their inside.

102
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:14,759
And they are satisfied with their outside,
so-called knowledge.

103
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:19,939
And they go ahead with it, and once they break
their heads, then they realise, “Oh God,

104
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:21,209
what was it?

105
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:25,399
Inside is all darkness.”

106
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:36,509
We cannot live with all the windows closed
hermetically and the sun shining outside.

107
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:47,109
We have to have light inside, to see for ourselves,
what are we, what are our powers, how far

108
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:58,259
we can go, how we are working out ourselves,
our lives, our aims?

109
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:08,119
Now the enlightenment, as the enlightenment
you see here is of these lights, is manifested

110
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:17,889
within you as vibrations, as chaitanya, as
light.

111
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:23,009
So the chaitanya itself is the light.

112
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:31,019
But the difference between this light and
that light is such that this one will only

113
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:35,639
tell you as far as your eyes are concerned.

114
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:43,799
It will tell you that it is a stone, or it
is a wood, or it is a house, or it is a face

115
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:54,199
of a man – anything, this light, but it
won’t be able to tell you whether this person

116
00:25:54,199 --> 00:26:02,889
is good or bad, whether this house is vibrated
or not, is auspicious or not.

117
00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:07,199
So it doesn’t give you auspiciousness, the
idea of auspiciousness.

118
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:12,919
So we are talking of Ganesha’s innocence,
which gives us sense of auspiciousness, and

119
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:19,639
ourselves also makes us auspicious.

120
00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:33,839
This is how the chaitanya itself is enlightenment,
chaitanya itself is enlightenment.

121
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:40,709
It relates to you all the knowledge which
it has.

122
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:48,599
Now imagine what a micro-arrangement it is
that the chaitanyas, which are small, small

123
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:57,379
like, we can say, little round valayas, small,
small ones.

124
00:26:57,379 --> 00:27:08,939
They have intelligence in them, and discretion
built-in them to tell you whether a person

125
00:27:08,939 --> 00:27:13,909
is good or bad.

126
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:18,019
You have got it, Sahaja Yoga, so in a simple
way.

127
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:24,169
So we have not bothered to find out, what
your computer has got.

128
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:33,609
It has got the knowledge now to know, not
only if the person is good or bad, but what

129
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:36,979
troubles that person has got.

130
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:49,359
Now this light can go up to one dimension
of a person, how he looks, how he walks, everything.

131
00:27:49,359 --> 00:28:01,829
And you, if you start imagining something,
if you start imagining – and saying that,

132
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:05,379
“I feel this way, I think this way.”

133
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:10,609
(somebody interrupts Mother’s talk)

134
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:13,959
Shri Mataji: not all right?

135
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:14,959
Yogini: [inaudible]

136
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:15,959
Shri Mataji: Ha?

137
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:16,959
Yogini: [inaudible]

138
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:18,599
Shri Mataji: You can’t hear Me?

139
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,919
Many yogis: Yes.

140
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,559
Upstairs only in the baby school.

141
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,749
Shri Mataji: What is it?

142
00:28:24,749 --> 00:28:31,699
Akbar: There is a video for the mothers with
the children, and they can’t hear You.

143
00:28:31,699 --> 00:28:34,559
It is upstairs.

144
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:43,789
Shri Mataji: I didn’t hear, what is it?

145
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:53,769
Antonio Scialo: There is a children-room upstairs,
for children, with a video for children and

146
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:54,769
mothers.

147
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:55,769
But they cannot hear it.

148
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:56,769
Shri Mataji: Oh I see, but the children are
here?

149
00:28:56,769 --> 00:29:00,579
Yogis: Babies, babies; mothers and babies.

150
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:03,559
Shri Mataji: Oh God.

151
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:16,249
Somebody has to go up and fix it up, isn’t
it?

152
00:29:16,249 --> 00:29:27,759
I think you should have tested it before,
isn’t it?

153
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:29,689
Alright.

154
00:29:29,689 --> 00:29:46,139
So, the chaitanya that is within us, which
is flowing out, which we are receiving from

155
00:29:46,139 --> 00:30:03,768
all over, is all-pervading, is in every molecule
pulsating: which gives us knowledge about

156
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:12,368
each and every matter, each and every animal,
each and every human being, and each and every

157
00:30:12,368 --> 00:30:16,228
Deity.

158
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:26,868
Without this light you could not have recognised
Me.

159
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:31,459
You could not have recognised any Deities.

160
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:38,959
You could not have known your position in
life and your aims in life.

161
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:45,458
You would not have known what is your purpose
of life, why are you here.

162
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:49,199
Are you here just to make some money, put
some in the insurance, some in the shares?

163
00:30:49,199 --> 00:30:50,199
Of course, now nobody will do that!

164
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:55,800
(The stock markets crashed on Monday 19 October
1987 the week of this puja) (Laughter) And

165
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:03,319
get some house, and dance on the fingers of
your wife, or the wife has to dance as the

166
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:12,328
dictates of the husband, to bring up children
somehow – are you here for that?

167
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:19,208
This chaitanya tells you, very clearly, “No.”

168
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:31,449
Because if you get more involved into these
things and become completely cut-off from

169
00:31:31,449 --> 00:31:37,718
the collective happenings, then this light
goes off.

170
00:31:37,718 --> 00:31:46,238
As soon as this light gets disconnected, you
can’t have any light.

171
00:31:46,238 --> 00:32:01,449
So, any connection, whatever you have, with
the vibrations has to be very strong, and

172
00:32:01,449 --> 00:32:04,569
has to be absolutely intact and steady.

173
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:11,899
For example, if there is a light which is
not steady, which is moving, you can’t understand

174
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:14,758
things properly.

175
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:23,718
Though the vibrations know everything, but
how will they communicate this to an instrument

176
00:32:23,718 --> 00:32:40,888
which is not perfect, which does not respect
vibrations, which does not communicate with

177
00:32:40,888 --> 00:32:45,649
the vibrations?

178
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:47,399
Please take the child out.

179
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:51,888
Don’t try to push the – no, no, no, don’t
do that.

180
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:53,439
No, no, don’t.

181
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:56,049
You should not lose temper with children,
you know?

182
00:32:56,049 --> 00:33:13,099
They are crying, they must be wanting something.

183
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:35,368
So, this knowledgeable instrument that you
have got is to be all the time flowing through

184
00:33:35,368 --> 00:33:40,929
you, and you have to be a very clean apparatus.

185
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:51,959
Supposing you have this light, and the glass
is not clean – you won’t get light properly.

186
00:33:51,959 --> 00:34:02,929
So the purity has to be established, and that
is the part, where Ganesha is so important,

187
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:12,988
because He cleanses you, He washes you and
you become innocent: because you do not plan

188
00:34:12,988 --> 00:34:21,628
or think of harming anyone, who is a good
person, who is a nice person.

189
00:34:21,628 --> 00:34:27,779
It becomes innocence because it is auspicious.

190
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:30,069
You start becoming auspicious.

191
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:37,559
Wherever you go, and [if] you meet somebody
that person feels, “Oh God, today something

192
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:39,748
good has happened in our family.

193
00:34:39,748 --> 00:34:43,008
Something good has come out.”

194
00:34:43,008 --> 00:34:49,988
Now recently I met someone in Germany where
there was a ‘sahaja yogi’ who started

195
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:53,679
talking against Me and Sahaja Yoga.

196
00:34:53,679 --> 00:35:00,998
And he got out of the Ashram, and then he
went to somebody who was supposed to be a

197
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:06,008
sahaja yogi, and his wife, and there he started
telling about his woes and, against Sahaja

198
00:35:06,008 --> 00:35:08,618
Yoga and all those things.

199
00:35:08,618 --> 00:35:13,958
Though he has been always a possessed man,
but still: these people should not have listened

200
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:15,649
to anything against Me.

201
00:35:15,649 --> 00:35:22,449
In the shastras is written, that: to hear
the Guru-ninda, anything against your Guru,

202
00:35:22,449 --> 00:35:25,098
is absolutely dangerous.

203
00:35:25,098 --> 00:35:29,518
So anybody says anything against your Guru,
you have to put your hands like that, “I

204
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:32,738
don’t want to hear anything against my Guru!”

205
00:35:32,738 --> 00:35:34,169
Instead of that they sympathised.

206
00:35:34,169 --> 00:35:43,359
So the lady has got a serious type of cancer,
and the husband is also very sick.

207
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:53,349
Now, one has to understand that if you are
going to cross this ocean in a boat – all

208
00:35:53,349 --> 00:36:01,159
of us are there – and [if] one wants to
put one foot into the mouth of a crocodile,

209
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,159
how can we save such people?

210
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:09,819
Then it’s better that they should go to
the crocodile than to the boat.

211
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:17,939
But those who try to sympathise and put another
foot in the crocodile, then they have to be

212
00:36:17,939 --> 00:36:24,939
in trouble.

213
00:36:24,939 --> 00:36:31,358
All these things not only hamper but are so
inauspicious and dangerous that you all have

214
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:36,919
to be extremely careful about it.

215
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:38,848
You need not tell people that, “You are
evil!

216
00:36:38,848 --> 00:36:42,698
You are bad!“, or anything – but just
“Get out of Sahaja Yoga!”

217
00:36:42,698 --> 00:36:43,758
Have nothing to do with them.

218
00:36:43,758 --> 00:36:45,169
You should say, “We are sorry.

219
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:47,098
We can’t to anything about it.

220
00:36:47,098 --> 00:36:48,238
You do what you like.

221
00:36:48,238 --> 00:36:51,128
It’s not our responsibility.”

222
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:57,429
And there you should not be meek, you should
not feel embarrassed or delicate about it.

223
00:36:57,429 --> 00:36:59,518
Tell them off, “Nothing doing.

224
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:07,199
We cannot help you here, we are sorry, you
work it out yourself.”

225
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:16,039
Because this light is a light which nourishes
you and strengthens you.

226
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:21,939
The light of the Spirit must give you that
strength within you.

227
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:24,909
You become a strong personality.

228
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:34,768
You become a personality which can withstand
lots of things, even crucifixion, but it can

229
00:37:34,768 --> 00:37:36,858
also fight.

230
00:37:36,858 --> 00:37:43,959
It has all the qualities built within itself.

231
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:47,138
Like a person who has a temper.

232
00:37:47,138 --> 00:37:48,138
No!

233
00:37:48,138 --> 00:37:50,628
It’s not a very good person to be, with
temper.

234
00:37:50,628 --> 00:37:54,238
It’s not good for a Sahaja Yogi to have
temper.

235
00:37:54,238 --> 00:38:00,559
But if somebody says something to you against
your Mother, you have to have temper.

236
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:04,268
That’s the place we have to use temper.

237
00:38:04,268 --> 00:38:08,289
You can box that person, doesn’t matter.

238
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:14,929
(Laughter) Ganesha will be just standing behind
you.

239
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:21,109
(Laughter) And Hanumana will be in front.

240
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:27,498
(Laughter) If you box him once, Hanumana will
box him ten times.

241
00:38:27,498 --> 00:38:34,888
(Laughter) So that time the anger has meaning.

242
00:38:34,888 --> 00:38:44,858
Now, people say, one should not have greed
in life.

243
00:38:44,858 --> 00:38:51,738
Yes, one should not have greed, but if you
have got greed for vibrations it’s a very

244
00:38:51,738 --> 00:38:53,399
good thing.

245
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:56,258
You should be very greedy about vibrations.

246
00:38:56,258 --> 00:39:02,108
Wherever you get vibrations, you must rush
and try to get more vibrations.

247
00:39:02,108 --> 00:39:08,959
Greed is alright, you should have that greed
within yourself.

248
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:16,638
If you don’t have that greed, how will you
be able to overcome the other attractions?

249
00:39:16,638 --> 00:39:20,838
It is very surprising, I always wonder about
human beings – which I’ve never been able

250
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:23,689
to understand Myself.

251
00:39:23,689 --> 00:39:35,039
(Laughter) That, when it comes to hatred they
are the best!

252
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:43,799
If they want to hate someone then you can
make them sacrifice everything that they have.

253
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:49,799
Under the name of God, under the name of nation,
under the name of anything whatever you want.

254
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:52,979
You just have to say that, “We have to hate
someone.”

255
00:39:52,979 --> 00:39:59,809
Immediately they’ll gather around, they’ll
pass trough all kinds of ordeals, sacrifice

256
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:08,878
everything, go to jails, they will kill themselves,
commit suicides – just if you tell them,

257
00:40:08,878 --> 00:40:11,478
“We hate someone.”

258
00:40:11,478 --> 00:40:18,238
Or else you have to say that, “We are a
great nation, something very big and, these

259
00:40:18,238 --> 00:40:23,659
are bad nations – so we have to fight.”

260
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:29,458
They will do.

261
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:37,228
It is very surprising that, even when it comes
to political revolutions and for their political

262
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:44,838
freedom, they can go to any limit of sacrifices.

263
00:40:44,838 --> 00:40:47,128
The other day I was watching Lenin’s fight.

264
00:40:47,128 --> 00:40:48,419
I was amazed!

265
00:40:48,419 --> 00:40:56,458
This single man Lenin, who was always in the
exile used to only write, “We have to fight,

266
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:58,809
we have to get this, we have to do that.”

267
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:05,638
Though he was a realised soul, but still he
didn’t write about spirituality, he wrote

268
00:41:05,638 --> 00:41:12,748
about political struggle, and three times
there was an upsurge and thousands and thousands

269
00:41:12,748 --> 00:41:22,919
of people you find in every place being killed
– just like that.

270
00:41:22,919 --> 00:41:23,919
It is very surprising.

271
00:41:23,919 --> 00:41:31,969
Now, don’t fan, you see, while I am talking
you should not fan, you know, it disturbs.

272
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:36,899
Pay full attention; pay full attention, is
important.

273
00:41:36,899 --> 00:41:43,649
Because if you do not pay attention, others
will look at you, and their attention will

274
00:41:43,649 --> 00:41:44,649
be spoiled.

275
00:41:44,649 --> 00:41:52,429
Now this one was so dedicated, even little
children and wives and pregnant women and

276
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:57,478
so many men were killed in a lot like that.

277
00:41:57,478 --> 00:42:03,268
Again they rose, again they rose three times,
and the fourth time they were successful.

278
00:42:03,268 --> 00:42:06,199
For what?

279
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:10,008
For a political achievement.

280
00:42:10,008 --> 00:42:14,758
We did that in India, too.

281
00:42:14,758 --> 00:42:19,789
People gave up everything that they have,
their houses, families – everything they

282
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:21,789
gave up.

283
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:28,378
Even for fake gurus people have spent so much
money, they have done so much, given up everything,

284
00:42:28,378 --> 00:42:32,899
sold their houses, put their children into
trouble, got into trouble – everything they

285
00:42:32,899 --> 00:42:34,029
did.

286
00:42:34,029 --> 00:42:51,709
But for the right thing, the wisest thing,
the only great thing that has to happen is

287
00:42:51,709 --> 00:42:58,828
Sahaja Yoga – where comfort is pouring on
us all the time, where all kinds of joy is

288
00:42:58,828 --> 00:43:10,279
pouring on us, where everything is being smoothed
out for you – people become so fond of comfort,

289
00:43:10,279 --> 00:43:18,448
and this and that, that the slightest sacrifice
they can’t understand.

290
00:43:18,448 --> 00:43:23,538
They’ll come with problems about their wives,
about their children, about their husbands

291
00:43:23,538 --> 00:43:24,738
– everything solved.

292
00:43:24,738 --> 00:43:28,059
Now this goes on and on and on and on.

293
00:43:28,059 --> 00:43:29,299
Solve them!

294
00:43:29,299 --> 00:43:30,388
Finish them off!

295
00:43:30,388 --> 00:43:32,438
Cut them short!

296
00:43:32,438 --> 00:43:36,649
You have to spread Sahaja Yoga!

297
00:43:36,649 --> 00:43:42,068
You have to sacrifice some time, you have
to sacrifice some money also.

298
00:43:42,068 --> 00:43:47,138
Who is going to work it out?

299
00:43:47,138 --> 00:43:56,229
Nobody is going to kill you, as people were
killed in Russia, or in Germany, or in Poland.

300
00:43:56,229 --> 00:44:00,948
Nobody is going to take away your children
or to take away your money, or anything – no

301
00:44:00,948 --> 00:44:05,029
one wants it.

302
00:44:05,029 --> 00:44:12,969
But this light in your hand has to be burnt
with the true desire, the pure desire within

303
00:44:12,969 --> 00:44:16,799
you, is the Kundalini.

304
00:44:16,799 --> 00:44:24,988
That is the wick, that is the one has to be
kept absolutely nourished.

305
00:44:24,988 --> 00:44:28,649
And that is where sahaja yogis fail.

306
00:44:28,649 --> 00:44:31,488
People don’t want to leave Sahaja Yoga.

307
00:44:31,488 --> 00:44:33,908
Even if you tell them, “Please go away,
we can’t help!”

308
00:44:33,908 --> 00:44:35,668
– “No, no, no, I cannot leave Sahaja Yoga.”

309
00:44:35,668 --> 00:44:36,668
– “Why?”

310
00:44:36,668 --> 00:44:37,758
Because is a place of enjoyment.

311
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:47,338
But it would be something different from human
beings, because human beings, if a human being

312
00:44:47,338 --> 00:44:55,409
gets a bottle of wine he’ll call ten more
to enjoy it.

313
00:44:55,409 --> 00:45:02,409
If a dog gets something to eat he’ll call
other dogs to eat it.

314
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:07,029
If a crow gets something to eat he’ll call
other crows to eat it.

315
00:45:07,029 --> 00:45:09,618
Naturally built within them.

316
00:45:09,618 --> 00:45:12,218
Same with human beings.

317
00:45:12,218 --> 00:45:18,998
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga we are not
that tenacious about it.

318
00:45:18,998 --> 00:45:23,688
We have to tell all our relations, “We are
Sahaja Yogis, and this is the religion of

319
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:28,198
within, and this is what it is – if you
don’t want to follow I have nothing to do

320
00:45:28,198 --> 00:45:29,198
with you.

321
00:45:29,198 --> 00:45:30,848
Why don’t you follow it?”

322
00:45:30,848 --> 00:45:32,508
Everybody has got relations.

323
00:45:32,508 --> 00:45:41,549
So on a Diwali day, when we were talking about
our light, what are we going to do with this

324
00:45:41,549 --> 00:45:42,549
light?

325
00:45:42,549 --> 00:45:45,638
Are we going to use it only for our own purpose?

326
00:45:45,638 --> 00:45:57,208
Christ has said, you don’t put the light
under a – what you call it? – measure.

327
00:45:57,208 --> 00:46:02,338
You don’t put it under a measure.

328
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:05,348
You put it on a table.

329
00:46:05,348 --> 00:46:08,909
We all have to come out in the public, we
have to find out ways and methods.

330
00:46:08,909 --> 00:46:14,969
It’s not only the leaders, everybody has
to work it out what we can do to spread Sahaja

331
00:46:14,969 --> 00:46:15,969
Yoga.

332
00:46:15,969 --> 00:46:19,899
In every place you go: how can we give Sahaja
Yoga?

333
00:46:19,899 --> 00:46:25,169
Of course I don’t want you to change your
dresses – but you can carry big badges.

334
00:46:25,169 --> 00:46:26,169
People will ask you.

335
00:46:26,169 --> 00:46:33,179
You should say, “Yes, this is the person
who has given us peace, joy and happiness.”

336
00:46:33,179 --> 00:46:38,118
Start talking like that, go to the markets,
go to public places.

337
00:46:38,118 --> 00:46:47,419
I go to market just to spread vibrations – you
all have to do that, otherwise you will have

338
00:46:47,419 --> 00:46:52,118
the Sahaja Yoga enjoyment to yourself , but
unless and until you share it you are not

339
00:46:52,118 --> 00:46:53,888
going to enjoy it fully.

340
00:46:53,888 --> 00:46:55,618
Look at Me.

341
00:46:55,618 --> 00:47:00,049
I have all the vibrations of the world.

342
00:47:00,049 --> 00:47:08,509
(Laughter) I have everything, I should be
such a self-contented person, sitting at home

343
00:47:08,509 --> 00:47:13,149
– in meditation.

344
00:47:13,149 --> 00:47:18,859
(Laughter) At this age, why should I travel
after all?

345
00:47:18,859 --> 00:47:25,969
(Laughter) I am the Adi Shakti – why should
I worry of making everybody such a powerful

346
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:27,888
shakti people?

347
00:47:27,888 --> 00:47:31,399
There’s no need.

348
00:47:31,399 --> 00:47:41,211
I should enjoy My powers, I can, but I cannot.

349
00:47:41,211 --> 00:47:43,169
I have to work hard.

350
00:47:43,169 --> 00:47:47,679
I give the maximum time to Sahaja Yoga, than
any one of you can give.

351
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:52,619
I have a family, I have got My husband.

352
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,319
He has a life which is very, very busy life.

353
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:57,009
I’ve got grandchildren.

354
00:47:57,009 --> 00:47:59,449
I give the maximum time.

355
00:47:59,449 --> 00:48:04,029
Now see, from here to Rome, then to France,
then to Spain.

356
00:48:04,029 --> 00:48:07,459
You all are having just a relay race.

357
00:48:07,459 --> 00:48:11,889
Alright, I am here – Italians are having
a little strain.

358
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:15,389
Then they will relax!

359
00:48:15,389 --> 00:48:18,429
“Now alright…”

360
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:23,189
(Laughter) Then, what do I do?

361
00:48:23,189 --> 00:48:27,619
All the year round I am going from places
to places…travelling.

362
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:32,659
And when I have everything.

363
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:43,989
Can you think of a rich man who is busy distributing
all the wealth he has, while the others take

364
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:46,389
time to take it?

365
00:48:46,389 --> 00:48:49,199
That is what it is.

366
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:58,119
So I have to tell you that you have to come
in a new dimension of your enthusiasm.

367
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:02,389
Sahaja Yoga is not for our enjoyment alone.

368
00:49:02,389 --> 00:49:04,129
“We are saints,” so what!

369
00:49:04,129 --> 00:49:05,219
For what?

370
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:07,509
For what you are made saints?

371
00:49:07,509 --> 00:49:11,959
It’s not that the men should only do, or
women should do, or this one should do, or

372
00:49:11,959 --> 00:49:13,799
that one should do.

373
00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:20,209
Don’t get involved into these temptations.

374
00:49:20,209 --> 00:49:26,839
There are thirteen temptations, which came
out of the churning.

375
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:35,419
The fourteenth one was a big hunter to neutralise
all the thirteen.

376
00:49:35,419 --> 00:49:43,739
Not that Sahaja Yoga wants to tempt anyone,
but they become temptations because they are

377
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:48,269
blessings to you, and blessings you start
using as temptations.

378
00:49:48,269 --> 00:50:01,079
Now, for anybody, to have such a temptation
would be more like a horse, which has to go

379
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:08,959
to the south or to the north, is standing
and eating the grass.

380
00:50:08,959 --> 00:50:15,489
You have to move, movement is the point, you
have to move from places to places, you have

381
00:50:15,489 --> 00:50:20,029
to go from villages to villages, you have
to go from houses to houses.

382
00:50:20,029 --> 00:50:22,709
This message has to spread.

383
00:50:22,709 --> 00:50:28,159
Christ’s twelve disciples only – how much
religion they have created?

384
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:33,669
Of course, it’s of no use, but still!

385
00:50:33,669 --> 00:50:37,039
You are going to give something so substantial
and so great.

386
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:40,269
But when you tell them, then the way you tell
them is important.

387
00:50:40,269 --> 00:50:46,979
The way you assert is important.

388
00:50:46,979 --> 00:50:51,079
I don’t mind from today – you can tell
them what I am.

389
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:52,319
Doesn’t matter.

390
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:53,889
How long are we going to hide it?

391
00:50:53,889 --> 00:50:58,619
You better tell them that, “She is such
and such, it’s written in the Bible, She

392
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:00,209
is such and such – we have found it.

393
00:51:00,209 --> 00:51:03,419
If you don’t want to see it, don’t see
it – but it is so.”

394
00:51:03,419 --> 00:51:13,999
Let’s have that determination and let’s
have that kind of a outspokenness.

395
00:51:13,999 --> 00:51:16,339
Look at these horrible politicians.

396
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:22,769
They say, “I believe that there should be
some people who should be rich, the rest should

397
00:51:22,769 --> 00:51:23,769
be poor.

398
00:51:23,769 --> 00:51:25,469
I believe.

399
00:51:25,469 --> 00:51:27,969
I believe in this and I believe in that.”

400
00:51:27,969 --> 00:51:29,509
What about you?

401
00:51:29,509 --> 00:51:33,879
You do not only believe, but you know for
definite!

402
00:51:33,879 --> 00:51:45,039
And that’s what should be decided on a Diwali
day that by next Diwali we have to get many,

403
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:46,669
many people for Sahaja Yoga.

404
00:51:46,669 --> 00:51:52,109
But when I speak, many people told Me that
they think I am not speaking to them [but]

405
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,919
to somebody else.

406
00:51:54,919 --> 00:52:00,039
You should see to the people who are working
harder than you for Sahaja Yoga; who are involved

407
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:04,949
more in Sahaja Yoga; those who are achieving
more in Sahaja Yoga – not the people who

408
00:52:04,949 --> 00:52:07,339
have done nothing.

409
00:52:07,339 --> 00:52:10,699
You can see Me.

410
00:52:10,699 --> 00:52:17,019
What are we doing?

411
00:52:17,019 --> 00:52:20,519
You should think about it.

412
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:24,219
Where are we?

413
00:52:24,219 --> 00:52:28,249
This is the most important period.

414
00:52:28,249 --> 00:52:32,959
At the most, in Europe, I will be for five
years more, at the most.

415
00:52:32,959 --> 00:52:39,889
Do you think I’ll be travelling after seventy
years of age?

416
00:52:39,889 --> 00:52:42,929
No.

417
00:52:42,929 --> 00:52:48,209
So this is such an important time when I am
here, then I could meet people, I could talk

418
00:52:48,209 --> 00:52:51,019
to them, I can help you a lot.

419
00:52:51,019 --> 00:52:53,569
In these five years you have to achieve something.

420
00:52:53,569 --> 00:52:59,099
And you have to take a jump and give a speed
to yourself.

421
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:05,699
Otherwise this is a very important time, will
be lost by all your fellow men.

422
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:08,129
Like the other day we had program.

423
00:53:08,129 --> 00:53:12,999
I’ll tell you a practical side: now what,
I would do [is] take the addresses of all

424
00:53:12,999 --> 00:53:20,859
the people who got realisation, take it down,
write to them, go and see them, meet them.

425
00:53:20,859 --> 00:53:23,779
[Find out] what has happened, why didn’t
they come.

426
00:53:23,779 --> 00:53:30,539
Then make a statement, why people didn’t
come, what happened, why is he not coming.

427
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:33,609
Write to them all the time.

428
00:53:33,609 --> 00:53:38,879
See you’ll be surprised if you take one
copy of ‘Reader’s Digest‘ (Magazine),

429
00:53:38,879 --> 00:53:41,959
only once – make a mistake.

430
00:53:41,959 --> 00:53:50,029
(Laughter) – they go on sending you so many
types of things, you know?

431
00:53:50,029 --> 00:53:56,039
(Laughter) You will get this present, you’ll
get – this is a car free for you, this thing

432
00:53:56,039 --> 00:53:57,039
for you.

433
00:53:57,039 --> 00:53:58,039
Who wants it?

434
00:53:58,039 --> 00:53:59,099
But they go on sending.

435
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:01,609
I have written to them, “Don’t send Me
anything.

436
00:54:01,609 --> 00:54:02,609
I don’t want any car – nothing.

437
00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:06,309
You just send Me Reader’s Digest, thank
you very much.

438
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:09,289
I’m not a lucky person.

439
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:11,669
Please don’t send.”

440
00:54:11,669 --> 00:54:14,849
Still they are sending!

441
00:54:14,849 --> 00:54:16,439
(Laughter & applause)

442
00:54:16,439 --> 00:54:20,329
In this way you must write to them all the
time, “Why are you not coming to Mother?

443
00:54:20,329 --> 00:54:22,389
Why you are not coming to Sahaja Yoga?

444
00:54:22,389 --> 00:54:26,189
Sahaja Yoga is so important, it has given
me so much, why don’t you want to have it?”

445
00:54:26,189 --> 00:54:30,049
You must show that earnestness within you.

446
00:54:30,049 --> 00:54:35,479
And if you do not show that earnestness – take
it in a mundane way, “Alright, it’s going

447
00:54:35,479 --> 00:54:39,209
well, this, that, is good, alright, this is
improving, that is.”

448
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:42,319
That’s not the way you are going to work
it out!

449
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:47,429
Once I go to India I know in India it will
take no time.

450
00:54:47,429 --> 00:54:51,659
India will work out very fast.

451
00:54:51,659 --> 00:55:00,609
And you have to book your seats in the heaven,
that’s very important.

452
00:55:00,609 --> 00:55:07,999
I mean, even for an aeroplane you have to
book a seat; then what about heaven?

453
00:55:07,999 --> 00:55:11,879
(Laughter) And so many have to book the seats.

454
00:55:11,879 --> 00:55:17,959
If all Indians are sitting there, what will
you do?

455
00:55:17,959 --> 00:55:21,869
(Laughter)

456
00:55:21,869 --> 00:55:30,499
So with this joy, with this happiness, with
this light on our face, with this beauty of

457
00:55:30,499 --> 00:55:34,489
enlightenment you are all gurus.

458
00:55:34,489 --> 00:55:38,479
Imagine, these useless [false] gurus know
nothing, their Kundalini is not awakened,

459
00:55:38,479 --> 00:55:42,269
nothing of that kind – and how much they
have built up their empires after empires.

460
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:49,209
I don’t say that you build up empires, no,
not that way, but why not build up at least

461
00:55:49,209 --> 00:55:57,279
a hut to show that you have achieved something
and it has to be done.

462
00:55:57,279 --> 00:56:01,479
Talk to everyone in your office, in your this
thing, not to feel shy.

463
00:56:01,479 --> 00:56:05,729
I have seen people put up these horrible peoples’
photographs everywhere.

464
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:10,419
In their office you go, you find them; in
the buses you find them; everywhere they are

465
00:56:10,419 --> 00:56:11,419
hanging.

466
00:56:11,419 --> 00:56:13,939
Why not My photograph?

467
00:56:13,939 --> 00:56:19,329
So the curiosity is there, people will ask
you, you tell them – it will work out.

468
00:56:19,329 --> 00:56:22,499
The best thing is working out in Italy, surprisingly.

469
00:56:22,499 --> 00:56:27,719
And it will go ahead, because we found some
very good people and you should try to find

470
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:30,039
out.

471
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:34,029
Such people who are around – get after them
and work it out.

472
00:56:34,029 --> 00:56:38,149
But don’t go to wrong people, must use your
discretion.

473
00:56:38,149 --> 00:56:43,049
You know how these [false] gurus work – is
very important.

474
00:56:43,049 --> 00:56:48,379
My brother was telling Me that a lady from
this Muktananda – now the Muktananda is

475
00:56:48,379 --> 00:56:53,249
not there, there is another American girl,
American-styled Indian girl.

476
00:56:53,249 --> 00:57:00,749
So, this Muktananda lady (disciple), one English
lady came to his house, My brother’s house

477
00:57:00,749 --> 00:57:04,199
– and she was very sweet, “I want to see
you, Sir,” – this, that.

478
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:05,669
And she saw My photograph.

479
00:57:05,669 --> 00:57:08,069
So she said, “What is this Mataji doing
here?”

480
00:57:08,069 --> 00:57:09,069
He said, “Why?

481
00:57:09,069 --> 00:57:10,759
She is my sister.”

482
00:57:10,759 --> 00:57:15,119
She just bundled up everything and ran away.

483
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,269
So My brother called her, “Please, come
along, sit down, sit down.

484
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:19,269
What do you do?”

485
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:24,399
She said, “No Sir, we see – we always
go and meet all the important people of the

486
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:27,209
city, talk to them about it.”

487
00:57:27,209 --> 00:57:29,739
He said, “Yes.”

488
00:57:29,739 --> 00:57:33,069
And all the judges’ names were on the list.

489
00:57:33,069 --> 00:57:36,199
Immediately My brother took the telephone
and told them, “Have nothing to do with

490
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:38,559
this woman!”

491
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,289
But this is what it is.

492
00:57:42,289 --> 00:57:44,619
You should find out how to approach people.

493
00:57:44,619 --> 00:57:48,459
When I am there, there are – say – 200
people.

494
00:57:48,459 --> 00:57:50,199
When I go away, there are only 2 people.

495
00:57:50,199 --> 00:57:51,199
Why?

496
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:52,199
What is the matter?

497
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:54,649
Why they go away?

498
00:57:54,649 --> 00:57:57,499
There must be some reason.

499
00:57:57,499 --> 00:58:00,729
They don’t know Me.

500
00:58:00,729 --> 00:58:03,179
At least get their addresses.

501
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:04,979
Find out who are these people.

502
00:58:04,979 --> 00:58:10,769
There’s no harm in getting their addresses
and finding out who they are.

503
00:58:10,769 --> 00:58:17,849
Then put them on the list and go on sending
letters to them, if not so much like Reader’s

504
00:58:17,849 --> 00:58:22,169
Digest, but something.

505
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:27,409
When you will start sending letters to them,
you will be entered into their ignorance.

506
00:58:27,409 --> 00:58:30,309
The light will go in.

507
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:34,519
Through your movement, your attention, the
light will go.

508
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:38,369
You don’t know your attention, how powerful
it is.

509
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:42,059
Once you start paying attention to them, the
light will pass through them.

510
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:46,229
If not today, tomorrow they’ll come round.

511
00:58:46,229 --> 00:58:51,009
You can also send My photograph, “Try on
the photograph, this is the photograph, you

512
00:58:51,009 --> 00:58:53,119
came to the program, we are very happy.”

513
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:58,609
Now if the follow-on doesn’t work out, try
this thing.

514
00:58:58,609 --> 00:59:05,609
And that’s the best way you can achieve
sometimes, but it is for you to think and

515
00:59:05,609 --> 00:59:09,829
understand – because you are human beings
and you know human beings.

516
00:59:09,829 --> 00:59:16,369
You just put yourself in the position of another
person – what would have appealed to you?

517
00:59:16,369 --> 00:59:26,339
There’s another thing I feel that people
should write books about Me.

518
00:59:26,339 --> 00:59:27,339
There’s no harm.

519
00:59:27,339 --> 00:59:31,469
But about Me, write the book about Me.

520
00:59:31,469 --> 00:59:36,749
But some people, who have a name, who have
in the society some name, who will be taken

521
00:59:36,749 --> 00:59:42,689
up seriously – they can write a book about
Me.

522
00:59:42,689 --> 00:59:46,899
They write books about everyone, why can’t
you write a book about Me?

523
00:59:46,899 --> 00:59:51,349
Not about, you can write about Sahaja Yoga
in it – of course, but you can write about

524
00:59:51,349 --> 00:59:52,349
Me.

525
00:59:52,349 --> 00:59:56,949
Telling people of such and such person is
there, and this is the solution, this is the

526
00:59:56,949 --> 00:59:57,949
hope.

527
00:59:57,949 --> 00:59:58,949
Why not?

528
00:59:58,949 --> 01:00:02,739
They write about all these horrible gurus,
why can’t you write about Me?

529
01:00:02,739 --> 01:00:07,359
But the person has to be a well known person.

530
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:15,709
Now supposing you write a book, somebody else
can publish in his name – if you are a good

531
01:00:15,709 --> 01:00:16,709
writer.

532
01:00:16,709 --> 01:00:18,999
Somebody else can edit it and publish it.

533
01:00:18,999 --> 01:00:20,899
We can do that way.

534
01:00:20,899 --> 01:00:26,899
There are so many ways and methods by which
you can bring to the notice of the people

535
01:00:26,899 --> 01:00:28,379
that this is Sahaja Yoga.

536
01:00:28,379 --> 01:00:31,469
How many people know about Sahaja Yoga?

537
01:00:31,469 --> 01:00:36,369
A person comes out of jail, from India, walks
out and here it is.

538
01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:46,109
Very well known ‘guru’ sitting in some
corner of some dirty lane in America somewhere,

539
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:47,509
and is a very well known person.

540
01:00:47,509 --> 01:00:59,639
They are all very well known – how?

541
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:04,889
And it is not always that these things are
done through money, they are done through

542
01:01:04,889 --> 01:01:10,199
people doing their own deliberation.

543
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:15,119
But these deliberations may be mesmerising,
bhootish, I agree.

544
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:20,089
I do understand that you are free people,
to do what you like, but in your freedom you

545
01:01:20,089 --> 01:01:22,269
have to realise.

546
01:01:22,269 --> 01:01:27,079
And this is what today you all have to decide
that this is the light we have got, this has

547
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:34,519
to be made into a beacon, not just a light,
a tinted light like that; what’s the use?

548
01:01:34,519 --> 01:01:38,529
We have to be like a beautiful tower of light.

549
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:43,879
Like a lighthouse.

550
01:01:43,879 --> 01:01:47,759
And everybody should work it out within and
without.

551
01:01:47,759 --> 01:01:50,659
Within though you have worked out, without
you must work now.

552
01:01:50,659 --> 01:01:55,219
And secondly there’s a deepawali, it is
not only one light.

553
01:01:55,219 --> 01:01:58,829
So we have to be all collective, try to get
to collective life.

554
01:01:58,829 --> 01:02:03,989
Whenever it is possible, try to attend all
that is collective; try to be there, where

555
01:02:03,989 --> 01:02:05,189
there is collective happenings.

556
01:02:05,189 --> 01:02:10,959
There, where it is collective, this source
of energy flows better.

557
01:02:10,959 --> 01:02:15,299
May God bless you all!
