1
00:00:01,774 --> 00:00:06,855
What enthusiasm all over the world!

2
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:15,277
The whole of Sydney, I think, has been
drenched of all their flowers.

3
00:00:16,102 --> 00:00:20,129
And such nice things to say,

4
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,507
the cards and the letters and the beautiful
poems,

5
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:32,272
the children are singing beautifully.

6
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:45,061
Words fail to express the feelings
of such jubilation

7
00:00:45,262 --> 00:00:49,760
and such sincere feeling of happiness.

8
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,506
You needed a Mother

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,536
to look after you, to care for you

10
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:19,734
and to be able to transform you

11
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:24,528
with lot of wisdom.

12
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:35,079
So every birthday I find

13
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:47,170
that Sahaja Yogis are also expanding
their hearts

14
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:56,832
and realizing that they are no more drops
but they are part and parcel of the ocean.

15
00:01:57,782 --> 00:02:07,557
And that the ocean itself is going
to strengthen them and look after them.

16
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:15,630
It’s the ocean that is going to nourish
them.

17
00:02:18,214 --> 00:02:25,124
And the same ocean is going to guide them.

18
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:29,909
So the connection between a drop 
and an ocean

19
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:36,325
has to be fully established.
So the limitations of a drop

20
00:02:36,526 --> 00:02:44,039
have to be absolutely dissolved
into the greatness of the ocean.

21
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:58,517
With care and with nice things to say

22
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:04,189
we can improve the depth
of the collectivity,

23
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,820
and with sincere desire to be collective.

24
00:03:10,392 --> 00:03:16,533
The desire to be collective has to be
very sincere.

25
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:25,830
So, this expanse of your being will start.

26
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:31,058
The first thing is needed: a sincerity
to yourself.

27
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:37,031
Of course, because we are coming
from a drop status,

28
00:03:37,232 --> 00:03:44,318
from a drop, a little limited drop,
from that phase,

29
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,969
so we get engulfed again and again
into those limitations.

30
00:03:51,950 --> 00:04:00,720
But we must see our own vision:
what you will be in future,

31
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:04,878
what you want to be in future.

32
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:11,290
Thus the sincerity itself to the idea
that you want to be collective,

33
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:17,836
itself, will break all barriers.

34
00:04:18,974 --> 00:04:24,931
If you are sincere to any purpose,
anything, then you forget the time,

35
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:28,893
you forget the labor, you forget
everything, you want to achieve it,

36
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:32,257
even in small things.

37
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:37,645
Now, this sincerity comes from where?

38
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:42,361
There are two things which work out
sincerity.

39
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:50,443
Firstly, you must see for yourself what
is Sahaja Yoga,

40
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:54,257
what it has given you.

41
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:59,847
It has given you Realization,

42
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:06,360
it has given you that wider vision, it has
given you collective consciousness,

43
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,468
it has given you thoughtless awareness
and doubtless awareness.

44
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:20,173
It has made a new personality out of you,
like an egg becoming a bird.

45
00:05:21,173 --> 00:05:26,347
And now you are a bird and you cannot
go back to the shell again.

46
00:05:28,503 --> 00:05:33,466
Once you realize what Sahaja Yoga
has done for you

47
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:40,354
and also realize what you have achieved
in that:

48
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:49,140
that is you have achieved the knowledge,
knowledge of Kundalini

49
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:54,790
which was a secret knowledge all these
years, absolutely secret knowledge.

50
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:59,172
Nobody knew about it, it was all
underground.

51
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:05,061
All the knowledge about Kundalini you have,
very clearly,

52
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:09,387
without going to any college, school,
university, anywhere.

53
00:06:09,588 --> 00:06:13,694
Without going to any laboratories you have
experimented with it,

54
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:17,589
you’ve found out what is Kundalini.
You have seen with your own eyes,

55
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:24,032
you’ve seen the rising of the Kundalini,
you have given Realization to people.

56
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:29,557
Already you have experienced not only
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

57
00:06:29,758 --> 00:06:34,073
but you have also experienced your
own powers.

58
00:06:34,734 --> 00:06:45,116
Also you have seen that you have really
become

59
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:49,823
so much different from what you were

60
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:54,966
in your knowledge of understanding things.

61
00:06:55,167 --> 00:07:01,477
So, if your knowledge is so much with you

62
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:06,405
and that you are entitled to raise
the Kundalini of others,

63
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:11,948
which was not done by any great saints
before

64
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:19,919
by any great Seers, Maharshis,
all these great people who lived.

65
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,855
Only very, very few people had
this capacity

66
00:07:23,056 --> 00:07:30,133
to raise the Kundalini, all these years,
that you have got it.

67
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:32,654
You understand what are the chakras

68
00:07:32,855 --> 00:07:37,355
and you can diagnose it, even the children
can do it.

69
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:42,011
Which we don’t realize is something
so great!

70
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:50,599
At a human level we didn’t know a word
about it.

71
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,743
We never even had heard the word
‘Kundalini’!

72
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:59,800
And in such a short time you have become
so knowledgeable!

73
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:04,082
That’s the blessing of Sahaja Yoga.

74
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:08,221
So, when you see this: that you have
so much knowledge

75
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:12,589
and the light of your attention,
how it works.

76
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:16,094
And then you see so many blessings
that work out

77
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:23,150
and how automatically, just without
doing anything, you achieve results,

78
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:32,269
you are amazed and you can’t understand
how it has happened, how it has worked out.

79
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:38,519
Suddenly I was there, this happened.
Suddenly I was there, that happened. How?

80
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:45,898
This ocean is every moment, into all
details, working out things.

81
00:08:48,982 --> 00:08:53,672
All these happenings should open
your eyes to the fact

82
00:08:53,873 --> 00:08:56,716
that you are no more like an ordinary
human being,

83
00:08:56,917 --> 00:09:00,853
that you are sages now, that you
are saints.

84
00:09:01,054 --> 00:09:04,406
So, our attitude has to be changed.

85
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:08,157
So many human beings are still animals:
you can see the way they are killing,

86
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:11,984
the way they are behaving - they are
not even human beings.

87
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:15,627
We live with them, we see them every day:
they are criminals

88
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:25,197
and not only that but they have very
low level of a culture in them.

89
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,074
We can easily call them as animals.

90
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:33,820
Then, we have some human beings who
are half animals and half human beings.

91
00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:40,844
Then, we have some human beings who
are really human beings, who are seekers.

92
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:46,831
(Hindi) Let them come forward if they
want to. (Hindi)

93
00:09:50,593 --> 00:10:01,386
And this understanding of what you have
achieved in Sahaja Yoga

94
00:10:01,587 --> 00:10:08,411
should immediately make you realize
what you are.

95
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:16,950
And when it all has happened to us,
automatically,

96
00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:21,043
you should be very sincere about it,

97
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:28,093
you must feel that something really 
you have achieved,

98
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,046
there’s something so great,

99
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:38,782
so we have to be sincere, mentally also
you should feel that way.

100
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:45,110
So, this is first thing you do is
to mentally feel, to mentally feel

101
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:54,143
that it’s so important, it is so -
it is so important,

102
00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:03,430
it is so valuable.

103
00:11:05,175 --> 00:11:09,103
You become very sincere about it.

104
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:18,249
But the second part is different:

105
00:11:19,966 --> 00:11:25,348
where you see something, you know something

106
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:30,070
and you start opening your heart about it.

107
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:36,486
In the second part you have to open
your heart.

108
00:11:36,687 --> 00:11:41,232
So, the sincerity comes from an open heart:

109
00:11:42,648 --> 00:11:46,109
if your heart is not open, you cannot
be sincere.

110
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:51,775
Now, what does it mean that your heart
is not open? Let us see.

111
00:11:55,592 --> 00:12:00,582
You are born again, you have got
your Realization.

112
00:12:00,783 --> 00:12:04,849
Also it is your birthday in a way.

113
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:12,105
But in the growth of your knowledge
and understanding,

114
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:16,872
you have not kept pace with your heart.

115
00:12:17,073 --> 00:12:24,366
But what is the reason for that? What is it
that keeps your heart like that?

116
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,869
You can discover very easily that
your heart rules the body,

117
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,193
rules your brain, everything.

118
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:43,600
Because if your heart stops, everything
stops.

119
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:48,826
But if your brain stops, heart won’t stop.

120
00:12:49,027 --> 00:12:55,819
So, heart is the most important thing and
it governs the whole being within you.

121
00:12:56,358 --> 00:13:05,960
Now, this special instrument, which is
very delicate,

122
00:13:06,227 --> 00:13:15,901
which circulates also, is like a stone.

123
00:13:16,102 --> 00:13:19,376
How will it pulsate?

124
00:13:21,647 --> 00:13:25,638
So, when we say ‘enlarge your heart’,

125
00:13:26,662 --> 00:13:32,351
it means that the stoniness of your heart
has to be melted away.

126
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:39,723
But how does it become stony? We have
to go to the roots of that.

127
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:48,208
It becomes like a stone because the heart
controls the brain.

128
00:13:49,172 --> 00:13:52,227
As there are seven auras on your brain,

129
00:13:52,428 --> 00:13:56,478
in the same way, there are seven auras
on your heart.

130
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:05,464
And all those auras are the ones which
control the auras of the brain.

131
00:14:08,112 --> 00:14:16,466
Now, on the brain, as you know, there are
two institutions of ego and conditionings,

132
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:24,445
which starts pressing the brain too much.
As a result, all these auras get pressed.

133
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:31,548
So, the auras which are surrounding
the heart also get pressed.

134
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:38,299
But brain can think:

135
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,620
‘Yes, this is very good. I know how
to raise Kundalini, I know how to do this,

136
00:14:41,821 --> 00:14:45,775
everything I know’, part tells (?).

137
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:51,508
It doesn’t become stony that way,
it can think.

138
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:58,433
Anybody who is a stone-hearted fellow
can think. Like Hitler.

139
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:08,497
So, the brain does not get affected
by the conditioning or the ego

140
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:13,209
to such an extent that it becomes like
a stone, it cannot think.

141
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:18,314
If it is ego too much… (Just closer
if you bring, it would be better.

142
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:21,146
It goes on falling, I’m holding it on.)

143
00:15:21,347 --> 00:15:28,186
If it’s an ego, then a person may become
stupid, but he thinks, he thinks all right.

144
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:34,575
He really becomes stupid. Anybody
who is an egoist,

145
00:15:34,776 --> 00:15:41,517
whose Agnya is catching, becomes
a stupid fellow, no doubt about it.

146
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:47,588
You see in his behaviour, whenever
he talks, the way he is trying

147
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:54,141
to do anything, he’s such a show-off
and he becomes a stupid fellow.

148
00:15:54,342 --> 00:15:59,353
Any wise person can see that, that
he is such a stupid man.

149
00:15:59,554 --> 00:16:12,863
So, what we find, that mind is covered
with the superego

150
00:16:13,064 --> 00:16:20,318
but it does not make a person with
a brain which is stony.

151
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:32,875
On the contrary, it makes a person
a stupid person, not a stone-headed.

152
00:16:33,974 --> 00:16:39,348
And such a stupid man can go on
talking all kinds of things.

153
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:45,778
And you can immediately recognize
such a stupid man, not difficult.

154
00:16:46,054 --> 00:16:49,949
The other side of this is the conditionings
in the mind.

155
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,204
That’s even a worse thing, very sly.

156
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:58,359
Because somebody has the conditionings,
he doesn’t come out of it.

157
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,622
He doesn’t show off, but he's sly

158
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:10,759
and his brain is covered with such ideas
which are asahaj.

159
00:17:11,081 --> 00:17:17,582
Like somebody saw Me, in a Puja, washing
My hands and giving that water;

160
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:24,801
he said: ‘Why do you take the water which
is washed, which is washing Mother’s hands?’

161
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:29,373
So, the other one said: ‘Mother has got
such tremendous vibrations in Her hands,

162
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:35,915
that when we wash them, the vibrations
come in.’

163
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:40,200
Oh, he couldn’t believe it! Because
the conditionings are

164
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,558
that whenever you wash your hands,
only the dirt comes out.

165
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:47,691
So, they can’t think of vibrations.

166
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:52,242
All such conditionings are there
in the mind of people.

167
00:17:52,443 --> 00:17:58,289
Because of these conditionings they
cannot take to heart.

168
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:05,066
But what happens that they think about it
in a very sly manner,

169
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:14,506
tell lies, talk nonsensical things and
try to convince you that they are right.

170
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,593
They are not stupid, but they are idiotic.

171
00:18:23,621 --> 00:18:26,646
They talk like idiots.

172
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:32,542
And that idiotic thing you accept!
There’s no wisdom in it.

173
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:38,589
So, one fellow is a stupid fellow,
another one is an idiot.

174
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:43,656
Between the two lies the Sahaja Yogi.

175
00:18:44,314 --> 00:18:56,039
So, this conditioning makes the brain
pervert,

176
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:05,552
but it doesn’t make it a stone.
Only what makes it a stone

177
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:12,684
is that if he is born with some sort
of a mental derangement,

178
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:17,453
that he cannot think, otherwise the brain
goes on thinking.

179
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:22,428
Whether with conditionings or with ego,
it goes on thinking.

180
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:27,338
Such a brain

181
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:35,413
should not affect the heart, because
heart affects the brain.

182
00:19:35,614 --> 00:19:41,000
But the auras which are manifested
from the heart

183
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:47,089
start becoming dull or disappearing.

184
00:19:47,565 --> 00:19:52,584
So the auras around the heart are
very sensitive

185
00:19:52,785 --> 00:19:58,219
and they feel: ‘No use throwing light
on the brain’.

186
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:06,568
They start becoming smaller and smaller
and that’s how the heart becomes small.

187
00:20:07,794 --> 00:20:13,631
Because they have no purpose in life there,
so they start becoming smaller and smaller.

188
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:16,459
As a result, the heart becomes small.

189
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:21,774
You call somebody as very small-hearted
fellow, is a chicken-hearted fellow

190
00:20:21,975 --> 00:20:26,693
or we always say such a man is
a ‘stone-hearted person’.

191
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:29,659
All this happens

192
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:35,440
because of the conditionings and the ego
of the human mind

193
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:46,649
and the result is felt by the heart
becoming a stone,

194
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:52,631
because heart is a sensitive thing.
Brain is not that sensitive.

195
00:20:52,832 --> 00:20:58,080
If you put something soft in the water,
it becomes hard,

196
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,423
but if you put a stone in the water
and boil it, it won’t.

197
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:08,239
So, heart being very sensitive and delicate
becomes like a stone,

198
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,057
like as you boil in the heat of the brain
waves.

199
00:21:13,258 --> 00:21:18,474
And it becomes a very hard stone.
It does not know

200
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:24,294
how to say even one word which is nice.

201
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:27,999
It goes on hitting people all the time,

202
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,747
saying things which one should not
have said,

203
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:39,430
all the time thinking, ‘What should we say
to hurt another person?

204
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,199
How should I try to really mislead
another person?’

205
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,542
because it’s a sly attitude.

206
00:21:49,585 --> 00:21:58,184
The ego part, the heart becomes again
frozen with ego

207
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:02,146
and then the heart thinks - not thinks,

208
00:22:02,347 --> 00:22:07,520
but heart cannot emit any auras
to the brain.

209
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:12,616
The brain starts thinking that, ‘Now,
the area of heart is finished.

210
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:18,414
The heart cannot control us any more.’
Then heart starts thinking that,

211
00:22:18,615 --> 00:22:23,543
‘I will do all the work myself.’ I mean,
the head starts saying.

212
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,309
And the heart becomes small, stony.
It doesn’t act.

213
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:32,956
So now, the brain takes over. The brain
takes over and then brain starts.

214
00:22:33,157 --> 00:22:39,393
Brain starts itself acting in a manner
that we can’t understand:

215
00:22:39,594 --> 00:22:45,956
they behave like animals, they behave
like satanic people, they become very cruel

216
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:52,940
and they do not know how to really say
something good to others.

217
00:22:53,141 --> 00:22:56,562
There’s a kind of a very false pride
in them

218
00:22:56,763 --> 00:23:02,249
and such people go on hurting others,
insulting others

219
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:08,569
till they meet another one like them
and then both of them collapse.

220
00:23:11,494 --> 00:23:14,407
That’s the only snag in the whole thing,

221
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:17,242
otherwise, you would have been finished
by now.

222
00:23:17,443 --> 00:23:25,279
But because the two persons with ego cannot
be together, they neutralize each other.

223
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,821
So thank God we are saved from them.

224
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:37,489
So these two conditionings, which actually
are on the brain,

225
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:49,872
these two conditions freeze the heart and
also make the domain of heart as zero

226
00:23:50,073 --> 00:23:54,776
and then the brain starts asserting itself.

227
00:23:56,883 --> 00:24:01,963
That is how we do not know how to be
kind to others,

228
00:24:02,164 --> 00:24:06,385
how to be nice, how to be helpful,
how to be gentle

229
00:24:06,586 --> 00:24:13,382
and how to be reassuring, protecting
others.

230
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:22,001
All this we have inherited already.

231
00:24:22,202 --> 00:24:25,736
We have already got a stone heart
when we come to Sahaja Yoga

232
00:24:25,937 --> 00:24:30,177
and we have a brain either full of ego
or superego.

233
00:24:30,378 --> 00:24:36,842
So now, with your Kundalini rising, you can
clear out your head, first of all.

234
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:42,045
So, the sincerity will come when
the Kundalini will move

235
00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:49,355
and touch your Brahmarandhra, which is
the seat of your heart and will expand.

236
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:53,192
Then the heart just comes back
like a king, returns back

237
00:24:53,393 --> 00:24:56,926
and starts dominating the brain.

238
00:24:57,127 --> 00:25:00,636
And when the heart comes back,
you immediately find

239
00:25:00,837 --> 00:25:02,735
those people with whom we were angry,

240
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:06,644
we would not talk, we had nothing to do,
suddenly, we become friendly with them.

241
00:25:06,845 --> 00:25:13,596
There’s no problem. In many ways,
people have harmed you.

242
00:25:13,797 --> 00:25:18,776
All that harming and everything just
disappears.

243
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:22,823
And you start becoming so nice
and beautiful.

244
00:25:23,024 --> 00:25:26,830
What has happened that Kundalini has
touched your Brahmarandhra,

245
00:25:27,031 --> 00:25:31,376
where is the seat of heart. And as soon
as that opens out,

246
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:36,531
your heart also opens and it gets awakened.
It thinks, ‘Oh, what?

247
00:25:36,732 --> 00:25:40,493
I have allowed this brain to rule me?
How dare it rules me!’

248
00:25:40,694 --> 00:25:45,159
It just jumps on it. And we have seen
people:

249
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,951
suddenly, they’re so much transformed
that it’s remarkable.

250
00:25:50,152 --> 00:25:54,778
There - one gentleman in America,
he said that, ‘Mother, after Realization

251
00:25:54,979 --> 00:26:02,327
I was so much changed that I’ve become
a very mild person

252
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:05,608
and I never used to wish my uncle
or anyone.’

253
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:10,352
So he met him in some sort of a fete
and then he said, ‘Hello, uncle!’

254
00:26:10,553 --> 00:26:16,389
The uncle started looking at him. ‘Are you
all right?’ He would never say that.

255
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:20,389
Then he went and saw: ‘Are you all right,
uncle? Are you keeping all right?

256
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,393
Can I do something for you?’
Very nice things he said.

257
00:26:23,594 --> 00:26:28,070
Uncle said, ‘What have you been doing?
Are you drunk or what?

258
00:26:28,271 --> 00:26:32,805
How can you speak so sweetly to me?
I can’t believe it.’

259
00:26:33,393 --> 00:26:37,220
That’s what happens. And that’s why
we have to understand

260
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:41,145
that all these things can be easily
dropped out

261
00:26:41,346 --> 00:26:46,493
because we have acquired them. They can be
finished off because we have acquired them.

262
00:26:46,694 --> 00:26:51,239
They need not be all our lives,
our relations.

263
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,343
So, ego and superego, both can be
blasted off

264
00:26:56,544 --> 00:26:59,070
once your heart is awakened.

265
00:26:59,271 --> 00:27:05,959
So, when we are dealing with people,
we have to break the ice also

266
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,121
by communicating with others in a very
decent manner.

267
00:27:10,322 --> 00:27:15,265
Like telling yourself, ‘No, I don't believe
that this man is so bad.

268
00:27:15,466 --> 00:27:20,673
Let me look after him, he may be all right.
You see, I don’t think he’s so bad.’

269
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:24,763
So, to accept somebody as bad is very
easy for human beings

270
00:27:24,964 --> 00:27:27,353
and once they start accepting such a thing,

271
00:27:27,554 --> 00:27:30,314
then they build up a kind of a fortress
in which they live

272
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:35,901
and they think they are the best people
and nobody else are good.

273
00:27:36,102 --> 00:27:40,142
And thus, the whole community, the whole
society,

274
00:27:40,343 --> 00:27:45,635
the whole humanity gets bitten
by these ideas.

275
00:27:49,062 --> 00:27:55,246
And Sahaja Yoga is the only way which
is going to cure it.

276
00:27:55,447 --> 00:28:00,845
Sahaja Yoga is the only way which is going
to finish this.

277
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:07,536
And that part is to be played
by you people,

278
00:28:07,737 --> 00:28:11,797
to understand that sincerity can only
come if you raise

279
00:28:11,998 --> 00:28:17,646
your Kundalini again and again and open
your Brahmarandhra.

280
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:26,239
Then your heart will rise. It will become
a very awakened personality

281
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,538
and it will take charge of your brain,

282
00:28:28,739 --> 00:28:32,573
which is all the time thinking, thinking,
thinking, like mad.

283
00:28:32,774 --> 00:28:35,824
And once that happens, then you will
realize

284
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:40,385
that now you have jumped into doubtless
awareness.

285
00:28:42,174 --> 00:28:46,836
So, the relationship between the two
has to be fully understood.

286
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:52,217
At first, the domination of the heart or,
we can say, the kinghood of heart

287
00:28:52,418 --> 00:28:56,799
is challenged, is put down, brought
to zero.

288
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,269
And then this brain becomes the king,
and it starts ruling us.

289
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:11,821
‘I think…’, ‘I feel…’ means the brain,
the ego.

290
00:29:12,022 --> 00:29:22,459
If you could give up ‘I think…’, ‘I want…’,
everything will be all right.

291
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:27,983
You should say, ‘“I want…” is not
the point. This body wants it.’

292
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:33,343
You separate yourself. Gradually you start
separating yourself

293
00:29:33,544 --> 00:29:36,357
from all such situations by never saying
‘I want…’

294
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:41,876
You should say, ‘This body…’,
‘This hand…’, ‘This head…’

295
00:29:42,077 --> 00:29:45,078
You start separating. And once you have
separated,

296
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:51,187
all these barriers of ego and superego
will disappear.

297
00:29:51,388 --> 00:29:57,078
But, as it is, also it’s very easy to get
rid of these two.

298
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,871
It’s very easy to get rid of these two.

299
00:30:00,072 --> 00:30:06,045
Only by raising your Kundalini and breaking
your Brahmarandhra.

300
00:30:06,246 --> 00:30:08,985
This is the greatest achievement that
you have got,

301
00:30:09,186 --> 00:30:11,861
that you can break your Brahmarandhra,

302
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:15,857
make your Kundalini get connected
with the All-pervading Power.

303
00:30:16,058 --> 00:30:18,171
That’s why I always say you must meditate

304
00:30:18,372 --> 00:30:21,776
and you must be in thoughtless awareness,
then it works out.

305
00:30:21,977 --> 00:30:24,803
Don’t pay attention to outside things
so much.

306
00:30:25,004 --> 00:30:36,142
Of course, you are, in a way, responsible
for Sahaja Yoga,

307
00:30:36,343 --> 00:30:41,724
because you are sincere about it.
You cannot force yourself.

308
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:45,525
So, again and again I say, you weigh
your sincerity.

309
00:30:45,726 --> 00:30:49,799
‘How sincere am I to Sahaja Yoga?’

310
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:58,719
And some people just take it frivolously,

311
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:05,831
saying ‘Mother, I was silly, I was
confused.’ You cannot say that!

312
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:16,805
You cannot say, because you owe
these things to Sahaja Yoga.

313
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:22,324
Everything you owe to Sahaja Yoga now.
It’s a new life to you.

314
00:31:22,525 --> 00:31:29,465
So you cannot say, ‘I was confused’
or ‘I was silly, I was stupid, I did this.’

315
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:32,088
You tell yourself you can’t do it.

316
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:35,393
Mother has really worked very hard
with full sincerity

317
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:40,963
and we cannot be insincere about it.
We don’t want to be hypocrites.

318
00:31:41,751 --> 00:31:50,598
This is hypocrisy, absolute hypocrisy.
You say something and do something.

319
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:56,400
If you have any sense of gratitude and
self-respect, then you should never say that

320
00:31:56,601 --> 00:32:02,198
‘By mistake, I did this, Mother’ or ‘I was
confused, I was silly, I was stupid.’

321
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,393
That shows you are a very mediocre person
and you have no sense

322
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:12,070
of gratitude towards Sahaja Yoga
nor towards yourself.

323
00:32:12,271 --> 00:32:17,414
But the best part of it, that I don’t need
Sahaja Yog

324
00:32:17,615 --> 00:32:23,510
and that Sahaja Yoga does not need you. 
You need Sahaja Yoga.

325
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:28,425
In itself, Sahaja Yoga is complete.
It does not need you.

326
00:32:28,626 --> 00:32:37,222
It is a complete thing, will remain
like that, absolutely.

327
00:32:39,154 --> 00:32:43,660
It will have its own position,

328
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:49,278
its own status, its own dignity,
everything intact.

329
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:56,319
But if you have to get something out of it,
you have to work it out.

330
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:01,209
Like from the river Ganges, if you have
to fetch the water,

331
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:06,140
you must have proper pitchers which are
deep enough to receive the water.

332
00:33:06,341 --> 00:33:09,588
But if you take a stone, what can you
bring out of it?

333
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:15,722
But the Ganges flows. It is what it is.
It has its own capacities in it.

334
00:33:15,923 --> 00:33:20,218
It doesn’t change because you people
have taken stones.

335
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:25,748
So now you have to understand that raise
your Kundalini as many times as you can.

336
00:33:25,949 --> 00:33:29,119
Try to put attention to your Kundalini
all the time.

337
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,161
See where is the problem is. Get it
cleared out, absolutely cleared out.

338
00:33:33,362 --> 00:33:37,619
Find out where is the problem is and raise
your Kundalini many a times

339
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:43,230
and see that you are flowing all right
on your fontanel bone area,

340
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:45,880
so that your heart expands.

341
00:33:46,081 --> 00:33:49,350
It’s a mechanical process in a way,
you can say.

342
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:51,712
But even that you people don’t do.

343
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:54,350
If you had done that, your heart would
have increased.

344
00:33:54,551 --> 00:34:00,499
And you yourself will say, ‘Mother,
my heart has become large like Asia.’

345
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,580
And then you see the miracle of the heart,
how it emits vibrations

346
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:09,524
by which you become such compassionate,
such dynamic,

347
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:14,456
beautiful people and so sincere
to Sahaja Yoga.

348
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,599
I would request you to open your heart 
today for this puja.

349
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,767
You have been very jubilant and happy.

350
00:34:21,968 --> 00:34:25,355
And must be your heart must have opened
because I’ve seen Sahaja Yogis

351
00:34:25,556 --> 00:34:30,761
have a very large heart for Me, but
for themselves they don’t have.

352
00:34:30,962 --> 00:34:35,743
They’ll do everything for Me, but nothing
for themselves.

353
00:34:35,944 --> 00:34:39,528
They’ll work morning till evening
to decorate the hall, to do everything.

354
00:34:39,734 --> 00:34:43,413
They must have sent all these flowers
to Me from I don’t know where.

355
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:48,483
But if I tell them, ‘You meditate for
yourself’, that they will not do.

356
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,464
Or ‘You achieve this for yourself’,
that they will not do.

357
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,217
This is the situation.

358
00:34:56,418 --> 00:35:00,944
So, instead of wasting all your energy
for decorating all these things,

359
00:35:01,145 --> 00:35:04,058
you should decorate yourself
within yourself.

360
00:35:04,259 --> 00:35:07,197
With sincerity, with nice thoughts
about yourself

361
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:11,677
that you are capable, absolutely capable
people

362
00:35:11,878 --> 00:35:17,365
and you can use your imagination,

363
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:22,450
your intelligence, rationality, whatever
you think you have,

364
00:35:22,651 --> 00:35:31,300
to find the way, to find the way, again
I say, to keep your heart large.

365
00:35:32,895 --> 00:35:37,952
And this is the message for today’s
birthday all over the world

366
00:35:38,153 --> 00:35:45,134
because I felt that the whole world was
today like a big heart pulsating.

367
00:35:45,335 --> 00:35:50,131
I received the last phone and came here.

368
00:35:54,077 --> 00:35:56,998
From all over the phones coming,

369
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,127
flowers are showering, the beautiful nice
things they are saying.

370
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:06,313
Everything is there. When I am just
drenched into it,

371
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:11,150
just drenched, it was too much for Me.
Such sweet, sweet things for the children,

372
00:36:11,351 --> 00:36:13,902
from the children, such things from
the ladies,

373
00:36:14,103 --> 00:36:18,924
some very, very nice from the men
and it was amazing

374
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:25,670
how these people are bubbling with
enjoyment that today is My birthday.

375
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:33,102
In the same way, please consider that
every day is your birthday,

376
00:36:33,303 --> 00:36:36,346
that you have to raise your Kundalini
all the time

377
00:36:36,547 --> 00:36:40,898
and keep the standard of your Kundalini
higher and higher.

378
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:45,372
The more you open out, the more threads
of Kundalini will come up

379
00:36:45,573 --> 00:36:50,202
and the more your heart will open out

380
00:36:50,403 --> 00:36:53,858
and it will be awakened, it will become
more powerful.

381
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:57,274
And with an open, big heart and a powerful
heart,

382
00:36:57,475 --> 00:37:02,686
you can dominate your brain, which is
giving you all these funny ideas.

383
00:37:02,983 --> 00:37:06,921
I hope this will happen this year here

384
00:37:07,122 --> 00:37:13,846
and people will try to make it a point
that we have a large heart.

385
00:37:14,047 --> 00:37:17,621
Large heart doesn’t mean stupidity,
doesn’t mean that.

386
00:37:17,822 --> 00:37:24,812
Large heart means the heart in which
you can put Me in.

387
00:37:26,471 --> 00:37:30,221
It’s quite a big person, Myself,

388
00:37:30,422 --> 00:37:34,878
so you have to have a very large heart
that I could reside into your heart.

389
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:39,239
That is the large heart and that’s what
you all should have.

390
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,854
If that happens, then everything
will work out very well.

391
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:49,114
So, the surrendering part of it: you must
know how to surrender

392
00:37:49,315 --> 00:37:53,079
and you must know how to keep whatever
is not surrendered,

393
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,378
because you surrender yourself

394
00:37:57,791 --> 00:38:04,312
in such a manner that you expand
your heart absolutely.

395
00:38:04,513 --> 00:38:10,586
Put Me down there and then keep
your flowers with you

396
00:38:10,787 --> 00:38:20,177
to be given to Me at a time when you are
in complete control of yourself.

397
00:38:20,378 --> 00:38:25,824
So you have your emotions, your feelings
like flowers,

398
00:38:26,025 --> 00:38:32,331
that you have to keep to yourself, which are
the part of the same ocean of your heart.

399
00:38:32,532 --> 00:38:41,183
And, once you are ready, everything is
done, if the whole house is ready,

400
00:38:41,384 --> 00:38:44,497
now bring the flowers, the emotions,

401
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:48,968
the nice things, the beautiful things
and nourish them.

402
00:38:49,169 --> 00:38:52,251
One must learn, I think, there should
be some books

403
00:38:52,452 --> 00:38:57,167
about how to say nice things to others.

404
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:01,696
We should try to find some books like that
or should write some books

405
00:39:01,897 --> 00:39:06,485
how nice things could be said, how we can
take care of others,

406
00:39:06,686 --> 00:39:14,385
how we can make another feel our love,
the expression of love,

407
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:18,516
and that work, such a book will really
help people to understand

408
00:39:18,717 --> 00:39:23,458
that this is nice to say. And once you say
something nice to other,

409
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:28,360
that niceness comes back, as I have
told you,

410
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:31,439
like the ripples that touch the shores
come back

411
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:38,558
and then you feel very happy. Go on saying
things which are nice,

412
00:39:38,759 --> 00:39:43,160
which are pleasing, will be very much
appreciated.

413
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,314
But if you say it with sincerity, not just
to tease someone

414
00:39:47,515 --> 00:39:51,536
or to say something, just to be so
superficially good,

415
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:57,168
like ‘Thank you, thank you, thank you,’ but
something from your heart, as they say,

416
00:39:57,369 --> 00:40:01,617
then you will be surprised that the heart
of the another person will open

417
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:09,315
and from that heart will flow those
beautiful flowers of emotions towards you.

418
00:40:09,516 --> 00:40:14,432
So, on one side, you have to expand
your heart and on another side,

419
00:40:14,633 --> 00:40:17,690
you have to reserve or preserve

420
00:40:17,891 --> 00:40:21,781
all the beautiful, nice, delicate feelings
within yourself,

421
00:40:21,982 --> 00:40:26,358
absorbed from everywhere and then
to pour them out at the right point.

422
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,251
That’s the art.

423
00:40:30,158 --> 00:40:34,565
Like these flowers were in the garden first 
to begin with, preserved, preserved.

424
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:38,903
At the right time they were brought in.
So they feel more glorified

425
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,397
that they are used at the right time.

426
00:40:41,598 --> 00:40:45,710
This is the way we have to be with
ourselves in our heart

427
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:52,670
because human beings are very delicate,
very beautiful things

428
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:56,619
and to beautify them you have to say
beautiful things.

429
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:02,319
This tongue is not for saying harsh things,
for making fun of others,

430
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,550
for teasing others, but is for saying
something, such a beautiful thing

431
00:41:07,751 --> 00:41:13,266
that the another person also imbibes
that beauty.

432
00:41:14,228 --> 00:41:19,763
I’ve seen some nice things people have said
and that lingers in My mind.

433
00:41:19,964 --> 00:41:24,259
And I said, ‘When will I have chance to say
these things to others?’

434
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,796
So, think about it, that ‘Now this is
a very nice sentence,'

435
00:41:27,997 --> 00:41:34,738
‘This was a very sweet thing they said.
All right. So now, where should I use this?’

436
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:38,393
As I go to the shops, I see something:
‘Ah, that’s good.

437
00:41:38,594 --> 00:41:41,803
That will be good for particular person.
Let’s buy that.’

438
00:41:42,004 --> 00:41:45,919
In the same way, if you find these nice 
feelings

439
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:51,629
and nice emotions and nice things said,
then what do you do?

440
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:56,397
You collect them, all these things,
keep them and use them

441
00:41:56,598 --> 00:42:04,246
at the right time, at the right place. This
is what is the wisdom of Shri Ganesha.

442
00:42:04,446 --> 00:42:10,435
Innocent people are the most sincere
people, innocent people.

443
00:42:10,636 --> 00:42:14,415
Those who are clever and cunning cannot
be sincere

444
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:16,664
because they enjoy their cunningness,

445
00:42:16,865 --> 00:42:22,584
they enjoy their so-called ‘brilliance”.
They can never be.

446
00:42:22,785 --> 00:42:31,509
Those people who are simple, who are
loving,

447
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:36,247
who care for love more than anything else,

448
00:42:36,448 --> 00:42:43,763
can only say very nice things sincerely.

449
00:42:43,964 --> 00:42:54,129
Today I wanted to say many things to you,
how I feel

450
00:42:54,330 --> 00:43:02,148
about this birthday in Australia,
but I told you the words fail.

451
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:05,429
Because - see, Australia is such
a far-off country.

452
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:12,429
To come here with so many people sitting
and singing ‘Agata Swagata’.

453
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:17,148
It is unbelievable, unbelievable,

454
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:20,670
because I have not given you any money,
you have not given Me any money,

455
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:24,930
you are not bound to say anything
like that.

456
00:43:26,288 --> 00:43:31,665
But not only that you are doing it, but
you are enjoying it.

457
00:43:32,197 --> 00:43:35,680
It’s something great. You’re enjoying it
and that’s what it is:

458
00:43:35,881 --> 00:43:40,904
that when your heart is large, then
whatever you do for others, you enjoy.

459
00:43:41,105 --> 00:43:44,773
You enjoy doing good things. You enjoy
saying nice things.

460
00:43:44,974 --> 00:43:49,735
So we should have choicest flowers
of beautiful sayings,

461
00:43:49,936 --> 00:43:53,399
we should have choicest emotions

462
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,839
which we should be able to express
to each other.

463
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,464
Now start on that from today, I have
to say: you start on this,

464
00:44:01,665 --> 00:44:05,716
that from 1990 we are all the time
going to speak

465
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:09,919
something beautiful to each other 
all the time

466
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,783
and just keep your ears open, keep your
eyes open and wherever you get a chance,

467
00:44:15,984 --> 00:44:21,878
wherever you hear something like that,
keep it in your mind and use it back.

468
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:28,271
Today I am so enamored and it is too much
for Me, really,

469
00:44:28,472 --> 00:44:33,329
to believe even that there are so many
Sahaja Yogis

470
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:37,430
in Australia, which is so far away.

471
00:44:37,631 --> 00:44:42,778
Now it is your responsibility. It is
your responsibility

472
00:44:42,979 --> 00:44:48,548
to be sincere about Sahaja Yoga, and in all
sincerity, if you do everything,

473
00:44:48,749 --> 00:44:53,359
you’ll never think of such funny arguments
which I’ve heard before.

474
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:59,028
You’ll just think that, ‘We love Mother
and we have together, to be together,

475
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:01,825
and we have to love each other
and all the time

476
00:45:02,026 --> 00:45:08,099
we have to say nice things to each other
so that the love increases.’

477
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:16,975
Anything else, anybody who tries to say
things

478
00:45:18,491 --> 00:45:25,841
or break things or breaks somebody’s heart
are doing sinful things. There’s sin.

479
00:45:26,042 --> 00:45:28,766
To break the heart of a saint is
the greatest sin

480
00:45:28,967 --> 00:45:31,886
and they’ll be punished for that.

481
00:45:32,087 --> 00:45:37,941
So, now you are all saints and sages,
you have to respect each other.

482
00:45:38,142 --> 00:45:46,832
Not only that, but you have to be enjoying
your sincerity.

483
00:45:47,033 --> 00:45:50,479
That’s the way, I’m trying to say,
enjoy your sincerity.

484
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,499
And all these stupid thoughts come
into your head, throw them away.

485
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:57,699
Because I heard of so many arguments
here and there and I thought,

486
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:02,824
‘What is this? They are Sahaja Yogis or
they are ordinary people of the street?’

487
00:46:03,025 --> 00:46:06,098
This is happening and then the children,
this happening, that.

488
00:46:06,299 --> 00:46:11,020
Now, about children also, I’ve been telling
you that: send your children to India.

489
00:46:11,221 --> 00:46:14,185
In any case, you have been selfish
about them.

490
00:46:14,386 --> 00:46:18,817
You know they are not developing all right.
So send them to India.

491
00:46:19,018 --> 00:46:23,220
In that you have opened your heart because
the whole world is your relation,

492
00:46:23,421 --> 00:46:29,183
the whole world is your family. You go
anywhere in the whole world, you will find

493
00:46:29,384 --> 00:46:34,627
people who’ll love you, who’ll care for
you, who’ll do everything for you.

494
00:46:34,828 --> 00:46:38,338
I mean, to know that in every place
there is somebody sitting

495
00:46:38,539 --> 00:46:43,429
just waiting to meet you as your own!

496
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:46,600
Just now I was thinking, ‘These musicians
are going to Singapore.

497
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,244
What will happen? Where will they stay?’
Big problem,

498
00:46:50,445 --> 00:46:53,858
trying this and that. Suddenly, I gave
a bandhan,

499
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:56,952
phone came from Bala. Bala told Me that,

500
00:46:57,153 --> 00:47:02,333
‘No, it’s perfectly all right. I’ll tell
my mother. She’ll look after them.’

501
00:47:02,947 --> 00:47:06,303
Problem solved. So, any such problems,

502
00:47:06,504 --> 00:47:09,767
your problems can be solved because
you are sincere,

503
00:47:09,968 --> 00:47:16,737
but if you’re insincere, you’ll meet only
insincere people and then you’ll go down,

504
00:47:16,975 --> 00:47:20,676
go down into your own estimation
and estimation of others.

505
00:47:20,877 --> 00:47:23,147
And you’ll have no place in Sahaja Yoga.

506
00:47:23,348 --> 00:47:26,500
There’s no place for insincere people
in Sahaj Yoga,

507
00:47:26,701 --> 00:47:29,980
so try to develop your sincerity.
Raise your Kundalini

508
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:35,572
as many times as you can. Keep it there.
Keep it on Sahastrara

509
00:47:35,773 --> 00:47:39,888
and see that your heart opens.
That’s the best way.

510
00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:42,510
They’ve been all asking Me, ‘How to open
our heart?’

511
00:47:42,711 --> 00:47:46,617
I said, ‘Take the key.’ Now, I don’t know
how to tell them.

512
00:47:46,818 --> 00:47:50,764
‘Open your heart’ means just raise
your Kundalini,

513
00:47:50,965 --> 00:47:55,326
keep to the Brahmarandhra and see that 
the Brahmarandhra opens.

514
00:47:55,527 --> 00:47:58,522
Not only that, but you see how

515
00:47:58,737 --> 00:48:02,690
by expanding your heart, by being nice
to others, how you feel.

516
00:48:02,891 --> 00:48:08,003
There are some people who do not talk 
much, who do not meet others,

517
00:48:08,204 --> 00:48:12,430
who have reservations. They live as if they
are living in the air, sort of people,

518
00:48:12,631 --> 00:48:16,278
must know there must be some badhas,
some bhoots sitting on their heads,

519
00:48:16,479 --> 00:48:21,319
otherwise that’s a very unnatural behavior
for a Sahaja Yogi.

520
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,841
I’ve told you so many things today because
I think the care,

521
00:48:26,042 --> 00:48:34,144
the love, the affection, the wisdom
and the patience is to be imbibed.

522
00:48:34,345 --> 00:48:42,186
If I’m your Guru, if I am your Mother,
you have to imbibe these qualities.

523
00:48:42,622 --> 00:48:46,554
For everything I’m worried. If somebody’s
in trouble, I’m worried.

524
00:48:46,755 --> 00:48:52,004
I’ll try to get the problems sorted out
of that person.

525
00:48:52,205 --> 00:49:00,694
Anyone who has a problem, I just - that
sticks to Me till I have solved the problem.

526
00:49:00,895 --> 00:49:03,559
And I tell frankly also about, say,
your children,

527
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,480
I tell about your wife, about your husband
that, ‘This is not all right.

528
00:49:07,681 --> 00:49:12,663
This must be corrected’. Because I care
for you.

529
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:17,414
This is what should be your attitude
towards

530
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:24,491
Sahaja Yogis, Sahaja Yoga and that will
strengthen you so much,

531
00:49:24,692 --> 00:49:27,727
because you care, that’s why others care.

532
00:49:27,928 --> 00:49:34,196
Can you imagine for an Indian woman like Me
to have so many people who care for Me?

533
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:40,401
Why should they care for Me, after all?
All right, you are Sahaja Yogis,

534
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:44,626
but there are people who are not
Sahaja Yogis, I tell you,

535
00:49:44,827 --> 00:49:48,169
whom I, they are not Sahaja Yogis,
whom I have met from My childhood,

536
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:51,062
whom I know, my relations, - they all
care for Me!

537
00:49:51,263 --> 00:49:56,400
Just one thing, because I care for them,
I get bothered about them.

538
00:49:56,601 --> 00:50:03,153
Anybody who tells Me a problem, it is
in My head, sticks there like a stamp.

539
00:50:03,361 --> 00:50:10,004
Till I’ve solved the problem, I’ll be
looking out how to fix that problem.

540
00:50:10,433 --> 00:50:13,806
And I don’t have any problem of My own.

541
00:50:14,007 --> 00:50:17,101
In the same way, you should not have
any problems of your own.

542
00:50:17,302 --> 00:50:21,294
Then only you can manage. All right now?

543
00:50:21,495 --> 00:50:23,952
So may God bless you!
