1
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:30,650
I 

2
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:41,370
bow to all the seekers of truth.

3
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:52,610
Today they have decided that I should give
you a general idea about Sahaja Yoga and after

4
00:00:52,610 --> 00:01:07,149
that on Monday and Tuesday I’ll speak to
you about all the details of the mechanism.

5
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:18,050
I have come to America to give you a great
message of the salvation of human beings.

6
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:25,000
Everybody is trying to frighten us that there
is going to be a doomsday and we are all going

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,720
to be doomed.

8
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:36,099
But the one who has created this universe
has some worry about His creation also and

9
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:41,270
that He is not going to allow this creation
to be destroyed.

10
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:48,180
Not only that but He is extremely anxious
that this creation should be saved, that human

11
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:57,010
beings must be saved and they should enter
into the kingdom of God to enjoy the realm,

12
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:05,610
the glory and the blessings of their Father,
the God.

13
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:14,080
It is hard to believe in those days of turmoil
that any such thing can happen to us.

14
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:23,480
But perhaps we are not aware that we are fantastically
made great instruments of God’s powers.

15
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,420
The only thing needed is that we should be
put to the mains.

16
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:37,170
Unless and until we have connected to Him
we do not understand the value of this instrument

17
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:45,760
which has been created with great care, love
and tenderness.

18
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:54,990
We just believe that this body has come to
us, we take it for granted and we actually

19
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:04,360
do not even think why we have become a human
being from a small insignificant thing like

20
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,850
an amoeba.

21
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,610
There must be some reason for becoming a human
being.

22
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:17,170
And what is the purpose of a life, why are
you on this Earth, what are we doing, what

23
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,170
are we [UNCLEAR]?

24
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,760
We do not ask these questions to ourselves.

25
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:31,370
On the contrary we have turned our back to
all such questions and we think make the hay

26
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,400
while the sun shines.

27
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,400
But actually we are not.

28
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:45,290
What we are doing in our pursuits also sometimes,
we just go after things which are destructive,

29
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:52,630
which are negative, which are anti-God because
the discretion, even to understand what is

30
00:03:52,630 --> 00:04:00,130
right and wrong is being lost by our over-thinking
and ego orientation.

31
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:08,209
When for us I use my ego, what I might think
is correct then we do not think that this

32
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:12,880
ego can destroy others as well as ourselves.

33
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:22,019
So it is very important to know, first of
all, that we are not our ego, we are not our

34
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:28,380
conditionings and our blind faiths, but we
are our Spirit which is absolute and which

35
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,620
knows the reality.

36
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,370
So we have to become that reality.

37
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:39,200
Unless and until we become that reality, whatever
we do is just a mental projection.

38
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,560
There are many people in this world who just
abide by their mental projections and that

39
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,240
explains many things.

40
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,570
Like if you see Mr.

41
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,570
Khomeini.

42
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:58,400
You may not like him, but if you ask the Iranians
they think he is a god and they think he is

43
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
absolutely right.

44
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,350
If you meet somebody else like that, like
Hitler.

45
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:09,270
Hitler thought that he was the best man and
there are many even now, they believe that

46
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:18,910
it was just a mistake otherwise they would
have to live long to really create a new race

47
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,910
of Arians.

48
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:26,370
All these ideas can be explained because people
lived with their rationality and rationality

49
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:33,090
has no logic in it, it has no binding force,
it has no discretion, it has no understanding

50
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,910
to what limit one can go.

51
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,700
For example somebody murders someone.

52
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,960
So someone can say, “What’s wrong?

53
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,080
I murdered because this happened, that happened
so I murdered.

54
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,850
But under law all these things are punishable
so we are frightened to do it and we don’t

55
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,850
do it.

56
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:52,430
But God’s laws are not perceived in normal
life.

57
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:58,360
They start becoming evident when we start
denying the naturalness of life.

58
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,740
When we become extremely sophisticated, so-called,
and artificial.

59
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:12,710
Or we go too much into some sort of a fanaticism
or some sort of a conditioning by reading

60
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:19,480
some books or forming some sort of a club
or forming some sort of an organization.

61
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,419
One has to know that you cannot organize God.

62
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,160
God cannot be organized.

63
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,400
God can organize you, but you cannot organize
God.

64
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,210
Second simple thing people don’t understand,
especially in America, is that you cannot

65
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,770
pay for God.

66
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,740
This is something so simple what people don’t
understand because for them money is everything,

67
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:45,290
perhaps I don’t know what, but recently
one of our persons tried to send an article

68
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:52,610
about Sahaja Yoga to one of the magazines,
and the people of that magazine asked how

69
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:58,740
many Rolls Royces she had and when they said
she doesn’t take any money, they said we

70
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,180
are not interested in her.

71
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,889
We are not interested in good people.

72
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:07,449
If there is something sensational, then we’d
like to publish about it.

73
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:08,990
That is what we have come to.

74
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:15,520
That anything good or a message of salvation
is not going to go to many people because

75
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,110
for them it is not very much pay or I don’t
know whatever it is.

76
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:25,270
So one has to understand at the very gross
level that you cannot purchase God.

77
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:31,710
But this simple thing also people don’t
understand and when you are so naîve about

78
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:36,710
your spiritual ascent, all kinds of mistakes
can be done.

79
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:43,240
Now when we do mistakes the result of it we
get into problems.

80
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,760
I was addressing the Jungian society in New
York and I asked him, “Why do you accept

81
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,800
people that take you to the subconscious?

82
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,290
Why should you accept people who take you
to this kind of mesmerism and hypnotism?

83
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,970
What is the idea behind it?”

84
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:07,300
They said, “Actually, because it is unconscious
you have to pass through it.

85
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,610
It’s a hodgepodge or a mixed bag, as you
call it.

86
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:17,070
That whatever is unconscious within us is
not God.

87
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:26,320
Supposing a bird can hear much more than you
can hear, a fish can understand magnetism

88
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,820
of the Mother Earth, but you cannot, and there
are so many things which are unconscious to

89
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:38,060
you, that doesn’t mean that all that is
unconscious is God.

90
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,789
Also whatever is written is not scripture.

91
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:47,070
Now what is unconscious within us and what
is not you must understand very clearly.

92
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:54,180
According to them it was that the unconscious
was placed at the bottom, then on top of that

93
00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:02,429
some can be made conscious, then on top of
that, they had subconscious, then they had

94
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:06,769
conscious mind, then on top of that was the
ego.

95
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:11,480
It’s absolutely like a bag into which everything
is pushed into.

96
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,220
God is the greatest organizer that you could
think of and He’s so systematic and He knows

97
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,009
that a day has to come when you have to ascend.

98
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:24,629
He must keep that road free, like you have
kept this road free for people to pass through.

99
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:30,740
They don’t have to pass through everybody,
to every bench, to every table to come on

100
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,740
their seat.

101
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,330
So this is a very wrong conception people
have about unconscious.

102
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:42,879
Now in our body you should how see clearly
unconscious is placed.

103
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,959
Whatever I am telling you, you should not
also take me for granted.

104
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,279
It’s not a correct attitude.

105
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:55,170
But also you should not deny it because, like
a scientist, you should keep your mind open

106
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,009
to see what I am saying.

107
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:03,300
People who deny are the same as who accept
it blindfolded.

108
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:10,240
You should not accept it blindfolded, but
keep yourself open and keep this as a hypothesis

109
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,079
which is to be proved, and if it is proved
you have to accept it as a fundamental law

110
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,300
of God’s government.

111
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:27,390
Now within us is placed – here you can see,
is a very clear-cut thing – is the lowest

112
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:36,739
part, is the center that guards this part
of the unconscious called as the Kundalini.

113
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:48,470
It is called as Asa in the Koran and also
in the Bible it is said that I will appear

114
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,130
before you like tongues of flames.

115
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:56,269
Now this is the reflection of the Holy Ghost
about which in the Bible nothing has been

116
00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:01,800
written and whatever has been written is very
ambiguous or a mystique.

117
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:08,199
This is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within
you is this Kundalini, which is the mother,

118
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:16,489
which has to ultimately nourish you and to
give you your second birth.

119
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:24,029
This was known to the Greeks definitely because
they called this triangular bone as sacrum

120
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:25,029
bone.

121
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:32,920
Sacrum in Greek language means sacred, so
they were quite aware of the sanctity or sacredness

122
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:39,569
of this power which is within us, so they
called it the sacrum bone.

123
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:49,550
This power resides inside this triangular
bone waiting for a chance where it can ascend

124
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,839
and nourish you.

125
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,649
You must know that normally in the body nothing
ascends by itself.

126
00:11:55,649 --> 00:12:01,739
There is some sort of a force that has to
ascend it or to bring it out like blood has

127
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:04,480
to circulate to the pumping of the heart.

128
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:12,310
In the same way this Kundalini, when She is
awakened, just like the pulsation of the heart,

129
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:21,489
rises above and you can see clearly with your
eyes the pulsation of the Kundalini and the

130
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:25,800
rising of the Kundalini and also the breaking
through of the Kundalini.

131
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:32,170
If you have a second [UNCLEAR] you can feel
the pulsation of the Kundalini, rising of

132
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,170
the Kundalini.

133
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:40,410
You can hear the same lub-dub of the heartbeat
and on top of the head where you get your

134
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:47,839
so-called baptism, you feel the throbbing
there and ultimately this break and you start

135
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,970
feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

136
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:56,629
This is the real second birth and not an artificial
birth where we just decide that we have got

137
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:58,029
a baptism.

138
00:12:58,029 --> 00:12:59,420
That’s artificial.

139
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,399
That’s just an immature, symbolic thing.

140
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:12,360
But really what should happen is that the
living process of your evolution must be exhibited

141
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:20,009
through its happening and not just a mental
projection of accepting that you have become

142
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,699
a person who is twice born.

143
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:27,420
It’s just a certification, again a mental
projection.

144
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:35,829
So one has to accept that something living
has to take place, something that you can

145
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:43,279
see clearly within you happening and you have
to get something that you cannot do.

146
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,649
For example you have seen people who say,
“We have got the blessings of the Holy Ghost.

147
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:49,649
So you ask them, “How?”

148
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:51,779
They say, “We are jumping."

149
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:55,889
If you are jumping, anybody can jump; what
is so great about it?

150
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:57,149
Jumping is not a big thing.

151
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:01,799
If you are jumping that doesn’t mean that
you have achieved anything great.

152
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,959
Anybody can jump.

153
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:08,679
But you can not get the cool breeze of the
Holy Ghost coming out of your own head.

154
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:14,679
One lady said, “There is always an air conditioner
and you must be feeling the air conditioner."

155
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:17,709
I said, “All right, but from your head it
is coming out."

156
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:20,279
She said, “Yes, it’s coming out of my
head."

157
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,310
So I said, “ So that means your head has
become the air conditioner."

158
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,029
And she said, “That’s true.

159
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:27,850
The air conditioner has started working here."

160
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:33,290
And that’s what one has to know that whatever
will happen to you that is Divine, we cannot

161
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,290
[UNCLEAR].

162
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,779
We cannot transform a flower into a fruit.

163
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:48,439
There’s a thousand and one things we cannot
do which are done by the living power of God’s

164
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:54,869
love and that living power of God’s love
is reflected within us as Kundalini.

165
00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:59,449
So that’s one part of the unconscious.

166
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:02,759
This is the one which can become partly conscious.

167
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:10,989
Below that is the consciousness which we call
the collective hell.

168
00:15:10,989 --> 00:15:12,329
One can go to hell.

169
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:13,829
It’s very simple to go to hell.

170
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:19,180
If you want, the simplest thing to do is to
go to hell.

171
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:28,129
On the left-hand side is another consciousness
– of which we are not aware so it is unconscious

172
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:31,680
– where we talk of the subconscious.

173
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:38,269
Whatever has happened to us in this life or
many lives or to all the world, all the creations

174
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:42,119
since we were created, all that resides beyond
that point.

175
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:46,350
So we have subconscious as well as collective
subconscious.

176
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,339
We have another unconscious area which is
not conscious to us.

177
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:56,929
You must have seen some people, like recently
I saw a very good film about a gentleman who

178
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:58,489
was never an artist.

179
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:04,769
Suddenly he became quite funny and he said,
“I’m Gaugin and I can paint like him."

180
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:11,480
He started painting on a canvas, you could
see, just like Gaugin style with very bold

181
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,350
lines and all these colors as you have seen
– exactly the same way.

182
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,350
People couldn’t understand.

183
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,839
This man was never an artist, nothing.

184
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:19,930
He has done suddenly.

185
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,610
What has happened to him?

186
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,210
That means he got possessed by someone, must
have been possessed by Gaugin himself because

187
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:31,739
he was mad when he died, and that he was expressing
himself through this man and he was a medium

188
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:33,049
now.

189
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:38,939
There are many things like this which act
as mediums and anybody can get possessed by

190
00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:47,959
this and in my experience I have seen most
of the diseases are called as incurable are

191
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:52,990
done when people go to the left side.

192
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,319
Any kind of fanaticism can give you.

193
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:06,100
Then if you try to bow yourself before people
who are fake, you get problems on the left-hand

194
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,949
side.

195
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:14,299
If you bow to wrong ideas or to wrong conditionings,
also you go to the left side.

196
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:21,640
Or if you just start thinking about your past
and crying and weeping, you can get into it.

197
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:28,500
So the people who are more on the left side,
when they are of an extreme nature, we call

198
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,500
them masochists.

199
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:36,120
On the right-hand side you have another kind
of unconscious which we call as supraconscious

200
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
unconscious.

201
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:45,140
Supraconscious is where you think more of
the future.

202
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,800
Such people are more troublesome to others
than to themselves.

203
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:56,230
They are ego oriented and they talk so much,
they are so aggressive, very argumentative

204
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,740
– very right-sided people.

205
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,970
They trouble others, they torture others.

206
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,690
They don’t torture themselves.

207
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:10,090
When you have the left-sided problem you suffer
body, but these aggressive people try to trouble

208
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,460
others and they’re least bothered because
that’s not their problem.

209
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:21,480
What they do is to trouble others and they
enjoy that kind of troubling and that ego

210
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
orientation.

211
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,930
Beyond that lies another unconscious which
is called as a collective unconscious.

212
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:33,230
This collective unconscious is made up of
people who have died with their ambitions

213
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,510
still intact.

214
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:42,420
Hitler has used those dead bodies to entice
the whole German nation to do all the things

215
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,420
that they have done.

216
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,150
No normal human being can be that cruel.

217
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:52,000
This kind of a thing works out in all the
countries where it is very ego oriented.

218
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,870
For example, an ego oriented society can have
very cruel parents, can have very cruel people

219
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,260
and can be very aggressive people.

220
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:06,090
As a result of their activity on the right-hand
side they develop an institution called as

221
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:13,960
ego and this ego, when it covers them, they
cannot think that anybody is right.

222
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,440
They think they are always right.

223
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,700
They always try to establish their point,
whatever it comes to and they aggress others

224
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,560
and try to dominate others.

225
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,010
The other type are the superego people.

226
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,990
So the people who are extremely egoistical,
they call them as sadists.

227
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:37,630
So we have two types of beings within us,
two types of unconscious within us – one

228
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:42,390
on the right-hand side and one on the left-hand
side and the third is the hell where people

229
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:48,700
are thrown when they go too much to the extreme,
to the right or the left.

230
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:55,310
But now here we are dealing with another unconscious
which is the super unconscious which is on

231
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:59,892
top of your head and that is what we have
to achieve through our evolutionary process

232
00:19:59,892 --> 00:20:02,130
– achieve a living process.

233
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:08,690
The Kundalini is the feminine, the mother
within you.

234
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,450
That doesn’t mean the feminist society or
the feminist movement, because the feminist

235
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:20,130
movement is absolutely against it, because
what I am saying that in your evolutionary

236
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:30,570
process you have to be crowned by the compassionate,
the kind, the soothing, the nourishing quality

237
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,160
of a mother.

238
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:39,780
But otherwise what happens is that women think
we should become like men and men start thinking

239
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,850
we should become like women.

240
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,520
It’s a very funny sort of thing going on.

241
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,480
Actually it’s a pendulous movement, it is
not any evolutionary.

242
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:56,380
In an evolutionary movement you move spirally
and come above a point, much above than where

243
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:01,920
you were and start seeing things at a much
better level and a subtler level.

244
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,520
But this kind of pendulum movement is very
common with people who want to solve their

245
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,010
problems by mental projections.

246
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:14,830
They think if you have this kind of government
is good, that kind of government is good,

247
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,660
they try all sorts of things.

248
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,110
Nothing is going to work out because that’s
not reality.

249
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:26,160
Reality is only possible when you are transformed
and you become the Spirit.

250
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:33,460
That time you move spirally and come up and
you become a person who is really an enlightened

251
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,460
person.

252
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:41,310
As an enlightened person you get the power
to be collectively conscious.

253
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,410
It’s an actualization.

254
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:48,490
It is not just a lecture that we are all brothers
and sisters.

255
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,990
It is not just a mental understanding that,
“Oh, I’m a twice-born person."

256
00:21:52,990 --> 00:22:01,280
It happens to you by which you become collectively
conscious, means you actualize the experience

257
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,650
of self realization.

258
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:12,100
As it is said in the Koran also that at the
time of resurrection your hands will speak.

259
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,700
You’ll be surprised that in the Koran, much
more is written about the resurrection time.

260
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,710
That means He talked about the future.

261
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:25,560
He said that when the resurrection time will
come your hands will speak.

262
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,360
Now people just want to talk about doomsday.

263
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,530
They don’t want to talk about the resurrection
time.

264
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:34,500
Like the newspaper, we said that if you have
to give some bad news you’d better give

265
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,720
us, we don’t want to have good news, that
there is a saving point, we have a right.

266
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,030
Because perhaps they are afraid that their
existence will be lost if you say that there

267
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,670
is no need to worry, you will all get transformed.

268
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:53,360
So whatever it is, we have to get transformed
and without transformation there is no solution.

269
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:03,730
In Sanskrit language this is called as atma
sakshatkar, means the facing or actualizing

270
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,270
the Spirit.

271
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,320
Also a twice-born is called as dwijaha.

272
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:19,600
Even a bird is called as twice born because
first it’s an egg and when the egg becomes

273
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,100
the bird he becomes a dwijaha.

274
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:28,490
So there is a difference in the personality
of an egg and the personality of a bird and

275
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:33,110
that’s how this transformation has to take
place.

276
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,580
Like somebody asked me, “Mother, I believe
in this thing."

277
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,530
I said, “But ask yourself why did you believe?”

278
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,910
He said, “I felt like giving him."

279
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,130
I said, “This is an explanation."

280
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:47,030
Then everybody will say, “I believe in it,
I’m believing in that and if everybody believed

281
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,440
in something, they fight.

282
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,850
Why do they fight?

283
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:55,770
By believing into something you have just
used your ego, that you have fixed your ego

284
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:00,030
with certain ideas and you are accepting it,
or on your superego that you have conditioned

285
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,630
yourself, or this is the thing I have to do,
that thing I have to do.

286
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:11,160
But it is not because maybe it is wrong, maybe
it is right because you are still on a relative

287
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,340
terminology.

288
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:21,030
To believe into something is all mental projection
again, but you have to keep your mind open

289
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,310
and see for yourself.

290
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:27,530
First of all you must see those who believe
into it, what effect it has.

291
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:33,820
Like somebody told me that some people fast
on such and such day in India, or they fast

292
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,550
in Ramadan on a certain date.

293
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,980
I said, “All right.

294
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:46,420
One should do that in case you find by doing
such and such thing these people are exceptional,

295
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,570
that they are something great, that they have
achieved something in life, that they can

296
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:57,550
say that they have become the Spirit, that
they can say that they are collectively conscious,

297
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:01,820
that they can feel you and feel themselves
on their fingertips.

298
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:06,810
Not only that but they have to be peaceful
people, they have to be compassionate people

299
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,280
and their presence must nourish you.

300
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,110
If it is done then all right, it is a proper
thing.

301
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:18,480
But because there is a fashion to club something
like this or another fashion to club like

302
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,600
that, if you try to club under any banner
like that, then we are sadly mistaken that

303
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,660
we have not done full justice to our mind.

304
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,960
Anything that you cannot reflect back and
where you lose the capacity to reflect is

305
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,890
a wrong thing.

306
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:41,810
When you become the Spirit the more you reflect
the more you understand.

307
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:45,630
We had one gentleman who came to Sahaja Yoga.

308
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:51,170
He got his realization and he said, “Mother,
you said that you become collectively conscious.

309
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:55,570
I want to know about my father, what’s wrong
with my father."

310
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,580
He wanted to question and he wanted to see
if it is true or not.

311
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:05,630
I said, “All right, put your hands towards
your father and just say, ‘I want to know

312
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:11,610
about my father,’ because you are connected
and your computer is working."

313
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:17,170
What happened was that he got a burning on
his finger, on this part, He asked, “Mother,

314
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,170
what is the decoding of this?

315
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:23,070
That you are getting this burning means what?”

316
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:29,880
So I told him that this means that your father
must be down with very bad bronchitis because

317
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,880
this center is here [Shri Mataji points to
throat].

318
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,020
And he telephoned to his father and found
out that his mother said – exactly the same

319
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:42,970
sentence – that your father is down with
very bad bronchitis.

320
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,030
Now the telecommunication of God has started
working.

321
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,830
You can even cure your father sitting down
here.

322
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:54,120
Then he tried to do it and he asked after
3 or 4 hours and they said he is all right,

323
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,270
he’s out of his bed.

324
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:00,840
So first what happens, you start reflecting
about your achievements.

325
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:07,510
Start feeling openly does it work, how it
works, do you see anything like that?

326
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:14,130
and when you are convinced about it then you
start proceeding further with it.

327
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:23,180
But anything that makes you so incapable that
you cannot reflect then I see a kind of enslavement

328
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,730
of whatever type it is.

329
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:29,550
Like I have seen people just do it because
they are told to do it.

330
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:35,390
We are people who are freedom loving, especially
in this country has talked a lot about freedom

331
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,809
and the freedom doesn’t mean abandonment.

332
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:42,710
It doesn’t mean that you just get lost in
your freedom.

333
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:52,830
But it means that wisdom to balance your freedom,
how to understand the value of your freedom.

334
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:58,310
If you do not have that sense, all freedom
can be lost.

335
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:05,770
This freedom can only be understood and could
be valued when you become the Spirit.

336
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:11,840
If you are not the Spirit, even if you give
a hundred dollars to somebody, he might immediately

337
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,170
go to a place which will destroy him.

338
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:23,850
People do not have wisdom to understand even
the value of their money, their position,

339
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,970
their chastity.

340
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:31,090
They have no sense at all of their self also.

341
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:36,570
So how you develop this is through the awakening
of your Spirit within you.

342
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,370
There’s a category of people who are seekers.

343
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,900
They are a category.

344
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,800
Everybody is not a seeker.

345
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,450
They need not be showing that they are seekers,
they may not be apparently seekers but in

346
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:57,330
their heart of hearts, they are seekers and
they are the epitome of our evolution.

347
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,420
They are the ones who are going to be blessed.

348
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,920
Not every person.

349
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,990
He may be a king, He may be a big man, he
may be a minister, anything.

350
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,690
It makes no difference.

351
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:11,710
He has to be a seeker and a seeker is going
to be blessed to begin with.

352
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:17,150
It is a seeker who knows that she’s seeking
something beyond.

353
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,670
But those who are still seeking money, all
right, go ahead with your money.

354
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,730
When you are fed up with it then you will
come to God.

355
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,540
Those who are seeking power, all right, go
ahead with your power.

356
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:30,680
Those who are mediocres are not good for Sahaja
Yoga to begin with.

357
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,500
First only the seekers get the blessings.

358
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,390
They can be under any [UNCLEAR], they can
be anything.

359
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:42,250
Only their Kundalini judges them and tells
that they are the seekers.

360
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:50,100
I’ve seen people who have just met me once
and got their realization and settled down.

361
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:57,290
One of them came to America who started giving
realization to so many, another one came to

362
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,750
Boston, another part of America.

363
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:09,760
He just started giving realization, another
went to Vancouver, they just started giving

364
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,300
realization to people.

365
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:17,230
It’s not that the realization is a guarantee
for anyone.

366
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:23,130
It depends what is their physical, mental,
emotional and spiritual condition.

367
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,830
If any way there is an imbalance within you,
it has to be balanced and you have to get

368
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,640
your realization.

369
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,590
Nobody can fight for it, nobody can be aggressive,
you cannot argue it out.

370
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,950
On the contrary those who argue too much seldom
get realization.

371
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,430
You have to be humble about it.

372
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:41,130
If you are humble about it, you do get your
realization.

373
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:46,540
There is nothing to be given up except for
your ego and superego.

374
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,772
That’s what you have to get of and you can
see that very clearly.

375
00:30:50,772 --> 00:30:55,580
When the Kundalini rises, when She touches
this point, then an awakening takes place

376
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,580
here.

377
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:01,960
By that awakening these two institutions are
sucked in and you get a very soft bone on

378
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,570
your head like a child.

379
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:08,060
As Christ has said you have to be like a child
to enter into the kingdom of God and then

380
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:16,520
you enter into the limbic area and through
this part you enter into the subtle energy

381
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:24,330
of that all-pervading power which is called
in Sanskrit as gamba shakti.

382
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:29,110
There is no difference in what these people
have been talking, They are all absolutely

383
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,850
one with each other, complete [UNCLEAR uni-religion].

384
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,650
There is no difference at all.

385
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:37,330
Christ himself has said those who are not
against Me are with Me.

386
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:41,300
But we never try to find out which are the
ones who are not against Him.

387
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,960
And He also said you will be calling Me Christ,
Christ, and I won’t recognize you.

388
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
Why?

389
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,890
He said, “By calling Christ, Christ, you
do not become Christians."

390
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:56,780
You become Christians only by real baptism,
by the awakening of the Kundalini, by breaking

391
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:04,010
of this area and entering into that subtle
area where you become one with the all-pervading

392
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,600
Diving power.

393
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,610
And this has to happen, this is your right
to have it.

394
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,180
Sahaja Yoga – Saha means with, Ja means
born.

395
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:19,780
It’s spontaneous, the spontaneous yoga of
the Spirit.

396
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:23,860
It’s a living force and you don’t have
to do anything about it.

397
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,420
It just works out.

398
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:33,480
Only in places where people are complicated,
I a little bit regulate the force and then

399
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,520
it works out.

400
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:41,440
I have to little bit nourish the different
centers which are suffering and it works out.

401
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,920
But in a place like India where, in the villages,
the people are extremely simple.

402
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,300
Thousands of them come in and get realization.

403
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,500
So many of them are getting realization and
having a better life.

404
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:57,110
They are no more slaves of any habits, any
diseases.

405
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:02,820
Diseases get cured because of nourishment,
your mental being improves, you get rid of

406
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:10,700
all your mental sicknesses, you get rid of
all your false guru problems and you get rid

407
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:17,140
of the oppression of the modern times that
is working on you.

408
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:22,300
You become a free bird and you start seeing
the whole thing as a drama.

409
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,660
This has to happen to many people – not
to one but to many.

410
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:32,470
When it happens you’ll be amazed this is
the time of our last judgment.

411
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:36,410
This is the time where you are going to be
judged by your Kundalini.

412
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:41,510
Nobody is going to put you on a scale to find
out how far you are good.

413
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,910
It’s only the Kundalini which is going to
tell.

414
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:49,210
When She rises She indicates that this person
has this problem, that problem and not only

415
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:54,460
that but through Sahaja Yoga problems can
be solved and you can be established into

416
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,830
Sahaja Yoga.

417
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,830
May God bless you all.

418
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:02,679
This is just an introduction to Sahaja Yoga
I’ve given you and again on Monday and Tuesday

419
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:08,280
I will tell you about the different chakras
and nadis within us, how they work out, how

420
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:14,040
we get diseases, how to get them cured, how
you can do it yourself, but how you become

421
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,859
the Spirit, what is the nature of Spirit,
how the Spirit expresses itself within ourselves

422
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:20,579
and what are its powers.

423
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:21,579
May God bless you.

424
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:25,790
As today is the first day I would like you
to ask me some questions but not like mad

425
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,090
people.

426
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,909
Ask good questions, sensible questions which
have some relevance.

427
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:33,730
There’s no need to be aggressive with me.

428
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,200
Supposing you believe in something.

429
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,280
All right you go ahead with it.

430
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,099
I have not to argue with you.

431
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:42,339
I’m here to give you the reality to find
out within yourself what is it.

432
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:45,109
No use saying this has happened, that has
happened.

433
00:34:45,109 --> 00:35:10,890
If you belong to any group you go ahead with
it.

434
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:47,259
When you get fed up then you can come to me.

435
00:35:47,259 --> 00:35:55,200
Still I’m willing to help you all.

436
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,739
May God bless you.

437
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:10,200
[Someone in the audience starts delivering
a long rant.

438
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:45,039
He doesn’t seem to 

439
00:36:45,039 --> 00:37:20,069
want to leave so Shri Mataji stands up to
talk to him]

440
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:34,480
Shri Mataji: No, no, let me handle him.

441
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,880
Gentleman, please listen.

442
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,680
Sir?

443
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,480
Hello?

444
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:50,579
Hey, mister, if you are talking about Christ
you have to change your tone.

445
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,739
This is not the way you should talk as a Christian.

446
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:54,119
Behave yourself.

447
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,680
This is not a Christian way of talking.

448
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,560
If you are talking about Christ, you are talking
like a satanic person.

449
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,660
That’s not the way to talk.

450
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:14,509
Ah, now you want to crucify me?

451
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:41,930
Is He in your pocket?

452
00:38:41,930 --> 00:39:27,500
Was Christ born in America?

453
00:39:27,500 --> 00:40:12,770
Just look at this madness.

454
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:28,049
What 

455
00:40:28,049 --> 00:40:29,800
to do?

456
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,640
Nothing you can do with these people.

457
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,140
Seeker: I have been meditating and had a vision
of you.

458
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,640
He then saw the picture of you.

459
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,609
He heard you were talking about collective
consciousness tonight and I presume he’s

460
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,470
trying to see through this maze.

461
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,030
Shri Mataji: You are a seeker.

462
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,299
That’s how the unconscious helps.

463
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:52,299
Many people dream.

464
00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:55,930
Look at the unconscious, how helpful it is.

465
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:59,040
But for a person who is gross, what can one
do?

466
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,839
There are so many ways by which people are
suggested and told because God is anxious

467
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,460
that people should be saved.

468
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:11,130
Absolutely, it is true and it’s a good thing
that you have said it.

469
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:18,910
But one should understand the most important
thing is that you must become your own Spirit.

470
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:23,779
This is just a suggestion to you to come here
to become the Spirit.

471
00:41:23,779 --> 00:41:26,470
It’s not important, whatever I am.

472
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,829
Supposing I am something, so what?

473
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:29,890
What have I done for you?

474
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:34,440
What you are going to get out of me is important.

475
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,869
So you get something out of me because you
have had a suggestion, you saw, is good.

476
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:40,210
So many people dream of me.

477
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:45,279
In India is very common because people are
simple and they go into their deeper sleep

478
00:41:45,279 --> 00:41:48,849
very easily while here, people are not that
simple.

479
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:52,039
They are so pressurized in life that they
don’t feel that.

480
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:54,989
But I’m happy that you dreamt about it.

481
00:41:54,989 --> 00:42:00,930
May God bless you.

482
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:04,920
Seeker: Will you be performing any healings
tonight?

483
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,410
Shri Mataji: Yes, maybe.

484
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:11,789
It might work out.

485
00:42:11,789 --> 00:42:13,039
It just works automatically.

486
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:16,539
Actually I do not heal individually anyone.

487
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:21,410
We’ll give you little guidelines by which
it will work out.

488
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:27,130
In a general way it works out because then
the Kundalini rises She nourishes you and

489
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,130
you get healed.

490
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,069
I do not do anything particularly on one person.

491
00:42:31,069 --> 00:42:35,630
You get healed because you have that power
within you to heal yourself.

492
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:42,049
Only what I do is like a candle which is enlightened
enlightens another light.

493
00:42:42,049 --> 00:42:47,700
Yogi: Actually she is going to give you the
experience of self realization when the questions

494
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,730
are over.

495
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:54,979
So if you want to stay, please do and feel
it for yourself and then you will start to

496
00:42:54,979 --> 00:42:56,140
become your own healer.

497
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:00,190
Shri Mataji: You have to become your own master,
your own guru.

498
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,710
You don’t need any guru.

499
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,700
Once you have your second birth that’s all.

500
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,269
It’s so simple, it’s so fantastic.

501
00:43:05,269 --> 00:43:06,319
Why not have it?

502
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:11,229
Why was he fighting with me I just don’t
understand.

503
00:43:11,229 --> 00:43:12,930
He must be paid by someone.

504
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,599
I don’t know what is the matter.

505
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:15,599
Is he drunk?

506
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,350
I’m saying that you have got something,
your own power, your own diamond within you.

507
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:23,619
Just have it.

508
00:43:23,619 --> 00:43:31,259
Am I saying anything wrong?

509
00:43:31,259 --> 00:43:45,519
Seeker: Is 

510
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:50,210
meditation part of your program and do you
teach a technique of meditation?

511
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:54,630
Shri Mataji: Actually there is nothing like
doing meditation.

512
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:58,720
What happens is that you become one with your
present.

513
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:04,810
Means you are in meditation.

514
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:10,800
It is not that you have to do meditation but
you just become in meditation.

515
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:17,809
So the meditation has no technique as far
as the spontaneity is concerned.

516
00:44:17,809 --> 00:44:22,710
First you are awakened spontaneously, just
like a seed is sprouted.

517
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:28,499
Then you have to look after yourself because
[UNCLEAR at the first shot] the Kundalini

518
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,559
rises, just like a jet it comes up.

519
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:36,960
But then it goes back and settles back into
other places where there is a problem.

520
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:43,569
Then you have to learn how to keep it going
and establish yourself like a little seedling

521
00:44:43,569 --> 00:44:48,880
where you put in a proper place, look after
it properly and then it starts growing well.

522
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,890
So it is in stages.

523
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:58,640
First is the awakening of the Kundalini, secondly
is the breaking of the Sahasrara, and third

524
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:04,760
is the establishment of yourself as a realized
soul.

525
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:10,440
Then comes the stage where you are called
a Sahaja Yogi where you master the whole art

526
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:19,280
of giving realization to others, of understanding
yourself and there is a stage where there

527
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,380
aren’t any doubts.

528
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:33,930
Seeker: How long does it take generally for
one to get the kind of consciousness where

529
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:34,930
the Kundalini awakens?

530
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,859
Shri Mataji: It’s a very good question,
Sir.

531
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:40,650
It is the question of a seeker, It takes just
a split of a second.

532
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:42,690
But not with everyone.

533
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:50,009
If you say, “How much time does it take
for an aeroplane to take off?

534
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:55,160
We say if everything is normal it takes ten
minutes.

535
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,470
But everything has to be all right which is,
normally, you don’t find.

536
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:03,540
That’s an abnormal situation these days,
to find somebody normal.

537
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:09,289
So when they are abnormally like that, it
takes a little time, you have to work it out.

538
00:46:09,289 --> 00:46:11,519
Otherwise it is spontaneous.

539
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,029
In a simple person like a child, it just shoots
off.

540
00:46:14,029 --> 00:46:15,029
Don’t worry.

541
00:46:15,029 --> 00:46:16,029
It will work out.

542
00:46:16,029 --> 00:46:17,029
Seeker: One more question?

543
00:46:17,029 --> 00:46:18,029
Shri Mataji: Yes, please.

544
00:46:18,029 --> 00:46:19,259
Seeker: Somebody wants to get a job.

545
00:46:19,259 --> 00:46:20,460
They need experience.

546
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:24,029
So you get experience you are good at job.

547
00:46:24,029 --> 00:46:27,859
It’s like a big cycle.

548
00:46:27,859 --> 00:46:35,869
So the profession you are talking about is
it possible that somebody here on the world

549
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:43,150
could never be able to awaken the Kundalini
because of his condition.

550
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:48,650
Is it assumed that everybody can do it maybe
in ten years, fifteen years?

551
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:53,769
Shri Mataji: I wish so, but do you know in
this place how many people have come out of

552
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,559
this great Los Angeles?

553
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:56,700
Just see.

554
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,190
This is the condition.

555
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,229
But let one fake guru come here.

556
00:47:01,229 --> 00:47:04,489
He can fill the whole hall and people would
be hanging from there.

557
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:05,900
That’s the problem.

558
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,720
I wish that what you say comes true.

559
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,930
If they come they’ll get it.

560
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:17,269
But if they don’t want to come, you cannot
force it.

561
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:19,579
That’s their freedom.

562
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:23,759
You cannot hypnotize, you cannot do anything.

563
00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:25,200
They have to come, really.

564
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:35,970
They have to knock at the door.

565
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:42,190
Seeker: If you are meditating at the moment
should you continue with your present meditation

566
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:43,969
or does it really matter?

567
00:47:43,969 --> 00:47:48,299
Shri Mataji: No, you will give up on all that
yourself because you’ll find out that the

568
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:53,480
state of meditation is something that is inbuilt.

569
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,619
Once it starts, like, say, you are inside
this room.

570
00:47:57,619 --> 00:48:00,049
You don’t need a car, isn’t it?

571
00:48:00,049 --> 00:48:03,660
Once you are inside there then you don’t
need anything.

572
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:30,989
Then you have to know how to be there all
the time.

573
00:48:30,989 --> 00:48:38,900
Seeker: When the Kundalini rises, then you
said it goes down.

574
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:46,059
Does it go down to a place where it has to
help and if that does happen can somebody

575
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:47,950
else help to fix it up?

576
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:54,450
Shri Mataji: Yes, many can, and thank God
now in your Los Angeles we have at least ten

577
00:48:54,450 --> 00:49:01,650
people who can do that and you’ll be the
eleventh one to help them later on.

578
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:05,200
Don’t you worry on that point.

579
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:10,960
You have to work it out.

580
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,819
It’s not difficult.

581
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:22,170
It has become very easy now.

582
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:26,999
Seeker: When exactly does the Holy Spirit
reveal things to you?

583
00:49:26,999 --> 00:49:35,089
Shri Mataji: The Holy Spirit which is reflected
within you as this Kundalini, when She rises,

584
00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:37,530
She enlightens your centers.

585
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:46,160
By that, what happens is that you start feeling
your centers on your finger tips, on your

586
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:53,180
central nervous system, on your complete consciousness.

587
00:49:53,180 --> 00:50:20,510
[Someone in the audience starts interrupting
which becomes more and more shouting and chaos.]

588
00:50:20,510 --> 00:51:13,499
Shri Mataji: I don’t understand these people.

589
00:51:13,499 --> 00:51:28,359
It has never happened whatsoever in any country.

590
00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:31,859
Yogi: He’s probably a born-again Christian.

591
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:35,130
Shri Mataji: It must be fine for…

592
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:39,130
After all, what have you done?

593
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:43,700
He’s talking so big…

594
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,769
Now I think we’ll do the questioning tomorrow,
all right?

595
00:51:46,769 --> 00:51:50,319
Let’s have the realization now my child,
if you don’t mind madame.

596
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,900
You can write it down, darling.

597
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:58,759
You give me all things written down and I
will answer all your questions because this

598
00:51:58,759 --> 00:51:59,759
thing starts.

599
00:51:59,759 --> 00:52:04,160
This is a funny thing, I tell you.

600
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,460
Yogi: They’re just saying this is Hollywood
Los Angeles.

601
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:18,249
Yogi: The questions we are going to leave
it for next time.

602
00:52:18,249 --> 00:52:19,369
Mother wants to give you the experience.

603
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:22,020
If you want it, please stay.

604
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,030
If you do not want to receive it, that’s
fine.

605
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:25,280
Shri Mataji: Go away.

606
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,269
Give me my freedom.

607
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:34,660
Why are you doing like this?

608
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:45,680
[Woman in audience wants to continue the conversation.]

609
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:56,210
Yogi: Please, can we all just turn this way
and Mother is going to give you the experience.

610
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:58,079
Let’s get on with it.

611
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,510
Shri Mataji: Madame.

612
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:04,799
Hello, madame, can you give them the experience?

613
00:53:04,799 --> 00:53:07,809
Can you do it?

614
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,200
No you cannot.

615
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,519
What you feel is different.

616
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:12,519
You are an individual.

617
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:13,519
But can you give the experience?

618
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:14,519
If you cannot, let me do it.

619
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:17,839
If you feel then go ahead with it.

620
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,579
I’m not saying you don’t feel it.

621
00:53:19,579 --> 00:53:20,579
You can go out.

622
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:21,579
Why are you here disturbing others?

623
00:53:21,579 --> 00:53:26,029
You can go away if you don’t want to stay
here.

624
00:53:26,029 --> 00:53:27,069
Let the others feel also.

625
00:53:27,069 --> 00:53:30,750
You cannot give them the experience, can you?

626
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,780
So you go away.

627
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:40,479
Yogi: Maybe, I think, she was saying that
these other people have evil spirits and not

628
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,479
you.

629
00:53:41,479 --> 00:53:44,269
Shri Mataji: You see, I don’t know what
you were saying.

630
00:53:44,269 --> 00:53:46,789
Whatever it is now you must understand.

631
00:53:46,789 --> 00:53:53,750
Woman in audience: Can I say a word?

632
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:57,260
Maybe it is time to tell you that she loves
you…

633
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,859
Shri Mataji: I tell you I can’t hear, I’m
sorry for that.

634
00:53:58,859 --> 00:53:59,859
Yes, now I understand.

635
00:53:59,859 --> 00:54:01,540
What I’m trying to tell you: Be simple about
it.

636
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:04,029
I know that they are evil spirits or whatever
you say.

637
00:54:04,029 --> 00:54:11,089
I don’t want to call them by any bad names,
I understand that but let it be.

638
00:54:11,089 --> 00:54:13,109
Forget about that.

639
00:54:13,109 --> 00:54:15,680
Don’t pay attention to anyone.

640
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,150
It’s all right.

641
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:18,150
I understand.

642
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:22,609
Just think, now, I couldn’t hear anything
at all what you were saying.

643
00:54:22,609 --> 00:54:24,809
So forget it, madame, it’s all right.

644
00:54:24,809 --> 00:54:27,080
They are not crucifying me at least, isn’t
it?

645
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,900
That’s not so bad.

646
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,460
It could be much worse.

647
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:34,380
It makes no difference to me.

648
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,970
Now can you much forgive?

649
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:37,400
Because they don’t know what they are doing.

650
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,680
They are out of gear.

651
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,810
Man in audience: No, I wouldn’t say they
are out of gear.

652
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:44,810
I would say they are in gear.

653
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:45,810
Shri Mataji: Ah?

654
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:51,030
Man: You used the words of Jesus Christ, right?

655
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:56,539
Shri Mataji: I have no right?

656
00:54:56,539 --> 00:54:58,019
Listen now.

657
00:54:58,019 --> 00:55:02,369
I think some people think that Jesus Christ
was born in America…

658
00:55:02,369 --> 00:55:33,599
What right do you have on Jesus Christ?…

659
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:42,519
Why can’t I talk about Christ?

660
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:50,279
< unintelligible shouting breaks out >

661
00:55:50,279 --> 00:56:11,630
Yogi: It looks like an organized group that
came in numbers.

662
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:30,119
They’ve all got Bibles and they’re probably
all born-again Christians.

663
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:41,730
Shri Mataji: What’s he saying?

664
00:56:41,730 --> 00:57:08,749
Yogi: He’s advising us not to say anything
just for the moment.

665
00:57:08,749 --> 00:57:14,920
Shri Mataji: They get angry because I say
you can’t take money.

666
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:25,489
These groups always take money.

667
00:57:25,489 --> 00:57:36,549
Yogi: Can I suggest that – a good way to
experience this is to slip your shoes off

668
00:57:36,549 --> 00:57:41,509
to make the contact with the Earth, put your
hands out toward Shri Mataji – socks if

669
00:57:41,509 --> 00:57:48,400
you wish, it’s up to you.

670
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:54,030
Just simply put your hands out and, in your
heart, all you have to do is ask for it, nothing

671
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:55,030
else.

672
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:58,890
Shri Mataji: Now, please, don’t disturb
anyone.

673
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:01,319
I request you, please.

674
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:12,829
It’s really sinful to disturb people who
are seeking God, who are seeking reality.

675
00:58:12,829 --> 00:58:29,349
Yogi: Put your hands comfortably in your lap.

676
00:58:29,349 --> 00:58:45,099
Shri Mataji: Just put your hands straight
and both your feet touching the Mother Earth.

677
00:58:45,099 --> 00:58:55,450
Please sit straight, neither bending too much
nor pushing back your neck.

678
00:58:55,450 --> 00:59:00,349
In a straight way please be seated.

679
00:59:00,349 --> 00:59:08,529
Now close your eyes.

680
00:59:08,529 --> 00:59:18,480
You have to keep your eyes closed.

681
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:56,479
Now as I’ve told you, when we have problems
with our centers we have to nourish them.

682
00:59:56,479 --> 01:00:04,650
So keep your left hand towards me throughout
because the left hand is the desire power

683
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:07,279
within you.

684
01:00:07,279 --> 01:00:18,359
And the right hand you have to use it to nourish
your centers which require nourishment.

685
01:00:18,359 --> 01:00:23,589
First of all you have to know that we are
all Spirit.

686
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:33,609
And so, please put your right hand on your
Heart 

687
01:00:33,609 --> 01:00:43,329
and say – you can ask a question if you
want – to me.

688
01:00:43,329 --> 01:00:48,180
You can address me as Mother or Shri Mataji
if you can say that.

689
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:52,859
Ask a question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

690
01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:54,809
Ask three times.

691
01:00:54,809 --> 01:00:56,759
Without feeling guilty.

692
01:00:56,759 --> 01:01:04,160
Don’t feel guilty about anything because
we are in the present now here so you are

693
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,259
not to feel guilty at all.

694
01:01:09,259 --> 01:01:26,549
Just ask the question, “Am I the Spirit?”

695
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:30,890
It’s like watering the plant.

696
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,740
You are nourishing your Heart.

697
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:33,829
Open your Heart.

698
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:39,160
With confidence, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

699
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:59,450
Now if you are the Spirit, then you are your
own guide, you are your own master, you are

700
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,630
your own guru.

701
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:04,299
So you have to put your right hand…

702
01:02:04,299 --> 01:02:05,650
Please don’t feel guilty.

703
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:07,200
All of you have this problem.

704
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,289
I think you should not feel guilty at all.

705
01:02:09,289 --> 01:02:13,440
At this time you should say, “I don’t
feel guilty at all."

706
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,819
It’s very important.

707
01:02:14,819 --> 01:02:15,930
Not to feel guilty.

708
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:17,510
Forget about the past.

709
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:22,130
Now put the right hand on the stomach on the
left-hand side.

710
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:27,910
Put your left hand towards me as it was and
put your right hand on the left-hand side

711
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:35,519
of the stomach and press it a little.

712
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:44,029
This is the center 
of Primordial Master.

713
01:02:44,029 --> 01:02:51,970
You have to say here in your Heart ten times
with full confidence, “Mother, am I my own

714
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:53,109
master?”

715
01:02:53,109 --> 01:03:00,119
“Am I my own guide?”

716
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:25,359
“Am I my own guru?”

717
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:41,199
Or you can say with full assertion, “Mother,
I am my own master."

718
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:46,519
“Mother I am my own guru."

719
01:03:46,519 --> 01:03:50,319
“Mother, I am my own guide."

720
01:03:50,319 --> 01:04:05,980
Because “I” stands for the Spirit and
not for ego.

721
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:56,119
Again raise your hand to your Heart.

722
01:04:56,119 --> 01:05:01,969
Now without feeling guilty again you have
to assert, no questioning.

723
01:05:01,969 --> 01:05:08,089
You have to assert, “Mother, I am the Spirit."

724
01:05:08,089 --> 01:05:10,979
Say it twelve times.

725
01:05:10,979 --> 01:05:41,700
On the Heart, press it hard without feeling
guilty.

726
01:05:41,700 --> 01:06:00,729
Now raise your right hand up to your forehead
and put it across.

727
01:06:00,729 --> 01:06:08,839
At this center, you have to forgive everyone,
just forgive everyone.

728
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:14,509
Some people say it is very difficult to forgive,
but actually, logically if you see if you

729
01:06:14,509 --> 01:06:18,420
don’t forgive you are playing into the hands
of others.

730
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:26,390
You must say I forgive everyone.

731
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:50,160
Now put this right hand at the back of the
head.

732
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,520
There’s another center there.

733
01:06:52,520 --> 01:07:03,589
If you have forgiven everyone without feeling
guilty – again I say, without feeling guilty

734
01:07:03,589 --> 01:07:14,489
– you have to say, “If I have done any
mistakes, let God forgive me."

735
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:24,039
But without feeling guilty.

736
01:07:24,039 --> 01:08:11,719
It will just work out.

737
01:08:11,719 --> 01:08:16,920
Now raise your hand on the head.

738
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:22,560
Put it on your head, your palm.

739
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,339
Press it and move it clockwise.

740
01:08:26,339 --> 01:08:35,000
At this point as I have said, I cannot cross
your freedom.

741
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,730
You have to say that you want your realization.

742
01:08:39,730 --> 01:08:49,980
Please say, “I want my realization."

743
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:58,520
“Please give me my realization."

744
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:08,770
I cannot force it on you.

745
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:14,770
Now put your right hand towards me and the
left hand on your head and see if you feel

746
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:24,670
the cool breeze.

747
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:33,840
Raise the hand about six inches above.

748
01:09:33,840 --> 01:10:57,310
[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone several
times] Now change your hand and see again.

749
01:10:57,310 --> 01:11:10,910
[Shri Mataji blows again] Change your hand
again and see.

750
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:52,800
Some of you might feel heat.

751
01:11:52,800 --> 01:12:00,120
The first state you arrive at is called as
thoughtless awareness.

752
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,940
Now you watch me without thinking.

753
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:02,940
Put your hands like this.

754
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:22,850
Let’s see if you can do it.

755
01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:26,760
Some of you might be feeling the left hand
or the right hand.

756
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:32,130
On whatever hand you are feeling, you put
it up like that and the other hand towards

757
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:35,350
me, if you are not feeling in the right.

758
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:41,160
If you are not feeling in the left hand, you
put your left hand towards me.

759
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:44,500
In any case you try it this way.

760
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,970
The ventilation helps you.

761
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:57,700
First you put the left hand towards me and
the right hand up.

762
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:10,170
Now put your right hand towards me (and left
hand up).

763
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:16,130
It’s better to keep it that way because
more are right.

764
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:26,830
Also tonight I will teach you to raise your
own Kundalini which you should do at home.

765
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:32,290
You should go home and sleep – not discussing
it, talking about it but I’ll tell you how

766
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:37,350
to do it and how to feel the cool breeze in
the hand by that.

767
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:42,540
You put your left hand which is hand of your
desire in front of your Kundalini, while you

768
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:43,540
are sitting down.

769
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:49,010
Just put it like this and you have to move
your right hand in this way such that it goes

770
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:54,940
upward, forward, downward, backward – like
in a clockwise manner.

771
01:13:54,940 --> 01:14:00,770
So let us move it, one hand like this.

772
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:03,940
Now move this hand like this.

773
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:11,560
At this point you take it up, push back your
head and give it a twist.

774
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:16,690
And now you put it into a knot.

775
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:36,090
[Shri Mataji demonstrates raising Kundalini
again finishing with a single knot.]

776
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:37,090
Once more.

777
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:41,050
This is the last time you have to do it but
three knots we have to give.

778
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:42,220
Now let’s do it.

779
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:54,290
You are doing it yourself [Shri Mataji raises
Kundalini a third time giving three knots].

780
01:14:54,290 --> 01:15:01,840
Now see for yourself.

781
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:18,810
It’s very subtle, a subtle thing, a new
awareness.

782
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:24,750
You can put up your hands like this and ask
a question in your Heart, “Is this the cool

783
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:26,310
breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

784
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:42,810
Put your hands like this and ask the question…

785
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:45,760
Now see it for yourself.

786
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:51,310
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

787
01:15:51,310 --> 01:15:55,750
Put down your hands and see for yourself.

788
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:59,730
Are you feeling the cool breeze in the hands?

789
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:12,460
Seeker: I feel it in my feet as well.

790
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:15,980
Shri Mataji: It’s all over.

791
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:18,800
You’ll feel it on your feet, it’s all
around you.

792
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,780
It’s a game sometimes.

793
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:22,270
It’s all there.

794
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:24,740
First experience is very strong.

795
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:26,180
But you have to keep it on.

796
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:32,970
Don’t forget the first experience if you
have had and you have to be serious about

797
01:16:32,970 --> 01:16:33,970
it.

798
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:36,860
You must understand, it’s a deep thing that
has happened.

799
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:43,610
This has been what you have been asking for
ages now and you are blessed.

800
01:16:43,610 --> 01:16:50,880
If you feel extremely peaceful and happy without
any thoughts, go home, don’t talk too much

801
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,080
and sleep off.

802
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,870
This is you are in meditation.

803
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:57,800
Some people haven’t felt, doesn’t matter.

804
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:05,090
There is a way by which we can do it and can
establish it.

805
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:13,560
So please you go home, be silent about it
and understand that you’ve got it now.

806
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:30,460
Be one with yourself, respect yourself, you
are to be respected and I 

807
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:31,460
bow to all of you.

808
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:35,560
Yogi: At the end of this program as you go
out, the people here in Los Angeles have asked

809
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:41,760
if you would just give them your name and
address so that they can let you know, the

810
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:46,090
reason being that they are going to have a
follow up seminar in about a week or ten days

811
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:50,600
time afterwards and they want to be able to
let you know the dates incase you cannot come

812
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:55,400
on a Monday or Tuesday night, they could advise
you so that you could follow this up and get

813
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,150
the experience deeper and deeper.

814
01:17:57,150 --> 01:18:02,170
So please give them the address, there is
literature at the back, they’ll be giving

815
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:03,180
that out to you.

816
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:07,190
Shri Mataji: But don’t read and get confused.

817
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:12,620
That I must tell you because to put on the
light is very easy, but to understand the

818
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:15,540
mechanism and the history and all that is
very complicated.

819
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:21,580
Of course the first book is very simple, but
you people don’t read it and get worried

820
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:22,680
about it.

821
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:27,280
Just if you want to read it, you can read,
you will, if you don’t read, it’s all

822
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,280
right.

823
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,350
We don’t give all the books.

824
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:34,910
Actually, in Sahaja Yoga, we have many books,
but we just give the first book to begin with.

825
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:36,230
I have a very short time with you.

826
01:18:36,230 --> 01:18:43,560
I think you can read it, you can understand
it and come back again and gradually progress

827
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,080
with it with respect to yourself.

828
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:49,240
May God bless you all.

829
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:56,770
Yogi: As you heard her say, the programs are
on Monday and Tuesday night here at the same

830
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:57,770
time.

831
01:18:57,770 --> 01:19:04,480
The experience is something you have to deepen
into, so come back on Monday and Tuesday nights.

832
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:04,850
Thank you very much.
