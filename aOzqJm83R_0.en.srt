1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:15,610
The most precious thing that we have, within
ourselves… the preciousness of your spirit…

2
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:24,279
is immeasurable, and that’s why it is called,
as a thing of eternal value.

3
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,199
Because it is infinite.

4
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:39,079
You cannot measure.

5
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:59,140
Now, God, The Almighty, we say, is, Sat-Chit-Anand.

6
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:05,020
Sat means, the truth.

7
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:16,740
The truth we understand, in human terminology,
is relative… but the sat I am telling you,

8
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:25,810
is the absolute, from where all the relations
start.

9
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:31,700
Example I will tell you how to understand.

10
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:56,020
This Earth has got, oceans, and rivers, and
all kinds, of, waters you can say.

11
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:07,020
But, Earth is enveloping all of them.

12
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:25,330
If, the Mother Earth was not there, there
could not have been, any of these existing.

13
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:40,330
So, we can say, that Mother Earth is the support,
of all the things that exist on Her.

14
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:52,200
She is enveloping us… in the atoms She exists…
in the big mountains She exists, because the

15
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,300
elements are part, of that Earth.

16
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:16,209
In… in the same way, God Almighty, the sat
part of Him, the truth, is the support, of

17
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:20,989
all the things, that are created, or not created.

18
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:27,659
Another example you try to understand.

19
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:38,680
How, the sat, is the purusha [–man -ed.],
is the God, who does not, take actual part

20
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:45,750
in the creation itself, but, is a catalyst.

21
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:54,939
The example can be like this, that I am doing
all the work, I am creating everything, but

22
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:57,870
I have a light in my hand.

23
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,290
Without the light, I cannot do anything.

24
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,650
Light is the support of my work.

25
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:13,090
But, the light, does not, in any way, do anything
about what I do.

26
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:25,180
In the same way, God Almighty, is just a witness,
like a light.

27
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:35,490
But His another quality is His chitt, is His
attention.

28
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:44,820
When it is excited, in Sanskrit, there is
a very good word, sphuran, is pulsates, when

29
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:55,530
it pulsates, His attention when it pulsates,
then through His attention, He starts creating.

30
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:07,710
And he has third quality, which we call as
anand.

31
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:22,030
Anand is the feeling, of joy that He gets
by His perception, by His creation.

32
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,960
The joy that He gets.

33
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:34,639
All these three things, when they are at a
zero point, where they meet, then, they become,

34
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:42,710
the principle of Brahma, where these things
are one.

35
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:47,310
Where there is complete silence.

36
00:05:47,310 --> 00:06:00,639
Nothing is created, nothing is manifested,
but the joy is one with the attention, because,

37
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:15,470
attention has reached and merged into joy,
and joy has become one with the truth.

38
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:36,139
This, combination, of three qualities, separate,
and create three types of phenomena.

39
00:06:36,139 --> 00:07:03,500
The anand, the joy, in God, moves with His
creation, and with the truth.

40
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:16,810
When the joy starts moving with the creation,
the creation starts moving down from first,

41
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,039
the truth stage, to asat [–untruth -ed.].

42
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:29,039
From sat to untruth, to maya, to illusion.

43
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:37,900
And that time, the creation starts, on the
right hand side.

44
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:44,009
The creative forces start working out, and
when it starts working out, the joy in it,

45
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:54,150
which is on the left hand side, is the emotional
side of God, also starts becoming, grosser

46
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,320
and grosser.

47
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,900
The creation starts becoming grosser, and
the joy in it also starts becoming grosser,

48
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:08,780
and the sat, the light of God, also starts
becoming grosser and grosser, and grosser,

49
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:18,970
till they reach a stage, where there is, we
can say, a complete darkness of tamoguna,

50
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:31,790
the complete creation of the creativity, and
the complete sleeping of the joy limit, exists.

51
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,430
Clearer?

52
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,820
To understand now Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

53
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,460
That’s why Christ said, I am the light.

54
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:57,140
Because, He represents the sat, the light
of God, and light of God becomes absolutely,

55
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:04,510
gross, dormant, dead, when it reaches the
seventh stage of creation.

56
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:12,430
All these things go deeper and deeper, becoming
grosser, and grosser.

57
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,330
That’s one part of the parabolic.

58
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:26,080
Now, the another part of the parabolic starts
when you are ascending back to God Almighty.

59
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:34,279
That grossness, now, gradually starts becoming
higher, and higher, subtler and subtler, and,

60
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,140
finer and finer.

61
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:49,339
In that refinement, you find, ultimately the
light, works for the evolutionary process.

62
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:55,970
Gradually, the grosser parts start becoming
enlightened.

63
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:02,390
You find the lower animal is not that much
enlightened as the higher animal is.

64
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:13,600
Gradually, even the joy starts becoming subtler,
and we can call it, beautiful.

65
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,810
Human joys are much more beautiful than that
of animals.

66
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:31,850
So, the joys also start changing their manifestation,
in the sense you start seeing more and more,

67
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,279
and wider range of joy comes into [inaudible].

68
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:42,500
For example, to a dog, beauty has no meaning,
decency has no meaning.

69
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:55,660
So, at such stage when you reach, when you
are a human being, to that extent, you develop,

70
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:12,640
you are sat, which is awareness, to that extent,
you also develop, your joy, and to that extent,

71
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,850
you also develop your creative action.

72
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:30,890
Now you see, how the creativity of God, passes
into the hand of man… when it turns down.

73
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:41,800
How the joy of God passes into the hand of
man, and how His light comes into the heart

74
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,590
of man, as Spirit.

75
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,980
Its beautiful.

76
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:55,150
And at that stage, when you have become a
human being, people say, human beings have

77
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,200
a soul.

78
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:03,610
Not that others do not have, but the light
starts burning in a human being only.

79
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:13,350
Because of that light, we talk of religion,
we talk of God, and we talk of eternal things.

80
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:21,089
But, its a very precarious stage, that is
to be human beings.

81
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:28,480
Because at this stage, you have to jump only
a little bit that side, while you start jumping

82
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:36,020
this side and that side, because this jumping
is not possible, unless and until, the awareness

83
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:47,830
reaches that stage, where, you become independent,
and, in that independence, you find your own

84
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,970
glory.

85
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:58,490
This is the position, because your glory cannot
be yours, unless and until you are independent.

86
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:15,630
As long as you are slaves, or under bondage,
of something that is gross, how can you enjoy,

87
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:20,160
that eternal joy, that is within you.

88
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:33,040
So, it is for you to expose yourself more
to that joy, by opening out yourself more

89
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:46,560
and more, getting subtler, and cleaner, so
that you feel that joy.

90
00:13:46,560 --> 00:14:06,829
Once, you know this point, that, after getting
Self-realization, unless and until these three

91
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:20,300
things, start merging together, you cannot
feel, that you have established yourself.

92
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:27,110
The joy within you, must be felt through your
awareness, otherwise you cannot feel it.

93
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,240
Supposing you had no eyes, how can you see.

94
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:42,230
If you were not aware to see Me, how will
you feel Me.

95
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:47,899
If you are not aware to feel Me, how can you
see Me.

96
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:58,160
If you are not aware to hear Me, how can you
understand Me.

97
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:06,269
And once that awareness comes to you, then
only, the joy awakens within you, because,

98
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:16,790
only through these subtle feelings of awareness,
you are going to absorb the joy.

99
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,010
As just now you felt it when you said “oh,
what a beautiful thing it is”, you felt

100
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,010
very happy.

101
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:27,529
You are feeling the joy of this creation that
is there.

102
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:30,420
And man is the summit of creation.

103
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:42,210
But, only the crowning part is such a little
thing, really little it is, its a very little

104
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:49,190
distance, it crosses in no time, but only
thing is, that these three things, have to

105
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,880
be combined.

106
00:15:50,880 --> 00:16:00,380
And that’s why I find, that, even you get
realization, you do not feel the silence,

107
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,850
because you have not become the light.

108
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,589
You do not feel the joy, because you have
not become the anand, that is the left side

109
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:09,589
of yourself.

110
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:12,329
In every thing there is joy.

111
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:16,040
As human beings you start seeing joys, in
the patterns.

112
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:24,050
You see a tree bark, you open it out, you
see the patterns, you call it the [inaudible

113
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:29,690
words], you call it the… the roughness,
and the smoothness, and the harmony of it,

114
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:35,920
you start seeing in the matter, the joy of
its creation.

115
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:45,980
But now, after realization, you start feeling
the joy of creation, this summit of creation,

116
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:52,280
is the human being.

117
00:16:52,280 --> 00:17:01,250
And thats why for a Sahaja Yogi, he must realize,
that if he tries to be, say, friendly, or

118
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:08,920
interested, or involved in a person, who is
at a lower level, he can never get joy from

119
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
that person.

120
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:16,500
Only thing what he can do is to raise that
person higher to his own level, and make him

121
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,189
also feel the same joy as you are getting.

122
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:28,569
Supposing a man, who is an artist, marries
a blind girl, whats the use.

123
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:31,980
She cannot enjoy the art created by this man.

124
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:38,350
In the same way, if you, are interested in
say, your family people, in your relations,

125
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:45,140
in your friends, the first thing, and the
highest, and the greatest thing that you can

126
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:53,039
give, is to give them Self-realization, means,
the joy of your Spirit.

127
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,360
Expose them to the joy of their Spirit, which
is the most precious.

128
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
[inaudible.

129
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,410
might be a word after it]

130
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:09,490
And this is the reason why people flicker,
and they… they fiddle, and they feel uneasy.

131
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:18,680
They… they lose their joy, very easily,
at a small thing, that has passed away, finished.

132
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:28,790
Its like the ocean before you, and I am there,
and I want you all to come into it, and enjoy.

133
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:37,830
It is all for you, the whole thing was created,
for your enjoyment.

134
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,919
You have to become subtler, and subtler.

135
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:47,419
You are wasting lot of time here, on very
gross things, you have noticed it.

136
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:48,999
