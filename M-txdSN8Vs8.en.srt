00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,533
Talk to Yogis in Rahuri, (India) 7 January 1983.

2
00:00:03,172 --> 00:00:06,174
You have come here to learn

3
00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:10,327
something, to go deep into your experiences

4
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:17,176
of the knowledge of your roots.

5
00:00:17,176 --> 00:00:22,385
Shri Krishna has said that this is

6
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:26,128
a tree which is upside down, the

7
00:00:26,128 --> 00:00:30,116
roots are upwards and the

8
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:33,075
leaves are outwards.

9
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,825
In the same way, you

10
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:39,284
know that Kundalini really, when

11
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:43,010
it rises in the Sahasrara or above

12
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,275
Sahasrara, then you start getting the

13
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:51,668
feeling of Kundalini. So, one has to

14
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:55,662
understand that when we are now getting

15
00:00:55,662 --> 00:00:58,716
subtler and subtler and trying to

16
00:00:58,716 --> 00:01:01,278
feel the Kundalini, we should try to

17
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:06,483
get out of materialistic attitude and

18
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,548
materialistic viewpoint and materialistic

19
00:01:09,548 --> 00:01:13,737
sticking point. I had met one

20
00:01:13,737 --> 00:01:16,206
guru before, because you know I went

21
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:19,010
to all of them. And I asked one of

22
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,944
them, I said, why do you take money,

23
00:01:21,944 --> 00:01:24,953
so much money from these people who

24
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:28,009
are western people? So much, why do you

25
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:31,171
take and just they become beggars,
absolutely, like beggars they become

26
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:34,206
because you charge them so much and

27
00:01:34,206 --> 00:01:38,999
so heavily??And he told me that unless

28
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:41,227
and until you make them beggars

29
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:43,756
they will never take to God. They are

30
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:46,847
too rich to be near God. I mean,

31
00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:50,406
this explanation I just could not

32
00:01:50,406 --> 00:01:53,666
understand, it was absurd, I could not

33
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:59,408
understand how can this explanation
have any proper meaning that you should

34
00:01:59,408 --> 00:02:02,400
make people beggars and
then they be nearer to God.

35
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,717
I said, in India we have
many beggars, do you think

36
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:08,597
those beggars are nearer to God??So he

37
00:02:08,597 --> 00:02:10,847
said, 揘o, otherwise, you see, they get

38
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:13,230
stuck up with their money and you

39
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,567
must just make them absolutely without

40
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:19,839
any money, moneyless people.

41
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:27,632
So, I mean, of course to such a
stupid person what can you talk?

42
00:02:27,632 --> 00:02:29,262
What can you convince?

43
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:34,858
I couldn't say to him, then
why are you taking the money?

44
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:39,923
Then he would have said,
because I am detached.?

45
00:02:39,923 --> 00:02:46,515
You see, anything one can say like that if you
start like that you cannot just stop it.

46
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:52,457
But one has to understand that
materialism has gone into our roots

47
00:02:52,457 --> 00:02:57,989
and if we have to clear out our roots
we must get out of materialism.

48
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:01,828
That's important, but that does not
in any way mean that you torture your

49
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:04,039
body or anything, I dont mean that.

50
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:06,889
But what Iam saying, your attention.

51
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:11,882
[Shri Mataji addresses some
children] you shouldn't do like that.

52
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:15,838
Always Natali you get up which you know is not
good.Always disturb is not good.Sit Down.

53
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:18,290
Now even if there are so many
childrens sitting down here.

54
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,424
Please sit down and dont
disturb any more sit down.

55
00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:24,691
Sonu come and sit here. Sonu come here.Better....
and then she gets the diarrhea always.

56
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:45,505
You are not here just to enjoy but you are here for a
puja do you understand that. You are grown up girl now.

57
00:03:45,531 --> 00:04:23,621
Look at all these children's how they are sitting quitely.Will they move out? they don't understand English.I have seen all our English children whether it is in Caxton hall or whether it is any hall all of them must go out and
make a big noise and play there. It's always seen they cannot sit down. Look at them these children how quitely they are sitting. What a quality it is! They are just feeling the vibrations and they are enjoying it. They dont want

58
00:04:23,647 --> 00:05:40,128
to go out.There is no enjoyment outside. Its inside. See them. See the contrast.You must keep eyes open to see. See our children. Now Linda is there she will tell you. She has to manage the children outside the caxton hall.They are shouting,screaming and the caxton hall people will always tell me that its better not have childrens for your program because they make suchh a lot of noise. Its very common problem. They have atleast told me 10 times that please
don't allow children to come in. But the children will never sit quitely even for 5 minutes. As soon as 5 min. will start they will say lets go out.. They can't sit quitely. Poor Sonu whenever she goes out she gets a diarrhea. .....All right Orea you sit somewhere out from there separately. You also.You have only here 3 childrens and you will always see them walking about. and another is Mathews where is he? I have to keep eye on them. It's dangerous.

59
00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:46,049
So now, when we are
dealing with our

60
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,462
roots we have to be in the center,

61
00:05:51,462 --> 00:05:56,376
in the core. In the core mean we are

62
00:05:56,376 --> 00:06:01,378
taking in, sucking in the feeling

63
00:06:01,378 --> 00:06:03,628
or you can say the?

64
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:11,183
Feeling and awareness put together, what do you
say to that in English, is there any word?

65
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:15,448
Is there any word which makes
awareness and feeling put together?

66
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:20,709
Is there Gavin?

67
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:24,031
[answer: Experience]

68
00:06:24,031 --> 00:06:26,548
Oh, yeah, experience, you can say the

69
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,301
experience into your awareness and feeling.

70
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:35,029
You have to get the experience
into your awareness and feeling.

71
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:38,730
In Marathi it is a very simple word Jaaniiv

72
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,007
comes from the word ja.

73
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:46,467
Ja comes the word spontaneous.

74
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:49,120
Also ja has two meaning.

75
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:57,786
Ja means also dnyana, awareness, and
also it means spontaneous zaaniiv.

76
00:06:57,786 --> 00:07:08,150
So you start sucking that within yourself, when
you are not entangled into other things.

77
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:13,050
If your attention is entangled
outside, you cannot enjoy.

78
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,339
So, to be lost into which is
samaadhi you see, is the one where

79
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:21,914
your attention is completely
drowned into the experience.

80
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:25,540
That iswhat we have to achieve.

81
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,329
So it is  not only materialism, also emotionalism,all kinds of isms.?

82
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:33,671
We are attacked by all kind of isms?

83
00:07:33,671 --> 00:07:40,794
since the history of word started in this
world I think and now the unholy thing that

84
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:46,546
the ism? latest is, could be sahaja
Yoga-ism?

85
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:53,224
also could be the greatest word because now
there has to be attack on Sahaja Yoga also.

86
00:07:53,224 --> 00:08:02,516
In this one is that as I told you, I didnt explain
it properly or you didnt hear Me properly that day,

87
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:15,925
that Sahaja Yoga does not mean lethargy or
slowness, not at all, but is a quick and a fast

88
00:08:15,925 --> 00:08:20,560
stepping in into the dissolution.

89
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,622
Very quick!

90
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:27,517
And once you very quickly

91
00:08:27,517 --> 00:08:30,467
dissolve into it, the whole movement

92
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:32,309
of your body is quick but not jerky,

93
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:40,159
is smooth and quick, rhythmic, is musical,

94
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,325
neither is awkward nor lethargic,

95
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:46,401
but is musical, is as a rhythm about

96
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:50,364
it, is very gracious.

97
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:54,954
The whole movement of dissolution can happen

98
00:08:54,954 --> 00:09:00,199
to you very easily if you dont allow

99
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:07,526
your attention to be attacked by all these isms.?

100
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:09,055
There is no end to it,

101
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:13,305
I mean, if I have to write all of them I
think we will have to need at least one book

102
00:09:13,305 --> 00:09:19,390
to write all the ism's of the world, there
is no end to it, which we have created.

103
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:23,697
Then the worst of all is now
I think Sahaja Yoga-ism

104
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:30,944
in which first of all is
the feeling of lethargy:

105
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:36,127
it will happen Sahaja, sit down.
Mother will do everything for you.

106
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:39,346
The another is Sahaja Yoga-egoism

107
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:43,116
in which we haven't got one fellow lying there,

108
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:51,270
in which people sahajayogi's get into tantrums, try
to show off that they are great Sahajayogi's

109
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:57,198
they have reached the third stage
or the seventh stage or whatever they may.

110
00:09:57,198 --> 00:10:02,946
Now it's good this example is a very
good example, I wish you had taken up.

111
00:10:02,946 --> 00:10:09,387
But see the expression of the Indian,

112
00:10:09,387 --> 00:10:11,871
the enamored expression, see, it

113
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:15,841
so genuine, they can't control the singing.

114
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:23,200
Now, see, it's like a ?I just dont know, but people
think it's a package deal sort of a thing.

115
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,626
It's so nonsensical I tell you, that either

116
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,786
they could be taken out all their money

117
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:34,143
or if they are to be told now for Puja,
all of them are paying twenty-one

118
00:10:34,143 --> 00:10:39,679
because they have to do this or this extra work, so
they are charging twenty-one

119
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,493
and if you tell them for Puja they
will even give them fifty-one.

120
00:10:43,493 --> 00:10:51,695
But I have told some of you have even refused
that I mean it's so shameful I tell you!

121
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:56,367
It's absolutely shameful! Can you imagine?

122
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:58,528
What is twenty-one rupees to you?

123
00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:06,174
To them it's quite a lot, because it's some sort of
part of you you are giving which is so nonsensical,

124
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:15,110
is a feeling , is a sign of complete negativity. Left Nabhi.

125
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,714
It's a problem. Materialism
it's complete materialism.

126
00:11:18,714 --> 00:11:26,811
Those who have been, say, doing
vegetarianism are materialists in India,

127
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:35,583
we have seen the cases like you see the Jains
and the Marvari and the Gujaratis.

128
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:41,437
They are all vegetarians, supposed to be compassionate people,

129
00:11:41,437 --> 00:11:47,085
they build some temples also and sometimes
they give to poor people also and

130
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:51,074
sometimes to people like Hare-Rama-Hare-Krishna
who are begging in India.

131
00:11:51,074 --> 00:11:55,409
They give money to them. Supposed to be very compassionate

132
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:59,764
They are more compassionate to
chickens than to human beings.

133
00:11:59,764 --> 00:12:02,253
We have that kind.

134
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:09,162
At the same time I have seen in the
West also such materialistic people,

135
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:16,132
I mean, they have no shame.
So when you just turn and

136
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:22,739
see that, should abhor that,
abhor, it's shameful!

137
00:12:22,802 --> 00:12:26,067
How could you be like that even
in Sahaja Yoga?

138
00:12:26,109 --> 00:12:31,655
So as I have told you, there are
some people who are materialistic,

139
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:38,327
some people who are emotionalistic
and some people who are egoistic.

140
00:12:38,327 --> 00:12:43,633
Now leave all these things on the
sides, then you come in the center.

141
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:46,675
Now you are in the center.

142
00:12:46,675 --> 00:12:54,539
In the center, people enjoy just the love
of their Mother, like Shri Ganesha does.

143
00:12:54,539 --> 00:13:02,384
Just think how your Mother loves you, finished!
Can you? This very sweet feeling

144
00:13:02,384 --> 00:13:05,700
And who is your Mother if you
really believe in Her, in Sahaja

145
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:12,120
Yoga, these two things should solve the problem.
No more thinking.

146
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,651
Just think how much your Mother loves

147
00:13:14,698 --> 00:13:23,167
that means you are jumping onto My Kundalini
and when you jump onto My Kundalini,

148
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:29,555
then there is no thought,
you cannot think.

149
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:37,674
When you think that how much your Mother loves
you, you are jumping onto My Kundalini and

150
00:13:37,674 --> 00:13:40,968
that time there is no thought.

151
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:44,307
It is very simple to
meditate in Sahaja Yoga

152
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:47,047
because you have somebody in person.

153
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:50,359
They never had somebody in person.

154
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,820
So I can understand their problems,

155
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,037
there was nobody in person;

156
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:58,752
they had to do it in the air.

157
00:13:58,752 --> 00:14:05,137
But here a sure shot thing:
you can feel your vibrations

158
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:15,485
you can feel My love and you
can feel your own quality.

159
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:21,968
It's very simple.

160
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:30,122
But it's not the love that is selfish, it's not the love where you

161
00:14:30,122 --> 00:14:33,586
say, Oh Mother loves me so She look after me,
She will do everything for me,

162
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:38,506
She is going to do
everything.

163
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:44,082
It's the love that other loves me so much,
what can I do for Her?

164
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:49,816
Which is the best flower I can give to my Mother?

165
00:14:49,816 --> 00:14:52,615
What does She need? She needs nothing.

166
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:59,498
She doesn't need money, She doesn't need anything.
What can I give Her?

167
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:02,094
Which is the best flower

168
00:15:02,094 --> 00:15:10,266
Like Shri Hanuman was given a gold necklace by Shri Sitaji

169
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:15,169
and He saw that, and He was sitting on a tree and

170
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:24,923
He was breaking one by one all of those
big-big gold balls of His necklace.

171
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:28,631
So Sitaji said, what are you doing?

172
00:15:28,631 --> 00:15:34,135
He said, I am trying to see in these balls where is Ram.?

173
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:42,495
He said, none of them has, so I am just breaking
them to find out, otherwise why should I wear it?

174
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:45,768
And then She said, "Really? Where is Ram?"

175
00:15:45,768 --> 00:15:53,171
He opened His chest. He said,
see in My chest. He exists there.

176
00:15:53,171 --> 00:15:58,405
So it is never one sided sort
of a thing, it is a thing that

177
00:15:58,405 --> 00:16:02,743
exists within you and you feel that
and then has to be reciprocal.

178
00:16:02,743 --> 00:16:15,471
In the water, if there is a ripple it goes
to the shores and then it returns back.

179
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:24,392
So with this force only, I tell you, you
can conquer your ego and super ego.

180
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:30,481
There is no way out.

181
00:16:30,481 --> 00:16:36,347
And for these Indians it is very easy to do because they

182
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:41,608
know their Mother's love.

183
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:46,572
I know there has been an attack on that point and

184
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,688
the mothers have been funny there.

185
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:53,704
But doesn't matter, when you see
something just put yourself to it.

186
00:16:53,704 --> 00:16:58,660
To feel your roots.

187
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,760
These are your roots, and then you see the enjoyment.

188
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,307
The Mother Earth Herself
is sucking you now.

189
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:14,124
She is sucking you down.

190
00:17:14,124 --> 00:17:16,573
That is how you meditate now.

191
00:17:16,616 --> 00:17:22,383
This is how you have to meditate, and it's
such a security giving thing.

192
00:17:22,383 --> 00:17:26,475
It will change your expressions, faces, everything.

193
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:38,682
And that enamored expression that you find in these
people will be on your face very soon

194
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:47,612
And complete silence will exist once you come on My Kundalini,

195
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:59,685
but not through your mental projections, but
through your meditative, spontaneous experience.

196
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:03,375
It's very joy giving.

197
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,224
Just feel the joy of that.

198
00:18:06,224 --> 00:18:14,488
You are all with Me here and the joy of that
feeling will really enlarge your hearts

199
00:18:14,488 --> 00:18:20,216
and then, then you can give it to others.

200
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:23,712
You don't have to be crazy about these things

201
00:18:23,712 --> 00:18:32,184
but just to feel it within yourself.

202
00:18:32,184 --> 00:18:38,333
All right, now I move on to Indians because

203
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:42,439
they are different style of people.

204
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:47,094
May God bless you!

205
00:18:47,094 --> 00:18:49,305
(Marathi talk)

206
00:31:39,261 --> 00:31:41,271
Now, I was telling them, I must

207
00:31:41,271 --> 00:31:46,696
translate it to you in English is the
most important point

208
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:52,271
I was telling that now you are transformed,
now you have become saints, no doubt of it.

209
00:31:52,271 --> 00:31:55,190
Now from an egg you have become a bird,

210
00:31:55,190 --> 00:32:01,532
but, now what should happen to you?
Your Kundalini is still in the sacrum.

211
00:32:01,532 --> 00:32:06,772
How it has happened that now you
have got all the Ganesha Shakti?

212
00:32:06,772 --> 00:32:13,384
I have made you like Ganesha, in the same
pattern as I had made Ganesha you are made.

213
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:21,237
Now you have become a Ganesha,
and from this Ganesha stage,

214
00:32:21,237 --> 00:32:30,621
which you think you are a Ganesha now,
if I offer you a throne of Shri Ganesha,

215
00:32:30,621 --> 00:32:36,161
if you have to sit on that throne
as a king, then what should happen?

216
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:41,434
Actually, that now your Kundalini should
not be anymore in the sacrum bone,

217
00:32:41,434 --> 00:32:46,525
but in your stomach, because Ganesha's
Kundalini is in the stomach.

218
00:32:46,525 --> 00:32:49,788
In the stomach means in the Nabhi Chakra.

219
00:32:49,788 --> 00:32:56,374
Means all your seeking has been
so far in materialism,

220
00:32:56,374 --> 00:33:02,078
has been in other things like in money, or in

221
00:33:02,078 --> 00:33:06,476
power or in love or whatever it was.

222
00:33:06,476 --> 00:33:11,807
But now your Kundalini itself
is in the Nabhi Chakra, means

223
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:16,699
your seeking is nothing but
itself has become the Kundalini.

224
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:23,026
Your seeking has become the Kundalini,
means that you are the giver,

225
00:33:23,026 --> 00:33:26,937
now you are the Guru, you have
now become the Guru.

226
00:33:26,937 --> 00:33:32,898
When the Kundalini starts from the Nabhi
that means now you are the Guru,

227
00:33:32,898 --> 00:33:39,258
now you have to give all the
blessings,everything, as a Guru does.

228
00:33:39,258 --> 00:33:41,797
Now you all have become Gurus.

229
00:33:41,797 --> 00:33:44,867
But that's only possible when the Kundalini has risen,

230
00:33:44,867 --> 00:33:50,813
has lifted Her abode from the sacrum
to the stomach,

231
00:33:50,813 --> 00:33:56,228
and this stage, unless and until it has
arrived, you are not a confirmed Guru.

232
00:33:56,228 --> 00:33:59,495
Once that has happened you
become a Guru and then

233
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:05,559
you can really impress
people and work it out.

234
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:07,779
It has to be done very fast.

235
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:11,531
It has to work out very fast
and for that, first of all,

236
00:34:11,531 --> 00:34:14,986
please get rid of your
entanglements which are stupid.

237
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:18,842
If you really believe that you
have to progress in your seeking,

238
00:34:18,842 --> 00:34:23,773
that you have to have your Kundalini
coming up from your Nabhi,

239
00:34:23,773 --> 00:34:31,572
then please, please hurry up, please try to
work out, otherwise you are very few who

240
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:40,450
have been given also the privilege of
doing My Puja, very few.

241
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:43,713
And those who have been given have a chance

242
00:34:43,713 --> 00:34:46,725
to develop to that stage, and
once you become that, all

243
00:34:46,725 --> 00:34:52,289
of you who have achieved that
stage can become the Gurus.

244
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:55,924
And for that, you have to have only wisdom.

245
00:34:55,924 --> 00:34:59,133
Wisdom, keep to your wisdom,

246
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:04,801
and like Shri Ganesha has His
wisdom and in that wisdom He knew

247
00:35:04,801 --> 00:35:07,923
one thing: that His Mother was all powerful

248
00:35:07,923 --> 00:35:12,464
and that He doesn't have to worship
anybody else but His Mother.

249
00:35:12,464 --> 00:35:17,628
And He has to have all the
powers which are granted by Her.

250
00:35:17,628 --> 00:35:23,506
His powers, no one, even Brahma,
Vishnu, Mahesha does not have.

251
00:35:23,506 --> 00:35:25,426
They cannot reach Ganesha;

252
00:35:25,426 --> 00:35:29,211
They cannot reach His stage because
They are one-sided but

253
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:33,181
Shri Ganesha has all the powers,
all the Chaitanya powers He has.

254
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:37,152
So to become like that, to be like
that,He should be your ideal:

255
00:35:37,152 --> 00:35:43,850
how He behaved and how He would sacrifice
anything for the sake of Mother.

256
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:50,416
Here there are people who don't even
want to pay for something like a puja and ..stuff

257
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:54,810
which you may just spend away
somewhere in nonsensical things,

258
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:58,891
because your attention has to
be brought round completely.

259
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:05,113
It has to be completely severed from
all these nonsensical entanglements

260
00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:09,570
and there should be less talking and more experiencing.

261
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:13,700
Then only it's going to work out.

262
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:22,342
It's a good pleasure and a great
thing to be here in this holy land,

263
00:36:22,342 --> 00:36:25,807
it's a very holy place
you can see it, so peaceful.

264
00:36:25,807 --> 00:36:28,733
Try to feel the peace within yourself that

265
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:32,351
is within every human being and after

266
00:36:32,351 --> 00:36:34,315
that you have to know that this

267
00:36:34,315 --> 00:36:38,234
peace that you are achieving
has to be given to others.

268
00:36:38,234 --> 00:36:43,669
In Sahaja Yoga, perhaps you have realized,
whatever you have got from the nature,

269
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:46,286
you can release it back.

270
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:51,476
For example if you give vibrations
to a plant you can make it grow.

271
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:57,251
If you give vibrations to a flower
you can make it sustain its life.

272
00:36:57,251 --> 00:37:00,498
For the first time you are giving
something to the nature,

273
00:37:00,498 --> 00:37:04,274
but as soon as you grow up to that state of a

274
00:37:04,274 --> 00:37:07,169
Guru then you can give the peace

275
00:37:07,169 --> 00:37:14,429
that is in the nature, you can give the
feeling of bliss that is in the nature.

276
00:37:14,429 --> 00:37:17,696
But first achieve it within yourself.

277
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:24,284
Make this go inside you and see
that bliss settle down within you.

278
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:27,953
You don't see other nonsensical
things which are very disturbing

279
00:37:27,953 --> 00:37:30,044
sometimes to your western mind.

280
00:37:30,044 --> 00:37:37,208
For example if a telephone is not working or the road is not all right, if the
bathroom is not this.

281
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:43,578
These nonsensical things have no meaning, but
feel the peace outside,

282
00:37:43,578 --> 00:37:52,706
try to establish that peace within because
this peace you have to give to others.

283
00:37:52,706 --> 00:37:56,834
The whole development plan
that I have is very fast

284
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:59,613
and I am sure you will keep pace with me.

285
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:00,684
So may God bless you!

286
00:38:00,684 --> 00:38:07,591
When you sit down just feel the peace and
try to achieve that peace within yourself.

287
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:12,513
Don't pay attention to nonsensical
things and this with this your little

288
00:38:12,513 --> 00:38:17,302
brain trying to criticize, but try to
achieve the peace within yourself so

289
00:38:17,302 --> 00:38:20,680
that you can give peace to others.

290
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:26,836
It's not proper that some of you are looking after
the negative people all the time, it's not proper.

291
00:38:26,836 --> 00:38:28,701
You don't have to look
after the negative people.

292
00:38:28,701 --> 00:38:30,324
Just leave them alone.

293
00:38:30,324 --> 00:38:34,777
Keep out of that because negative
people can always bring you down.

294
00:38:34,777 --> 00:38:39,668
Don't try to improve the conditions of the
negative, leave them behind. You go fast.

295
00:38:39,668 --> 00:38:45,581
Once you have achieved that state
then we can arrange for them to come.

296
00:38:45,581 --> 00:38:49,625
For example, if My car has failed, all
right, I got into another car, which

297
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:52,197
was all right because I have to come to the program.

298
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:55,619
Then I can send the tempo
from here to get that another

299
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:00,424
car where there were some people who
were not supposed to be at the program.

300
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:04,543
That's how you have to be quick and
not bother your heads too much

301
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:08,880
about the negative people who are sick
people, trying to be compassionate.

302
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,865
There is no need.

303
00:39:09,865 --> 00:39:11,378
Tell them, tell Mother.

304
00:39:11,378 --> 00:39:12,872
Let you talk to Mother.

305
00:39:12,872 --> 00:39:16,410
Look after yourselves and
don't be bothered about them.

306
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:19,709
This is another nonsensical
idea of compassion you have got.

307
00:39:19,709 --> 00:39:22,764
Compassion is not mental projection I told you:

308
00:39:22,764 --> 00:39:25,536
the compassion that works, that flows.

309
00:39:25,536 --> 00:39:29,508
It's all mental you see for us
compassion is mental, every idea,

310
00:39:29,508 --> 00:39:35,103
peace is mental, bliss is mental, God
is mental, everything is mental for us.

311
00:39:35,103 --> 00:39:41,772
He is not. He is the one that
resides in the heart as Spirit.

312
00:39:41,772 --> 00:39:44,370
He is the one who works
through the compassion.

313
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:50,492
And now you know My compassion is
that it flows, it works, it acts.

314
00:39:50,492 --> 00:39:55,410
It's not mental.

315
00:39:55,410 --> 00:40:00,987
So don't try to be mentally concerned
with people and try to be compassionate.

316
00:40:00,987 --> 00:40:01,960
All right?

317
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,456
I hope you understand that the
compassion is not a mental idea

318
00:40:06,456 --> 00:40:10,928
that we are compassionate, we are working
for the unity of the world.And all that.

319
00:40:10,928 --> 00:40:16,475
Even unity and all those ideas, even
the idea of collective understanding

320
00:40:16,475 --> 00:40:20,940
is in the heart, it should work.

321
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,484
In Sanskrit it is Kaaryanvit.

322
00:40:24,484 --> 00:40:27,687
In English there is no word. Kaaryanvit

323
00:40:27,687 --> 00:40:30,578
is embodied with the working capacity,

324
00:40:30,578 --> 00:40:33,429
embodied with the working out capacity

325
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:36,465
actually working out capacity
you can translate like that.

326
00:40:36,465 --> 00:40:37,505
It should work.

327
00:40:37,505 --> 00:40:41,857
If it does not work out then what's the use
of looking after somebody who is sick?

328
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:46,706
all right, come along This is
nonsense, this is very mental.

329
00:40:46,706 --> 00:40:54,950
Just don't waste your energy; you have
not come here to look after the sick.

330
00:40:54,950 --> 00:41:01,981
I hope you understand this idea of looking after the
sick and being very

331
00:41:01,981 --> 00:41:05,246
is all ego-oriented, see we are trying to help the sick,

332
00:41:05,246 --> 00:41:09,115
we are trying to help this, that,?all ego-oriented.

333
00:41:09,115 --> 00:41:13,711
Another superego-oriented that we
are sacrificing this and that and

334
00:41:13,711 --> 00:41:18,777
we are becoming beggars in India like the
Hare-Rama-Hare-Krishna. Beggars, parasites.

335
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:22,316
Both are just the same, now
please don't do all these things

336
00:41:22,316 --> 00:41:31,833
and try to keep yourself glued to one ideal:

337
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:35,247
that you have to ascend faster.

338
00:41:35,247 --> 00:41:41,660
You have to individually ascend faster
and collectively pull out everyone

339
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:46,388
but not those who are heavily
laden with problems and

340
00:41:46,388 --> 00:41:49,794
who are creating problems and
objecting your progress.

341
00:41:49,794 --> 00:41:53,627
That doesn't mean that you are
not compassionate.

342
00:41:53,627 --> 00:41:59,761
You know how much compassion that I have but
My compassion doesn't make stories,

343
00:41:59,761 --> 00:42:02,822
I am so compassionate and I am this and that.

344
00:42:02,842 --> 00:42:08,093
Up to a point is all right but don't so too much
bother about people who are dragging you behind.

345
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:10,603
You have come here for a training,

346
00:42:10,603 --> 00:42:18,952
a training into the understanding
of awareness which is compassion.

347
00:42:18,952 --> 00:42:23,183
You all have to, even, when you go to the
school, you are not bothered about a person

348
00:42:23,183 --> 00:42:26,840
who is lacking in the
class, do you?

349
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,598
You want to study fast so that you come up well.

350
00:42:29,598 --> 00:42:33,051
In the same way, I would
request you not to bother your

351
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:37,064
heads too much about people who
are trying to pull you down

352
00:42:37,064 --> 00:42:39,990
because I don't want you to be pulled down.

353
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:46,222
That's My compassion for them and for you.

354
00:42:46,222 --> 00:42:49,142
Let Me look after them and you just
don't worry your heads about them.

355
00:42:49,142 --> 00:42:52,205
They will be all right.

356
00:42:52,205 --> 00:42:53,361
So, may God bless you!

357
00:42:53,361 --> 00:43:00,431
Lets have a puja today, and
this puja will be simple today.

358
00:43:00,431 --> 00:43:06,092
I think we will have Ganesha's Puja and
then we will have Devi's Puja today,

359
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:12,798
and then we will have a good havan.
That is a good place for havan.
