1
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,915
Today, we are going to worship Shri Ganesha.

2
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:30,338
It's a very opportune time today, I feel,

3
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:35,881
where the innocence, especially

4
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:42,714
in the European and American countries,

5
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:45,753
is under attack.

6
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:50,332
There's no respect of the innocence,

7
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:54,998
no value for the innocence.

8
00:05:56,332 --> 00:05:59,123
They don't understand how important

9
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:03,498
it is for human life

10
00:06:04,332 --> 00:06:07,956
to have innocence

11
00:06:08,956 --> 00:06:14,373
being respected within themselves and also without.

12
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:21,207
The human life is different from that of animal life.

13
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:26,498
Animals are controlled all the time, or we can say

14
00:06:26,706 --> 00:06:31,790
they are under a complete imprisonment, you can say

15
00:06:32,748 --> 00:06:37,790
under the will of Lord Sadashiva.

16
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:41,664
That's why He's called as Pashupati.

17
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:48,623
But human beings have been given freedom

18
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:54,040
to choose their ascent, to choose the right,

19
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,498
to choose the truth.

20
00:06:56,706 --> 00:07:00,748
Only through innocence they can achieve that.

21
00:07:01,623 --> 00:07:03,896
Can you remove this one from here because

22
00:07:04,097 --> 00:07:06,639
people can't see Me I think.

23
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:17,539
It's all right.

24
00:07:22,332 --> 00:07:26,332
Only the innocence is the source of joy.

25
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:31,956
Without innocence you cannot enjoy anything fully.

26
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:38,873
This innocence is today completely under challenge

27
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:43,165
and to finish the innocence,

28
00:07:43,748 --> 00:07:46,082
in a very subtle way

29
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:49,873
there are very negative, cruel,

30
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:53,873
criminal type of people who are working it out.

31
00:07:54,498 --> 00:07:58,332
Their minds, if you say “possessed,” it doesn't look like that

32
00:07:58,748 --> 00:08:03,831
because otherwise they are quite intelligent.

33
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:08,539
They are also, in a way,

34
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:12,581
creative of horrible things.

35
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:16,456
So you can't say they are not intelligent,

36
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:22,082
but from where do they get this knowledge

37
00:08:22,332 --> 00:08:25,664
of creating something so horrifying?

38
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:35,915
In this Kali Yuga, as in Sahaja Yoga,

39
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,082
everybody can take birth. There's freedom.

40
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:46,082
It was not before so much so

41
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,623
that all kinds of evil people have taken

42
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,748
birth on this earth.

43
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,915
These evil people generate

44
00:08:58,498 --> 00:09:05,165
evil thoughts and people catch them and get moving with it.

45
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:08,873
Even a good person can get swayed by it.

46
00:09:09,207 --> 00:09:12,373
Even a saint can get swayed by it.

47
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:17,123
So these forces of evil,

48
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:22,165
the forces which are working out today,

49
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:26,332
are coming basically from these horrible people.

50
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:31,082
Firstly, they might have come as false gurus,

51
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:35,998
teaching something nonsensical,

52
00:09:36,373 --> 00:09:38,456
like Rajneesh.

53
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:42,581
Then from some philosophers like Freud,

54
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:47,748
who is still accepted in some countries as a great philosopher,

55
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:55,998
and still some psychologists worship him as God.

56
00:09:57,332 --> 00:10:02,248
This Freudian knowledge was accepted

57
00:10:02,748 --> 00:10:06,706
without even thinking why Freud did that.

58
00:10:08,831 --> 00:10:11,207
Freud was a Jew,

59
00:10:11,706 --> 00:10:16,915
and he found that many Christians tortured the Jews in America.

60
00:10:17,956 --> 00:10:21,290
This is another anti Christ activity.

61
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:24,498
And when they tortured the Jews,

62
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:29,230
this fellow thought that better to make them immoral,

63
00:10:30,082 --> 00:10:31,373
destroy their innocence.

64
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:34,373
I don't know if he could understand to that point,

65
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:40,040
and he started theories which were so shocking

66
00:10:41,248 --> 00:10:46,332
that normally any sensible person would never have accepted it.

67
00:10:47,082 --> 00:10:51,831
But so many people accepted in America to begin with.

68
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:54,623
In America,

69
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:57,332
people take to anything very easily which is absurd,

70
00:10:57,539 --> 00:10:59,332
which is stupid; I don't know why.

71
00:10:59,498 --> 00:11:02,040
They have a special liking for such things.

72
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,956
If Freud had come to India,

73
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:07,135
they would have cut him into a hundred pieces, I tell you,

74
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:09,297
and thrown in the Arabic Sea.

75
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:11,664
They could not have born this idea,

76
00:11:11,873 --> 00:11:16,664
the way he had insulted the mother and her love for her child,

77
00:11:16,873 --> 00:11:19,123
the purity of her love.

78
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:24,664
But Jews did not accept him, surprisingly.

79
00:11:25,082 --> 00:11:26,623
Jews did not accept.

80
00:11:26,831 --> 00:11:32,040
It's the Christians who accepted his ideas and started destroying,

81
00:11:32,248 --> 00:11:35,123
displeasing Shri Ganesh.

82
00:11:37,915 --> 00:11:39,373
First of all,

83
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:43,165
we have to understand we are born in a very precarious,

84
00:11:43,332 --> 00:11:45,748
dangerous times.

85
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,831
At the time of Christ there were very few people

86
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,964
who followed him and they didn't understand much about Kundalini either.

87
00:11:54,165 --> 00:11:56,123
They had no knowledge.

88
00:11:56,664 --> 00:11:58,956
They had no knowledge that Christ

89
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:01,790
was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha.

90
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,290
But in the Christian countries only you find

91
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:08,873
the insult of Christ, the insult of innocence

92
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:13,290
openly done, sometimes legally accepted.

93
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:18,332
So when we are born under such horrible circumstances,

94
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:20,706
we have to build up

95
00:12:20,915 --> 00:12:23,664
a great force, ourselves,

96
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,831
of spirituality.

97
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:28,998
When I came today,

98
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,873
there was no breeze, no leaf was moving,

99
00:12:33,082 --> 00:12:36,706
but you were singing songs and tremendous breeze was coming

100
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:39,998
from you all, and that made Me understand

101
00:12:40,207 --> 00:12:44,082
that this Divine force has come into being.

102
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:46,748
It is there.

103
00:12:47,748 --> 00:12:52,040
It's working. Not only that, but it’s very powerful.

104
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:57,332
Normally, breeze doesn't come to Me, it goes the other way around.

105
00:12:58,123 --> 00:13:00,207
But it was such a tremendous breeze

106
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:02,748
that I had to hold somebody's hand.

107
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:05,790
And not a leaf was moving.

108
00:13:07,332 --> 00:13:09,956
So this collective force that you have,

109
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,498
you must remember you have to fight it,

110
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:16,498
not to run away. Don't escape it.

111
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:19,748
You have to fight it

112
00:13:19,956 --> 00:13:24,040
and you have to prove that innocence is to be respected.

113
00:13:33,706 --> 00:13:38,581
Adi Shakti first made Shri Ganesh.

114
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:41,539
It was the first

115
00:13:41,956 --> 00:13:44,539
deity was created. Why?

116
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,456
Because She wanted to fill

117
00:13:48,664 --> 00:13:52,998
the whole atmosphere with Chaitanya,

118
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,414
with holiness, with auspiciousness.

119
00:13:57,998 --> 00:13:59,915
It is still there.

120
00:14:00,248 --> 00:14:02,664
It's still everywhere you can feel

121
00:14:02,873 --> 00:14:06,748
Chaitanya is working, but

122
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:11,539
it does not penetrate into the

123
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:16,248
modern minds because modern mind

124
00:14:16,414 --> 00:14:19,539
doesn't know what this innocence is.

125
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,790
They have no idea at all about innocence.

126
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:27,790
The way they are going on

127
00:14:28,082 --> 00:14:33,539
everywhere, is really something never happened on this earth.

128
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,956
So with the innocence comes moral life.

129
00:14:42,456 --> 00:14:47,623
Morality is the expression of innocence.

130
00:14:54,082 --> 00:14:56,539
Innocence

131
00:14:57,123 --> 00:15:02,664
shows a person that he's incapable of being immoral.

132
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:05,748
Once I had gone to visit a ship.

133
00:15:06,123 --> 00:15:09,194
I was coming out in the Customs.

134
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:11,436
When I was coming in the Customs

135
00:15:11,637 --> 00:15:14,014
they said, "Did you get anything from the ship?"

136
00:15:14,215 --> 00:15:15,714
I said, "Yes, of course."

137
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,623
So they were shocked, you know , "What did you get?"

138
00:15:18,873 --> 00:15:20,414
"Some cheese."

139
00:15:20,664 --> 00:15:21,790
"And?"

140
00:15:21,998 --> 00:15:26,040
"And we ate also, and we have some cheese with us.”

141
00:15:26,456 --> 00:15:27,498
"What else?"

142
00:15:27,748 --> 00:15:29,456
"Some books."

143
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:31,456
"Books?

144
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,290
You are not supposed to get any books from there."

145
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:35,956
I said, "Why not?"

146
00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:38,373
He said, “You have to pay Customs."

147
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:43,414
I said, “All right, how much do we have to pay Customs?"

148
00:15:43,748 --> 00:15:46,873
“You didn't read any rule about it?”  I said, “No.”

149
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,414
I was innocent.  I never read anything

150
00:15:49,623 --> 00:15:52,581
that you have to pay money for books also.

151
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:55,956
He said, “No, no you are joking. Go."

152
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,831
They thought this woman is so simple,

153
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:03,060
She doesn't, I was the wife of the Chairman of Shipping Corporation,

154
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:04,719
going in a very big car,

155
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,587
and they couldn't understand this woman is so simple that

156
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:09,913
She's saying She has taken some cheese

157
00:16:10,114 --> 00:16:12,531
and She has taken some books.

158
00:16:14,831 --> 00:16:17,706
All these laws and regulations

159
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:20,581
people bind they have also come

160
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:24,332
from our idea of Dharma.

161
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:28,539
But the root of Dharma is innocence.

162
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:33,207
All laws are made

163
00:16:34,248 --> 00:16:36,623
to protect the innocent.

164
00:16:37,332 --> 00:16:39,748
Not to punish

165
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,373
only the criminals but to protect the innocent person.

166
00:16:44,915 --> 00:16:48,332
So if somebody is proved to be innocent,

167
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:53,332
your innocence protects you.

168
00:16:54,373 --> 00:16:56,706
I have seen many a times in My life,

169
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:01,165
because I'm so simple, I should say,

170
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:06,207
that I had no problem, never, of anything.

171
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:13,248
This is a kind of

172
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:16,082
a very powerful vibrations

173
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:18,873
that come from an innocent person,

174
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,414
like from small children.

175
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,539
Small children, if you see their vibrations,

176
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:29,539
hundreds grown up Sahaja Yogis may not have

177
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,956
the vibrations of a little one, I can tell you this much.

178
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:35,873
But once they start growing,

179
00:17:37,248 --> 00:17:40,581
then they become very intelligent,

180
00:17:41,498 --> 00:17:44,290
very grown up, matured,

181
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:50,165
and as if they have lost their innocence.

182
00:17:51,623 --> 00:17:54,373
This is no growth according to Me.

183
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:58,706
According to Me this is the death of innocence.

184
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:02,207
To be cunning, to be clever,

185
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,581
to be very intelligent, so called,

186
00:18:07,332 --> 00:18:09,956
it is very self-deceptive.

187
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:18,373
For that, there is one blessing also.

188
00:18:19,623 --> 00:18:22,664
All those who have

189
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,082
committed such mistakes

190
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:30,831
have to ask forgiveness from Sadashiva

191
00:18:31,165 --> 00:18:33,873
or from the Adi Shakti.

192
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:37,623
But Ganesha doesn't forgive.

193
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:42,581
That is one thing wrong with Him: He doesn't forgive.

194
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:47,207
If you have hurt Him, He'll hit you back.

195
00:18:48,082 --> 00:18:51,581
As a result now, we have diseases like AIDS,

196
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,123
all other horrible diseases that you have

197
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:57,165
which are called as secret diseases.

198
00:18:57,748 --> 00:19:01,581
They are all because of the wrath of Shri Ganesh.

199
00:19:02,123 --> 00:19:04,873
Immoral life that people have been leading

200
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:07,373
as if they have a permission

201
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:10,581
from God Almighty to do what they like.

202
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:16,248
People are so proud, such vanity,

203
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:20,373
that they think whatever they do, after all, what,

204
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
nothing can happen to them.

205
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:26,414
And with all these things happening in this world,

206
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:29,790
people are still taking to immorality,

207
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:32,332
very openly,

208
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:35,498
boastfully.

209
00:19:35,915 --> 00:19:40,456
And I've seen that people who are elite, I have till now,

210
00:19:40,706 --> 00:19:42,498
been in the elite people.

211
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:46,915
They crack such dirty jokes and they are so

212
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:50,623
overly smart that you just can't bear their company.

213
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:54,332
They are worse than the loafers on the street sometimes.

214
00:19:54,706 --> 00:19:57,332
So this disease has spread,

215
00:19:57,831 --> 00:20:03,414
spread among older people more than among younger people,

216
00:20:04,706 --> 00:20:06,207
among children.

217
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:11,664
So I think the people are now jealous of the little children.

218
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,706
Otherwise, why should they attack

219
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:16,956
younger children? What do they get out of them?

220
00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:22,040
In this jealous attitude

221
00:20:22,248 --> 00:20:26,123
they try to attack in a very dirty, funny manner.

222
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:29,623
Then Shri Ganesh,

223
00:20:29,831 --> 00:20:31,873
He will never forgive these people -

224
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:34,581
never, never, never.

225
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,956
First of all, He'll expose them,

226
00:20:37,623 --> 00:20:41,706
and He will punish them for seven lives.

227
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:45,915
Seven lives their families will be cursed,

228
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:49,998
and seven lives they, themselves, will be cursed.

229
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:53,123
That is His commandment.

230
00:20:53,332 --> 00:20:55,956
But if His Mother says, "All right, forgive",

231
00:20:56,165 --> 00:20:59,373
or the father says, "All right, forgive", He obeys.

232
00:20:59,623 --> 00:21:03,248
He obeys His Mother absolutely.

233
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,414
Never questions, never questions,

234
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,831
never answers back.

235
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:16,207
Whatever He’s told,

236
00:21:16,623 --> 00:21:21,332
though He's in command of all the Ganas, He's  Ganadheesha,

237
00:21:21,664 --> 00:21:26,831
but before His Mother, He's just like a little baby.

238
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:30,456
He doesn't challenge the Mother.

239
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:35,207
Even if the Mother tries to test Him

240
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:40,332
or tries to get puzzled,

241
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,748
He never doubt Her.

242
00:21:45,664 --> 00:21:48,831
In Her Maya He cannot fall.

243
00:21:49,456 --> 00:21:53,831
He cannot fall into Her Maya because He's so innocent.

244
00:21:55,332 --> 00:21:59,456
He's like a churned out butter, out of the buttermilk.

245
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,539
So this butter can never get dissolved back.

246
00:22:03,748 --> 00:22:07,998
In the same way, this child,

247
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,498
which is pure innocence,

248
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:15,040
never can be contaminated

249
00:22:15,456 --> 00:22:18,290
by the Maya of the Mother.

250
00:22:18,498 --> 00:22:23,581
Maya is the process by which you test people.

251
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:26,165
You have to test them.

252
00:22:26,332 --> 00:22:30,123
See, these days people are so clever, so intelligent,

253
00:22:30,332 --> 00:22:34,040
that it is beyond even Adi Shakti, beyond any Shakti,

254
00:22:34,248 --> 00:22:37,123
the way they try to cheat you.

255
00:22:37,332 --> 00:22:39,290
So many have cheated Me,

256
00:22:39,456 --> 00:22:41,873
but they are back in their seats again.

257
00:22:42,082 --> 00:22:45,248
That's done not by Me, but by Shri Ganesha.

258
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:48,040
He's just standing on all the sides.

259
00:22:48,248 --> 00:22:50,664
If you try to do anything like that,

260
00:22:50,873 --> 00:22:53,873
He'll hit you hard - I can't help it.

261
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:57,290
Now, this one came on this earth

262
00:22:57,456 --> 00:23:01,456
as our Lord Jesus Christ.

263
00:23:02,504 --> 00:23:06,171
Christ, I think, is more active than Shri Ganesha

264
00:23:06,382 --> 00:23:10,421
because Shri Ganesha is fat, He has a big belly,

265
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:12,873
I think He takes time to hit you.

266
00:23:13,082 --> 00:23:15,373
But this Christ,

267
00:23:15,581 --> 00:23:18,082
I don't know how He has hit people.

268
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:22,998
All over the world there are diseases, diseases, diseases.

269
00:23:24,082 --> 00:23:27,706
He has killed so many people.

270
00:23:28,082 --> 00:23:31,873
He's the one who used to ask for forgiveness

271
00:23:32,331 --> 00:23:34,665
for the people who killed him.

272
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:38,082
But He is so active, I have seen,

273
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,706
that sometimes I tell people,

274
00:23:40,915 --> 00:23:43,790
don't talk ill of Me, its very dangerous.

275
00:23:43,998 --> 00:23:46,498
Don't talk against Me.

276
00:23:46,748 --> 00:23:50,123
In a very secret manner He exists

277
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,248
and the way He hits people is sometimes -

278
00:23:54,456 --> 00:23:59,498
it's dangerous. Even My eyes get filled up with tears.

279
00:23:59,915 --> 00:24:02,164
So I have to control both sides.

280
00:24:02,373 --> 00:24:07,790
One is Shri Ganesha, another side is Christ.

281
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,123
There are two other people,

282
00:24:12,623 --> 00:24:16,581
Saint Michael and Gabriel.

283
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:20,498
We call them

284
00:24:21,957 --> 00:24:24,623
in Sanskrit language

285
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,748
as Bhairava and Hanumana,

286
00:24:27,957 --> 00:24:31,957
and they incarnated as

287
00:24:33,456 --> 00:24:37,248
Buddha - Mahavira and Buddha.

288
00:24:39,748 --> 00:24:43,248
And the Buddhists are really, I tell you,

289
00:24:43,456 --> 00:24:47,498
are another kind of  perverts.

290
00:24:48,456 --> 00:24:51,581
It was said, Buddha said

291
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,498
that you should not get attached to anything;

292
00:24:54,748 --> 00:24:57,581
you shouldn't get attached to your money,

293
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:03,248
to your wealth, to your family, to anything.

294
00:25:14,331 --> 00:25:16,373
That time,

295
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:20,123
the attachment was very great, must have been,

296
00:25:21,082 --> 00:25:24,581
and this attachment he wanted them to

297
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,665
remove from the minds of the people.

298
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:29,873
You cannot.

299
00:25:30,082 --> 00:25:31,873
By removing your clothes,

300
00:25:32,082 --> 00:25:35,164
by wearing those saffron clothes,

301
00:25:35,706 --> 00:25:39,248
by shaving your heads, by walking bare feet,

302
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:43,123
by torturing your body, you cannot.

303
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:45,957
That's all outside.

304
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:50,331
That's not real detachment. That's not Buddha at all.

305
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,082
Neither Christ, nor Mahavira.

306
00:25:55,331 --> 00:25:59,957
What they said that you should get detached from within.

307
00:26:01,082 --> 00:26:05,123
To get detached from within is very different

308
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:09,706
than to get detached from outside.

309
00:26:11,248 --> 00:26:16,123
It's not how much you starve that you become Christ,

310
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:22,248
or whether you move like Mahavira,

311
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:26,082
that you become like Him,

312
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:31,706
or you get saffron clothes

313
00:26:31,915 --> 00:26:34,748
like Buddha, you become Buddha.

314
00:26:34,957 --> 00:26:38,373
So what a misconception they have

315
00:26:38,581 --> 00:26:42,623
of whatever was taught to people.

316
00:26:42,957 --> 00:26:47,289
That was the time when it was the days of tapasya,

317
00:26:47,623 --> 00:26:52,082
of penance, and that's why they said to do penance

318
00:26:52,248 --> 00:26:54,623
is best is to get rid of all these things

319
00:26:54,873 --> 00:26:59,706
so you will develop deeper into your being.

320
00:27:01,706 --> 00:27:04,331
Even in the Christian religion they started

321
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,248
these nuns and these, what you call them,

322
00:27:07,456 --> 00:27:09,998
the fathers and the mothers and the nuns,

323
00:27:10,164 --> 00:27:12,581
and all kinds of things.

324
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,498
This is another artificial thing they started.

325
00:27:16,957 --> 00:27:21,790
By doing this, do you think you can become innocent?

326
00:27:24,498 --> 00:27:27,873
I have known nuns who are so horrible

327
00:27:28,082 --> 00:27:30,082
that you can't even look at them,

328
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,873
they emit nothing but heat.

329
00:27:33,082 --> 00:27:37,082
And those priests, now you have heard about them,

330
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:42,248
the way they are attacking the innocence of people.

331
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:48,915
Buddhists are the worst, I should say, because

332
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:57,832
they say, “Renounce, renounce everything.”

333
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,206
All right, renounce and beg.

334
00:28:03,206 --> 00:28:07,581
So you renounce everything and beg for gold.

335
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,915
What do you say to this kind of a contradiction?

336
00:28:11,082 --> 00:28:15,123
And we have there, like Dalai Lama,

337
00:28:15,331 --> 00:28:18,832
he is a universal beggar

338
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:21,206
and people like it.

339
00:28:21,414 --> 00:28:23,040
People like if somebody is begging

340
00:28:23,206 --> 00:28:26,331
because their ego is pampered.

341
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,873
Like he went to Los Angeles

342
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,082
and all the actors and actresses had a very, very

343
00:28:32,248 --> 00:28:33,957
big conference and thought

344
00:28:34,123 --> 00:28:36,665
that by giving alms to this beggar

345
00:28:36,873 --> 00:28:40,082
their innocence will come back.

346
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,832
Can you believe such a story?

347
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,206
Any sensible people has to understand,

348
00:28:45,414 --> 00:28:49,123
that by giving alms, how can your innocence come back?

349
00:28:50,623 --> 00:28:53,498
And so this fellow was again given lot of alms.

350
00:28:53,706 --> 00:28:56,289
He's got lot of gold and he's really

351
00:28:56,498 --> 00:29:01,414
a goldy man, all the time collecting gold

352
00:29:01,623 --> 00:29:04,957
from here and gold from there and gold from you.

353
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:12,414
Such people, incarnations, who came just to

354
00:29:12,748 --> 00:29:17,706
tell us to be detached, just to develop morality.

355
00:29:18,373 --> 00:29:22,373
If you are detached about your sex life,

356
00:29:22,623 --> 00:29:27,082
if you are detached about your financial side,

357
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:30,706
if you are detached even from your country,

358
00:29:30,957 --> 00:29:33,331
then a detached personality of that kind

359
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:37,706
will become innocent and there will be no quarrel.

360
00:29:39,164 --> 00:29:43,082
But it's happening the other way around now.

361
00:29:46,748 --> 00:29:48,748
Same in the Islam.

362
00:29:48,957 --> 00:29:53,790
Whatever was taught in the Islam is taken on the other side.

363
00:29:53,998 --> 00:29:56,331
It cannot be in any way

364
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:01,082
where Mohammed Sahib was only insisting on morality.

365
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:06,248
Any kind of immoral behavior He didn't want to have.

366
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:09,123
He did say, at that time, you can marry more women

367
00:30:09,331 --> 00:30:11,164
because there were more women,

368
00:30:11,373 --> 00:30:15,164
but He never said you become prostitutes,

369
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,623
you lead a life of sin.

370
00:30:20,915 --> 00:30:23,623
That was just a Samayachar, that was only

371
00:30:23,832 --> 00:30:27,082
that time, that was the problem. He said,   “All right.”

372
00:30:27,248 --> 00:30:30,082
For example, divorce was not allowed at that time,

373
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:33,082
but in Sahaja Yoga we do allow divorce.

374
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,289
But I have seen that without divorce

375
00:30:36,498 --> 00:30:40,164
they can't live, I mean, just an impossible situation

376
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:42,998
because also women sometimes

377
00:30:43,206 --> 00:30:46,748
are extremely, extremely cruel

378
00:30:46,957 --> 00:30:50,540
and men sometimes are extremely peevish.

379
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:54,915
Under these circumstances, how can they be companions?

380
00:30:55,832 --> 00:31:00,623
More women are immoral in this matter, I should say.

381
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,248
First, it was the men who used to do immorality,

382
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,082
but now the women who are not only innocence,

383
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:09,873
but also Shakti,

384
00:31:10,331 --> 00:31:13,748
are trying to get into

385
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,540
some sort of a shamelessness.

386
00:31:18,373 --> 00:31:23,248
No care of their own innocence.

387
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,581
Their innocence is the Shakti.

388
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:30,832
If a woman is not innocent, how can she have Shakti?

389
00:31:32,623 --> 00:31:35,790
If she is leading an immoral life,

390
00:31:36,123 --> 00:31:39,498
then her Shakti will be finished.

391
00:31:39,748 --> 00:31:44,373
Only her morality is her Shri Ganesha

392
00:31:44,623 --> 00:31:49,456
which emits this purity in her.

393
00:31:53,289 --> 00:31:56,665
Now, I feel that

394
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:01,164
the way people are pumping our heads with ideas,

395
00:32:01,373 --> 00:32:03,873
especially from Hollywood,

396
00:32:04,082 --> 00:32:06,164
we accept them

397
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,040
and we forget that we are just hurting Shri Ganesha

398
00:32:11,248 --> 00:32:14,040
and He'll come back on us.

399
00:32:15,665 --> 00:32:18,581
It starts at a very low level

400
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:22,248
when we start hating our children.

401
00:32:24,414 --> 00:32:28,414
The problem starts when we don't understand our children.

402
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:33,040
I mean, in England they say that two children are killed

403
00:32:33,206 --> 00:32:37,456
every week by parents.

404
00:32:40,957 --> 00:32:45,832
This kind of attitude towards children.

405
00:32:46,373 --> 00:32:49,331
First of all, they should not produce;

406
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,289
if they have produced then they are Shri Ganeshas.

407
00:32:52,498 --> 00:32:54,248
They have to respect,

408
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:58,373
they have to love, and they have to encourage.

409
00:32:58,665 --> 00:33:00,957
But to spoil the children is also

410
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:04,373
another kind of negative force, I think.

411
00:33:04,623 --> 00:33:07,790
Some people spoil their children.

412
00:33:09,498 --> 00:33:12,623
Ganesha can never be spoiled.

413
00:33:13,748 --> 00:33:17,581
You cannot spoil Him, because He is beyond Maya.

414
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:21,748
But the way people run after their children sometimes

415
00:33:21,957 --> 00:33:23,164
is shocking.

416
00:33:23,373 --> 00:33:27,082
To them, that is the greatest achievement they have got,

417
00:33:27,248 --> 00:33:28,873
that they have a child.

418
00:33:29,082 --> 00:33:31,581
Even in a place like India

419
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,790
where it's an over population,

420
00:33:35,498 --> 00:33:37,832
to them their children are like,

421
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,082
I don't know what, so attached.

422
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:44,790
So this is a new attachment that has started

423
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:51,373
which also gives you a kind of an immoral life,

424
00:33:54,456 --> 00:33:57,414
because you are Sahaja Yogis.

425
00:33:57,998 --> 00:34:00,540
For people who are Sahaja Yogis,

426
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:03,957
all the children of the world are their own,

427
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,832
not only your own children whom you love.

428
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:12,302
All of them are Shri Ganeshas.

429
00:34:12,463 --> 00:34:15,414
Of course, if there's somebody who is not a good child

430
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:19,040
or you find it difficult, its all right,

431
00:34:19,206 --> 00:34:22,748
but otherwise all the children of this world

432
00:34:22,957 --> 00:34:25,832
are your own children

433
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,790
and you have to love them

434
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:30,498
as you would love your own children.

435
00:34:30,706 --> 00:34:33,547
Christ has said, "Love thy neighbor as thyself."

436
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:36,257
I don't know why He said it because in all

437
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:40,627
Christian nations neighbors are the biggest problem.

438
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,832
Even here.

439
00:34:46,706 --> 00:34:49,082
So I say, "Love thy child,

440
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:52,498
love other children as thy children".

441
00:34:52,706 --> 00:34:55,540
Let’s start at that point, maybe after that.

442
00:34:55,748 --> 00:34:59,414
But normally there are places where they won't allow

443
00:34:59,623 --> 00:35:02,040
you to take a flat because you have children.

444
00:35:02,206 --> 00:35:04,248
I mean, imagine.

445
00:35:04,498 --> 00:35:09,832
Only unmarried people or barren people can live there.

446
00:35:10,082 --> 00:35:13,873
And also compulsory is that you should not have any child.

447
00:35:14,082 --> 00:35:16,082
Even today you may not have child

448
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:19,023
but once you live there you should not have any child.

449
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:24,433
If you have a child then you are ousted. Can you imagine?

450
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:28,289
About only thirty years back, people had twelve children,

451
00:35:28,498 --> 00:35:32,082
fourteen children, they were competing in that

452
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:34,082
and lived very happily.

453
00:35:34,248 --> 00:35:39,414
And these days the problem has become like this,

454
00:35:39,623 --> 00:35:42,706
that you should not have many children.

455
00:35:42,915 --> 00:35:47,373
Those who started the problem are having no children at all.

456
00:35:48,289 --> 00:35:50,915
Those who said should be controlled, see,

457
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:55,414
anywhere in the west the growth is minus.

458
00:35:55,623 --> 00:35:58,206
Who is doing that? Shri Ganesh.

459
00:35:58,414 --> 00:36:02,082
You don't want children, all right.  Don't have.

460
00:36:02,623 --> 00:36:05,915
Except for Sahaja Yogis, nobody gets child.

461
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:08,998
In this place, Mohan got his child first

462
00:36:09,164 --> 00:36:12,248
so in the whole village there was a celebration.

463
00:36:12,456 --> 00:36:16,998
There has been no child born here for years together.

464
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,456
But then, again, the problem is like this.

465
00:36:21,665 --> 00:36:25,540
When I say this, I find Sahaja Yogis go to another extreme.

466
00:36:25,748 --> 00:36:30,540
They are stuck to their children; “stuck” actually is the word.

467
00:36:34,832 --> 00:36:37,748
Which is very wrong.

468
00:36:38,331 --> 00:36:41,123
I'm not saying you should neglect your child in any way,

469
00:36:41,331 --> 00:36:46,498
or you should in any way beat them or trouble them,

470
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:48,498
all these things.

471
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,915
You must love them in such a manner

472
00:36:52,456 --> 00:36:56,082
that they should know, if they do anything wrong

473
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:58,706
they'll lose your love.

474
00:36:58,915 --> 00:37:03,540
Because for children love is the most important thing.

475
00:37:07,957 --> 00:37:10,998
They should know this, what you don't like.

476
00:37:11,164 --> 00:37:14,289
You should tell them what you don't like.

477
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:18,456
And you will be amazed

478
00:37:18,665 --> 00:37:24,164
how children will not do anything

479
00:37:24,414 --> 00:37:28,748
that will make you unhappy with them.

480
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,581
Now that's a trick I think one has to learn.

481
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,873
This is the best way to grow your children.

482
00:37:36,082 --> 00:37:38,623
I'll tell you a story of My own daughter.

483
00:37:38,832 --> 00:37:43,082
She went to Delhi and all the girls were having sleeveless blouses.

484
00:37:43,456 --> 00:37:46,790
So she asked Me,

485
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:50,351
"I want to have sleeveless blouses."

486
00:37:50,512 --> 00:37:52,790
She was grown up, she was going to college.

487
00:37:52,998 --> 00:37:55,414
I said, "All right, have it, whatever you like."

488
00:37:55,623 --> 00:37:59,164
Then said, "By the way, why don't You wear sleeveless?"

489
00:37:59,373 --> 00:38:02,414
I said, "I feel shy."

490
00:38:04,123 --> 00:38:07,456
"Then why should You allow me?  This is no criteria.

491
00:38:07,665 --> 00:38:11,957
Whatever I ask, You say, ‘yes’ to me.  I'm not that grown up."

492
00:38:14,998 --> 00:38:17,498
Even My granddaughter, she was here,

493
00:38:17,706 --> 00:38:18,790
she asked Me,

494
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,873
"Nani, why do you wear always blouses with sleeves?"

495
00:38:23,082 --> 00:38:28,082
I said, "Do you know these are very important chakras,

496
00:38:28,498 --> 00:38:31,456
the most important chakras for our body.

497
00:38:31,665 --> 00:38:34,915
If you keep them open, these two or these two,

498
00:38:35,082 --> 00:38:36,873
then you will have problems."

499
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:41,164
"My goodness, I must wear now full sleeve."

500
00:38:41,414 --> 00:38:44,540
Immediately they understood.

501
00:38:44,832 --> 00:38:47,581
So something deep, if you tell them

502
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:52,623
in a deep manner which is respecting their innocence,

503
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,581
they will improve.

504
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,581
For example, a child comes spoilt child,

505
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:00,248
he does very well in the class and all that.

506
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,665
Now one way is to beat him up, shout at him,

507
00:39:03,873 --> 00:39:05,915
scold him - these are one.

508
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:08,456
Another simple thing is

509
00:39:08,665 --> 00:39:13,040
to talk to him, “See, supposing you stand first,

510
00:39:13,498 --> 00:39:18,164
supposing you get good marks, you become a great man.

511
00:39:18,373 --> 00:39:22,082
How proud I will be.  Everybody will be proud of you.

512
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:24,123
But supposing you do not,

513
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:27,040
then they will think, ‘Oh, he's a useless fellow,

514
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:29,832
he'll have to beg on the street.’”

515
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,748
Immediately, he'll change.

516
00:39:32,957 --> 00:39:37,414
The handling of the children is very important.

517
00:39:37,998 --> 00:39:40,540
Innocence is to be handled

518
00:39:40,748 --> 00:39:42,832
in a very delicate manner

519
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,331
as you would handle a beautiful flower.

520
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,040
It's a flower.

521
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:54,456
As flower has fragrance, also innocence has fragrance.

522
00:39:54,915 --> 00:39:59,998
Now this Ganesha was made out of the Mother Earth.

523
00:40:20,082 --> 00:40:23,623
He was made out of Mother Earth.

524
00:40:24,206 --> 00:40:29,082
Mother Earth is the essence of innocence.

525
00:40:30,414 --> 00:40:32,456
See this Mother Earth,

526
00:40:32,748 --> 00:40:35,665
we don't look after, we don't give Her water,

527
00:40:35,873 --> 00:40:38,498
we don't do anything for Her,

528
00:40:38,706 --> 00:40:43,998
but how She's trying to enrich our life;

529
00:40:45,123 --> 00:40:49,082
how She's trying to cool us down;

530
00:40:50,082 --> 00:40:53,706
how She works out for us things

531
00:40:53,915 --> 00:40:58,373
which normally cannot be improved.

532
00:40:59,581 --> 00:41:04,414
To respect this Mother Earth  is very important

533
00:41:04,623 --> 00:41:08,138
for all the innocent people. They do.

534
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,915
I've seen children, they respect the Mother Earth.

535
00:41:11,082 --> 00:41:15,706
They like to play on the mud, they like to play on sands,

536
00:41:15,957 --> 00:41:19,082
they want to build castles,

537
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:28,665
and all kinds of things they do with the Mother Earth.

538
00:41:29,082 --> 00:41:32,540
But they are not attached, that's one thing.

539
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,123
They are not attached.They'll build a castle.

540
00:41:35,331 --> 00:41:38,082
All right, finished, now finish this.

541
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:40,082
Then they go to the airport,

542
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:44,206
there they find something, they all join to make it a joy.

543
00:41:44,498 --> 00:41:46,665
Wherever they go

544
00:41:46,873 --> 00:41:49,331
they find it easy to make that thing

545
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:54,082
for their enjoyment. To them, enjoyment is important.

546
00:41:54,872 --> 00:41:57,623
To them, yesterday, as I said time is not important.

547
00:41:57,832 --> 00:42:00,082
How much you enjoy is important.

548
00:42:00,248 --> 00:42:04,832
Time is a headache for the grown-ups.

549
00:42:05,082 --> 00:42:07,540
Children don't worry.

550
00:42:07,748 --> 00:42:11,706
You take them somewhere in a nice place

551
00:42:12,706 --> 00:42:15,619
so they don't want to come our way.

552
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,623
You ask them, "Lets go home."

553
00:42:17,832 --> 00:42:21,957
"Why?  For what? Why should we go home?"

554
00:42:22,118 --> 00:42:24,701
They can't understand.

555
00:42:25,082 --> 00:42:30,206
They love all that is natural, all that is beautiful.

556
00:42:30,456 --> 00:42:34,498
They don't know the value in the money form.

557
00:42:34,706 --> 00:42:36,998
They know the value of something

558
00:42:37,164 --> 00:42:40,164
in the form of love.

559
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:44,082
I have seen Myself,

560
00:42:44,373 --> 00:42:48,248
you see, if you give something to children

561
00:42:48,498 --> 00:42:52,581
they'll keep it there, even Sahaja Yogis,

562
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:56,498
and they'll show you, “I've got it.”

563
00:42:56,832 --> 00:43:02,957
See the essence of Shri Ganesha is pure love.

564
00:43:06,164 --> 00:43:10,082
The pure love of this Mother Earth

565
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,832
created Shri Ganesha,

566
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,331
or Adi Shakti created out of the pure love.

567
00:43:18,623 --> 00:43:20,123
But surprisingly,

568
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:25,040
Shri Ganesha was created before the Mother Earth,

569
00:43:25,414 --> 00:43:27,248
so how it is?

570
00:43:27,456 --> 00:43:30,706
So first He was created only

571
00:43:30,915 --> 00:43:34,082
as the Logos, as they call it, or we call it

572
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:37,623
the Brahmanadha, Omkara.

573
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:42,623
First He was created only as the sound of Omkara.

574
00:43:43,206 --> 00:43:45,832
Then this Omkara

575
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:49,832
was covered with the Mother Earth

576
00:43:50,164 --> 00:43:53,414
to make Shri Ganesha.

577
00:43:53,873 --> 00:43:59,581
So, Omkar is so important

578
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:04,456
because it has got in it

579
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:10,373
all the three powers, A-U-M.

580
00:44:12,456 --> 00:44:17,498
A-U-M stands for the Mahakali,

581
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:21,915
Mahasaraswati and Mahalakshmi's powers.

582
00:44:22,706 --> 00:44:27,123
All these three powers exist in this Omkara.

583
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,873
So in a dormant form, we can say

584
00:44:31,082 --> 00:44:35,123
those three powers exist in Shri Ganesha.

585
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:40,957
So when we try to harm Him,

586
00:44:41,206 --> 00:44:45,414
then we are harming the Shakti within us,

587
00:44:45,873 --> 00:44:48,790
which is Omkar,

588
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,790
which fills the whole universe,

589
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,164
which fills all the vibrations.

590
00:44:56,498 --> 00:45:00,082
In the vibrations these powers move.

591
00:45:00,456 --> 00:45:04,456
These three powers fill up every vibration.

592
00:45:04,915 --> 00:45:07,623
That's why they know, they understand

593
00:45:07,832 --> 00:45:12,581
and they work out the whole thing in such a manner that...

594
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:15,957
Supposing now somebody has broken his legs,

595
00:45:16,123 --> 00:45:18,665
take it like that.

596
00:45:19,581 --> 00:45:23,206
Now, I sit down here and may give a bandhan.

597
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:26,665
Immediately, immediately,

598
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:33,823
a power is sent, immediately.

599
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:36,573
Somehow,

600
00:45:36,865 --> 00:45:41,156
is faster than all your communications that you use

601
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:45,114
and immediately things work out.

602
00:45:47,448 --> 00:45:52,323
How it works out? Now it's a very complicated stuff,

603
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:56,198
but it’s also very uncomplicated because

604
00:45:56,406 --> 00:45:59,531
it is the work of Shri Ganesh.

605
00:46:01,281 --> 00:46:03,573
He's not interested.

606
00:46:03,782 --> 00:46:06,323
You see, if there's any problem, all right,

607
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:10,823
like making a little fort on the seashore;

608
00:46:11,032 --> 00:46:15,239
All right, it will melt it, finished, back again.

609
00:46:15,698 --> 00:46:18,698
He's not attached.

610
00:46:20,032 --> 00:46:23,073
So what should we do

611
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:27,364
to show our gratitude to this little child?

612
00:46:29,281 --> 00:46:31,823
Supposing you say to a child, “Thank you.”

613
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:34,615
He’ll say, “Hey, what did you say?"

614
00:46:34,823 --> 00:46:37,073
Won't understand, children don't understand

615
00:46:37,234 --> 00:46:39,026
why should we thank them.

616
00:46:39,187 --> 00:46:40,854
We teach them say "thank you,"

617
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:44,175
so even if they have to say "sorry", they’ll say "thank you"

618
00:46:44,336 --> 00:46:48,364
because they know only one word, "thank you". So they say "thank you".

619
00:46:48,656 --> 00:46:50,448
Now these children,

620
00:46:50,656 --> 00:46:55,156
how will they play, in the same way this Omkara plays.

621
00:46:56,865 --> 00:47:02,615
Most detached, as they call "Nishkriya", to the power.

622
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:05,239
Means doesn't do anything.

623
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,698
Nothing, just paying attention.

624
00:47:07,907 --> 00:47:11,114
If somebody gets cured, gets saved,

625
00:47:11,364 --> 00:47:15,656
somebody gets vibrations,

626
00:47:16,323 --> 00:47:18,907
who does it?  Shri Ganesh.

627
00:47:20,198 --> 00:47:25,281
But He is not attached, He's not attached,

628
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:28,615
He doesn't want any credit for it.  It's His job.

629
00:47:28,823 --> 00:47:31,406
He will send one Ganas, all right, go to... fast .

630
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,406
They will run fast,

631
00:47:33,615 --> 00:47:37,615
more than any one of your modern - the most modern

632
00:47:37,823 --> 00:47:40,990
vehicle that you have as aeroplanes or anything.

633
00:47:41,156 --> 00:47:44,615
Immediately, I'm telling you again, the word is that.

634
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:48,364
Just as if you press the button, it works.

635
00:47:48,573 --> 00:47:51,698
But on some people it does not,

636
00:47:51,907 --> 00:47:55,406
if they are surrounded by people who have no faith,

637
00:47:55,865 --> 00:47:58,573
if they themselves have half faith or something.

638
00:47:58,782 --> 00:48:03,698
He is the judge of your faith in the Mother

639
00:48:03,907 --> 00:48:09,907
because He has absolute faith in His Mother - absolutely.

640
00:48:10,198 --> 00:48:16,531
In the same way, those who have absolute faith in His Mother,

641
00:48:18,114 --> 00:48:21,656
He looks after them.

642
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:25,032
He really looks after them.

643
00:48:25,198 --> 00:48:28,323
Also He destroys.

644
00:48:33,698 --> 00:48:37,239
Once a person told Me

645
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:40,615
about a minister in India,

646
00:48:40,823 --> 00:48:43,323
a very nasty fellow,

647
00:48:43,531 --> 00:48:47,782
very corrupt, immoral, everything put together.

648
00:48:48,483 --> 00:48:51,608
He was going on, carrying on,

649
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:55,322
but this was a nice Sahaja Yogi, very good Sahaja Yogi. He told Me

650
00:48:55,483 --> 00:48:58,370
that this man has now started troubling him

651
00:48:58,531 --> 00:49:01,228
and wants him to do something dishonest.

652
00:49:01,389 --> 00:49:06,531
I said, “Really?” I said, “Really here and there".

653
00:49:06,782 --> 00:49:11,198
This great minister had to resign and go away.

654
00:49:12,671 --> 00:49:15,295
That moment.

655
00:49:15,496 --> 00:49:19,371
Is a fact.  I can show you so many such things,

656
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:25,781
but the faith of Shri Ganesha is tremendous.

657
00:49:28,387 --> 00:49:33,179
He never doubts, and He's not attached.

658
00:49:33,382 --> 00:49:34,787
So many people sometimes,

659
00:49:34,948 --> 00:49:37,865
"Mother, you know we did this, we went there,

660
00:49:38,032 --> 00:49:41,615
we had to climb up so much, and then we gave realization

661
00:49:41,823 --> 00:49:46,406
only to one person". Finished.

662
00:49:47,236 --> 00:49:49,986
What's the use?  Don't give any realization.

663
00:49:50,147 --> 00:49:52,194
I have told hundred times to people,

664
00:49:52,355 --> 00:49:55,513
if you think you are doing any work, better not do it.

665
00:49:55,673 --> 00:49:58,548
It's no good doing such work.

666
00:49:58,798 --> 00:50:01,882
If you are attached to it, then better not do it.

667
00:50:02,048 --> 00:50:07,131
You do it for fun, just for joy, just for faith in your Mother.

668
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,882
With this absolute faith you never feel fatigued,

669
00:50:12,048 --> 00:50:15,423
you never feel tired. You see Shri Ganesha's work.

670
00:50:15,632 --> 00:50:17,632
All these bandhans, who carries?

671
00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:22,656
Shriman Ganesh Mahoday.

672
00:50:25,882 --> 00:50:30,340
He, with His big belly,

673
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:33,131
just orders His people,

674
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,590
and these Ganeshas, Ganas,

675
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:39,923
are the most competent people you can find.

676
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:45,298
You get Me any competent person, any scientist,

677
00:50:46,798 --> 00:50:49,423
no one can beat them.

678
00:50:49,757 --> 00:50:52,757
How can they cure a person?

679
00:50:53,048 --> 00:50:57,715
Say a lady had a son in Mexico who was sick

680
00:50:58,048 --> 00:51:01,798
and he had a fatal disease which was in their family

681
00:51:01,964 --> 00:51:05,882
but they always used to get it at an age

682
00:51:06,089 --> 00:51:09,632
when they were very old.

683
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,882
But he was a young boy studying in Harvard.

684
00:51:13,131 --> 00:51:15,583
She wrote to Me three letters

685
00:51:15,744 --> 00:51:18,911
and in these three letters she was wondering, “What should I do?

686
00:51:19,072 --> 00:51:22,423
Should I send him to You?” And I was, you see,

687
00:51:22,632 --> 00:51:25,465
jumping from one tree to another tree.

688
00:51:25,673 --> 00:51:28,006
I said, "Where would you meet Me?"

689
00:51:28,214 --> 00:51:30,506
I just thought of it,

690
00:51:30,715 --> 00:51:33,340
and fourth letter comes in, that she took him

691
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:36,840
to the hospital in Harvard University

692
00:51:37,006 --> 00:51:40,256
and there she took him to some other hospital,

693
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:42,513
and all the hospitals declared that

694
00:51:42,673 --> 00:51:46,214
he is absolutely all right, he's completely cured.

695
00:51:50,548 --> 00:51:55,882
But, your faith. Her faith has worked.

696
00:51:56,506 --> 00:52:00,465
It is the mother's faith has worked for the son.

697
00:52:01,465 --> 00:52:05,256
It’s very easy to doubt Me, it's very easy.

698
00:52:05,548 --> 00:52:10,006
It's a slippery ground, I tell you, very easy to doubt Me.

699
00:52:12,214 --> 00:52:15,173
Because people doubt people for what they wear.

700
00:52:15,381 --> 00:52:17,298
Now they will say,

701
00:52:17,506 --> 00:52:20,089
"Why was She wearing such an expensive sari?"

702
00:52:20,298 --> 00:52:25,964
This is a selection of Mr. Guido the great, not Mine.

703
00:52:27,882 --> 00:52:31,089
He forced Me to buy this.

704
00:52:32,757 --> 00:52:35,590
What can I do?

705
00:52:36,882 --> 00:52:43,256
But I'm not attached, but to keep his spirits all right

706
00:52:45,173 --> 00:52:48,757
I wear it, just to please them.

707
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,673
Even children, you will be surprised,

708
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:58,256
they feel very pleased if you do something that they like.

709
00:52:59,548 --> 00:53:01,964
They are very, very,

710
00:53:02,253 --> 00:53:05,742
I shouldn't say intelligent because I don't like that word very much

711
00:53:05,903 --> 00:53:09,403
but I should say, very subtly understanding things.

712
00:53:11,214 --> 00:53:15,214
One of My granddaughters, eldest one, she's a gem of a gem.

713
00:53:15,673 --> 00:53:20,715
She, I took for her a Wendy's house and she built it up.

714
00:53:21,256 --> 00:53:23,798
And My daughter is quite tall.

715
00:53:23,964 --> 00:53:26,715
She called her, “Mummy, come to my house."

716
00:53:26,882 --> 00:53:29,256
So this daughter of Mine went there

717
00:53:29,465 --> 00:53:31,506
and she entered inside the house

718
00:53:31,715 --> 00:53:34,298
and she broke the whole thing.

719
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:36,845
So it is, my granddaughter came to Me,

720
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:38,548
"See. Look at your daughter.

721
00:53:38,709 --> 00:53:41,750
You have taught her no manners of any kind."

722
00:53:42,089 --> 00:53:45,506
I said, "Why, what happened?”, "She comes into my house

723
00:53:45,715 --> 00:53:48,214
and asks such an unmannerly question,

724
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:50,208
‘What have you got for me to eat?’

725
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:53,225
Do you do that when you are going into somebody's house?

726
00:53:53,386 --> 00:53:54,845
Do you ask such a question?

727
00:53:55,006 --> 00:53:57,298
And when I said, ‘You can't ask such a question

728
00:53:57,506 --> 00:53:58,715
in somebody else’s house,’

729
00:53:58,882 --> 00:54:02,048
she laughed so much that she broke my house.

730
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:05,869
Is this the way to behave? You have never taught them.

731
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:08,214
Grandma you have taught us everything nice.

732
00:54:08,381 --> 00:54:10,585
You have never taught her how to behave

733
00:54:10,746 --> 00:54:12,715
when you go to somebody's house.”

734
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:15,506
You see?  So innocent.

735
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:18,964
So innocent the whole thing was,

736
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,465
that just to please her,

737
00:54:22,715 --> 00:54:26,798
even a small thing if you do, you can please them.

738
00:54:27,048 --> 00:54:29,089
Very simple thing.

739
00:54:29,465 --> 00:54:32,590
Now His power is Kundalini.

740
00:54:32,798 --> 00:54:35,673
Well, this is another problem.

741
00:54:36,131 --> 00:54:40,089
She is the power of Shri Ganesha

742
00:54:40,423 --> 00:54:44,632
and without Him She won't rise.

743
00:54:45,298 --> 00:54:48,798
What a complication - now tell Me.

744
00:54:50,757 --> 00:54:54,298
Like, if My child says,

745
00:54:54,548 --> 00:54:59,340
"You can't go out of this house without asking me",

746
00:55:00,423 --> 00:55:02,506
so you can't just do anything,

747
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:05,882
you are bound to the house.

748
00:55:06,506 --> 00:55:08,131
So in the same way,

749
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:12,131
without taking the permission of Shri Ganesha,

750
00:55:12,423 --> 00:55:15,173
Kundalini won't rise.

751
00:55:15,423 --> 00:55:18,465
It's very difficult,

752
00:55:20,089 --> 00:55:23,131
impossible I should say.

753
00:55:24,256 --> 00:55:27,256
Of course, the Mooladhara will go on like this,

754
00:55:27,465 --> 00:55:31,506
pumping just like a heart,

755
00:55:32,506 --> 00:55:34,422
but it won't come up

756
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:37,206
because Kundalini would like to do

757
00:55:37,415 --> 00:55:40,956
but He won't allow Her to go.

758
00:55:42,998 --> 00:55:45,331
Those who are immoral,

759
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:48,331
those who have done immoral things,

760
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,832
and those who are spoiling

761
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:55,914
the Ganesha principle of others,

762
00:55:56,123 --> 00:55:59,290
are very difficult for realization.

763
00:55:59,665 --> 00:56:02,415
But I have seen some people

764
00:56:02,623 --> 00:56:05,873
who have asked for forgiveness

765
00:56:06,415 --> 00:56:09,748
and the Mother has told Shri Ganesh to forgive,

766
00:56:09,914 --> 00:56:12,665
they have got realization.

767
00:56:12,832 --> 00:56:15,081
Only that's the point,

768
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:17,790
that if you approach through the Mother,

769
00:56:17,956 --> 00:56:19,956
He will forgive you.

770
00:56:20,164 --> 00:56:22,498
Definitely, He'll forgive you.

771
00:56:22,707 --> 00:56:25,164
There is such a nice

772
00:56:25,373 --> 00:56:29,123
relationship between the mother and child.

773
00:56:29,626 --> 00:56:32,914
That's something good, otherwise this fellow would have killed

774
00:56:33,075 --> 00:56:37,241
at least ninety percent of people in the modern times.

775
00:56:39,748 --> 00:56:45,790
So it is such a blessing, also,

776
00:56:48,081 --> 00:56:50,039
such a promise,

777
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:54,582
that if we look after our Shri Ganesh principle,

778
00:56:55,665 --> 00:56:58,039
keep ourselves clean,

779
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,415
keep our eyes clean,

780
00:57:00,665 --> 00:57:05,914
and develop pure relationships among ourselves,

781
00:57:08,956 --> 00:57:13,373
we'll have no problem of any kind.

782
00:57:13,707 --> 00:57:16,373
You'll have proper relations with your wife,

783
00:57:16,582 --> 00:57:19,331
proper relations with your children,

784
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:22,707
and proper relations in the family,

785
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:26,456
proper relations in the society,

786
00:57:26,832 --> 00:57:32,081
proper relations in the politics, economics,

787
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:37,540
and all various areas in which you move.

788
00:57:38,415 --> 00:57:41,748
Your innocence will help.

789
00:57:42,415 --> 00:57:46,456
You might think that people are trying to befool you.

790
00:57:46,998 --> 00:57:52,998
Let them try and you see what happens.

791
00:57:54,498 --> 00:57:58,790
Let them try to attack your innocence

792
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:02,582
and see what they get out of it.

793
00:58:05,498 --> 00:58:10,790
It is such a blessing you all have as human beings,

794
00:58:11,206 --> 00:58:13,623
that your Mooladhara is so well developed

795
00:58:13,832 --> 00:58:16,373
and Shri Ganesha is nicely settled down.

796
00:58:16,582 --> 00:58:18,832
You all have got your realization

797
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:21,665
and now whatever we were enjoying -

798
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:25,832
- yesterday, just like children, don't you think so?

799
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:28,323
We had forgotten our age, everything,

800
00:58:28,484 --> 00:58:31,373
we were just like children enjoying everything,

801
00:58:31,582 --> 00:58:34,415
whether the dance were rhythmic, unrhythmic

802
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:37,956
or inconsistent, we didn't mind.

803
00:58:39,707 --> 00:58:41,998
Everything we enjoyed.

804
00:58:42,248 --> 00:58:45,832
No rules, regulations are needed for enjoyment.

805
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:49,331
And this enjoyment, the source of this enjoyment,

806
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:52,748
comes from the innocence that we have within us.

807
00:58:54,081 --> 00:58:55,456
Without innocence,

808
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:59,081
you cannot enjoy anything with this mind

809
00:58:59,832 --> 00:59:03,498
and from this heart,

810
00:59:04,206 --> 00:59:09,998
because in the heart resides the father,

811
00:59:12,164 --> 00:59:15,206
Shiva.

812
00:59:15,498 --> 00:59:18,707
They are terrible people,

813
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:22,498
snakes around them.

814
00:59:23,206 --> 00:59:24,331
You...

815
00:59:26,873 --> 00:59:30,373
Not easy...

816
00:59:30,665 --> 00:59:34,914
If you can stand on your feet for fifteen years

817
00:59:35,123 --> 00:59:37,748
and go on saying,

818
00:59:37,956 --> 00:59:40,373
“Om Namaha Shivaya, Om Namaha Shivaya”,

819
00:59:40,582 --> 00:59:46,164
then maybe Shiva might grant you some boon.

820
00:59:46,707 --> 00:59:51,290
It's the most difficult deity to please, is Shiva.

821
00:59:51,832 --> 00:59:54,331
Though He is very innocent Himself,

822
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,873
He is too innocent, so much so,

823
00:59:57,081 --> 00:59:58,956
just like a white cloth you can say.

824
00:59:59,164 --> 01:00:05,081
Any bit of spot on your character, finished,

825
01:00:05,415 --> 01:00:07,832
condemned.

826
01:00:08,873 --> 01:00:13,540
But even a rakshasa stands on his leg

827
01:00:13,748 --> 01:00:16,415
for twenty-five years maybe

828
01:00:16,623 --> 01:00:20,914
and goes on praising Him, then He may forgive.

829
01:00:24,707 --> 01:00:27,248
Shri Ganesha doesn't forgive.

830
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:31,331
So the only person left to you is your Mother,

831
01:00:31,956 --> 01:00:33,998
who just forgives.

832
01:00:34,206 --> 01:00:37,623
I don't want to have any headache of this not-forgivingness.

833
01:00:37,784 --> 01:00:41,505
It's a big headache. If you don't forgive somebody, I get a headache,

834
01:00:41,665 --> 01:00:44,956
so I don't want Myself to do that.

835
01:00:45,164 --> 01:00:50,123
So I just forgive. I forgive.

836
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:55,998
I forgive all the Sahaja yogis all the time.

837
01:00:56,206 --> 01:00:59,665
There have been some horrible, nasty fellows.

838
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:03,914
I don't want to be angry with them because Ganesha will

839
01:01:04,123 --> 01:01:05,582
just finish them.

840
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:08,956
Automatically, Ganesha is doing something,

841
01:01:09,206 --> 01:01:12,331
but at least He doesn't do it so fast

842
01:01:12,707 --> 01:01:16,540
because they have called Me Mother and I respect it.

843
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:20,873
Of course, they have been very troublesome, horrible, I know.

844
01:01:21,081 --> 01:01:24,665
I know why you are angry with them,

845
01:01:26,498 --> 01:01:31,206
but forgiveness is the best punishment

846
01:01:32,623 --> 01:01:37,415
by which they realize their mistakes

847
01:01:37,998 --> 01:01:41,748
and out of hundred, ninety-nine people

848
01:01:41,914 --> 01:01:45,998
will enjoy forgiveness than punishment.

849
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:53,956
So all this is done by Shri Ganesha

850
01:01:54,956 --> 01:01:58,123
and He is all the time with you.

851
01:01:58,373 --> 01:02:01,748
Your Ganesha is awakened, no doubt.

852
01:02:01,998 --> 01:02:04,373
He is all the time with you.

853
01:02:04,623 --> 01:02:07,832
But some people have vibrations,

854
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:11,650
they get realization, then they are busy,

855
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,553
say, if they are women, busy with their children,

856
01:02:14,714 --> 01:02:18,172
they have no time for Sahaja Yoga.

857
01:02:18,956 --> 01:02:22,026
At the most, cleansing they'll do. But for what?

858
01:02:22,187 --> 01:02:24,437
Why are you cleansing?  Supposing this glass

859
01:02:24,598 --> 01:02:26,379
is cleansed, cleansed, cleansed,

860
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,665
and never used, what is the use of cleansing?

861
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:32,873
They meditate for themselves,

862
01:02:33,081 --> 01:02:35,665
they cleanse for themselves,

863
01:02:35,832 --> 01:02:38,248
but never use their vibrations,

864
01:02:38,456 --> 01:02:42,832
never give vibrations.  How can that be?

865
01:02:44,248 --> 01:02:47,415
You have to give vibrations.

866
01:02:47,623 --> 01:02:49,623
If you don't give vibrations to others,

867
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:51,832
if you don't transform other people,

868
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:53,748
if you don't cure other people,

869
01:02:53,914 --> 01:02:57,998
if you don't teach them how to have pure love,

870
01:02:58,206 --> 01:03:01,456
what's the use of cleansing, coming to Puja,

871
01:03:01,665 --> 01:03:04,540
feeling nice, joyous?  Finished.

872
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:10,707
These are useless people, useless Sahaja Yogis.

873
01:03:11,707 --> 01:03:14,623
Ganesha is not happy.

874
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:16,206
How can He be happy?

875
01:03:16,415 --> 01:03:20,665
His Puja is to give realization.

876
01:03:21,665 --> 01:03:23,748
That is His Puja.

877
01:03:23,914 --> 01:03:26,790
Supposing He is waiting there, say,

878
01:03:26,998 --> 01:03:30,248
for you to ask for His blessings.

879
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:34,790
Now what is His blessing?  Is to give realization,

880
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:37,290
to allow the Kundalini to rise.

881
01:03:37,498 --> 01:03:42,164
You ask for it and what do you get?

882
01:03:42,914 --> 01:03:47,290
You ask for your health, ask for this, ask for that.

883
01:03:47,665 --> 01:03:49,832
Why not ask,

884
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:53,873
"Shri Ganesh, make us good instruments of Sahaja Yoga.

885
01:03:54,081 --> 01:03:57,665
Give us strength to give realization to people

886
01:03:57,832 --> 01:04:00,540
and talk about Sahaja Yoga."

887
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:03,290
People don't even talk about Sahaja Yoga.

888
01:04:03,498 --> 01:04:07,290
They are feeling shy.  Why should you be shy?

889
01:04:07,698 --> 01:04:09,782
One day I was traveling by train,

890
01:04:09,948 --> 01:04:12,154
I met a lady, she sat next to Me

891
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:15,144
and she was following some sort of a cult, I don’t know,

892
01:04:15,305 --> 01:04:17,114
some Muslim cult,

893
01:04:17,275 --> 01:04:19,615
and the whole time she was boring Me.

894
01:04:19,782 --> 01:04:21,989
I started feeling sleepy

895
01:04:22,198 --> 01:04:24,615
but whenever I got up she was still talking

896
01:04:24,782 --> 01:04:26,073
about that cult.

897
01:04:26,281 --> 01:04:28,823
I said, "Sahaja Yogis will never do that."

898
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,615
You must talk about it.  You must tell people.

899
01:04:31,782 --> 01:04:33,365
You must go around.

900
01:04:33,573 --> 01:04:37,073
Don't be afraid, Ganesha will protect you.

901
01:04:37,281 --> 01:04:39,782
He'll help you, He'll be very happy.

902
01:04:40,365 --> 01:04:42,948
He'll work it out, everything for you.

903
01:04:43,156 --> 01:04:45,240
All problems can be solved.

904
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:46,948
Everything can be done.

905
01:04:47,156 --> 01:04:51,989
Believe in His power.

906
01:04:52,448 --> 01:04:54,490
Have faith in your Mother.

907
01:04:54,698 --> 01:04:57,532
That is the message of Shri Ganesha.

908
01:04:57,774 --> 01:05:00,339
May God bless you.

909
01:05:06,281 --> 01:05:10,073
Today of course I would like chidren to come up for the Puja,

910
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:16,490
say, they should be all below six years, would be better idea.

911
01:05:19,323 --> 01:05:22,073
Say, from two years to six years, we could have small ones.

912
01:05:22,657 --> 01:05:26,198
Or maybe eight years, but then they grow up I think, after that.
