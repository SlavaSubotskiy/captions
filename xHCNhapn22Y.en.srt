00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,892
1995-1225 Christmas Puja Talk, Ganapatipule, India,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,892
It is a great day when Christ came on this earth.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,892
And you know about how He was specially created

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:36,892
to come down as a human being to work out the salvation of the people.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,892
It is said that He came to India, in Kashmir,

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,892
and He met there the King Shalivahana.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:17,892
It’s all in Sanskrit; I’ve read that the conversation took place between Christ and King Shalivahana,

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,892
who was a great devotee of the Mother.

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,892
And he asked Him, “What is Your name?” In Sanskrit it’s all written.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,892
So He said, “I come from a country where people believe in filth,

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,892
and I think this is My own country.”

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,892
So Shalivahana said, “You are such a great person, who has come on this earth,

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,892
so You should go back to those countries to save them

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,892
and to tell them about the pure principle of life.”

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,892
In Sanskrit it was written Nirmala Tattwa.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:23,892
And Christ went back, and after three and a half years only He was crucified.

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,892
These were special days, I call them the days of tapasya.

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,892
Same time Buddha and Mahavira were born,

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,892
at the same level of the Virata’s forehead.

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:14,892
As you know that according to Vedas, there are seven awarenesses we can go through,

21
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,892
or the subtle qualities we have within ourselves.

22
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,892
The first one was the Bhu. Bhu is Ganesha was created.

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:40,892
Second is Bhurvah, meaning antariksha, means “all that is created around us.”

24
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,892
The third one is Swaha at Nabhi Chakra.

25
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,892
Swaha is the one where you consume everything.

26
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,892
Is in modern times, you see, people go on consuming everything.

27
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,892
All kinds of books they will read; they’ll go to all kinds of things,

28
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,892
and if you tell them, “Why do you do it?”

29
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,892
“What’s wrong?”

30
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,892
“Why do you dress up like this?”

31
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,892
“What’s wrong?”

32
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,892
This just consumption of everything goes on.

33
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,892
But then at that time also there is

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,892
another great thing within us is called as Swadha,

35
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,892
where we sustain the dharma within us. Swadha.

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,892
Dharma of everything.

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,892
See, those people who say there should be no blind faith and this and that,

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,892
it’s not blind, but it’s an inner urge.

39
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,892
Why we love our parents? Because there’s a dharma within us.

40
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,892
Why do we live, we live in our country?

41
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,892
Because there’s a dharma within us.

42
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,892
All these dharmas are there. Why a wife loves her husband?

43
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,892
Because there is dharma.

44
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,892
Why the husband loves the wife? Because there is dharma.

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,892
When this dharma is within you - we'll not call it religion

46
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,892
because it can mean something else – this one is sustained, dharaiti.

47
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,892
Once it is sustained within ourselves, it becomes Swadha.

48
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,892
That’s our capacity; that’s our quality.

49
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,892
We can call it an innate understanding.

50
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,892
Some of them are even in the animals,

51
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,892
like attachment to parents, attachment to their masters.

52
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,892
Then comes the higher awareness where your Manah - now it's not mind.

53
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,892
There’s very confusion; there’s a big confusion. Mind,

54
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,892
you see, English language is really quite confusing.

55
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,892
Manah means “by which we have emotions.”

56
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,892
Now recently I read that they are now talking about, not only of IQ

57
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,892
but EQ, means emotional coefficience.

58
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,892
That means a person who has only intelligence is not all right,

59
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,892
he must also have the balance of emotions. They are coming to it now.

60
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,892
But first they only used to praise people who have IQ.

61
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,892
That’s not the situation. So now it is different,

62
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,892
perhaps they are realizing that through intelligence how people have created chaos, violence,

63
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,892
all kinds of destruction on this earth.

64
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,892
So now they are talking about a higher capacity within us

65
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,892
called as EQ, which capacity is emotional.

66
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:28,892
This emotional capacity comes to you as an inner urge,

67
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,892
as an inner capability which you cannot avoid.

68
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,892
A person may be anything in life, but if he has no love,

69
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:54,892
if he hasn’t got any emotional feelings, then he is not complete.

70
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,892
Now these emotional things also could be very limited, no doubt.

71
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,892
There could be something that get attached to somebody, or something can happen,

72
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,892
as also the IQ, where we get attached to some idea.

73
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,892
Like Hitler had some idea, and he believed that it was the truth, and he has to do it.

74
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,892
So when you get attached to one idea like that,

75
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:37,892
you can just do things which are not at all helpful, supportive or nourishing to reality.

76
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,892
All these things have happened: wars, destruction, also,

77
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,892
as you see nowadays, the people are trying to secretly destroy others.

78
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,892
All these are coming as the anti-feeling

79
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:12,892
where the Manah has developed a domination of the intelligence,

80
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,892
where emotions are dominated by intelligence and rationality.

81
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,892
So there is another awareness within us, another capability within us,

82
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,892
another urge within us, innately built is the Janah.

83
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,892
Janah means the people, the communication.

84
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,892
You cannot live alone; you see a man who goes to jail, he’s quite happy,

85
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,892
he’s quite comfortable, he doesn’t have to do any work, everything is done for him

86
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,892
if he has a good class, he lives very well, much better than he would live outside.

87
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:12,892
But the only thing is, he cannot meet other people, he cannot communicate.

88
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,892
And when this capacity of communication which is within us - I mean,

89
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,892
which is a part and parcel of human existence - is taken away,

90
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,892
a person in the jail feels absolutely frustrated and unhappy.

91
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,892
He doesn’t mind laboring, doing all kinds of menial work,

92
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:56,892
as long as he’s not in the jail, cut out of the communications with others.

93
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,892
So this communication is also an inner urge within us.

94
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,892
In that also people sometimes go too far and neglect other dharmas.

95
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,892
They are more bothered about communication

96
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,892
than about other dharmas which are very important.

97
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,892
So there is no balance in a person.

98
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:35,892
Then comes the sixth awareness within us, which is a very interesting thing.

99
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,892
One was where we take to conditionings.

100
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,892
Say, if I am an Indian, then I am very proud of Indians;

101
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,892
I can never see anything wrong with them, or I may see everything wrong with them,

102
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,892
it can be both ways.

103
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,892
How you have been conditioned is the point,

104
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,892
and this conditioning comes to us through our sixth center of Agnya.

105
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,892
And the another thing that we develop

106
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,892
when somebody tries to condition us or to control us,

107
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,892
we try to get out of it, or sometimes we try to dominate.

108
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,892
This dominating capacity is also within us innately built.

109
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,892
Both things are innately built within us that we go on getting ourselves conditioned.

110
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,892
For example I would say that in very stupid, silly manner, people get conditioned,

111
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,892
is impossible to get them out of it.

112
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:12,892
It always comes out of self-centeredness that a person has no value for understanding.

113
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,892
Like now somebody comes to your house, he’s a vegetarian,

114
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,892
all right. Now he stays with you.

115
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,892
So, "I’m a vegetarian, you must get new utensils to cook the food

116
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,892
because I can’t have food in the utensils where the meat is cooked.”

117
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,892
All right. Then, “You must get your servant in a proper manner,

118
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:53,892
so send him to some place where you can get the well water.”

119
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,892
The servant must be absolutely drenched - this is typical Indian old style -

120
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:09,892
and should go and draw the water from the well, and “bring me it for drinking and cooking,”

121
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,892
while the servant dies of pneumonia, doesn’t matter.

122
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,892
All such stupid conditionings we have,

123
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,892
but it's not only that in the East you find all these conditionings - the West is even worse.

124
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,892
For example, they have clubbing.

125
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:39,892
Now, there are clubs where people wear particular type of clothes;

126
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,892
it’s a club. Now, if they wear something else then everybody will laugh at them.

127
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,892
Or how to use the spoon and fork is very important in the West, how they use spoon and fork.

128
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,892
Specially English have this nonsensical conditioning.

129
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,892
If somebody uses the fork and spoon in a wrong way then, finished!

130
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,892
He is nowhere; he is not sophisticated.

131
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:17,892
The ideas of sophistication and all that comes through conditioning of ages,

132
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,892
because maybe they were primitive to begin with, they had no clothes,

133
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,892
proper clothes to wear,

134
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,892
might be they were covering themselves with some leaves or something,

135
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,892
I mean, only hundreds of years back.

136
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,892
So now they have jumped to the other side, very particular about their dress,

137
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,892
very particular about fork and spoon.

138
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,892
And they just can’t bear something that is different.

139
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,892
“I don’t like that,” is very common there, “I don’t like. I don’t like.”

140
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,892
Now, they came to India, “We don’t like.”

141
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,892
“What you don’t like?”

142
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,892
“We don’t like the way Indians dress up.”

143
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,892
“All right, you dress up the way you like,

144
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,892
let Indians dress up the like they like.

145
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,892
Now why do you think that your dress in England will suit here in India,

146
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,892
which is such a hot, hot, hot country?”

147
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,892
But no, “This is how we are.” It’s quite funny the way they have,

148
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:46,892
and this conditioning goes on into such a deep manner that nobody sees the stupidity behind it.

149
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,892
For example, if the Queen has invited you, you must wear a tailcoat,

150
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,892
and now it's very expensive to have a tailcoat.

151
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,892
Now, they have to go to a particular shop to borrow it.

152
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,892
Sometimes they're loose, and sometimes they're tight.

153
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,892
I have seen people coming to these parties, Queen’s parties,

154
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,892
I could never recognize them because somebody looked like Charlie Chaplin,

155
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,892
or somebody looked like Laurel, or somebody like Hardy.

156
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,892
I couldn’t make out who are these people.

157
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,892
Then I was told, “He's that such and such ambassador.”

158
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,892
“Oh my God, I know him very well, what has happened to him?”

159
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,892
They cannot walk straight,

160
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,892
their gait changes because of the clothes which are so tight sometimes, and sometimes so loose.

161
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,892
But you have to wear.

162
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,892
All these formal ideas come to us as a kind of a part and parcel of you,

163
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,892
because you accept all these conditionings.

164
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,892
So the other side it goes to, that we abandon all this,

165
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,892
we don’t want all, we're anti-culture.

166
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,892
So I met one gentleman who was wearing a pant which had lots of holes in it.

167
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,892
Imagine in the cold of London to wear a pant like that.

168
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,892
So I said, “Why do you want to wear a pant which has holes?”

169
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,892
He said, “This is a holy pant."

170
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,892
“Holey?

171
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,892
My goodness, it will give you varicose veins, it's horrible.”

172
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,892
“What’s wrong?

173
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,892
We are anti-culture people so we are taking now to holey pants.”

174
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,892
I mean, such stupid people are not only who are uneducated,

175
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,892
but very well educated people, highly-placed people, are so conditioned,

176
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,892
and this conditioning has caused so much damage to human beings.

177
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,892
For example, to accept Freud had become just a complete religion in the West.

178
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,892
Freud became Christ at that level, though he was a Jew.

179
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,892
And he dominated the Western culture so much

180
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,892
that I just couldn’t understand the impact of this stupid man

181
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,892
who would have been thrown in the sea if he had come to India.

182
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,892
But the conditioning part is: "Everything is written is law,"

183
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,892
and they accepted this man so much

184
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,892
that the culture of the West became absolutely self-destructive throughout.

185
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,892
No respect, no morality, nothing was lofty,

186
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,892
all value systems shattered

187
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,892
because they accepted this kind of nonsense because it was written.

188
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,892
Even today I hear, “In such and such book, such is written;

189
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,892
in that book such and such thing is written.” This is terrible condition.

190
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,892
For example, it’s written in the Bible that Jews crucified Christ.

191
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,892
Nonsense! Just use your brains. How can Jews crucify Christ?

192
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,892
They were in the multitude.

193
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,892
In any country have you heard that a person can be crucified

194
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,892
with the general opinion of the people?

195
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,892
It’s the government, the Roman government did that.

196
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,892
But to put the blame on the Jews was a very good idea

197
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,892
of a very cunning man called as Mr. Paul,

198
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,892
and people accepted that because it suited them to hate the Jews.

199
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,892
Then the Jews started creating people like Freud.

200
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,892
So all such conditionings also have reactions,

201
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,892
and these conditionings then build up, and once they build up,

202
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,892
their reactions also build up and you have a country full of all kinds of chaos,

203
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,892
fear, violence and destruction.

204
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,892
The conditioning is more also with the idea of possession:

205
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,892
“This is my land.

206
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,892
This possession is mine. That is this, that.”

207
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,892
Like this it goes up to a point where people

208
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,892
who believed in the formless God also fight for the land.

209
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,892
Why should they? They believe in the formless God,

210
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,892
so why should they fight for the land?

211
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,892
But they’ll go on fighting for the land,

212
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:44,892
and this fighting for the land can go to any extent of very cruel things

213
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,892
that whole country can work out.

214
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:01,892
Conditionings are of every kind, if you see, are blinding your eyes.

215
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,892
For example they believe in Koran.

216
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,892
Simple thing is, Koran was never written by Mohammed Sahib.

217
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,892
He never knew how to read and write.

218
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,892
It’s a fact.

219
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,892
For forty years it was not written.

220
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,892
There was a fellow called Mua’wiya or something like that,

221
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,892
who killed Hazrat Ali, his sons.

222
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,892
He was the second Calipha; the first one died very early.

223
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,892
Then he killed the third one also.

224
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,892
Then he killed the fourth one, just to become himself the Calipha,

225
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,892
and the liver of this fourth Calipha was eaten

226
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,892
by the mother of this horrible fellow who hated women.

227
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,892
So he puts it down in the Koran, all the things against women,

228
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,892
and people accept it because it’s in the Koran.

229
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,892
Somebody has made fun of Koran and written what's wrong,

230
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,892
and it’s so stupidities, and all that.

231
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,892
So I asked him, "What is the use of writing this book, what is the use?"

232
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,892
He said he never thought of the use.

233
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,892
“Then why did you write? It must have some use. It’s a useless book.”

234
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,892
I said, "It is only useful that, by reading this, all the people who are not Muslims,

235
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:39,892
will laugh at Islam, and those who are Muslims will say, 'Well, this is our book,

236
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,892
whatever it says we believe in it, we are conditioned like that.'

237
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,892
So you don’t solve the problem."

238
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,892
So he said, “Then what should I do?”

239
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,892
I said, "You write another book, saying

240
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,892
This is all stupidity I've written of Koran,

241
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,892
because I know it was not written by Mohammed Sahib.'

242
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,892
Don’t write anything Mohammed Sahib, against Him.

243
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,892
He is the One who is the incarnation of Dattatreya. It’s a fact.

244
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,892
So you write that He never wrote it, so all these people have done all these things."

245
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,892
This conditioning can be removed

246
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,892
if you know what sort of life Christ led.

247
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,892
Very important.

248
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,892
First of all He was born in a manger.

249
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,892
To be born in a manger means in a poor circumstance.

250
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,892
That means He showed there’s no need to have money

251
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,892
or there’s no need to have a huge, big properties

252
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,892
or anything to be impressive on people.

253
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:03,892
Those were the days where people respected the tapasvis, the ones who were doing tapasya.

254
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,892
That was the time to do tapasya.

255
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,892
So He came on this earth and lived like a tapasvi.

256
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,892
On the contrary, the Christians are the most self-indulgent people you could think of.

257
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,892
You go to any Christian nation, you will be amazed

258
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,892
how they are just slaves of money and their watches.

259
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,892
How they are living is very shocking to see they are following Christ.

260
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,892
“Yes, we follow Christ.”

261
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,892
Then follow means what?

262
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,892
He’s there and you are standing backwards moving.

263
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,892
Is that the following?

264
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,892
If you see the Catholic Church, or even Protestants, you’ll be shocked.

265
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,892
How are they following Christ? I can’t understand, until now I never understood,

266
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,892
because Catholic is nothing but money-oriented.

267
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,892
The only thing they have picked up from Christ that He went to a wedding

268
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,892
and created wine out of water and distributed.

269
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,892
Now this wine is just the juice of the grapes.

270
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,892
It’s also called wine in the Hebrew language.

271
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,892
Thank God I have read Bible in Hebrew translated directly.

272
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,892
So it's called draksharas.

273
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,892
Because instantly, you cannot create alcohol.

274
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,892
It has to rot, rot, rot, and the more it rots, the more good it is, they say.

275
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,892
They write it down, this is twenty-five years old, so is the price is much.

276
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,892
But if it is three hundred year old the price is exorbitant.

277
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,892
So it has to rot and smell like hell, then only it’s a good alcohol. It’s a fact.

278
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,892
How could Christ create that instant, that moment, alcohol?

279
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,892
But now what I find is this, that if somebody dies

280
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,892
they will take champagne to celebrate what?

281
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,892
Good riddance of bad rubbish? Or when somebody is born they will do it.

282
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,892
But on Christmas day especially, after coming from church,

283
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,892
don’t go to any Christian’s house.

284
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,892
Even the Indian Christians have started following the Western people,

285
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,892
because Indian Christians believe that Christ was born in England.

286
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,892
All such ideas have come from where?

287
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,892
Is because the English and the Portuguese and the French brought Christianity to us.

288
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,892
Now, by any chance, are they Christians?

289
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,892
What business they had to bring Christianity to this place?

290
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,892
They took Christianity to all the places, specially Spanish.

291
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,892
Spanish, Portuguese went round the whole world

292
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,892
to spread Christianity and today is the mess

293
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,892
that you see in those people. They are nothing but drunkards.

294
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:40,892
Yesterday I was going back, and the sea was full of happiness and joy,

295
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,892
and the water had reached a very high level. It happens with Me.

296
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,892
But what I found, there were four, five Christians coming, singing carols,

297
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:59,892
and just completely drunk, and I was thinking they’ll be drowned in this water very soon.

298
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,892
This was the great boon of Christianity on human beings,

299
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,892
that you can drink as much as you like.

300
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,892
Now this drinking has come, I should say, from where? God alone knows,

301
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,892
but it has come also from the Christians.

302
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,892
And the Muslims also drink, no doubt,

303
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,892
but they hide and drink.

304
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,892
They don’t openly drink and don’t call it's a religious duty that you should drink.

305
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,892
Imagine in the church when they give communication,

306
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,892
they give you some sort of a dirty smelling wine.

307
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,892
After that, how can you have communication?

308
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,892
Once you are drunk you are finished.

309
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,892
But all these things happen.

310
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,892
So today we are talking about Christ.

311
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,892
He is sitting in a position of Agnya Chakra,

312
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,892
controlling pineal and pituitary.

313
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,892
By that He controls our conditioning.

314
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,892
If we follow Him then we cannot be conditioned by anything,

315
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,892
because He talked of Spirit only.

316
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,892
Spirit cannot be conditioned - conditioned by anything.

317
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,892
Whatever is good that will be accepted, good, congenial to the Spirit.

318
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,892
It’s a different attitude of a person who is spiritual.

319
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,892
Like we had people here,

320
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,892
I know they are not very comfortable.

321
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,892
Some of them are put into these tents here and there,

322
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:08,892
but they are enjoying because they are enjoying the spiritual atmosphere.

323
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,892
They don’t care where they sleep, where they live, what they have.

324
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,892
This is all because you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

325
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,892
But those who have not, so much worried,

326
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,892
“This is not good, I want this way, that way.” All material happiness they seek,

327
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,892
trouble everybody, criticize everybody, get angry with everybody.

328
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,892
But actually they haven’t got spiritual joy,

329
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:46,892
and they can never be really in joy unless and until they become fully spiritual.

330
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,892
Christ has openly said that “You have to know yourself.”

331
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,892
Same in Koran, Mohammed Sahib has said,

332
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,892
“Unless and until you know yourself, you will not know God.”

333
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,892
There are lots of truths in Koran, I find, left over by this Mua’wiya

334
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,892
and also in the Bible.

335
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,892
Also in the Jews, I find their Torah and all that has lots of truth,

336
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,892
but is covered by all this kind of thinking,

337
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,892
rationality and adjustments they have done for their own use.

338
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,892
Actually we have to understand that Christ never started any exclusive religion, never.

339
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,892
None of them. Specially Mohammed Sahib has talked about Abraham;

340
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,892
He’s talked about Moses; He’s talked about Christ and His Mother, much more than in the Bible,

341
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,892
respected Her.

342
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,892
And He said, “There have been more than one lakh walis (means realized souls) before.”

343
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,892
But still Muslims are some sort of a unique people

344
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,892
because they call themselves Muslims. Whether they drink, doesn’t matter;

345
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,892
whether they womanize, doesn’t matter;

346
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,892
they kill people, doesn’t matter.

347
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,892
They are running after few things which are forbidden to them,

348
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,892
but still they are Muslims.

349
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,892
Same with the Christians.

350
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:33,892
Difficult to find a man who is a real Christian, who follows Christ, before realization.

351
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,892
After realization, of course, we are different,

352
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,892
but for that you have to cross this Agnya.

353
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,892
Agnya also is there which has to control your ego.

354
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,892
Christ in His lifetime showed how ego works.

355
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,892
His own crucifixion itself shows how Christ,

356
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,892
such a great incarnation of purity, was crucified;

357
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,892
shows what people are like,

358
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,892
what they did to Him, how He was troubled

359
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,892
and tortured by these stupid people

360
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,892
and then how He was crucified by the government.

361
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,892
In the beginning there were many Sahaja Yogis, I should say, they were called as Gnostics.

362
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,892
"Gna” in Sanskrit means knowledge, who had the knowledge about self.

363
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,892
Christ has said, “Thou shalt.” He has said that “Know thyself.”

364
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,892
"You have to knock at the door,” meaning

365
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,892
you must have Shuddha Iccha, otherwise it won’t work out.

366
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,892
Nobody can force you. He controls the ego.

367
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,892
He’s the One who gives you the balance,

368
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,892
but if you go to the West you know they are nothing

369
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,892
but some sort of a stupid donkey-like ego.

370
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,892

371
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,892
The way they talk, the way they behave towards each other, it’s a big eye opener.

372
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,892
They are developed. How are they developed? God knows.

373
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,892
Oh, they are very advanced, sophisticated, this, that.

374
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,892

375
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,892
With this Agnya catching. Christ has said in His Lord’s Prayer:

376
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:51,892
“Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them who trespass against us.”

377
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,892
What a big thing to say, but one thing I have seen in the West,

378
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,892
people don’t know how to forgive.

379
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,892
They are full of hatred

380
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,892

381
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:12,892
and they cannot ask forgiveness because they are full of terrible ego.

382
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,892
Though they will feel guilty, but they will never ask for forgiveness.

383
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,892
They’ll never say that “Oh God, forgive me for what I have done. ”

384
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,892
This is so common now.

385
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,892
For example the Nazis, they killed so many people

386
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,892
and still you find these Neo-Nazis coming up, even in Italy.

387
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,892

388
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,892
They are not ashamed as to what they have done.

389
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,892
This happens because there is no really connection with Christ.

390
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,892
Firstly, if you have connection with Christ,

391
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,892
your ego has to be finished, absolutely.

392
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,892
And this ego which comes to you from various sources is a myth. Is a myth.

393
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,892

394
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,892
With this ego people try to befool others and show off.

395
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,892
Like there’s a story of Shahpesh- I don’t know if you have read about him.

396
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,892
He came to a king and told him that “I’m a great architect,

397
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,892
and I’ll build a big palace for you, ”and this and that.

398
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,892
The way he posed, the king believed him.

399
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,892
He said, “All right. Go ahead, I’ll send you so much money. ”

400
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,892
Now with this whole attitude and the way he was describing himself,

401
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,892
with his all his gestures full of such ego

402
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,892
that this king also got completely lost. He gave him lots of money.

403
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,892
And in six months' time he came back, said, “I’ve built your palace, come and have a look.”

404
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,892
So he went there, he saw it was just the same land, there was no palace, nothing.

405
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,892
So the king thought something gone wrong with him or what?

406
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,892
He was again looking and looking, and what does he find? He finds there was no palace, nothing.

407
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,892
Immediately he realized that his ego has befooled him.

408
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,892
So the king was very clever that way, he realized it.

409
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,892
So he started saying, “See this is the main road by which we’ll go, and there’s the palace.

410
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,892
Now the door opens. ”Nothing there.

411
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,892
It's all just a story. “And now here is your throne,

412
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,892
and please be seated on it.”

413
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,892
He said, “First you sit.”

414
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:53,892
He made this Shahpesh to sit on a throne which never existed. Now imagine, it was very painful.

415
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,892
He said, “You see, I want to see you sitting there, I like it.”

416
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,892
For one hour he made him sit.

417
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,892
For two hours he made him sit. Ultimately Shahpesh fell at his feet and he said,

418
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,892
“Sir, I’m sorry, there is no palace, there is no throne, nothing of the kind,”

419
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,892
but the king had lost all his money so he imprisoned him,

420
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,892
he was beaten up and did all kinds of things.

421
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,892
So this is the end of false ideas about oneself.

422
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,892
This ego can take you to such a heights of stupidity.

423
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,892

424
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,892
And the culture where it is pampered is the worst culture.

425
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,892
I’ve seen advertisements where they say,

426
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,892
"You must smoke this particular cigarette because it expresses your ego."

427
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,892

428
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:07,892
But according to Indian culture, to express your ego is absolutely something very stupid.

429
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,892
People laugh at such a person, the one who tries to show his ego.

430
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,892
In Marathi language, if somebody is trying to show off,

431
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,892
then they say he is climbing on a small, little shrub of channa.

432
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,892

433
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,892
It’s the whole system is such so nobody can develop any ego.

434
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,892
If they develop, then they are corrected.

435
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,892
Specially in Maharashtra, it’s very difficult to develop any ego.

436
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,892
As soon as you start talking big about yourself, immediately you are punctured.

437
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,892

438
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:02,892
But in the north, of course, a little bit allowed I think, and people do talk big.

439
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,892
We have great politicians who talk very big,

440
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,892
“I’m going to do this; I’m going to do that. We’re going to have this project, that project, this, that.”

441
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,892
One thing: Christ never said such a thing, never He talked.

442
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:25,892
What, if you see His sermons, is so deep and so enlightening.

443
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,892
Despite the effort of this gentleman Mister Paul,

444
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,892
you see Christ talking to people,

445
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:42,892
giving them different ways of explanation: what happens after realization,

446
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,892
how a seed is sprouted, and how it can get spoilt.

447
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,892
And very beautifully He explained to people.

448
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,892
I think it didn't have much effect at that time.

449
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:16,892
0

450
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,892
His life was so charming and so beautiful.

451
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,892

452
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,892
Like a shooting star, He came on this earth,

453
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:37,892
but He left such a remarkable impression on people.

454
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,892
His crucifixion was a part of the game

455
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,892
because He had to make the way in the Agnya Chakra,

456
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,892
to cross the Agnya Chakra He was crucified;

457
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,892
but His message is not crucifixion.

458
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,892
People wear the cross and I feel very hurt about it.

459
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,892
He crucified Himself, but that’s not the message,

460
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:12,892
that’s not you should celebrate that He crucified. There are people who celebrate it.

461
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,892
You have to celebrate His resurrection,

462
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,892
resurrection because human beings are to be resurrected.

463
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,892
In Sahaja Yoga nobody is crucified

464
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,892
and is resurrected because of one crucifixion of Christ.

465
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,892
That was enough. That was sufficient.

466
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,892
You can’t carry the cross on your shoulder; don’t have to.

467
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,892
He has carried for you, He’s done everything for you.

468
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,892
He said also that He died for all the sinners, is a fact. If

469
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,892
He had not done that, it would have been difficult to open your Agnyas,

470
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,892
because two problems, I told you, this conditioning and ego.

471
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,892

472
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,892
His crucifixion has helped

473
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:12,892
the loosening of these two horrible capacities of human being.

474
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,892

475
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:27,892
His life is to be understood in a very, very deep sense.

476
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,892

477
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,892
But if you are like a journalist, you can say,

478
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:40,892
“Why did He crucify Himself? If He was God why did He get crucified?”

479
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,892

480
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,892
Now the question is why He got crucified,

481
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,892
is how to tell these journalists who don’t know anything about chakras.

482
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:58,892
Because it was the era or the time of tapasya, of sacrifice, and so

483
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:10,892
then all these three persons - Buddha, Mahavira and Christ - went into complete renunciation.

484
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,892

485
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,892
They led a life of a great tapasvis.

486
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,892
They did it for us, not for themselves. They didn’t need it.

487
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,892
They didn’t want it; but they had do it to cleanse us,

488
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:43,892
to give us a proper Medha as they call it this Ekadesha Rudras,

489
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,892
you see, to be cleared out;

490
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,892
and they have sacrificed their lives, they have sacrificed all the pleasures of life.

491
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,892
For them it was not a sacrifice, it is just a kind of a life they wanted to have.

492
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,892
For such people there’s no question of sacrifice, but is a question of doing something

493
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,892
that would help to open the chakras of the people in the future.

494
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,892
Without them we could not have worked out Sahaja Yoga.

495
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:27,892
It was essential for these people to cleanse for us these three chakras,

496
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,892
part of the one Chakra of Christ.

497
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,892

498
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:45,892
All this they have worked out, and that's why today Sahaja Yoga is so beautifully created,

499
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,892
so beautifully spreading, is working out. We have to thank them very much.

500
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,892
Of course all other incarnations also have helped,

501
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,892
you can see, Vishuddhi, then also heart, and all these - right heart, left heart -

502
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,892
all these angels as they are called in the Bible,

503
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,892
have helped us to cross over.

504
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,892
All these incarnations are responsible in our evolutionary process

505
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,892
to create these ladders for us to move.

506
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,892

507
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:28,892
So, ultimately you reach the state of Tapah

508
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,892
on the sixth center and then in the state of truth, Satya.

509
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,892
Then the truth comes to you through Sahaja Yoga, in the brain,

510
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,892
in the limbic area when the Kundalini enters, She puts light there,

511
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,892
She creates enlightened personalities

512
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,892
and then She joins this all-pervading power of divine love,

513
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:06,892
and with this divine love you are completely changed and transformed.

514
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,892

515
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:17,892
So their contribution to the ascent of human beings has been great,

516
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,892
and that of Christ has been the greatest.

517
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,892
And when we say we have to follow Christ,

518
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,892
we should try to see how much detachment we have.

519
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,892

520
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,892
They say His brothers and sisters, or somebody came to see Him.

521
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,892
They say He had brothers. So He said, “Who are My brothers?

522
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,892
These are My brothers, these are My relations.”

523
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,892
Gyaneshwara said the same thing, that "They will become your relations

524
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,892
[Marathi, sounds like SO ERIKO, TE CHEEZ SO ERIKO TE]. They will be your relations,

525
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,892
they'll be your brothers and sisters, and not those who are not enlightened.

526
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,892
They are not your relations because they don’t understand you.

527
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:17,892
They don’t have entry into the Kingdom of God,

528
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:30,892
so they are not your relations." In His lifetime, He led a life of a person who was very simple.

529
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,892
Didn’t bother about clothes or anything.

530
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,892
All the conditioning of the worldly things were not His,

531
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,892
but He was not shameless type of a person who would accept any kind of a nudity and this and that.

532
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,892
Even about Mahavira there’s a big misconcept.

533
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:59,892
He was once praying in a garden where there were lots of bushes, we call them kunjas,

534
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,892
and in the bush His cloth, which was only one cloth He was putting on, was caught up.

535
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,892
So He cut half of it and was covering Himself.

536
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:17,892
Shri Krishna went to test Him, and He said that “I have nothing, I am just nude,

537
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,892
so why don’t you give Me your cloth? Because, after all, You are a king.”

538
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:34,892
So He took out his cloth and gave it to Shri Krishna, and got some leaves to cover Himself

539
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,892
and He was in His own garden, and went into His own palace.

540
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:46,892
Now, if you see the Jains, they make everything so horrible and insult Him all the time.

541
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:54,892
Most of the people who follow all these great incarnations really all the time insult them.

542
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,892

543
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,892
They don’t follow, they insult, and by their behavior, you see,

544
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,892
we form such a bad opinion of all these people.

545
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,892

546
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,892
I met one gentleman in Chicago. It was very cold.

547
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,892
He was the head of the Hare Rama Hare Krishna.

548
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,892
He was wearing a dhoti which was so thin, and he was shaking before Me.

549
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,892
I said, “What’s the matter?”

550
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,892
He said, “I’m feeling very cold.”

551
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,892
I said, “Why are you wearing this dhoti?”

552
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,892
He said, “My guru has told me if you wear a dhoti you will go to heaven.”

553
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,892
I said, “Really? In India eighty percent people wear nothing but dhotis,

554
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,892
are they all going to go to heaven? And many must have gone already,

555
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,892
so where will you be?” Didn’t like it.

556
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,892
Then I said, "Why you shaved your hair and put this …”we call it shindi, or in Hindi, bhodi.

557
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,892
I don’t know what you call - pig’s tail here, pig’s tail?

558
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,892
So he says, “It is because my guru told me

559
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,892
that I must shave my head and have this kind of a thing.” So I think perhaps,

560
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,892
maybe he will be tied to some rope and pulled in the heaven or something,

561
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,892

562
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:27,892
I said. Kabira has said - Kabira was one of them who has tried to slash out all your conditioning.

563
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,892
He said, “By shaving your head, if you are going to go to heaven,

564
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,892

565
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:44,892
so what about the lamb which is shaved twice a year?

566
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,892
He’ll be there earlier than you.”

567
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,892
It’s a fact, it's so, such stupid things.

568
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,892
And there are Jain sadhus who will remain absolutely nude and will pull their hair.

569
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:04,892
Now by law they are allowed to go nude on the street, you know, insulting everyone.

570
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,892
All such stupid things are happening in the name of religion -

571
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,892
that, too, of Buddha, Mahavira, and Christ.

572
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,892

573
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:23,892
They are the Ones who are trying to pull us away from rationality,

574
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,892
because you have to cross this.

575
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:36,892
All your limitations are because of this thinking, conditioning.

576
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,892
We have to go beyond because by thinking, what do we do?

577
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,892
We move in a linear way and then there’s no truth in it,

578
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,892
so the whole thing comes back, boomerangs, and you are finished.

579
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,892
We have to go beyond this mind; must understand this point is.

580
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,892
Christ has done this so that we can go beyond our mind.

581
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,892

582
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,892
If you don’t know how to go beyond mind,

583
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,892
better sit down for your meditation, work it out.

584
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,892
With this mind all kinds of things will come.

585
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:22,892
Temper will come, intrigue will come, jealousies will come,

586
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:33,892
all the six enemies that we have will come to us through this mind –

587
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,892
means thinking, rationality. Everything can be rationalized.

588
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,892
“Why did you murder your wife?”

589
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,892
"Because I hated her. She was this, she was that, she was that.”

590
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,892
But you cannot murder her.

591
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,892
“Why did you murder your husband?” “Because of this, because of that.”

592
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:01,892
Because of this mind we start doing things which are absolutely wrong, which are sinful,

593
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,892
and then we try to rationalize it.

594
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,892
Go against Agnya, go against reality,

595
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,892
and then use your conditioning, use your, we can call,

596
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:25,892
the ego to explain it, why you did it.

597
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,892
All the time when we are doing like that we can never go beyond mind.

598
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,892
We are so self-satisfied about ourselves. We think no end of ourselves.

599
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:45,892
Now, how are we to get out of it?

600
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,892
Introspection.

601
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,892
But it’s very difficult because people are afraid of themselves.

602
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,892
They don’t want to introspect, because once they start introspecting they

603
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:04,892
will know how sinful they have been, how wrong things they have been doing.

604
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,892
And then they’ll hate themselves. So they don’t want to introspect.

605
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:17,892
But it’s very important that we should introspect.

606
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:29,892
That introspection is very helpful for you to overcome these two hurdles of your Agnya Chakra.

607
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,892

608
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,892
I’ve told you many a times: don’t argue with anybody

609
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,892
because the other fellow, he is asking for argument is the one has lots of ego,

610
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,892
and that ego is acting on you.

611
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:55,892
So action/reaction starts, and we develop a habit of reacting to everything.

612
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,892
Specially in the West, I have seen they react to everything, everything.

613
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,892
For example, now, this thing is spread out here, now they have nothing to do.

614
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,892
“But they could have had better, why is it so thin?”

615
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,892
Well you pay for it now, you do it.

616
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,892
They are walking across, they meet someone. "See, see this man.

617
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,892
What sort of a person he is?”

618
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,892
If there’s a beggar, then they’ll start criticizing.

619
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,892
They'll criticize the government; they’ll criticize everyone.

620
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,892
What about yourself?

621
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,892
Instead of that why don’t you start doing something about it?

622
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,892
If you can’t help it, if you are not going to do anything about it, why react?

623
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,892
And this is the worst habit we have developed is to react,

624
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,892
and we think we have every right to react.

625
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:56,892
You have, but this right is self-destructive.

626
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,892
To react on everything is not proper.

627
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,892
You have no authority to react. It is to that extent.

628
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,892
You have to just witness, witness the whole thing.

629
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,892
Once you start witnessing,

630
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,892
you’ll be amazed that you will start seeing the play, play of the maya,

631
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,892
as they call it, and you will see where you stand with it.

632
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,892
Witnessing should be developed. All the time, witness.

633
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,892
Am I witnessing?

634
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,892
Many people say that I have very good memory

635
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,892
because I am all the time witnessing.

636
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,892
Everything is recorded within Me like a picture.

637
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,892
And then, when I have to say something, I have to correct something,

638
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,892
all that I have witnessed comes to help Me.

639
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,892

640
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,892
First of all, we should not react, react to anything.

641
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,892
Some people are attached, say, to money.

642
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,892
They’ll react, they’ll not give any money,

643
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,892
they’ll keep all the money with themselves.

644
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,892
In Sahaja Yoga also it happens.

645
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,892
I’ve seen people who are very, very miserly about money.

646
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,892
Another ones are who try to please others,

647
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,892
then they’ll waste their money on lavish things for nothing at all.

648
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,892
There’s no need to waste.

649
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,892

650
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:46,892
Reaction can come through anything. Seeing something you can react

651
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,892
and you become so engrossed with it that you don’t realize

652
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,892
that you are wasting all your brain energy on nonsensical things.

653
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:06,892
This reaction comes when you have lost complete sense of judgment.

654
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:14,892
You don’t know what you are losing, what you are gaining by this kind of reaction.

655
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:23,892
And this reaction is going to destroy your inner being completely,

656
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,892
because all the time you are here and you are there, and you’re there, and you are there,

657
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,892
and you are nowhere here.

658
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,892

659
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:39,892
If you are a very criticizing type of a person, try to stop it completely. Criticize yourself,

660
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,892
direct that energy towards yourself. "Who am I to criticize others?

661
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,892
Who am I to react to anything?

662
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:58,892
”Put a challenge to yourself, and you will see that your ego will subside.

663
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,892

664
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,892
One day somebody came and told Me that

665
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,892
“Mother I feel so angry, I feel like beating everyone.”

666
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,892
I said, “All right, do one thing. Take a chappel and hit on your head. Finished.

667
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:23,892
That’s the only way you can get rid of this habit that you want to beat others.”

668
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,892
Didn’t like it much, but I think by that he is improved.

669
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:30,892

670
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:39,892
Now, conditioning also should be seen. “Am I a conditioned person?

671
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,892
If my conditioning is there, then is it a good conditioning or a bad conditioning?

672
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,892
“At least you should have good conditioning.

673
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,892
But even that, to an extreme if you go,

674
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,892
you can create a problem for yourself and for others.

675
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,892
Most of these rituals and things started as a good conditioning.

676
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:10,892
Then it became like a trap, and they could not get out of it.

677
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,892
It’s a part and parcel of it, one has to accept.

678
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,892
Then what should we do?

679
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:27,892
We should not react. Just see the drama and you’ll be surprised,

680
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:28,892

681
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:35,892
without paying anything, without going to any theatre, every moment you can see the drama going on before you,

682
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:42,892
which is so enjoyable, whether it is absurd, whether it is ridiculous,

683
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:51,892
whether it is a sort of a - as you see in the films, you see, beating somebody and all that,

684
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:58,892
you just see it and you do not react.

685
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:06,892
Anything that you think is very perverse, ugly, immoral - don’t see, finished, gone.

686
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,892

687
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,892
So don’t tax your mind, because in the mind that we call it, so-called mind,

688
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:26,892
it's actually the Agnya Chakra in the center of your optic chiasma.

689
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,892
Just imagine. What a central place it has!

690
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,892
And any disturbance to your Agnya, what it can do to your brain

691
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,892
which is nothing but a lump of fat.

692
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,892

693
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,892
So how this Agnya can affect you,

694
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:54,892
and how it works and creates perverted images, that is to be really seen.

695
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:03,892
Conditionings, also you have seen, people are mentally so upset and so degenerated.

696
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,892

697
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:12,892
But the pure nature of Christ is innocence, you know that. He's Shri Ganesha.

698
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,892
Shri Ganesha is an eternal Child.

699
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,892
Christ is also complete innocence because He doesn’t react,

700
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,892

701
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,892
because He is not conditioned.

702
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,892
Children are not conditioned so much as we are.

703
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,892

704
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,892
If you talk to children, if you speak to them,

705
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:47,892
you’ll be amazed how innocent they are and how innocently they talk.

706
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:55,892
Once My granddaughter asked Me, “What do You think of the poor children of the tiger?”

707
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,892
I said, “Why?”

708
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:06,892
“You know their father tells them that ‘You eat human beings,’ and what can they do?

709
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,892
They have to eat human beings after all.” You see, so innocent.

710
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,892
So I told her that they are under a complete control of God.

711
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,892
Whatever they are doing, they are not going to be held responsible.

712
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,892
It’s only for human beings

713
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:33,892

714
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,892
that God has given this freedom.

715
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:44,892
It’s only human beings who can react in this manner.

716
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,892
So for animals it is, they are pashus,

717
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:54,892
means they are completely under the control of the God Almighty.

718
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,892
So they are swabhavas, everything, a serpent will be a serpent,

719
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,892
and a tiger will be a tiger, and they will say a lion will be a lion.

720
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,892
But human being can be a serpent, at the same time could be a scorpion,

721
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,892
could be a lion, could be anything,

722
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:20,892
you know suddenly you find a small little bug-like man coming up like a lion roaring at you,

723
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,892
and you say, “From where does this come, this cannon?”

724
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,892
It is so. You don’t know which way they will come,

725
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,892
and which way the camel will sit. You can’t say.

726
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:43,892
So this reaction of human beings comes

727
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,892
because he is not in connection with the Divine.

728
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,892
When he is in the connection with the Divine,

729
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,892
he sees the drama, and he leaves everything to Divine.

730
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,892
He can solve all his problem by just one bandhan.

731
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,892

732
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:12,892
He can solve all the problems just by a bandhan.

733
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:18,892
But he should be in full connection with the Divine.

734
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:26,892
It works, it works. It does work. This is not the time when Christ came on this earth.

735
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:37,892
This is the time where this Paramchaitanya has gone into action – activated,

736
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,892
is working out everything.

737
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:46,892
Now they asked Me about this Shri Ganesha, whether Shri Ganesha drank milk or not.

738
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,892
I said, “Anything possible.”

739
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,892
These days this Paramachaitanya is doing such things, unbelievable things,

740
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,892
which we cannot understand, everything is a chamatkar. So it’s possible.

741
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:01,892

742
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,892
Ganeshas, I’ve never heard of Ganesha liking milk so much,

743
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,892
but maybe for the little rat He might be taking. Can’t say.

744
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,892
“But why did Shiva drink?”

745
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,892
I said, “Let it be, let Shiva wants to drink, let Him have milk.”

746
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,892
Actually we have too much milk production,

747
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,892
so They must be wanting to consume some.

748
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,892
But it’s just a way at looking at things that, you see,

749
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,892
when everything is done by this Paramchaitanya.

750
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,892
They are doing such wonderful things,

751
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,892
I mean, I never asked Them to do anything.

752
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,892
But now, for example, in Brisbane when I was there,

753
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:47,892
I was sleeping in the ashram, and a rainbow appeared.

754
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,892
Of course I like paintings very much, of Raphael specially,

755
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,892
because he has drawn the Mother’s face,

756
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,892
and the Child’s face so exactly,

757
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,892
expressing the feeling of mother and the child.

758
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,892
And imagine, that picture appears in the sky,

759
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,892
and I didn’t tell them to show that Raphael.

760
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,892
When I was sleeping I was not even going to look at it.

761
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:21,892
But at this time, the halo that was on the back side of Mary comes upon the head.

762
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,892
Means Raphael himself did it, or, I don’t know. How can I explain?

763
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,892
This Paramchaitanya is doing all kinds of things,

764
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,892
and it does all this just to convince you about Sahaja Yoga.

765
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,892

766
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,892
Because even now there are many who are supposed to be very rational, intelligent,

767
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:50,892
educated, who don’t want to accept.

768
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,892
After all, if there is a divine power, if there is something like  that and is active,

769
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,892
how can you challenge it?

770
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,892
How can you say no to it?

771
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,892

772
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:13,892
Because the powers are unlimited, it has gone into every atom and every molecule.

773
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,892

774
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,892
It doesn’t do tricks, like moving this from there to there,

775
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:29,892
but what it does is to do something which is absolutely impossible.

776
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,892
It is doing.

777
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:33,892

778
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:43,892
So for us to believe in this activated Paramchaitanya

779
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,892
is the only solution.

780
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,892
So you leave it in the ocean of bliss,

781
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,892
and let this great power handle all these situations.

782
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,892
Don’t react yourself.

783
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,892
Which is so efficient, so quick, so fast, moves all over, understands everything,

784
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,892
and it loves you and respects you because you are Sahaja Yogis.

785
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,892

786
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:18,892
This is what it is today: we should know at the time when we are celebrating Christmas

787
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:27,892
that what we are celebrating is really our own ascent, our own achievements,

788
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:35,892
our own lofty heights which we have achieved and which we have to achieve.

789
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,892
We should have only aspirations as far as our spiritual side is concerned.

790
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,892
All aspirations should be left to this Paramchaitanya,

791
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,892
“You look after that.”

792
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,892
And the more you become,

793
01:11:50,000 --> 01:12:01,892
the more you develop this non-reacting attitude through your proper Agnya.

794
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:09,892
Not anger, not silence, but a very pleasant temperament.

795
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,892
That means people think that I have told you not to speak. No, no, you must speak.

796
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,892
You must talk to people, you must laugh, you must enjoy;

797
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,892
but all this should be full of joyous feelings.

798
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:33,892
That’s what they say that Christmas is for a very joyous atmosphere.

799
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,892
So they can’t do that way so they drink. I mean, after all,

800
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,892
you must give them benefit of doubt also that why do they drink?

801
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,892
They think by drinking they will become joyous.

802
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,892

803
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,892
Now our understanding about ourselves has to be very clear-cut.

804
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,892
Specially, people don’t meditate.

805
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,892
They just don’t meditate. They don’t want to grow.

806
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,892
They are Sahaja Yogis but they don’t meditate. It’s very surprising,

807
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,892
I can make out who meditates, who does not, because there is no depth.

808
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:21,892
They want to have this, they want to have that, is all right, but what about meditation?

809
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:28,892
If you don’t meditate, your Agnya will be completely covered with thoughts,

810
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:34,892
and you’ll be lost. So you have to meditate.

811
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,892
If you don’t meditate, I also suffer.

812
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,892
If you have no aspirations in Sahaja Yoga it's better to leave,

813
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,892
because you are like seeds which are sprouted and which will be wasted.

814
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:57,892
Some people are here because they want some sort of a platform, some publicity.

815
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,892
Some are here who want money, to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

816
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,892
There are some who want to have a kind of a communication,

817
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,892
to go round the whole world without paying a single pai.

818
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:19,892
All such people are of no use to themselves.

819
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:26,892
Now here you have the complete wealth.

820
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:27,892

821
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:36,892
All that celestial wealth is before you, and you are not going to accept it,

822
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,892
you are not going to drown into it. What should we say?

823
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,892
It’s not very sensible to do.

824
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,892
As I said, you don’t have to crucify yourself, you don’t have to give up anything,

825
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,892
you don’t have to live like Christ had to live or be born in the manger.

826
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,892
All that’s done for you already. Now come along.

827
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:09,892
But if you are coming in the darbar of the Divine, then be worth it.

828
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,892
You should be worth it.

829
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,892
And you’ll be surprised, all your problems will be solved.

830
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:22,892
Your self-respect will be maintained. So many things have happened like that,

831
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,892
but if you have no self-respect, you don’t respect your Realization,

832
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:34,892
you are not deeply involved as to your own ascent and the help to others,

833
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,892
it will not work out.

834
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,892
I’m here to tell you all these things which Christ could not tell.

835
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:46,892
I had to fulfil what  He wanted to say.

836
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,892
All those things I am saying to you. It has already worked,

837
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,892
you all have got Realization,

838
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,892
but develop respect for yourself as Sahaja yogis.

839
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,892
Don’t have funny ideas about yourself.

840
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,892
Just know you are a Sahaja yogi and a Sahaja yogini.

841
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:14,892
That’s what is needed for a person if he is today celebrating the birth of Christ.

842
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:24,892
He came on this Earth who was actually Christ, full of innocence,

843
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:34,892
who was the One who came as the embodiment of Shri Ganesha.

844
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:41,892
I have given the proof of it to you, how the carbon atom looks like,

845
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,892
and by which I have proved that Christ is the Alpha and Omega,

846
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,892
while He is made out of Omkara and Swastika.

847
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,892
All this we have experimented. We have found it. It’s there.

848
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:06,892
With all this, what is the greatest achievement is to respect your innocence.

849
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,892
Respect your innocence.

850
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,892
This is what is to be asked for today: be innocent,

851
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,892
and God looks after all the innocent people.

852
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,892
Don’t worry, don’t have to worry. I’ve seen children falling for seven storeys,

853
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,892
nothing happens to them.

854
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,892
They are perfectly all right. How? Who looks after them? Angels.

855
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,892
You have seen photographs of angels around you.

856
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:42,892
So try to be simple, innocent, not reactive,

857
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:51,892
and keep quiet and peaceful because here we are talking about the global transformation

858
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,892
where people will find their peace in their heart

859
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:04,892
and will establish a new world of peace, joy and spirituality.

860
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,892
May God bless you all!
