1
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,380
yes

2
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:37,329
What did he say mother could you please

3
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:39,370
say something about the collective and

4
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:43,089
the need for real-life selves to be

5
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:45,580
together but alright that's a very nice

6
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:51,309
addition I would like to say something

7
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:54,489
about connecting so far as you know in

8
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:58,839
the history of spirituality people have

9
00:00:54,489 --> 00:01:05,920
gotten realization many people one after

10
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:08,800
another many people got it but I will

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:14,610
say one in a million one in a ten

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:18,520
million like because we have to have

13
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:21,250
some of the food to talk about beginning

14
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,940
we are missing what was written in the

15
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:27,789
past but they those people who got

16
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:31,119
realization single-handed suffered a lot

17
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:35,500
and they could not transmit what it was

18
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:40,900
needed to be given to others in a way

19
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:44,920
that would be accepted now as you see

20
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:48,430
any discovery is made like that people

21
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:51,520
can benefit individually every person

22
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,960
can say oh I have parted so I can have

23
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,460
it

24
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:59,400
ha but it is of a movin it is of Norman

25
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,670
I can take it I will say a personality

26
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,220
like Christ we once we had Christianity

27
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,350
what have they done about it I mean it's

28
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,840
a Saturday I mean to think such a

29
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,850
personality too common what a great job

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,569
he has done to establish himself for our

31
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,140
detriment

32
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:20,220
what people have done the reason was he

33
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:22,140
wasn't he was alone it was not a mass

34
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,520
thing that was not the time because he

35
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,769
had to establish this Center without

36
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,650
that it could not be mass all right

37
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:30,870
it could not be a Hamas realization but

38
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,850
he talked about you have to be born

39
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,510
again and all that but the whole thing

40
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:39,290
fizzled out because they could not get

41
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,660
to the essence of it one person of that

42
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:48,560
value coming on this earth found it

43
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:51,870
impossible to convince people in fact so

44
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:56,579
one has to understand that any anything

45
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:59,160
that is if evolutionary first-first

46
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:03,480
happens to one or two persons only but

47
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,760
then it happens to many me now in sahaja

48
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,739
yoga this another problem apart from

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,810
that that it is happening to many people

50
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,000
is them no doubt thousands are getting

51
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,000
realization is no doubt is working out

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,680
that you know that now the evolution has

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,900
come to the stage as I say it's the

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,799
Blossom time many flowers are there and

55
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,930
they have to become fruits but now why

56
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,130
necessary to have connectivity when

57
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,780
people are between or as a shield

58
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:34,570
that is a very important point one has

59
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:36,670
to understand the thing is that now when

60
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:39,400
you are getting realized what is

61
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:42,670
happening to you you are getting related

62
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,150
to the whole a my proposal is getting

63
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:50,200
related to the mattress say your body is

64
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:52,450
there and you are sleeping first you get

65
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,230
a little a vaguely you open your fingers

66
00:03:52,450 --> 00:04:00,730
alright then you open your another thing

67
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:02,950
now there is a little trouble on your

68
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,960
finger and you can't see anything so you

69
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:08,020
open your eyes and you pay your

70
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,300
attention to your hands so that trouble

71
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,640
may be all right but you need another

72
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,310
hand to help so you want the another

73
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,549
hand also to be awakened to that point

74
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:21,580
like that so when the search opens are

75
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:23,770
getting awakened more and more see the

76
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:26,440
problems that are facing us we can sort

77
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,690
them better because so many people are

78
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,630
working out the problem you understand

79
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:34,270
my point now together when we are

80
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:42,630
together we understand now this problem

81
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:42,630
I moved to America I had one in 1970

82
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:51,520
1973 for starting yes 1973 Allegra's I

83
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:53,830
was alone I mean I gave very good

84
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,280
lectures we had very big halls filled up

85
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:59,380
and everything is enough the reason is

86
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,900
the people who got realization didn't

87
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,060
have anybody to look after them there

88
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:07,480
was nobody to support them give them

89
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,920
assistance so they got lost I mean they

90
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,590
are there some of them are here and

91
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,040
there now now what has happened now

92
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:17,770
today when I am going to America

93
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:20,140
everybody is playing in Australia

94
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:23,080
they're playing in India they're playing

95
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:25,050
like the tension and we surprised some

96
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,970
people are coming from India to go down

97
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,310
Dominika some are coming from Australia

98
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,409
to go down to America some are coming

99
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,509
from France some from Switzerland they

100
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:37,319
are all rushing to America now the job

101
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:39,690
is in America all right so like the

102
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,849
attention see as soon as somebody pricks

103
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,970
me of my hand goes there my articles

104
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:48,479
that everything works so the collective

105
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:51,060
working out effort is going to solve the

106
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,770
problem but supposing if this finger is

107
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,460
fighting with this finger can I write

108
00:05:52,770 --> 00:06:00,030
anything or if they are secluded and

109
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:05,460
alone then I can I use them all this

110
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:08,009
body has to become absolutely in Concord

111
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,889
with each other but so many are still

112
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:15,629
sleeping those who are awakened at least

113
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:18,599
must stick to it otherwise sahaja yoga

114
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:21,360
cannot go today I find it much easier to

115
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:23,219
give realization much as I was

116
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,490
struggling with six people for four

117
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:29,969
years in your London four years

118
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:32,370
seek speed but once they got realization

119
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:35,550
it started working fast and the more

120
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,529
people we get because the channel that

121
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,289
is to be used

122
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:42,539
it's like nerves in the body you become

123
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:45,719
a nerve of that body which is awakened

124
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:48,330
and once the nerves start working out

125
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:50,190
together realizing that there's one

126
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,310
force that is flowing through them all

127
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:58,319
of you have to work it out together with

128
00:06:53,310 --> 00:07:01,139
understanding of the divine it works

129
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,419
first any person who's all nerves are at

130
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:05,759
work will be much more dynamic than a

131
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:10,800
person who is half dead or is full

132
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:13,409
length so you can understand how

133
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:18,270
collectivities important then another

134
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:21,930
thing is that going to a very enjoyable

135
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:24,979
part that when the colour sahaja Yogi's

136
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:28,170
are collectively there they really know

137
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:32,290
because for the first time I'm starting

138
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:34,240
first before this you never enjoyed you

139
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:37,030
enjoy flowers enjoyed everything else

140
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,340
but not you wanted pure enjoyment of

141
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,950
human being starts coming when you

142
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,890
become truly realized I'll give you an

143
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:51,160
example we went to Calcutta one day and

144
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:53,320
I was in a room in a in one hotel and

145
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,380
there were three for sahaja Yogi's in

146
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:59,140
another hotel another one and one

147
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,570
gentleman came to me for his daily

148
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,670
language and whenever I raised him

149
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:09,250
Kundalini you see they've all got

150
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:10,870
vibrated and they all rushed to my to

151
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,780
know what has happened suddenly how is

152
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:15,640
it we got some joy within ourselves they

153
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,980
came to see and this man was there it

154
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:21,490
was a great room but they felt the

155
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:23,530
vibration is tremendous so it is not the

156
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,050
happening of an individual which is the

157
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,520
happening of the world and the

158
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,170
individual effort is going to be

159
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,320
absolutely useless it will be all

160
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:34,780
neutralized if you sit at home do your

161
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,770
meditation it won't work you won't have

162
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:43,110
any fun because the whole has to come I

163
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:48,250
give an example that when you churn the

164
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:50,770
butter in India I don't know you don't

165
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:54,820
do that way we do it very naturally you

166
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:58,150
put a little butter inside that and then

167
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:00,610
again you structure so the butter starts

168
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:03,040
gathering around that butter all of it

169
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:05,590
comes together but some particles have

170
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,900
left they stick to the sides stick to

171
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:11,590
that there are no more as butter they

172
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:14,800
are thrown away as but it is as simple

173
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:18,490
as that you see the more you gather

174
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,470
together really enjoy the spirit of

175
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:27,730
friendship

176
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:31,270
spirit of mirth spirit of love and pure

177
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:34,750
form so far the loves buyers they say

178
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:37,540
it's last there's money there space

179
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,910
that's the relationship this is you a

180
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,070
British so I must love you I'm Indian so

181
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,440
I must love you all these nonsensical

182
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,420
barriers are there you love a human

183
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:51,339
being because he's a human being and

184
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:54,790
he's a yogi speaks the same now today I

185
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:56,709
have attended a wedding party and the

186
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,450
bride and the bridegroom said we are

188
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:03,730
are hundred people coming to Madison

189
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:05,589

190
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,240

00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,520
enjoy a line just to get our humans even

193
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,089
if I tell you don't come they won't

194
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,430
listen

195
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:17,410
they will enjoy their honeymoon there I

196
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,209
never said you come on the contrary I've

197
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,920
seen you go where you might be to enjoy

198
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:23,140
your honeymoon where every left they

199
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,000
won't know because they know we're in

200
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:29,050
German hands with their brothers is

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,459
famous ancestors it's absolutely so I

202
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:37,149
think that the enjoyment of human beings

203
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:39,760
has not been there now there are people

204
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:43,209
who live in India who live in Australia

205
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,680
who live here all over the places but

206
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:47,260
when the sahaja Yogi's go to you I

207
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:51,459
should see them in the way they are

208
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:53,800
sahaja Yogi's in the villages way to

209
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:56,170
impress them way to feel the oneness

210
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,490
never there felt like this for a white

211
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,560
scheming they saw might scream they

212
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,290
would just run away and hide themselves

213
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,970
under this thing I see and even now

214
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,740
people are sometimes writing to see a

215
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,300
white skin in a village they say Oh God

216
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,089
they have come just to destroy something

217
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,459
but now that's all one now it's a human

218
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:15,370
a human being is coming that all of this

219
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:18,120
for there is nothing like a black or a

220
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:22,529
white or anything left now it's such an

221
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:25,990
such a love that promise and understand

222
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:28,270
that's only possible if you learn how to

223
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:32,290
live collectively and collectivities

224
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:35,740
also teaches you where you are very

225
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:38,590
important a person was not live collect

226
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,390
cannot understand and seen people for

227
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:43,840
their own families even their families

228
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:48,220
their surgeries but once they come to

229
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:51,120
the ashram they know what yet because of

230
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:55,570
their chests you have to learn to adjust

231
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,670
you can't have private bathroom to

232
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,800
yourself and private room to yourself

233
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:01,750
alright you can have if you want to have

234
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,940
but you should also know how to exist as

235
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:07,270
you know I live very comfortably myself

236
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:09,520
but if it comes to live anywhere I have

237
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:12,520
no problem of comfort already in the

238
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,800
same way we are not barred from a job

239
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,170
because of all these things away we can

240
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,630
your bathrooms with us we do not enjoy

241
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,940
life so you want to have everything

242
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,400
absolutely first class that has lead

243
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,620
said that even when we go to the picnic

244
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,840
we take on the Metropolitan with us in

245
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,300
the same way we cannot enjoy life you

246
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:34,840
cannot enjoy nature we can enjoy

247
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:37,870
anything as long as we become a just an

248
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:41,380
individual oh I am the one who is well

249
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:43,930
to it the last of all we must know by

250
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,970
individualism will become malignant I

251
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,940
don't say become communist because

252
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,950
that's another monuments but by becoming

253
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,770
individuals will be combining them what

254
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,090
is malignancy that an individual self

255
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,850
takes up upon itself

256
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:59,770
I will grow I will put it doesn't know

257
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,720
how to grow with the whole it has no

258
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:06,190
coordination with the whole that's why

259
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:08,740
you say it is a cancer cancer is nothing

260
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:11,440
but is a malignant cell which is alone

261
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:16,240
and he's saying that I have to achieve I

262
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:19,810
can unit I can manage it and once it

263
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:23,350
starts going like that whosoever touches

264
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:25,960
that person becomes all these ideas we

265
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:28,710
are higher race or we have greater

266
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,100
people we are moneyed people we are

267
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,649
something

268
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:37,480
special we are of this club all these

269
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:40,089
disappears it's all nonsensical they are

270
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,130
identified with nonsensical things I am

271
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:46,300
making ourselves miserable another salsa

272
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:49,240
mr. eyed well you give up on that

273
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:52,000
suddenly you find Oh what did you you

274
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,720
don't want in it we just want to be in

275
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,240
the company of sahaja Yogi's I have seen

276
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,740
people ambassadors very highly placed

277
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:05,259
people just getting me lost when they

278
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:08,139
search the other day I had a businessman

279
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:15,399
from Bombay I took him down with me to a

280
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:17,589
place called hooray and it was all in a

281
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:20,860
message that says there were no proper

282
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:23,800
bathrooms aware it was just like he got

283
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,899
for second act expected and there

284
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,440
weren't even places to sit down properly

285
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:31,720
only the beach and the palm trees and

286
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,380
all sorts of thing was there and the man

287
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,720
but mustard absolutely lost and he said

288
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:40,000
I never wanted this day to finish still

289
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:44,189
only they are really enjoyed myself

290
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:49,449
though because there was such content

291
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:55,209
such spontaneous love such attention and

292
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:58,899
such purity in that to enjoy that purity

293
00:14:55,209 --> 00:15:00,819
you have to be in collective sitting

294
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:03,069
down in the room you can't understand

295
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:05,610
there is no reflection of you can't

296
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:08,649
understand where are you how far your

297
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:10,959
collectivity is the most important thing

298
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:15,339
and those who try to break the

299
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:18,759
collectivity arguing anti sahaja we call

300
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:23,509
it a sahaja movement

301
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:25,429
sahaja activity you have to be one with

302
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:28,399
the hope those who have tried to

303
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:32,269
separate themselves all of them go down

304
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:37,909
in sahaja yoga try to be one with

305
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:41,929
everyone to share and enjoy everybody

306
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:45,619
speak because God has created you so you

307
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:47,749
are salute and the enjoyment should not

308
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:50,419
be lost because you have certain

309
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:52,429
barriers like some people can't take out

310
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:55,579
their shoes I mean just imagine how will

311
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:57,679
they are identified with issues they can

312
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,569
take out their shoes to that extent

313
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,669
they're stupid

314
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:04,599
see all this kind of stupidity drops out

315
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:07,249
once you meet really wise people around

316
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:11,599
to get rid of all these nonsensical

317
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:16,039
ideas which are really haunted your head

318
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:18,739
all these days get rid of them and you

319
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:22,339
really enjoy everyone

320
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:25,519
whether he is a doorman or he is the

321
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:28,819
chairman all of them are mental it's

322
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:31,479
nothing more than all that drops up and

323
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:34,699
you start enjoying yourself

324
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:36,820
that's why collectivity is the only way

325
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:40,210
I can work out

326
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:44,770
I can't think I can work out through the

327
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:49,480
people who are separated divided it is

328
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:51,930
said Christ has said also that they said

329
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,000
what you know what having to do he said

330
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:57,730
if when you love each other you have

331
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,280
done that it is just students true and

332
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:02,470
when I hear the loving conversation of

333
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,300
the sahaja Yogi's I feel the happiness

334
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,850
that's the greatest happiness for me

335
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:10,480
that all of you should love each other

336
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:12,550
in spirit without any return only for

337
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,610
love's sake you're or should love each

338
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:18,220
other and that is what it is and also

339
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:20,200
Krishna has said wherever people are

340
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:24,850
there together together in the name of

341
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:27,160
God I decided so in the knee joint so

342
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:30,310
called because you are all one moving

343
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,560
with one rhythm with one understanding

344
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:35,800
with one language so you all should

345
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,870
always meet all each other and have

346
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:43,030
record with each other it's so beautiful

347
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:46,350
it's music it's political we understand

348
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,350
that may God bless

349
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:57,070
I'd see for yourself when you got out to

350
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:59,170
a collectivity just abusing yourself at

351
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,760
that point that this is one thing we are

352
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:05,020
trying to teach me now I'm not going to

353
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:07,500
listen to this nonsense we are going to

354
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:10,120
be in otherwise also I mean we cannot

355
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,340
people cannot take even drinks without

356
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,280
somebody in there you can't take your

357
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,980
food alone there's so many things I mean

358
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:22,630
if you are not absolutely recluse you

359
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:26,730
can't live alone then in religion in in

360
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:33,120
the city especially in the realm of all

361
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:33,120
how can I be you all have to be there

362
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:44,450
I think it was a very good question

363
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:49,400
right chaos this individualism must be

364
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:51,320
given that doesn't mean you dress up

365
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:55,520
like a military people

366
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:57,440
that's not fascism or you should all

367
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,570
behave in the same manner that's not

368
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,600
necessary what I feel it's all the

369
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:06,560
beauty but does that mean that if I say

370
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:18,460
it is it is East you should say it is

371
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:22,780
West that's the main number case is it

372
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:25,550
that you can't dive into each other

373
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:34,120
what's the problem in connectivity

374
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:34,120
I can ask

375
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:51,480
must get out of individual limitations I

376
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:05,530
think everybody for some time more and

377
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:07,060
given a national survival but Ashna must

378
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,590
be such when there is collective dues

379
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:15,220
now I show me there fighting and

380
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:17,620
following this reversal yourself being

381
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:20,410
in the National ones but I leave it to

382
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:23,380
you it's all freedom you just decide

383
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:26,440
yourself I have not any rules and

384
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:30,250
regulations on how much because I've got

385
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:32,950
you to use your wisdom and put

386
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:39,040
everything right or self you are all

387
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:42,520
very wise people but first have them God

388
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,470
listen to others talk to them find out

389
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,690
what's the problem is on small small

390
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:49,510
things people find it's a very long

391
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:52,540
moreover you have to have one person as

392
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:54,490
a leader to whom you should listen to if

393
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,440
I find that fellow is useless I'll throw

394
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:58,540
him on it you know that throw him away

395
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,280
not in the way people throw me but he

396
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:03,070
just get out of sahaja line you know not

397
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:06,000
so there should be no problem but

398
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:10,360
everybody should not try to dominate

399
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:15,090
each other that's a valid try to change

400
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:19,270
your head as I would say how far can you

401
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:22,810
just how far can you accommodate

402
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:26,130
let's see that we have to learn that for

403
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,130
me isn't it

404
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:32,230
you must find out ways and methods of

405
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:35,050
accommodating yourself and others just

406
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:38,050
try to learn it's not difficult that's

407
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:39,440
the whole attitude of life is of

408
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,450
competition

409
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,940
this another should be changed you must

410
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:47,330
compete in level conflict in doing good

411
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:49,610
things confident working for others like

412
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:53,480
I won the know now I love take the fall

413
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:55,600
is very comfortable and watch the TV

414
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,800
this morning and I will not wash you

415
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,270
[Music]

416
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,640
then people start taking advantage

417
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:04,790
essence let them take advantage

418
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:10,520
disadvantage wonder actually if you see

419
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:14,360
the other side competent service

420
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:18,920
competing love confident good things of

421
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:21,830
saying good words of communicating in a

422
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:28,520
sweet away that others feel happy making

423
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:32,240
others happy try to change your attitude

424
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:34,100
towards others and you really enjoy I

425
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,440
tell you you'll enjoy that's the way you

426
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,810
know if you say something to hurt

427
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,760
someone and upset someone it must be

428
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,740
upsetting you definitely you may not

429
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,720
sure but it must be because whatever you

430
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,680
do to others comes back to you straight

431
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,990
forward march

432
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:56,750
I take it doesn't stay there altogether

433
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:58,970
it comes back so just try to be kind you

434
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:01,040
may say that the other may try to con

435
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,280
doesn't matter nobody can harm you

436
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,700
because you are the spirit you cannot

437
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,530
you are the spirit so just try to

438
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:11,240
understand the person I tell you after

439
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:13,070
some time and find that person will

440
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,890
become very some so many sahaja Yogi's

441
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:18,890
have become like that automatically we

442
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:24,050
are here for seeking God isn't it so to

443
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:26,100
help them you have a patient give up

444
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:29,430
your old methods and ways I must

445
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:36,150
to be good to disturb to be angry

446
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:39,210
there's no need at all I'm telling you

447
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:47,460
from my experience I've tried my wisdom

448
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:51,540
it works is it does work and you're

449
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:57,120
probably and failed in your ascent in

450
00:23:51,540 --> 00:24:00,360
their quality I like you to move brings

451
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,540
others to you I don't like people to

452
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:09,410
criticize others try to support any

453
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:12,870
children I never talk about their past

454
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:14,790
or anything like that it's very sad

455
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:17,880
sometimes I've seen people are very hard

456
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:20,100
and in anger they say things which one

457
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:23,010
should never see it's not gracious it's

458
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:25,800
not in the mannerism of sahaja Yogi's

459
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:28,380
you should never say these things do I

460
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,780
ever say anything like that about your

461
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,940
past when you write to me I know

462
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,890
everything about you did I ever mention

463
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,960
those things to you at all then why

464
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:39,030
should you say things of the past I have

465
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,130
heard these things people just rake it

466
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:43,500
up and flung it back

467
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:45,310
I've heard this kind of thing that you

468
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:49,710
bring it on other people is on

469
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:52,530
one should be very gracious many time

470
00:24:49,710 --> 00:25:01,750
and understand that everybody has

471
00:24:52,530 --> 00:25:05,980
tremendous potential respect yourself

472
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:08,620
and respect others I hope now you won't

473
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:11,200
have problem of collectivity after this

474
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,940
lecture and if you are you can listen to

475
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,750
this lecture again and again and my

476
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:19,450
special humble request there try to come

477
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:25,660
down your angles automatically other

478
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:28,480
angles will come down but if it is a non

479
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:31,120
surgery then you all should fight it

480
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,910
together won't you join together if it's

481
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,920
a nine century nobody dare touch you or

482
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:38,920
trouble you

483
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:47,200
those days are corner none of you will

484
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:49,390
be drawn these are all satanic forces

485
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,210
and they can work through yours we must

486
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:54,640
know when they give you such ideas to

487
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:59,460
fight and to quarrel understand that

488
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:02,590
this is anti God you are doing horrible

489
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:06,520
you have to move towards more

490
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:09,850
understanding more coordination because

491
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:12,250
this is such a tremendous book and of

492
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:15,420
such a sublime nature and we have to be

493
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,420
supplying ourselves

494
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:26,190
all right now is there any other

495
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:28,049
question with a very nice suggestion but

496
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:31,399
don't give me such big suggestions that

497
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:31,399
I have to speak for half an hour

498
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:57,080
I'll say I just want to get even

499
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:21,060
you come here and tell people no no she

500
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:23,220
said that when collectively sahaja

501
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:27,270
Yogi's become one that those who are not

502
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:29,760
so lonely and isolated he stops you see

503
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:32,820
sahaja Yogi's have to be strong enough

504
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:36,810
not to eat like that there are people

505
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,710
say who are in the water and some people

506
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:40,320
are at the board

507
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:43,200
all right now the people who are in the

508
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:46,260
boat are in the boat so they are in a

509
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,820
way different from the people who are in

510
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,010
the water that's the situation

511
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,840
all right now the people in the boat

512
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:55,230
have to save the people who are in the

513
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,060
hope in the in the water right so what I

514
00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:00,210
am saying that those who are on the boat

515
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:01,890
must first of all be united and then

516
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,810
with full strength will them on why this

517
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:07,950
collectivity is just to pull out the

518
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:12,390
rest of them this collectivity is just

519
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:16,170
to achieve their emancipation their

520
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:17,940
realization all right it doesn't mean

521
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:21,240
that is they should exclude that to be

522
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:24,050
the whole collectivity is to bring those

523
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:27,570
people are but you see there are what so

524
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:29,490
anti-god activities going on as well you

525
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:32,600
know that for example there's a guru who

526
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:35,000
makes lots of fun right and he has

527
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,400
destroyed many people now they

528
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,039
to me and they're saying so he may send

529
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,590
somebody here paid for a job just to

530
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:44,450
disturb us then the duty of all the

531
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,309
sahaja Yogi's to get together and see

532
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,679
that you tell him that you see now you

533
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:51,200
are doing wrong guru has done wrong to

534
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:53,179
us and he's going to do wrong to others

535
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,970
why do join me that on that point

536
00:28:53,179 --> 00:28:58,309
everybody should be one but if they are

537
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:00,799
not strong and if they are not one they

538
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:03,280
cannot pull out of us you see my point

539
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:08,179
is like not to exclude ease all

540
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:17,270
collectivity is to include everybody all

541
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:19,669
right I mean to say there is no

542
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:26,470
specialization in sahaja yoga in simple

543
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:26,470
words everybody is a doctor of em

544
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:48,770
I mean to say that all the sahaja Yogi's

545
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:52,230
must form a strong by which they achieve

546
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:55,350
enlargement of sahaja yoga getting more

547
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:59,670
people into such more people benefited

548
00:29:55,350 --> 00:30:01,980
by sahaja yoga all right well anyway

549
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:04,140
have seen wherever there is connectivity

550
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:08,930
like I would say Australia has the

551
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:11,460
maximum collected or India positive but

552
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:13,590
Australia in all the European countries

553
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:16,440
on to the western-style communities

554
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:19,470
Australia has the maximum connectivity

555
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:23,130
and there achieve the maximum results

556
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:27,210
only in Sydney today only one had told

557
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:31,830
me that the halls like this get packed

558
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:34,800
for programs very well there is no hope

559
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:37,200
for new people who are coming and it's

560
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,570
such a big company I am amazed I mean

561
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,420
how many must be going there and it is

562
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:44,640
because of collectivity and as soon as I

563
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:47,040
went there it started gathering enough

564
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,500
but before that the people were fighting

565
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,270
among themselves and many people ran

566
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,650
away from sahaja yoga because they

567
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:57,110
thought these people are fighting what

568
00:30:52,650 --> 00:31:00,510
are going to give us maximum using

569
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:04,500
Australia IT and is Austria is having

570
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:07,350
some problem then I as soon as the

571
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,930
problem came in the whole thing became a

572
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:12,540
very small group again that problem is

573
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:14,550
over now positivity has come the people

574
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:21,150
have joined together again it has been

575
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:23,160
nice it happens here was a TLC why

576
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:27,020
Labour Party lost if they had not

577
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,020
followed they would not have been so bad

578
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:33,820
he's acted simple a simple equation

579
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,869
united we stand
