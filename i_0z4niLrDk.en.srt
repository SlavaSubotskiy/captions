1
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:40,070
So welcome to you all, Sahaja Yogis,

2
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:46,487
to this great country of yoga.

3
00:09:51,362 --> 00:09:59,778
Today first of all we have to establish

4
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:07,028
our desire within ourselves

5
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:09,778
that we are seekers

6
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:17,028
and that we have to achieve our full growth and maturity.

7
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:24,028
Today's puja is for the whole universe.

8
00:10:24,694 --> 00:10:29,611
The whole universe

9
00:10:29,778 --> 00:10:34,528
should be enlightened with your desires.

10
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:38,861
Your desires should be so intense

11
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:43,278
that they should emit out

12
00:10:43,362 --> 00:10:48,945
the pure vibrations of Mahakali Shakti,

13
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:54,111
which is the pure desire

14
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:58,528
of attaining the spirit.

15
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:01,195
That's the real desire.

16
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:08,527
All the other desires are like mirage.

17
00:11:11,945 --> 00:11:20,527
You are the people who are chosen by God.

18
00:11:22,611 --> 00:11:30,611
Specially, first to express your desire,

19
00:11:30,694 --> 00:11:34,528
and then to achieve it.

20
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:46,278
And by intense desire of purity

21
00:11:46,362 --> 00:11:51,028
you have to purify the whole world.

22
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:53,278
Not only the seekers,

23
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:57,611
but even those who are not seekers.

24
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:10,362
You have to create an aura around this universe,

25
00:12:10,445 --> 00:12:18,362
of desire to achieve the ultimate,

26
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:21,861
the spirit.

27
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:33,945
Without desire this universe would not have been created.

28
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:46,028
This Desire of God is the one that is the Holy Ghost,

29
00:12:46,195 --> 00:12:50,195
is this all-pervading power,

30
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:55,278
is the Kundalini within you.

31
00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:59,528
Kundalini has only one desire,

32
00:12:59,694 --> 00:13:03,111
is to be the spirit

33
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:08,111
and anything else if you desire

34
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:12,278
the Kundalini doesn't rise.

35
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:15,778
Only when it knows

36
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:22,445
that this desire is going to be fulfilled

37
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:33,445
by somebody, who is facing the seeker,

38
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:38,111
it is awakened.

39
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:45,778
If you do not have the desire,

40
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:48,778
no-one can force you.

41
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,278
Sahaja Yogis should never try

42
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:56,611
to force this desire on other people.

43
00:13:56,694 --> 00:13:59,278
The first ordeal we face,

44
00:13:59,362 --> 00:14:02,861
as soon as you get your Realization,

45
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:08,528
is that you just start thinking of your family.

46
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:13,195
You start thinking: 'My mother has not got it,

47
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,527
my father has not got it,

48
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:19,195
my wife has not got it,

49
00:14:19,362 --> 00:14:23,527
my children have not got it.'

50
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:32,445
You must know that these relations are worldly.

51
00:14:32,527 --> 00:14:34,694
Sanskrit is loukik.

52
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:37,278
They are not aloukik,

53
00:14:37,362 --> 00:14:41,278
they are not beyond the worldly relationships.

54
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:43,527
These are worldly relations,

55
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:46,778
and these attachments are worldly.

56
00:14:46,861 --> 00:14:51,778
So if you play into that of course as you know,

57
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:55,195
that Mahamaya Shakti allows you to play with that.

58
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:58,445
You go ahead, as long as you like.

59
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:02,028
People bring Me all their relations,

60
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:04,278
parents, this and that

61
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,778
and ultimately they discover

62
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:12,111
that this was a very wrong thing they did.

63
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:19,111
They lost so many precious moments,

64
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:21,778
so many hours, so many years,

65
00:15:21,861 --> 00:15:24,694
wasting their energy on people

66
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:29,861
who never deserved any attention of Mother.

67
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:36,362
Sooner you realize the better that this desire

68
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:41,611
may be within you,

69
00:15:41,778 --> 00:15:47,362
and may not be in anyone of your so-called worldly relations.

70
00:15:47,527 --> 00:15:52,278
Makes no difference.

71
00:15:52,694 --> 00:15:54,694
As Christ was told

72
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:58,611
that His brothers and sisters are waiting outside,

73
00:15:58,694 --> 00:16:05,111
He said: 'Who are My brothers and who are My sisters?'

74
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:11,195
So one has to realize that those people who involve themselves

75
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,611
into the problems of their family all the time,

76
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:17,694
and attract My attention,

77
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:21,528
you must know that I am just playing about.

78
00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:25,611
It is of no value to you.

79
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:29,278
For your ascent it is important first of all

80
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:31,611
to have no desires

81
00:16:31,694 --> 00:16:36,778
to create desire in your kith and kin.

82
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:41,778
This is the first principle of establishment

83
00:16:41,945 --> 00:16:45,945
of Mahakali Power.

84
00:16:48,611 --> 00:16:51,694
Specially in India

85
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:55,362
where people are too much attached to their family,

86
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:59,195
it's a very big problem.

87
00:16:59,445 --> 00:17:02,611
If you give Realization to one person,

88
00:17:02,945 --> 00:17:07,362
you are amazed to see that all relationship they have

89
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:10,945
is with a big bunch of bhoots.

90
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:17,195
And once you give Realization to one person you are in for trouble.

91
00:17:17,362 --> 00:17:21,445
Then all the bhoots walk in, slowly,

92
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:25,111
torturing My life, wasting My energy,

93
00:17:25,195 --> 00:17:28,861
and absolutely disgusting.

94
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:32,195
It should happen to you to understand

95
00:17:32,278 --> 00:17:35,362
that this is not auspicious.

96
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:38,028
If you want to waste your time,

97
00:17:38,111 --> 00:17:41,945
I will allow you to waste your time.

98
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:48,278
But if you want to have the ascent fast,

99
00:17:48,362 --> 00:17:50,527
first of all one must remember

100
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:55,528
that these are relations which are absolutely worldly relations

101
00:17:55,611 --> 00:17:59,528
and this is not your pure desire.

102
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:04,362
So try to separate your pure desire

103
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:08,611
from your worldly desires.

104
00:18:09,445 --> 00:18:13,111
It does not by any means,

105
00:18:13,362 --> 00:18:17,945
suggest that you give up your family,

106
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:22,527
you give up your mother or give up your sister - nothing.

107
00:18:22,528 --> 00:18:24,861
But you witness them

108
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:31,028
and see, as you would see anybody else,

109
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:36,527
and see for yourself, whether

110
00:18:36,611 --> 00:18:40,527
they are really desirous or not.

111
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:42,278
If they are - well and good.

112
00:18:42,362 --> 00:18:45,945
They should not be disqualified because they are your relations.

113
00:18:46,028 --> 00:18:47,861
It works both ways.

114
00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:51,611
As they cannot be qualified because they are your relations,

115
00:18:51,694 --> 00:18:56,945
they cannot be disqualified because they're your relations.

116
00:18:57,028 --> 00:19:05,195
So in Sahaja Yoga to make your desire a pure desire,

117
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:12,527
you have to get out of so many things.

118
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:17,111
But for people who are attached to their family,

119
00:19:17,362 --> 00:19:20,861
are bound by their family,

120
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:23,028
they have to see to it

121
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:27,028
that they do not force Sahaja Yoga on anyone of their relations,

122
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:31,111
at least don't force them on Me.

123
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:45,237
Now this desire within us,

124
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,736
which is the Mahakali Power which is manifesting,

125
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:53,195
comes to us in so many ways.

126
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,736
As I told you first of all,

127
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:58,278
it comes to us after Realization,

128
00:20:58,403 --> 00:21:00,653
because you are all Sahaja Yogis,

129
00:21:00,778 --> 00:21:06,237
to do something about our relations.

130
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:09,694
Then the second desire that comes to us,

131
00:21:09,945 --> 00:21:14,819
that let us try to cure people,

132
00:21:14,903 --> 00:21:19,445
who are our relations.

133
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,903
This is the second desire,

134
00:21:22,028 --> 00:21:23,445
you should face yourself and see,

135
00:21:23,528 --> 00:21:26,653
that this has happened to many of you.

136
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:32,278
So, right from leprosy

137
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:37,653
to any small thing like cold or sneezing,

138
00:21:37,736 --> 00:21:39,986
whatever they have,

139
00:21:40,237 --> 00:21:45,945
you think you should bring to Mother.

140
00:21:47,736 --> 00:21:53,237
And all the worries of your families should be brought to Mother.

141
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:57,778
Simple thing like pregnancy or sneezing,

142
00:21:57,986 --> 00:22:02,986
very simple things - which are so natural

143
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:10,237
are brought into your attention.

144
00:22:11,403 --> 00:22:13,694
So when you have them in your attention I say:

145
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:19,153
'All right, go ahead with it. Try to solve it, if possible.'

146
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:21,903
But if you do not have them in your attention

147
00:22:22,028 --> 00:22:25,945
they are in My attention.

148
00:22:28,153 --> 00:22:32,861
You leave them in My attention, I'll manage that.

149
00:22:32,945 --> 00:22:36,986
But then it's a vicious circle.

150
00:22:37,653 --> 00:22:41,653
It's a very subtle projection of the mind

151
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,528
that thinks: 'All right,

152
00:22:43,611 --> 00:22:45,736
that Mother we don't have this in our attention,

153
00:22:45,819 --> 00:22:51,569
You'd better look after it." That's not the way.

154
00:22:51,653 --> 00:22:56,569
You should have only one intense desire within yourself:

155
00:22:56,653 --> 00:23:00,362
"Have I become the spirit?

156
00:23:00,736 --> 00:23:04,569
Have I achieved my ultimate?

157
00:23:04,694 --> 00:23:09,527
Have I risen above the worldly desires?"

158
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:12,569
Purify it.

159
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:18,403
Once you start purifying whatever falls off,

160
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:21,653
I'll look after that.

161
00:23:21,736 --> 00:23:27,653
This is just an assurance, but not a guarantee.

162
00:23:29,237 --> 00:23:36,153
If it deserves My attention I will definitely look after you.

163
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:45,362
You have to value your attention as I value My attention.

164
00:23:48,028 --> 00:23:53,778
I think you have to value much more of your attention

165
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:59,527
than Me, because I can manage,

166
00:23:59,694 --> 00:24:01,362
many more things within Myself,

167
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:06,945
because everything is in My attention.

168
00:24:07,903 --> 00:24:12,903
But you try to purify your desires,

169
00:24:13,028 --> 00:24:18,028
away from the worldly problems that are facing you.

170
00:24:18,153 --> 00:24:22,028
So you expand it more, then you start thinking:

171
00:24:22,153 --> 00:24:29,320
'Mother, what about the problem of our country?'

172
00:24:32,736 --> 00:24:36,320
All right, give Me the map of your country - finished.

173
00:24:36,403 --> 00:24:39,986
That's more than sufficient.

174
00:24:43,527 --> 00:24:47,611
Then purify yourself.

175
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:52,819
The desire that you have, you leave it.

176
00:24:52,945 --> 00:24:54,527
And once you are purified

177
00:24:54,611 --> 00:24:57,653
that area will be covered through your attention,

178
00:24:57,736 --> 00:25:01,653
it's very interesting.

179
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:08,445
When you get over it then only you can throw light,

180
00:25:09,111 --> 00:25:11,736
but if you are inside you are hidden by that.

181
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:15,403
Your light is hidden, there's no light emitted.

182
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:18,278
You all rise above that desire.

183
00:25:18,403 --> 00:25:21,362
Every time you get a desire you rise above it,

184
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:26,195
so your light is emitted on that wider problem

185
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,070
that you are facing

186
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:33,527
which you think should be solved by Me.

187
00:25:34,403 --> 00:25:39,487
These are all My headaches which you are taking on yourself.

188
00:25:39,528 --> 00:25:42,819
You have to do only one thing is to become the spirit

189
00:25:42,945 --> 00:25:45,487
that's all. Is a simple thing.

190
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:50,028
The rest of it is My headache.

191
00:25:51,945 --> 00:25:58,403
Now the problems

192
00:25:58,487 --> 00:26:05,487
that should take your desire on the collective

193
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:13,320
should be very different.

194
00:26:14,237 --> 00:26:19,195
To substantiate your purity,

195
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:24,445
to be fragrant with your purity,

196
00:26:24,528 --> 00:26:27,819
your attention should be on the other side.

197
00:26:27,903 --> 00:26:29,611
Now you are not facing Me,

198
00:26:29,694 --> 00:26:31,861
you are sitting with Me facing the whole world.

199
00:26:31,945 --> 00:26:37,278
See, the whole attitude will change.

200
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:42,653
The attitude should be: 'What can I give?

201
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:46,111
How can I give?

202
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:49,527
What is my mistake in giving?

203
00:26:49,611 --> 00:26:52,153
I have to be more alert.

204
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:56,569
Where is my attention?

205
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:59,070
I have to be more alert towards myself

206
00:26:59,153 --> 00:27:03,445
what am I doing?

207
00:27:03,945 --> 00:27:08,569
What's my responsibility?'

208
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:16,528
You must desire that you should be pure.

209
00:27:16,611 --> 00:27:19,778
You should be pure desire.

210
00:27:19,903 --> 00:27:23,611
That means you should be the spirit.

211
00:27:23,736 --> 00:27:28,653
That, "What is your responsibility to yourself?"

212
00:27:28,778 --> 00:27:34,903
You should desire that your responsibility to yourself

213
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:38,736
should be manifested,

214
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:43,320
should be complete.

215
00:27:43,403 --> 00:27:49,111
Then your responsibility to this Sahaja Yoga.

216
00:27:49,195 --> 00:27:53,111
What is your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

217
00:27:53,195 --> 00:27:55,653
which is the work of God,

218
00:27:55,778 --> 00:28:02,195
which has started and you are My hands.

219
00:28:03,945 --> 00:28:08,070
You have to do the work of God,

220
00:28:08,195 --> 00:28:12,528
and you have to fight the anti-God elements,

221
00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:15,028
the satanic elements.

222
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:17,653
You are not responsible for your family any more,

223
00:28:17,778 --> 00:28:21,403
those who are, are half-baked Sahaja Yogis

224
00:28:21,527 --> 00:28:25,195
I said, are useless absolutely good for nothing.

225
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,028
All such will drop out, their families will suffer,

226
00:28:28,111 --> 00:28:30,694
I know this is going to happen.

227
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:33,195
Because now the forces are gathering in such a way

228
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,945
that sorting out will start.

229
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:42,445
Your responsibility to yourself, to be the spirit,

230
00:28:42,528 --> 00:28:48,653
your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

231
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:53,819
your responsibility to understand Me,

232
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:58,487
better and better and better.

233
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,569
Your responsibility to understand this mechanism

234
00:29:01,653 --> 00:29:04,653
that is within you,

235
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:08,861
your responsibility to understand how this mechanism

236
00:29:08,986 --> 00:29:13,528
works out everything.

237
00:29:13,778 --> 00:29:19,527
The responsibility is to how to become a guru yourself.

238
00:29:20,445 --> 00:29:25,986
Your responsibility to be a dignified and a glorified personality.

239
00:29:26,111 --> 00:29:28,778
A responsibility to be a respectable person

240
00:29:28,903 --> 00:29:33,653
and not a cheap personality.

241
00:29:34,195 --> 00:29:36,778
Every one of you

242
00:29:36,861 --> 00:29:44,070
is worth the whole universe.

243
00:29:45,487 --> 00:29:50,278
If you want to rise to that height.

244
00:29:51,653 --> 00:29:57,945
Universes of universes can be thrown away at your feet.

245
00:29:58,487 --> 00:30:01,028
If you want to rise to that height,

246
00:30:01,111 --> 00:30:07,153
to that magnitude that is within you to prosper.

247
00:30:09,237 --> 00:30:11,736
But those people,

248
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:21,778
who still want to live on a very low level cannot rise.

249
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:26,153
For example,

250
00:30:26,237 --> 00:30:30,945
the western Sahaja Yogis have certain problems

251
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:39,320
of committing the sin against the Mother,

252
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:42,487
and the eastern Sahaja Yogis have the problem

253
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:47,278
of committing sin against the Father.

254
00:30:48,362 --> 00:30:54,278
It's not difficult at all

255
00:30:55,653 --> 00:31:00,569
for you to get out of it.

256
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:15,403
The attention is to be kept pure.

257
00:31:15,611 --> 00:31:20,445
In Sahaja Yoga you know all the methods

258
00:31:20,528 --> 00:31:25,819
how the attention one can keep it pure.

259
00:31:26,028 --> 00:31:28,070
If the attention is not pure

260
00:31:28,195 --> 00:31:31,278
then this desire

261
00:31:31,403 --> 00:31:36,070
will be always attacked

262
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:39,111
by all petty nonsensical things

263
00:31:39,237 --> 00:31:43,195
which has no meaning in your ascent.

264
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:46,237
Now a person who is a good Sahaja Yogi

265
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,945
is not bothered about clothes, what others say to him

266
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,195
or what others are talking to him,

267
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:53,111
how they are behaving towards him and

268
00:31:53,237 --> 00:31:56,986
the attention is not on that

269
00:31:57,111 --> 00:32:02,153
criticism that this person is like this, that person is like that.

270
00:32:02,237 --> 00:32:08,028
Nor there is the aggressiveness

271
00:32:10,237 --> 00:32:14,195
of anyone else,

272
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:17,237
because nobody is the other.

273
00:32:17,362 --> 00:32:22,111
But the problem is when I say that,

274
00:32:22,362 --> 00:32:28,153
no-one thinks that I'm saying about you, each persons.

275
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:32,653
Those who are aggressive take the other role

276
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:39,278
and those who are non-aggressive think the other way.

277
00:32:39,694 --> 00:32:43,611
Like I say something for a person who is aggressive,

278
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:47,070
the non-aggressive immediately thinks of the person who is aggressive,

279
00:32:47,153 --> 00:32:50,653
not about himself.

280
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:53,861
You immediately start shifting your mind to other person,

281
00:32:53,945 --> 00:32:58,527
finding faults with other people.

282
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:04,819
So this desire becomes

283
00:33:04,945 --> 00:33:10,653
gradually lower and lower and lower

284
00:33:10,778 --> 00:33:15,819
because of the loads that are put onto it.

285
00:33:15,945 --> 00:33:19,320
So the alertness is very important,

286
00:33:19,445 --> 00:33:24,445
complete alertness - satarkata,

287
00:33:24,527 --> 00:33:29,569
that we should keep our attention

288
00:33:29,653 --> 00:33:37,487
purely for the sustenance of our pure desire.

289
00:33:39,195 --> 00:33:43,528
Desire comes from your heart

290
00:33:43,653 --> 00:33:45,403
and you are so built

291
00:33:45,487 --> 00:33:49,986
that your brahmarandra is also the heart.

292
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:53,070
If you don't have a clean heart,

293
00:33:53,153 --> 00:33:57,528
this won't keep clean.

294
00:33:57,611 --> 00:34:00,320
There are people

295
00:34:00,445 --> 00:34:03,153
who think if they talk about Sahaja Yoga big,

296
00:34:03,237 --> 00:34:06,320
and all that, they are all right.

297
00:34:06,403 --> 00:34:09,861
They are cheating themselves.

298
00:34:10,111 --> 00:34:13,861
If the heart is not open

299
00:34:13,986 --> 00:34:17,527
then this is closed.

300
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:23,819
So try to open your heart by projecting.

301
00:34:28,778 --> 00:34:32,945
Projecting it.

302
00:34:33,028 --> 00:34:37,070
I hope today when you do this puja

303
00:34:37,195 --> 00:34:41,237
and you do the worship of Mahakali

304
00:34:41,362 --> 00:34:46,278
and this special yagya,

305
00:34:46,403 --> 00:34:51,070
we will definitely establish this aura,

306
00:34:51,195 --> 00:34:55,945
and enlighten the universe.

307
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:57,861
But your outlook should be:

308
00:34:57,986 --> 00:35:02,986
'How much I have contributed to this.

309
00:35:03,903 --> 00:35:07,237
Am I still thinking of other people,

310
00:35:07,362 --> 00:35:12,445
am I still thinking of my petty small problems,

311
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:18,778
or I'm thinking of my spirit?'

312
00:35:20,487 --> 00:35:25,819
So, the left side

313
00:35:26,028 --> 00:35:33,153
starts and ends with Shri Ganesh.

314
00:35:33,237 --> 00:35:39,569
Shri Ganesh has only basic one quality,

315
00:35:39,653 --> 00:35:42,528
that He's completely surrendered to His Mother,

316
00:35:42,611 --> 00:35:46,320
He does not know any other God,

317
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:50,070
He does not even know His Father.

318
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:52,778
He only knows His Mother

319
00:35:52,903 --> 00:35:59,362
and completely surrendered to Her.

320
00:36:02,903 --> 00:36:09,028
But this pure desire has to have the action,

321
00:36:09,653 --> 00:36:11,736
and about which I'll tell you later

322
00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:16,403
as we will be having more pujas and more pujas.

323
00:36:16,487 --> 00:36:22,320
But today let us establish ourselves

324
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:30,403
into that pure desire, to be the spirit.

325
00:36:30,778 --> 00:36:38,569
Now, as it is, with the western mind we'll say: 'How?'

326
00:36:40,945 --> 00:36:46,070
Is always coming, "How to do it?"

327
00:36:46,153 --> 00:36:52,819
Should I tell you? It's very simple.

328
00:36:52,945 --> 00:36:57,819
Adi Shankaracharya wrote 'Viveka Chudamani'

329
00:36:57,945 --> 00:37:02,403
and so many other books of treaties,

330
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:09,028
and then all these big intellectuals got after his life.

331
00:37:09,111 --> 00:37:11,403
And they said:

332
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:14,611
'How this and how that and how?'

333
00:37:14,694 --> 00:37:17,195
He said: 'Forget these people.'

334
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,986
Then he wrote 'Saundarya Lahari',

335
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,195
it's just a description of his Mother

336
00:37:24,403 --> 00:37:26,736
and his devotion to Her

337
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:36,237
and every couplet that He wrote is a mantra.

338
00:37:36,861 --> 00:37:38,611
It is not the surrender

339
00:37:38,694 --> 00:37:44,611
of your mind through your mind,

340
00:37:44,736 --> 00:37:50,487
but the surrender of your heart.

341
00:37:53,527 --> 00:37:57,445
Is absolutely the surrender of your heart.

342
00:37:57,527 --> 00:38:01,487
Western Sahaja Yogis know very well

343
00:38:01,653 --> 00:38:05,028
how there have been attacks

344
00:38:05,111 --> 00:38:09,028
and attacks of negativity on them,

345
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:15,694
specially when horrible people like Freud

346
00:38:16,237 --> 00:38:23,653
came to destroy their basic, the roots.

347
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:29,028
And how the West accepted it blindfolded,

348
00:38:29,153 --> 00:38:34,195
and put them on the path of hell.

349
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,028
All that has to be brought out.

350
00:38:38,153 --> 00:38:42,320
That is all nonsense, is wrong, absolutely

351
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:47,278
against God, it's anti-God activity.

352
00:38:47,487 --> 00:38:50,819
Then you will realize

353
00:38:50,945 --> 00:38:59,320
that you will fight fully, by saying,

354
00:38:59,445 --> 00:39:06,111
"This is the destruction of our basics, our roots,

355
00:39:06,237 --> 00:39:07,653
when our Mother is the source

356
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:12,528
of everything that is sublime, noble,

357
00:39:12,945 --> 00:39:15,903
all that is nourishing,

358
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:21,528
all that is elevating, emancipating.

359
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:25,153
You have cutting us from our roots.

360
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:30,736
"When he dealt with, I think, animal-like creatures

361
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:37,986
and he wants all of you to go down to that low level

362
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:41,694
of human beings,

363
00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:49,861
which exist as pathological cases, I don't know.

364
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:53,528
So it is important for you to understand all the attacks

365
00:39:53,653 --> 00:39:55,237
that came on you,

366
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,819
and be alert

367
00:39:56,903 --> 00:40:02,527
and don't be identified with anyone of these.

368
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:05,945
Last I would say you have come to this country

369
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:10,487
to see the roots and not the shoot.

370
00:40:10,528 --> 00:40:13,903
Change your attitude of western style.

371
00:40:14,028 --> 00:40:16,403
Telephones are no good.

372
00:40:16,487 --> 00:40:18,903
You cannot get any telephones done here.

373
00:40:19,028 --> 00:40:22,153
Postage is horrible.

374
00:40:22,278 --> 00:40:24,278
Railways are worst.

375
00:40:24,403 --> 00:40:30,528
I shouldn't say because we are in a railway.

376
00:40:35,487 --> 00:40:42,653
But, the people are excellent.

377
00:40:42,778 --> 00:40:44,611
They know what is dharma.

378
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:46,528
They are not being attacked, somehow or other

379
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:48,527
because it being the Kundalini.

380
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:54,195
The Ganesha is sitting here how dare anybody attack?

381
00:40:54,403 --> 00:40:58,653
This great Maharashtra has got eight Ganeshas,

382
00:40:58,778 --> 00:40:59,861
protecting them.

383
00:40:59,945 --> 00:41:03,945
I don't know if these Maharashtrians know this fact.

384
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,403
And so many marutis,

385
00:41:06,527 --> 00:41:09,153
so who can attack this country?

386
00:41:09,278 --> 00:41:10,528
There is no negative attack

387
00:41:10,653 --> 00:41:15,945
except that they themselves are rather money-minded sort.

388
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:19,111
That's the only curse they have, if they can get out of it

389
00:41:19,195 --> 00:41:23,028
they are great people.

390
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:32,945
So, we have come to this country not to enjoy the comfort

391
00:41:33,028 --> 00:41:38,320
of the West, but the comfort of the spirit.

392
00:41:38,445 --> 00:41:43,861
So to change your attitude towards India

393
00:41:43,945 --> 00:41:49,278
I don't mean Air India, by any chance.

394
00:41:49,362 --> 00:41:52,153
This is a wrong idea that you come by Air India

395
00:41:52,237 --> 00:41:54,736
because you are a Sahaja Yogi. Not at all.

396
00:41:54,819 --> 00:41:57,819
Air India is nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

397
00:41:57,945 --> 00:42:00,320
All our railways, all our everything,

398
00:42:00,403 --> 00:42:02,362
they have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga,

399
00:42:02,445 --> 00:42:04,778
so far.

400
00:42:07,237 --> 00:42:11,320
So you be patriotic and use your own airlines,

401
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,903
for heaven's sake.

402
00:42:16,153 --> 00:42:18,653
But when you arrive here

403
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:21,778
you will see that the people are too innocent,

404
00:42:21,903 --> 00:42:24,362
they can't understand Freud, you can't talk to them,

405
00:42:24,445 --> 00:42:27,070
it's beyond them.

406
00:42:27,195 --> 00:42:29,528
They are a higher type of people in this respect

407
00:42:29,653 --> 00:42:31,819
now because they are not attacked,

408
00:42:31,945 --> 00:42:34,611
while you are higher in a way that though you are attacked

409
00:42:34,694 --> 00:42:38,111
you've come out of it.

410
00:42:38,237 --> 00:42:41,653
You just turn your faces and you are on the other way.

411
00:42:41,778 --> 00:42:46,861
That's something great.

412
00:42:46,986 --> 00:42:49,611
So you would also have a confidence

413
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:52,778
there are many people who believe the same way as you believe,

414
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:58,320
in this big country where there's such a big population to support you.

415
00:42:58,445 --> 00:43:03,527
So you shouldn't feel lost.

416
00:43:04,611 --> 00:43:09,320
Thus today, we have to start this puja,

417
00:43:09,445 --> 00:43:13,237
on Mahakali Day.

418
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,653
And it's the Day of the Gauri we can say,

419
00:43:17,778 --> 00:43:20,861
and Ganesh-Gauri's Day today,

420
00:43:20,986 --> 00:43:27,487
though according to the schedule time it may not be.

421
00:43:27,569 --> 00:43:29,403
But according to Me,

422
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:33,986
let us establish within ourself on a subtler level

423
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:39,861
the desire to be pure,

424
00:43:43,111 --> 00:43:47,237
and to be cleansed out.

425
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:54,569
All the barriers and unclean things that are within us,

426
00:43:55,153 --> 00:43:59,819
to desire to be great Sahaja Yogis,

427
00:43:59,945 --> 00:44:06,528
desire to be responsible Sahaja Yogis

428
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:11,527
and desire to be surrendered to your Mother.

429
00:44:11,778 --> 00:44:13,611
It's not difficult.

430
00:44:13,694 --> 00:44:16,736
That is the easiest, the last one is the easiest,

431
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:18,819
because what you surrender,

432
00:44:18,945 --> 00:44:21,903
I don't want anything from you,

433
00:44:22,028 --> 00:44:27,070
except that you accept My Love.

434
00:44:27,195 --> 00:44:32,070
Surrendering just means you open your heart to accept My Love.

435
00:44:32,195 --> 00:44:35,028
Give up this ego.

436
00:44:35,153 --> 00:44:38,362
That's all and it will work out.

437
00:44:38,445 --> 00:44:42,653
I'm sure it's going to work out.

438
00:44:42,778 --> 00:44:46,153
I am trying to push Myself into your hearts

439
00:44:46,278 --> 00:44:50,195
and I'll definitely settle down there.

440
01:09:47,278 --> 01:09:52,320
Mahakali has a special capacity to weep,

441
01:09:52,528 --> 01:09:54,569
because She is left-sided.

442
01:09:54,653 --> 01:09:57,070
When She's helpless and She cannot act,

443
01:09:57,195 --> 01:09:59,945
She weeps.

444
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:02,237
This is the only manifestation

445
01:10:02,362 --> 01:10:05,445
of Mahakali is that She desires,

446
01:10:05,528 --> 01:10:08,945
and if She doesn't get Her desire enacted

447
01:10:09,028 --> 01:10:10,445
then She just weeps,

448
01:10:10,528 --> 01:10:13,653
that's the only thing She can do in helplessness, isn't it.

449
01:10:13,819 --> 01:10:18,070
And sometimes when She's full of Love

450
01:10:18,153 --> 01:10:21,195
as I've seen you today all of you coming down here

451
01:10:21,278 --> 01:10:24,320
and all these people sitting down here.

452
01:10:24,445 --> 01:10:27,403
When She cannot express Herself fully,

453
01:10:27,527 --> 01:10:29,569
with full heart,

454
01:10:29,778 --> 01:10:39,903
also She feels that joy pouring as tears.

455
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,195
May God bless you for today's puja,

456
01:10:42,278 --> 01:10:45,903
I hope all of you will take it in such a way

457
01:10:46,028 --> 01:10:48,528
that the subtlest of subtle

458
01:10:48,653 --> 01:10:51,195
will be awakened within you, the sensitivity

459
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:55,320
every way, and the Love,

460
01:10:55,528 --> 01:10:58,611
which culminates into joy.

461
01:10:58,694 --> 01:11:05,028
Love that flowers into the fragrance of joy

462
01:11:05,153 --> 01:11:10,320
will manifest in today's puja.

463
01:11:10,403 --> 01:11:13,237
May God bless you!
