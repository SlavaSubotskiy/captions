1
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:15,015
It is so nice to be here in Brazil, especially in Salvador.

2
00:06:16,295 --> 00:06:22,306
I’ve been to a gentleman a long time back, from my husband’s office,

3
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:28,935
from Brazil, and his wife was suffering from terrible black magic.

4
00:06:31,655 --> 00:06:36,150
And she really was cured of that trouble.

5
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:43,150
So, he told Me that, "You have to go to Brazil  because it is full of lots of negative things  specially the black magic,

6
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,744
So you must go there somehow".

7
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:54,269
And so, it was my great desire to come here and that’s how I came, few years back.

8
00:06:54,579 --> 00:07:01,423
 Also, Duilio was here and, I mean, things
were arranged somehow, Sahaj, so I came here.

9
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:06,535
So, the problem of this country is more,

10
00:07:07,575 --> 00:07:15,438
is this black magic that is brought by the people from Africa.

11
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:24,495
So, I have thought today, let us have Mahakali Puja.

12
00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:33,310
Mahakali is the left side power in us.

13
00:07:35,282 --> 00:07:40,135
So, actually, she is Adi Shakti.

14
00:07:40,135 --> 00:07:49,689
Only when she enters into the left side of the Virata we call her Mahakali, but she is the power of pure desire of God.

15
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:57,895
Then she establishes Shri Ganesha herself.

16
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:02,984
Then she goes to the right-side as Mahasaraswati.

17
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:12,198
And then she enters into the centre where she is Mahalakshmi.

18
00:08:12,198 --> 00:08:16,190
That is how Adi Shakti takes three forms.

19
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:28,851
But Mahakali is the pure form, because she’s not yet taken - I mean from Adi Shakti, she is Mahakali Power.

20
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:38,806
So, first thing she - before creating this universe or anything- she created Shri Ganesha.

21
00:08:40,863 --> 00:08:53,663
And first, to spread, manifest not only holiness but also auspiciousness, and purity.

22
00:08:56,255 --> 00:09:05,666
So, before anything was created, these spiritual Forces were created, to protect the creation that was to follow.

23
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:17,470
So, this Mahakali force was specially in the purest form to protect people from the negative side.

24
00:09:20,964 --> 00:09:36,151
Now when any thought enters our mind, any reasoning comes up to our mind, it is thrown on the left-side by this Mahakali.

25
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:39,120
Throw out?

26
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,043
So, goes to the left side. Subconcious.

27
00:09:42,043 --> 00:09:43,782
Every bad thought? No.

28
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:45,842
You see, whatever thought comes to us.

29
00:09:45,842 --> 00:09:46,580
Ah, whatever.

30
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,933
Today, there’s a thought, now, just now, that goes to the left side,

31
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:59,422
And then, that is how the present becomes the past, goes to the subconscious.

32
00:10:03,592 --> 00:10:13,596
Now the subconscious also has many layers which are on the left side in a parallel way, not horizontally, but parallel.

33
00:10:17,513 --> 00:10:26,166
So, there are seven of these layers, and the seventh one ends up into the Collective Subconscious.

34
00:10:29,576 --> 00:10:39,110
So, whatever is dead, in the past, and was discarded from the evolutionary process, is thrown into the Collective Subconscious.

35
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:57,523
Now when - say for example, lives which were thrown out of the evolution, microscopic animals, whatever, viruses,

36
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:02,891
then also human beings, animals, everything  that was thrown out,

37
00:11:02,891 --> 00:11:10,583
 like mammoths and all that, these animals were thrown out of the evolution, are [on the left-side].

38
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:28,764
So, the people who are living more in the past, if by any accident or by any unhappy incident in life, are thrown towards that,

39
00:11:30,032 --> 00:11:38,468
they catch some of this Collective Subconscious.

40
00:11:40,694 --> 00:11:53,151
So also, this lifetime, whatever conditionings we have, also pass into our, they pass into our subconscious mind.

41
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:10,275
For example, a person is sitting in the darkness alone, suddenly starts feeling the fear.

42
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:16,633
Then he is, with that fear, he’s thrown towards the left side

43
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:22,504
and he can catch something, what we call as ‘bhoots’, you see, what we call bhoots.

44
00:12:22,504 --> 00:12:28,576
It's some sort of a dead spirit and then he becomes a different person.

45
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:35,602
Also, somebody who is too much right-sided, is always active, thinking too much of the future,

46
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:43,999
his attention moves to the extreme - say, to the right side.

47
00:12:44,573 --> 00:12:54,626
Then suddenly if some shock or some fear, or whatever it is, this pendulum like thing, can move to the other side also.

48
00:12:57,951 --> 00:13:05,895
So, all the people who are very right-sided can get into problems of possessions.

49
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:06,865
Of subconscious?

50
00:13:06,865 --> 00:13:08,394
Of possessions.

51
00:13:08,394 --> 00:13:09,826
But, of subconscious?

52
00:13:09,826 --> 00:13:12,186
Subconscious also.

53
00:13:12,863 --> 00:13:26,207
Also, people who are extremely meticulous, extremely futuristic, can catch on the right side also Collective Supraconscious.

54
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:33,688
 Supraconcious. It's a right side. Futuristic.

55
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:48,273
Now, we have to now understand Mahakali’s powers.

56
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:58,623
Now Mahakali’s powers are such that she is the Holy Ghost.

57
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:09,868
So, firstly she can cure any diseases that come from viruses.

58
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:19,911
Like say from AIDS. You can start from Mooladhara, all Mooladhara diseases, then all Swadisthana diseases, all these diseases.

59
00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:33,437
Left Vishuddhi of course, is a combination, because when a man is too right-sided, to balance his ego, he puts it here in the guilt.

60
00:14:35,095 --> 00:14:41,564
It could be a combination of both right and left.

61
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:48,029
But all other incurable diseases are left-sided.

62
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:53,272
Like you have cancer.

63
00:14:53,948 --> 00:15:00,204
Now see this is the left-side centre and this is the right-side centre, they look like this.

64
00:15:00,204 --> 00:15:08,442
So, this is left-side, this is right-side, and in the centre, is the centre.

65
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:16,647
Now supposing even if you are working in the right side too much, the energy is driven to the right side.

66
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:24,114
But suddenly something may happen, you see, some accident, some sort of an unhappiness, anything,

67
00:15:24,368 --> 00:15:29,990
and this little bit can break like that, from the left side.

68
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:36,669
So, the virus can start flowing into the right-side also.

69
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:45,448
Now, when this virus enters into the right-side, you have no connection with the whole, because it’s broken now. [The triangle is broken.]

70
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:57,938
So, this right side starts working on its own and that’s how you develop this cancer where the cell itself becomes the ego:

71
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:04,172
it gets the ego and it starts multiplying, multiplying.

72
00:16:05,137 --> 00:16:09,015
So, this virus can give you any kind of disease

73
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:17,095
which cannot be cured by medical science because medical science deals with the right side of the physical side.

74
00:16:18,898 --> 00:16:25,817
But the mental side is dealt with by Mahakali Power, mental side.

75
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:41,583
That is how in Sahaja Yoga we have been able to cure many incurable diseases by using candles.

76
00:16:42,907 --> 00:16:52,297
Because the light when it is shown to these viruses, or to the bhoots, they go away.

77
00:16:54,354 --> 00:17:00,837
So, by three-candle treatment you can cure any one of these incurable diseases, even AIDS.

78
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:12,380
But when this trouble starts above the Vishuddhi chakra or from the Vishuddhi chakra,

79
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:24,972
then people become mentally handicapped, like they become mad, they get epilepsy or they get what you call schizophrenia.

80
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:32,864
Now what do they do when they use black magic? We should understand.

81
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:39,898
In India, we call it the "preta vidya" or "shmashana vidya". "Preta vidya" means the dead, knowledge of the dead

82
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:45,786
and "shmashana vidya" is the knowledge of the cemetery.

83
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:48,700
Preta vidya?

84
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,684
Si, Preta vidya.

85
00:17:50,684 --> 00:17:53,190
Preta also in Brazilian means "black".

86
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,422
Really?

87
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:55,787
In Brazilian, blake black.

88
00:17:55,787 --> 00:17:57,659
But "preta" means dead.

89
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,649
Dead, ah.

90
00:18:01,227 --> 00:18:06,125
And the other is "shmashana vidya" means of the, of the cemetery.

91
00:18:09,534 --> 00:18:16,362
So, the way they do it is that when some evil genius is dead, they know that somebody is dead,

92
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:26,661
then these people go there and try to wait until everybody disappears.

93
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:34,351
You know they burn in India, no? They burn the body in India.

94
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:35,095
Yes.

95
00:18:35,095 --> 00:18:40,547
And when the brain is opened it makes a sound, you see, of the head.

96
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:46,936
After that people go away. So, they [preta vidya people] are still there.

97
00:18:47,302 --> 00:19:01,510
And then they take the skull of that man, or some part of the body with them, maybe some bones, so that the Spirit, which is hovering there, follows them.

98
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:12,469
And then they give some names to these bhoots who are following them and then they, somehow or other, tie them up, you see, they imprison them.

99
00:19:13,342 --> 00:19:20,967
And then they use these bhoots to entice someone, to mesmerise someone.

100
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:27,032
And these bhoots can get more bhoots also with them to entice them more if these people want,

101
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:33,751
just because they are now been captured and they are evil geniuses.

102
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:44,014
So, this is what the false gurus do, that they put these bhoots on people, mesmerise them, through their eyes these bhoots come in.

103
00:19:44,014 --> 00:19:54,050
And then these people start giving all their money, all the property, everything to them, even the women give up their chastity.

104
00:19:59,095 --> 00:19:59,962
Anywhere.

105
00:19:59,962 --> 00:20:02,461
Anywhere, yes, anywhere, I'll say.

106
00:20:24,448 --> 00:20:29,677
So, this is how they try to mesmerise.

107
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:40,794
Also, they can use these bhoots for killing somebody or for beating somebody, putting somebody into trouble, all kinds of things.

108
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:55,962
So also, they try to sort of put ideas into people, make them violent and make them very bad people, dirty people.

109
00:20:57,145 --> 00:21:06,043
This unnatural sex relationship, like homosexuality and all that, it's also from bhoots.

110
00:21:07,846 --> 00:21:15,013
That is, they do everything that is anti, you can say, Mahakali.

111
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:25,478
And that is how they may bring inauspiciousness, unholiness, violence, all kinds of problems.

112
00:21:26,436 --> 00:21:34,580
Now supposing, if these bhoots are, say, drunkards, then they make people drink too much.

113
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:47,236
Or if they are, say, cheats or people who have been making money by wrong methods, they can also enter into the heads of people.

114
00:21:47,236 --> 00:21:53,801
Like here I think the politicians, they have entered into their heads, so they are like mad people now.

115
00:21:56,477 --> 00:22:08,637
And that is how the dharma is not there anymore, there is no dharma, there are no maryadhas, nothing and they do what they like.

116
00:22:10,585 --> 00:22:21,577
So, the hundred and eight names of the Goddess or the one thousand names of the Goddess are mostly for the Mahakali, on the left-hand side.

117
00:22:21,577 --> 00:22:25,827
Because she killed so many rakshasas. All right?

118
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:35,500
She destroys also viruses and all kinds of things which are inflicted on human beings.

119
00:22:36,402 --> 00:22:44,144
Also, she cures many things like conditionings, say for example, of the Catholic church,

120
00:22:46,793 --> 00:22:58,062
which has given a conditioning into human beings that they cannot ascend, because of this Catholic church conditioning.

121
00:22:59,555 --> 00:23:10,022
So even if you believe in someone, supposing there is a Sahaja Yogi and you believe that this Sahaja Yogi is God, then also you can catch.

122
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:18,332
If you believe in some Sahaja Yogi that he is God, then they can catch.

123
00:23:21,432 --> 00:23:30,113
Because they- if you beleive in anybody who has no authority, it is unauthorised shraddha [faith], then you get into trouble.

124
00:23:32,705 --> 00:23:41,197
So, in Sahaja Yoga nobody should consider somebody as guru because he has given you Realisation or something, he is not your guru.

125
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:56,471
And the best way to get rid of it is through the Mother Earth because she sucks in, recedes the left side. The Mother Earth sucks in your problems.

126
00:23:56,697 --> 00:24:10,871
So, if you just put your left hand towards the light and your right hand on the Mother Earth, from the light, you see, the negativity runs and goes into the Mother Earth.

127
00:24:11,998 --> 00:24:15,455
They use the same thing, like lemons they will use, you see.

128
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:22,846
In the lemon they will put bhoots and they put this lemon to somebody so that, that person gets possessed.

129
00:24:24,508 --> 00:24:32,933
While we remove the lemon that absorbs the bhoots and then put the lemon in the water.

130
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:41,344
Then another thing, that is the light, you see. Supposing you put the light without Me being there, my photograph not being there,

131
00:24:41,344 --> 00:24:47,703
then the bhoots start, you see, getting more upset with the light.

132
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:54,232
And it attracts more bhoots to protect itself.

133
00:24:54,796 --> 00:25:05,095
But in the presence of my photograph, the photograph emits vibrations which make all the bhoots run away.

134
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:15,829
Because the light also, this light, gets awakened in front of my photograph.

135
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:29,150
So, this is the contrast in which we can achieve results of getting rid of problems.

136
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:38,764
But I would suggest that Sahaja Yogis should not directly treat these people.

137
00:25:39,891 --> 00:25:47,766
They can put them before my photograph and use the three candles treatment but not to touch them.

138
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:54,624
Before doing anything, they should take a bandhan also.

139
00:25:55,413 --> 00:26:05,014
So, whenever you take your bandhan, you are taking the bandhan of Mahakali, because she protects you.

140
00:26:07,663 --> 00:26:17,327
After some time, when you have reached a certain stage of ascent, the bhoots run away, if they see you, they run away.

141
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:24,184
Or they will start shaking before you.

142
00:26:25,014 --> 00:26:37,022
And ask such a person to put his hands towards the light with my photograph. The light will go up and down and black soot will come out.

143
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:51,035
So, the left side is called as Tamo guna, the right side is Rajo guna and the centre as Satwo guna.

144
00:26:51,796 --> 00:26:59,808
Now, Tamo guna means a left-sided personality.

145
00:27:02,175 --> 00:27:10,204
He is the one who always runs into some darkness and he’s secretive and he’s sly.

146
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:14,477
And you don’t know how he- what he's up to.

147
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:24,135
And to look at, he looks very humble and he never answers you back but he does certain things at your back.

148
00:27:26,756 --> 00:27:31,963
You cannot make out his mischiefs till he may hurt you.

149
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:42,748
Now, the right-sided person is on the contrary extremely aggressive and sort of tries to show off.

150
00:27:44,213 --> 00:27:49,157
But the Satwo guna is in the balance.

151
00:27:49,664 --> 00:27:56,320
But on your vibrations, you can make it out what are the problems of the person.

152
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:03,990
Last night, for example, my whole Swadisthana was burning.

153
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:09,773
Even the children will show by putting their thumb in the mouth [unsure].

154
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:16,051
So, this is what is the Left Swadisthana and for Left Swadisthana, the mantra is Mahakali’s mantra.

155
00:28:16,164 --> 00:28:27,646
And another very important mantra for the Left Swadisthana is that, "Mother, you are the pure knowledge".

156
00:28:28,604 --> 00:28:34,841
But for Christians it is better even to say, "Mother you are the Holy Ghost" like the Christ has said it.

157
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:47,095
It is really easy to get rid of these things if you just decide that, "I’m not having anything to do with that."

158
00:28:48,448 --> 00:28:56,514
These bhoots are so stupid! That, supposing somebody, they may come to my house, take off their coat, put some other shawl on them,

159
00:28:56,514 --> 00:29:02,594
when they go, the bhoots can’t recognize them. They are so stupid.

160
00:29:02,594 --> 00:29:04,114
The bhoots that are in the shawl.

161
00:29:04,114 --> 00:29:09,673
No, no, no. Somebody comes to meet Me. And I take out the bhoots, you see, he’ll go out somewhere.

162
00:29:09,673 --> 00:29:21,108
The bhoots come inside the house also. Then you make him wear something else. So, the person changes his dress. So, they can’t make you out. They are so stupid.

163
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:27,293
[To a child] Just come here because there’s kana [food].

164
00:29:28,054 --> 00:29:30,691
Both of you.

165
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:43,162
So, this is Mahakali’s great work and I have already told you how she works it out. Now today we are going to worship her, I’m sure she will become very powerful here

166
00:29:43,162 --> 00:29:50,856
and she will see to it that all this black magic is finished.

167
00:29:51,053 --> 00:29:58,935
These Mahakali’s powers you will start seeing also when she, once she starts manifesting, your politicians will improve,

168
00:29:59,095 --> 00:30:07,297
everything will improve, because it is under these wrong powers you see that they are doing these things.

169
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:20,569
Also, all these bad things like violence and all kinds of bad things people do is only under the influence of negativity.

170
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:29,599
Even if they know this is wrong, it should not be done, they do it compulsively, compulsively.

171
00:30:30,213 --> 00:30:38,072
Now a new disease has come where people have compulsive habits, like washing their hands all the time, or

172
00:30:38,776 --> 00:30:55,477
I mean all these compulsive habits are done like somebody’s brushing their teeth three hundred times, somebody washing their hands, somebody very particular about everything, all the time cleaning, cleaning.

173
00:30:57,703 --> 00:31:05,529
Some women are like that, if anything falls off, they must run, clean and they have no time to sit down for five minutes.

174
00:31:06,994 --> 00:31:12,155
They can’t help it, they can’t help it.

175
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:18,156
Ultimately, they get out of the society because they are confused.

176
00:31:20,523 --> 00:31:31,060
So, I have now tried to tell you the various things that this absence of Mahakali can manifest.

177
00:31:32,526 --> 00:31:40,128
So, the Mahakali’s manifestation is so important for a country where there are so many negativities.

178
00:31:43,255 --> 00:31:53,347
And I hope next time I come this will be very much reduced [inaudible]. We’ll have a much cleaner place.

179
00:31:56,334 --> 00:32:03,983
Now you people also now know how to cure Left Swadisthana. So, always check up the Left Swadisthana and try to cure it.

180
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:11,925
May God bless you.
