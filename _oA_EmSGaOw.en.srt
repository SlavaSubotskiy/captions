1
00:02:57,566 --> 00:03:03,566
Everything in Sahaja Yoga is very scientific,

2
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:08,192
is all pre-planned I think, and is all significant.

3
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:14,150
For example, today is Wednesday

4
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:17,566
and we have never had any Puja on a Wednesday

5
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:21,108
because I was born on Wednesday.

6
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:25,941
So I was thinking if the Puja starts before twelve o’clock

7
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:28,025
we’ll be able to manage it

8
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:30,067
because I was born at twelve.

9
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:33,566
So every child has to sleep after twelve o’clock, you see,

10
00:03:33,983 --> 00:03:38,983
and so I couldn’t, I had to sleep. So it’s so significant, you see.

11
00:03:39,025 --> 00:03:41,566
It’s the first time we are having a Puja on Wednesday,

12
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:44,775
normally I don’t even travel on Wednesdays.

13
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:50,733
So, you can imagine that it’s such a breakthrough and I’m very happy

14
00:03:50,858 --> 00:03:52,983
that you all are ready for a Puja

15
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:58,691
and that we could break this rule also,

16
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:02,067
after such a long time,

17
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:08,566
because it was impossible for me to keep awake after twelve, you see

18
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:10,150
I was trying, trying, trying

19
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:13,608
and I knew that you all, also, were feeling very sleepy.

20
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:24,566
So it’s so mutual and it’s so simple.Alright.

21
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:30,983
So today we have gathered, really, remarkably,

22
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,900
in the really centre of the Nabhi of the universe,

23
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:41,566
and I don’t know how far

24
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:45,566
I can go with the description of this great country

25
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:48,941
which we call as Greece.

26
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:59,108
Also, in the Puranas it is described as Manipura Dweep.

27
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:04,941
The Manipur is the Nabhi Chakra – Manipur,

28
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:08,025
and a “dweep” is a island.

29
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:12,983
Island of the Manipura stays the Athena,

30
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,025
and there is a temple of Athena,

31
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:24,900
all been described about Her temple, about Her

32
00:05:27,816 --> 00:05:30,816
jewelry, dress and everything.

33
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:35,649
So it’s already in the Puranas described, this Athena.

34
00:05:35,816 --> 00:05:39,816
As I’ve told you before, ‘Athena’ means the Primordial Mother.

35
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:44,025
So now, one may say that,

36
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:46,275
“Why the Primordial Mother, Adi Shakti,

37
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:49,566
should be on the Nabhi Chakra of the universe?”

38
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,566
One may ask a question like that,

39
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:59,566
that, “Why She’s placed on the Nabhi Chakra?”

40
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:06,566
Because in the – I don’t know in English –

41
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:13,983
before the Creation was created in the material form,

42
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,941
where it was planned,

43
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:24,150
then there was something of the –

44
00:06:24,566 --> 00:06:26,566
what we call is the Vishnuloka,

45
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:36,067
is the loka, or the area where Vishnu ruled,

46
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:42,983
and in that Vishnuloka it was decided

47
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:52,649
that Adi Shakti should first come in the form as a cow,

48
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:58,900
and then She should descend in the area called as Gokul,

49
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:01,941
which is Vishuddhi Chakra,  first

50
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:04,233
and create vibrations there.

51
00:07:04,983 --> 00:07:09,233
Now in the material form the Gokul was

52
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:12,858
where Shri Krishna lived in His childhood.

53
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:21,775
So in the material form, Athena itself lived –

54
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:28,608
in the material form, I’m not saying in the formation before –

55
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:33,275
in this area, to create the vibrations.

56
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:36,192
So it is not only She was a Goddess

57
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:39,150
but She lived in this area

58
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:42,566
to create the vibrations for the Nabhi,

59
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:50,150
to create the universal

60
00:07:51,108 --> 00:07:56,108
compassion and love and all Her qualities.

61
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:03,150
Now as you know, every aspect of the Goddess has different qualities

62
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:12,025
and as you can see that Mahakali has the aspect of comforting,

63
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:16,566
and Mahasaraswati is counselling,

64
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:22,192
and the Mahalakshmi has got

65
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:25,566
for the redemption, for the awakening.

66
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,816
But the Adi Shakti’s work

67
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:33,816
is to unite everything, to integrate everything;

68
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:39,275
and to integrate all those qualities,

69
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:44,566
the Adi Shakti Herself was…

70
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:49,192
in material form, came on this earth, in this part,

71
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:52,775
and that’s why they knew about Athena.

72
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,566
But as it is,

73
00:08:56,608 --> 00:08:58,816
I don’t know what are the stories they have–

74
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:01,816
they must be having some mythological stories about Athena

75
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:04,858
that She lived like this or whatever it was.

76
00:09:06,566 --> 00:09:07,900
And this is the…

77
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:10,150
where She created the Devaloka.

78
00:09:11,192 --> 00:09:15,566
Devaloka is the area where devas existed.

79
00:09:15,983 --> 00:09:18,566
Like She created Indra –

80
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:21,941
you have heard the name of Indra – then Varuna;

81
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:26,941
all these devalokas She created in this area, not in India.

82
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:30,566
Devaloka was created on this side,

83
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:35,775
and ganas and all these people were created

84
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:40,233
on the side of Nepal and all those places, on the left-hand side.

85
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:50,566
Now unfortunately after Socrates, who came here

86
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:56,983
in such a condition when people were really,

87
00:09:57,025 --> 00:10:00,816
absolutely ignorant, in the complete darkness of ignorance,

88
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:02,816
they could not understand Him,

89
00:10:02,858 --> 00:10:05,858
they could not understand Socrates at all

90
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:11,025
and so like any other Primordial Master was treated

91
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:15,025
by the people who were surrounding Him,

92
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:19,816
He was also very much ill-treated and nobody listened to Him.

93
00:10:19,816 --> 00:10:23,067
But of course, as you know, He was Primordial Master

94
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:27,566
and His wisdom is well-known and He created out of Him

95
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:33,150
disciples, but none of them could go anywhere near His wisdom,

96
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,566
and they started their own theories, own styles,

97
00:10:36,566 --> 00:10:39,566
and that’s how we find the accent from

98
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:43,566
philosophy that was Socrates’ aim,

99
00:10:43,983 --> 00:10:48,900
gradually came into political and then into economic side.

100
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,900
So the attention was moved from philosophy

101
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:55,941
to economics today,

102
00:10:55,941 --> 00:11:01,192
not towards the philosophy which was established by Socrates.

103
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:05,941
We can say Socrates was the one Primordial Master,

104
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:13,816
after Abraham and Moses, who really made it

105
00:11:13,858 --> 00:11:19,858
very clear-cut understanding about spirituality.

106
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:25,900
Of course Moses and Mohammad…

107
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:27,566
Abraham had different problems.

108
00:11:27,566 --> 00:11:32,649
Like Abraham had problems of talking to people

109
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:35,150
who were  really very, very ignorant,

110
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:39,983
and Moses had problem with people who were very indulgent people,

111
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:44,775
so He had to pass laws of Shariat.

112
00:11:44,816 --> 00:11:46,566
Moses passed the law of Shariat,

113
00:11:46,566 --> 00:11:49,275
and if you read Bible, in the –

114
00:11:49,566 --> 00:11:53,983
I think – in the first verse only it is written about Shariat

115
00:11:54,192 --> 00:12:01,983
in the Jeremiah (Leviticus?), third book of Bible,

116
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:06,733
that Moses had to pass these laws, different, different laws

117
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:10,858
to make the people follow religion precisely.

118
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:15,192
So He did not argue, He did not say

119
00:12:15,608 --> 00:12:18,941
why you should do it, didn’t give any explanation. “You do it!” Like that.

120
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:22,067
Because He thought that these people are so ignorant

121
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,691
that you cannot leave it to their freedom

122
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:32,233
that you understand this or

123
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:35,192
that you see the point;

124
00:12:35,566 --> 00:12:36,983
He could not do that way.

125
00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:41,192
So He just said, “Alright. These are the laws, these are the things

126
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:44,775
and you have to follow. If you don’t follow then you will be killed,

127
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:47,775
your hands will be cut, this will happen, that will happen.”

128
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:51,983
Because the people were of that type.

129
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:55,649
Now then you see how gradually,

130
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:59,649
at the time of Socrates people had evolved,

131
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:01,733
they were a much better people

132
00:13:01,858 --> 00:13:05,858
so He could talk to them about something

133
00:13:07,816 --> 00:13:12,816
of wisdom, of honesty, of righteousness, of peace.

134
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:14,816
Of so many things He talked,

135
00:13:14,816 --> 00:13:17,983
and He could talk because people were worthy of that.

136
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:22,566
Otherwise He could have said, “Alright.

137
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:24,566
You do this, you do that, you do that.”

138
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:30,192
But see the difference also in the circumstances how what has happened:

139
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,150
in the first circumstances when Abraham had problems

140
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:39,941
then the people were absolutely good-for-nothing,

141
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:44,108
absolutely good for nothing, so He didn’t know what to do with them.

142
00:13:44,608 --> 00:13:49,233
So only, you can see it, in the time of Abraham that His own lifestyle…

143
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:53,691
I mean, that was just a system when the family was building up

144
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:56,192
and the relationships were building up,

145
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:59,733
and He tried to work it on that level.

146
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:04,858
Then at the time of Moses people evolved much more.

147
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:09,566
They evolved but still very ignorant.

148
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,025
So they evolved to this point

149
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:15,941
that He did not have to talk the things that Abraham talked.

150
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:21,150
So He talked to them about getting out of Egypt,

151
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:24,900
taking their freedom, getting out from there

152
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:32,566
and going to a place of more tranquillity.

153
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:36,108
But when they did that,

154
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,150
He found these people on the way –

155
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,900
when He went to get the Ten Commandments,

156
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:45,941
when He came back – what He finds…

157
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:14,192
So the people who were at the time of Moses,

158
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:19,900
when He had gone to get the Ten Commandments,

159
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:24,983
started indulging into very, very immoral character,

160
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:27,983
extremely immoral character.

161
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:33,566
They were very immoral and were doing such horrible things that

162
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:36,900
that nobody can believe that anybody

163
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,733
who tried to escape from the Egyptians

164
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,941
were worse than the Egyptians themselves.

165
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:48,192
So He gave this Shariat to them, to change.

166
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:56,775
Now then came the time when people were…

167
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:03,566
I mean, despite all that people were not so good,

168
00:16:03,691 --> 00:16:05,691
we can say at the time of Christ,

169
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:09,025
but they were not so immoral;

170
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:12,192
they also could not understand Christ.

171
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:17,983
So you see, despite all the human evolution,

172
00:16:17,983 --> 00:16:20,566
the human awareness evolving,

173
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:26,775
the understanding about spirituality was very poor

174
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:30,233
and you could not talk to them.

175
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:35,983
Now you can also see the circumstances of things.

176
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:39,192
When the circumstances are such,

177
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,566
like at the time of, say Moses,

178
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:47,108
that people are extremely immoral,

179
00:16:47,108 --> 00:16:50,108
they are doing all kinds of bad things,

180
00:16:51,566 --> 00:16:56,025
they are not bothered about their own destruction,

181
00:16:57,691 --> 00:17:02,691
the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

182
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:06,566
because they were so left-sided:

183
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:10,775
So the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

184
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:14,566
and say that, “If you do like this,

185
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,566
this We’ll have to do” the violence part.

186
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:19,941
So they took to violence.

187
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:27,566
So the circumstances made the reactions of the people,

188
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:32,608
also the awareness of human beings.

189
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:35,733
So many things worked it out.

190
00:17:36,691 --> 00:17:40,691
Say, for example, when Athena came on this earth,

191
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:49,733
her job was to create a integrated force

192
00:17:53,067 --> 00:18:00,816
which will have the whole chaitanya spread like an integrated force.

193
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:09,150
So that when it will be all disintegrated later on it can integrate.

194
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:17,608
So the Greeks have a job, special job, is to integrate.

195
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:24,858
You have to integrate people

196
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:29,691
which are left-sided and right-sided.

197
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:35,566
And that’s what I asked him, “What happened to Hitler?”

198
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:38,566
So they said that when they saw Hitler,

199
00:18:38,566 --> 00:18:41,691
though Hitler respected them, they resisted Hitler.

200
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:50,566
You can see the significance, how he respected the Greeks

201
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:57,858
and despite that they resisted him

202
00:18:57,858 --> 00:19:00,858
because they were given this special capacity.

203
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:05,067
Something with Greeks, they went to…

204
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:08,067
I mean, except Alexander, only the one

205
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:13,900
who tried to invade India,

206
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:17,775
and because of the Greek nature he receded back.

207
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:21,233
You see it’s a Greek nature

208
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:24,941
that they can go so far and then not,

209
00:19:25,941 --> 00:19:28,941
because they have an integrating force.

210
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:33,192
The same thing as I was asking him about what happened with the Turks.

211
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:38,733
They had gone into Turkey but they receded back.

212
00:19:39,566 --> 00:19:43,025
So this power of receding back

213
00:19:43,858 --> 00:19:47,566
is the integrating power,

214
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:50,691
by you integrate within yourself

215
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:55,691
both the qualities of the left and right and you balance it,

216
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:58,067
and you see now that’s alright.

217
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:01,067
If you have to be in the centre

218
00:20:01,108 --> 00:20:04,108
we should go up to a point and come back.

219
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:09,983
And this is a very basic quality of Greeks in every respect.

220
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:12,566
If you take their shipping,

221
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:16,067
they were very aggressive in shipping to begin with,

222
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,275
extremely aggressive people,

223
00:20:18,566 --> 00:20:22,275
and Greek ships were known for not maintaining at all.

224
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:24,566
They were not very law-abiding

225
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:27,150
so they were never used to maintain their ships, you see,

226
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:32,025
and always under trouble – the Greeks –

227
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:37,691
that in the shipping they were known to be, the Greeks have

228
00:20:37,691 --> 00:20:42,733
ships which are all falling off and rattling.

229
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:48,067
So perhaps, perhaps,

230
00:20:48,566 --> 00:20:52,067
they were aware that now the shipping is going to go down,

231
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:55,275
so no use maintaining these ships, you see.

232
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:59,649
Then when the shipping went down –

233
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:03,150
you see this is on economic level I’m saying, how they worked it out

234
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:05,566
they sunk their ships

235
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:11,067
and got the money out of insurance.

236
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:21,566
That is a typical Greek style of behaviour

237
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:26,816
is that they know already. It’s a kind of a wisdom,

238
00:21:27,108 --> 00:21:29,608
they know that how far to go.

239
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:33,233
Like, we can see now, Onassis also married this mad woman,

240
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:36,691
Kennedy’s wife, because  he must have realised

241
00:21:36,691 --> 00:21:40,733
that Kennedy never gave her any security so he married her.

242
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:44,192
Alright. He married her up to a point,

243
00:21:44,566 --> 00:21:47,649
but most of his property went to his daughter,

244
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:49,649
not to Mrs. Kennedy.

245
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:57,150
This balance and this wisdom is a special Greek style of life;

246
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,858
that’s why you might say that they are not over-developed

247
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,775
like Americans are.

248
00:22:02,816 --> 00:22:05,983
But now Americans have realised that they are idiots,

249
00:22:06,108 --> 00:22:08,108
but Greeks can never become idiots,

250
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,150
whatever you may try.

251
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:14,192
They are very sharp and very intelligent

252
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:18,067
but they know how far to go with everything.

253
00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:22,108
And what is the reason for this? The Athena.

254
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:27,025
So Athena is the one, Adi Shakti,

255
00:22:27,025 --> 00:22:30,025
and She created Ganesha here.

256
00:22:30,858 --> 00:22:34,150
And the balance of the universe,

257
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,983
or all the dharmas, is in the Nabhi Chakra,

258
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:42,608
and so the people over here are very balanced.

259
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,775
You can find them very…

260
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,775
in their language, in their styles, very deep.

261
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:57,067
One may say because they are traditional people,

262
00:22:57,108 --> 00:22:59,108
they have long traditions.

263
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:02,566
But Egypt had also long traditions.

264
00:23:03,192 --> 00:23:06,067
Of course Egyptians are, in a way,

265
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:09,983
wiser than all other Islamic countries,

266
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:15,233
but not like Greeks, not like Greeks.

267
00:23:16,816 --> 00:23:19,816
We have Chinese also who are very wise,

268
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:26,566
and they are known to be people of deep understanding,

269
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:29,900
but they are not like Indians.

270
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:35,858
So what is lacking in all these people is

271
00:23:36,858 --> 00:23:40,858
the depth of awareness

272
00:23:41,775 --> 00:23:47,941
because, though in China also Mother of Mercy came

273
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:55,192
and She really bestowed blessings upon them,

274
00:23:56,192 --> 00:24:01,941
and China rose also, afterwards,

275
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:05,067
into her own glory

276
00:24:05,608 --> 00:24:11,108
and became quite a good industrial,

277
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:14,983
I mean developed country, we can say, very powerful;

278
00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:21,858
but still, that kind of regimentation could not be borne

279
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:24,608
because, after all, Mother Mercy was there.

280
00:24:25,108 --> 00:24:26,900
Do you know last…

281
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,858
you have one Mother Mercy you have given me –

282
00:24:29,858 --> 00:24:33,816
Kuan Yin, same thing, Kuan Yin.

283
00:24:33,858 --> 00:24:36,649
And She’s the same thing called as Mother of Mercy –

284
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:43,649
and the second one was given by Gregoire recently,

285
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,108
and you see what’s happening in China.

286
00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:51,983
So the effects of these

287
00:24:56,566 --> 00:25:01,150
Deities which existed in different countries at different times

288
00:25:01,858 --> 00:25:05,858
are felt only in Kali Yuga in the best way.

289
00:25:06,775 --> 00:25:08,733
Now you may say that,

290
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:12,775
“Why should Mother come last to Greece?”

291
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:19,608
Because now Athena is in the Sahastrara,

292
00:25:19,858 --> 00:25:23,025
so you have to go not in the Nabhi.

293
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:26,775
So I had to bring Sahastrara here, isn’t it?

294
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,941
Sahastrara is the last chakra one has to achieve,

295
00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:34,900
so I thought that let Greeks

296
00:25:36,025 --> 00:25:39,733
grow up to the Sahastrara point.

297
00:25:40,816 --> 00:25:44,192
So we have to establish Sahastrara in Greece

298
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:50,608
and thus it’s a very powerful work we have to do in Greece

299
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:57,775
because actually, at the time

300
00:25:57,816 --> 00:25:59,983
when Athena came here,

301
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:04,150
it was not Sahastrara, it was Nabhi,

302
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:10,150
because She was actually on the Himalayas, came from Himalayas.

303
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:13,192
So now to bring Himalaya here,

304
00:26:13,691 --> 00:26:18,566
or to bring that purity in Greece, is a tremendous task

305
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:22,192
and we have very few sahaja yogis.

306
00:26:22,858 --> 00:26:26,150
But you see the reaction of the gentleman who came?

307
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:33,566
And we have formidable job because of these Orthodox…

308
00:26:33,566 --> 00:26:35,775
most unorthodox,

309
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,233
they have no orthodoxy about anything.

310
00:26:42,858 --> 00:26:47,566
So we have a problem, big problem,

311
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,150
how we’ll establish here.

312
00:26:53,566 --> 00:26:57,816
The Devaloka was formed here

313
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:01,983
and devas were here; they ruled here, no doubt;

314
00:27:02,566 --> 00:27:06,983
but in the human awareness they're brought down to the human level.

315
00:27:07,983 --> 00:27:12,983
Like Zeus was Parashurama, Parashurama –

316
00:27:12,983 --> 00:27:20,067
the one who was an Incarnation to announce the advent of Shri Rama,

317
00:27:20,566 --> 00:27:27,733
and He came before Shri Ram, died also very much before Shri Ram;

318
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:34,900
but they painted Zeus as a man who was a womaniser.

319
00:27:37,566 --> 00:27:40,816
So all Gods were brought to the level of human beings,

320
00:27:41,067 --> 00:27:44,067
bestowed with all the weaknesses, you see,

321
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:48,108
actually decorated with all the weaknesses.

322
00:27:49,108 --> 00:27:52,649
And that is responsible for the downfall

323
00:27:52,691 --> 00:27:56,733
because this part of the country

324
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:03,900
is on the pattern of Devaloka,

325
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:12,067
reflection of that, but this Devaloka is now,

326
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:18,775
we see it has become just the opposite

327
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:26,941
because Deities have been brought down to such a low level,

328
00:28:26,983 --> 00:28:29,941
to such degrading things.

329
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:37,025
Even in the mythology also, in India

330
00:28:37,608 --> 00:28:43,108
talks about Them like this. Not to such an extent;

331
00:28:44,025 --> 00:28:49,775
like Zeus, they don’t talk but about Indra they talk.

332
00:28:50,566 --> 00:28:58,691
And like Indra’s description comes like this:

333
00:28:59,983 --> 00:29:06,941
that the king Hiranyakashipu’s wife was living…

334
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:12,608
his wife… Hiranyakashipu’s wife was a saintly lady

335
00:29:12,608 --> 00:29:17,900
and Hiranyakashipu was ruling in the area of

336
00:29:18,025 --> 00:29:23,067
you can say Kandahar and Afghanistan and all these places,

337
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:28,025
and from here Indra went down

338
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,067
and took away the wife.

339
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:37,067
I mean They incarnated, the Gods incarnated here,

340
00:29:38,108 --> 00:29:41,025
and Indra went down,

341
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:45,067
He took away the wife of Hiranyakashipu with Him, to save Her,

342
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:49,067
and He went down and stayed in an ashram in Maharashtra

343
00:29:50,566 --> 00:29:53,983
where there’s a river flowing with My name – Nira.

344
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,691
So now the… see how the combinations are,

345
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:06,067
the Shandilya Muni who was the guru of My family –

346
00:30:06,067 --> 00:30:09,067
that’s why My gotra is Shandilya –

347
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:13,608
it was in his ashram He stayed.

348
00:30:15,067 --> 00:30:18,275
So the Muni Shandilya told

349
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:22,566
that, “See, this lady is a very pure lady,

350
00:30:22,566 --> 00:30:28,067
don’t disturb her, and out of her will come a very great saint

351
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:35,608
who will, by his own devotion,

352
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:40,067
make the Incarnation of Narasimha –

353
00:30:40,691 --> 00:30:47,192
this is the god Vishnu which comes as the half-cat –

354
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:51,150
and He will kill this asura.

355
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:56,649
Now, part of the Egypt was also ruled by this Hiranyakashipu,

356
00:30:56,649 --> 00:31:00,649
part of the Egypt – see how significant everything is.

357
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:04,192
So this Narasimha came

358
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:10,067
when…  you know about Prahlada’s story, alright, so this

359
00:31:10,941 --> 00:31:13,941
little boy played there around and he made some

360
00:31:14,025 --> 00:31:19,025
things and there’s a temple very near – you have seen Narasimha’s temple

361
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:24,150
and that you have seen the statue made out of sand?

362
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:26,608
That was made by Prahlad,

363
00:31:26,733 --> 00:31:30,108
and he came into the dreams of someone and said that,

364
00:31:30,275 --> 00:31:33,608
“In your temple you please put the statue I have made”,

365
00:31:33,816 --> 00:31:37,566
and they went around the Nira river and found it and put it there.

366
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,775
So see the relationship, how it is.

367
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:46,025
Now this Hiranyakashipu was killed by Narasimha.

368
00:31:46,649 --> 00:31:54,067
Narasimha, as you know, is the Incarnation of Shri Vishnu,

369
00:31:54,775 --> 00:32:01,733
because he had, this Hiranyakashipu had, a blessing of Brahmadeva

370
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:08,192
that not any animal can kill him,

371
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,900
not any human being can kill him,

372
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,900
not on the land or in the sky,

373
00:32:15,649 --> 00:32:18,566
and not with any weapon –

374
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:21,566
all so many blessings he had taken!

375
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:24,275
He had closed all the lines, you see,

376
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:26,649
so that nobody should kill him,

377
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:33,108
but actually he did not know there are ways and matters.

378
00:32:34,192 --> 00:32:38,233
So Shri Vishnu took the form of Narasimha,

379
00:32:38,233 --> 00:32:42,233
is that He became the simha,

380
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:47,816
means the ‘lion’, and the lower portion of a man.

381
00:32:48,983 --> 00:32:54,233
And it so happened that Hiranyakashipu asked Prahlada,

382
00:32:54,649 --> 00:32:57,775
“Where is your God?” He said, “He’s everywhere.”

383
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:01,775
So he said, “Alright, is He in this pillar?”

384
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:04,900
He said, “Yes, He’s in this pillar also.”

385
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:08,691
So he hit the pillar – see, the pillar

386
00:33:08,816 --> 00:33:11,983
must have been the same style as you make, Greek style,

387
00:33:11,983 --> 00:33:13,983
pillar of stone,

388
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,150
so he knew that in the pillar how can anybody be, it’s a stone –

389
00:33:18,566 --> 00:33:24,025
he hit it and the pillar broke, out of which came out Narasimha

390
00:33:24,691 --> 00:33:27,025
with long hands and claws,

391
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,816
and He took that Hiranyakashipu

392
00:33:29,983 --> 00:33:35,233
and put him on His lap, because neither on the sky nor on the ground

393
00:33:35,816 --> 00:33:40,566
and with His claws, because they were not weapons,

394
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:42,941
He opened his stomach and killed him.

395
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:48,067
So, because he was also ruling in Egypt,

396
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:52,733
the people of Egypt made their…

397
00:33:52,775 --> 00:33:56,150
they were Assyrians – Assyrians are asuras,

398
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:00,150
they were the ones who were asuras,

399
00:34:00,816 --> 00:34:02,816
that’s why they were called Assyrians –

400
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:09,566
so they made the statue of their god Sphinx

401
00:34:09,983 --> 00:34:13,233
the other way round than Narasimha.

402
00:34:15,941 --> 00:34:21,192
So the upper part of the Sphinx is that of man,

403
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:28,233
and the lower part of that statue is that of lion.

404
00:34:29,816 --> 00:34:32,858
This is very ancient story I’m telling.

405
00:34:35,108 --> 00:34:40,983
So how the Greeks went to India long time back,

406
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:44,025
because all these devas were Greeks –

407
00:34:44,775 --> 00:34:47,733
and these devas were, like Indra,

408
00:34:47,733 --> 00:34:50,733
what He did, and Varuna and all these things.

409
00:34:51,983 --> 00:34:54,900
But I think there… because

410
00:34:54,941 --> 00:34:58,775
the whole idea got perverted, whole thing,

411
00:34:59,192 --> 00:35:05,192
they could not see the proper image of their...

412
00:35:06,775 --> 00:35:12,192
of their...faces in their meditation

413
00:35:12,733 --> 00:35:14,608
because they perverted them

414
00:35:14,608 --> 00:35:17,608
so they could not see, and they saw perverted faces.

415
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:21,775
They saw them nude and that kind of thing,

416
00:35:21,775 --> 00:35:24,566
which was all their own imagination

417
00:35:24,566 --> 00:35:28,691
working, because they were indulging into all kinds of immoral things

418
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:34,775
so they made it absolutely, what you call a ...

419
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:42,150
very immoral type of relationships and things among them.

420
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:44,816
So that was their own ideas and they put it.

421
00:35:44,858 --> 00:35:48,150
But also, as a result of that, they could never see

422
00:35:48,192 --> 00:35:53,233
the body or the faces of these devatas properly.

423
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:57,233
So they made them more like…

424
00:35:58,649 --> 00:36:01,941
I mean quite ugly-looking faces they made.

425
00:36:01,983 --> 00:36:04,858
Like I have some Poseidon they have made here

426
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:08,067
which they gave it to My husband also – it’s not at all

427
00:36:08,108 --> 00:36:10,566
like Varuna, I can tell you.

428
00:36:10,566 --> 00:36:13,733
So… and absolutely nude, you know; it’s so embarrassing.

429
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:16,233
They gave it to My husband and he didn’t know where to look,

430
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:21,733
and I just started laughing because he’s a very shy man, My husband.

431
00:36:22,566 --> 00:36:24,775
And he had to put it in his office, you see,

432
00:36:24,775 --> 00:36:27,900
hidden somewhere and it looks very funny.

433
00:36:28,816 --> 00:36:33,775
And he was saying, “Why not we use a kind of a...

434
00:36:37,566 --> 00:36:40,608
covering with some silver?” I said, “It’s an antique

435
00:36:40,608 --> 00:36:43,192
they have reproduced; you can’t do it to an antique.”

436
00:36:43,566 --> 00:36:44,900
He said, “Alright; where should I put it?”

437
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,691
I said, “Put it in some corridor there.”

438
00:36:50,566 --> 00:36:52,816
So with such expense they gave it

439
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:56,691
but My husband was quite upset about it, you see,

440
00:36:57,775 --> 00:37:00,691
and every time he sees this gentleman he says,

441
00:37:00,691 --> 00:37:07,275
“You know, this gentleman is no good.”

442
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:15,775
Alright. So then, this part of the history is there.

443
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:20,275
On that history stands the modern Greek.

444
00:37:21,608 --> 00:37:27,067
So, if you see from Socrates to Christ,

445
00:37:27,566 --> 00:37:29,941
people had evolved we think,

446
00:37:30,566 --> 00:37:33,566
but they also crucified Christ,

447
00:37:34,649 --> 00:37:36,649
so what was their evolution?

448
00:37:36,816 --> 00:37:43,691
Though, if you see what Christ preached and what…

449
00:37:44,025 --> 00:37:49,025
I’m sorry, what Christ preached and Socrates preached,

450
00:37:50,566 --> 00:37:52,150
there is much difference

451
00:37:52,941 --> 00:37:57,941
because Socrates talked in parables, not openly,

452
00:37:58,858 --> 00:38:02,775
while Socrates talked in a very open way,

453
00:38:02,775 --> 00:38:05,900
in an open discussion, in open understanding.

454
00:38:06,025 --> 00:38:09,983
That shows only that the people could understand what He was saying.

455
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,566
But still He was also killed;

456
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:17,941
Socrates also was given poison and He was also killed.

457
00:38:18,192 --> 00:38:22,608
So that shows that, at that time also, the people in charge,

458
00:38:22,816 --> 00:38:26,816
or at the helm of affairs, didn’t know what was reality.

459
00:38:27,775 --> 00:38:33,067
So now, from Christ to Socrates and from Socrates to Me,

460
00:38:33,649 --> 00:38:37,192
we can say this way that we are talking about it,

461
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:43,649
though Socrates came in the year – how much B.C. He was?

462
00:38:43,733 --> 00:38:48,067
Yogi: About 500 years before Christ

463
00:38:48,566 --> 00:38:49,691
500 before Christ;

464
00:38:49,983 --> 00:38:55,900
so might be that Christ must have felt that Socrates,

465
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:59,733
He talked so openly, so nicely to people

466
00:39:00,067 --> 00:39:03,025
as because He was Primordial Master.

467
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,900
He realised it, so He talked in parables.

468
00:39:09,649 --> 00:39:13,067
He thought that, “No use talking straight like Socrates”

469
00:39:13,566 --> 00:39:18,275
because… you see they are very straightforward people;

470
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:23,067
the Primordial Masters have to be very, very…

471
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:27,025
they are by nature extremely straightforward.

472
00:39:27,691 --> 00:39:31,941
Even today’s… those who were real gurus,

473
00:39:31,941 --> 00:39:35,941
they would not accept any person,

474
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:38,858
they would throw away, they would beat people.

475
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,025
Even musicians in India, those who are great masters,

476
00:39:43,067 --> 00:39:45,775
they would beat their disciples if they played something wrong;

477
00:39:45,775 --> 00:39:47,691
like very harsh people.

478
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:52,233
So it was alright for Socrates also to tell things very

479
00:39:52,233 --> 00:39:55,566
plain and simple and all that, but still He was killed.

480
00:39:55,566 --> 00:39:58,858
And then Christ, who was 500 years later came.

481
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:01,150
See, He saw the point

482
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:05,192
that no use talking – because He came at Agya –

483
00:40:05,733 --> 00:40:07,608
talking in that way.

484
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:10,775
If you tell somebody, “Don’t do like this”,

485
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,108
even reason it out like Socrates did,

486
00:40:13,566 --> 00:40:16,900
He is the master of logic, you can call Him;

487
00:40:17,067 --> 00:40:20,025
the whole logic system comes from Him,

488
00:40:20,858 --> 00:40:22,858
He’s a master of logic.

489
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:28,566
But despite that, it did not appeal to the logic of the people who were at the helm of affairs.

490
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:32,733
So they have no logic in their heads, you see, they are just rationalist.

491
00:40:32,858 --> 00:40:37,233
Rationality is blindness but there’s no logic.

492
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:41,566
So because there is no logic they killed Him.

493
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:44,983
And Christ understood that there is no logic

494
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:48,192
with these people so better talk to them in parables.

495
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,608
So He talked to them in parables,

496
00:40:52,566 --> 00:40:54,233
but still they killed Him.

497
00:40:55,192 --> 00:41:00,025
[ Helm! ] The authorities, they couldn’t bear, they thought

498
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:04,233
He’s becoming very powerful, or whatever it was. The Jews themselves

499
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:07,858
were very funny, and they did it.

500
00:41:09,816 --> 00:41:15,150
So in Sahaja Yoga, what I decided that at least

501
00:41:15,733 --> 00:41:19,108
I should give Realisation to people first,

502
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,275
and then I can talk to them whatever I like.

503
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:27,566
Now, I’m talking to you everything

504
00:41:27,608 --> 00:41:30,649
and you are understanding it because you are Realised souls,

505
00:41:30,649 --> 00:41:33,649
but I cannot talk this to an ordinary person.

506
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:38,733
So we have two types of people: one who are Sahaja Yogis,

507
00:41:39,067 --> 00:41:40,941
and one who are not.

508
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:45,025
Of course there are some Sahaja Yogis who are not very worthy of this,

509
00:41:45,108 --> 00:41:49,566
I agree, and they may just go back or something,

510
00:41:49,691 --> 00:41:55,900
but you can become worthy of understanding all this knowledge

511
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,900
because your Kundalini can make you so capable

512
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,900
and your Sahastrara so good that you can absorb what I’m saying,

513
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:07,566
and can logically see what I’m saying is true,

514
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:12,108
and you can also verify it, whether it is true or not.

515
00:42:12,566 --> 00:42:16,983
So this stage of yours, I think, is the highest stage of awareness

516
00:42:17,025 --> 00:42:20,067
where collectively you are understanding Me.

517
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:23,150
The situation is not so bad as that was

518
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:25,983
even at the time of Christ.

519
00:42:25,983 --> 00:42:28,108
Before that, at Socrates’ time, I think,

520
00:42:28,108 --> 00:42:31,108
He was the only wise man going around.

521
00:42:31,566 --> 00:42:34,067
There was nobody else, seems to Me, had any wisdom.

522
00:42:34,067 --> 00:42:37,108
Even His disciples, you see, like Plato –

523
00:42:37,108 --> 00:42:41,067
he went off his head, then Aristotle went off his head.

524
00:42:41,649 --> 00:42:44,775
Both of them, really,

525
00:42:45,108 --> 00:42:48,691
tried to have their own arbitrary additions

526
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,858
which were all absolutely.

527
00:42:50,941 --> 00:42:53,858
But He talked absolutely…

528
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:58,067
Socrates talked absolutely about gods and everything,

529
00:42:58,192 --> 00:43:00,192
and talked so openly.

530
00:43:00,775 --> 00:43:03,983
Then, in the same way, we can say,

531
00:43:04,192 --> 00:43:07,150
the Primordial Master state is that

532
00:43:07,608 --> 00:43:10,983
we have Mohammad Sahib. He was also killed;

533
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:16,025
He was also killed because He told the truth.

534
00:43:16,566 --> 00:43:20,150
Then came Nanaka;

535
00:43:20,566 --> 00:43:23,566
He was not killed but nobody bothered about Him,

536
00:43:23,983 --> 00:43:27,858
and the people who really follow Him are just

537
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:30,983
in the opposite direction.

538
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,566
Supposing He was saying, “Come this way”;

539
00:43:33,566 --> 00:43:36,733
so they are going in that way.

540
00:43:36,775 --> 00:43:40,691
You find even same thing with Christ;

541
00:43:40,691 --> 00:43:45,025
if Christ said, “Come this way” the Christians are going that way.

542
00:43:45,733 --> 00:43:48,691
Every religion is just the same.

543
00:43:48,691 --> 00:43:51,566
Same with Krishna’s Gita.

544
00:43:51,691 --> 00:43:55,108
Those who preach Gita are just…

545
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,775
if Krishna is standing here and saying,

546
00:43:57,816 --> 00:44:00,649
“Come this way” Gita is saying, they are preaching Gita

547
00:44:00,649 --> 00:44:03,108
going down, taking people down.

548
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:06,108
So it is common with all religions

549
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:11,858
that they have always used the name of prophets

550
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:19,067
and of all the Incarnations just to make money

551
00:44:19,067 --> 00:44:26,067
and to take everybody to hell; straightforward march to hell you see.

552
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:29,566
So, now those who are alert about it,

553
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:33,608
and those who have seen that this is all nonsense are in Sahaja Yoga

554
00:44:35,233 --> 00:44:37,233
and sahaja yogis can’t do that

555
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:41,233
because they have come quite a long way now on this side,

556
00:44:41,816 --> 00:44:45,816
so they are going to pull out many others to that side

557
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,775
instead of going themselves down.

558
00:44:49,816 --> 00:44:55,649
So this is the situation today, and that’s why I say Greece

559
00:44:55,816 --> 00:44:59,649
is a very wonderful area where we can work it out.

560
00:44:59,649 --> 00:45:02,275
If Athena could be awakened here,

561
00:45:02,608 --> 00:45:06,566
this place could be of very great help to us.

562
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:12,775
Now there are very balanced Greek people,

563
00:45:12,775 --> 00:45:17,566
they have great sense of art because of Right-side Swadhishthana;

564
00:45:17,566 --> 00:45:23,150
also they have lots of qualities of

565
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:29,691
understanding the worthlessness of

566
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:36,649
too much indulgences and all that. It is so.

567
00:45:36,816 --> 00:45:39,025
But the immorality grew,

568
00:45:39,025 --> 00:45:42,649
now, because they started copying Westerners;

569
00:45:42,816 --> 00:45:46,067
otherwise the women here were very moral women.

570
00:45:46,608 --> 00:45:50,733
This is only in these twenty years this change has come.

571
00:45:51,067 --> 00:45:54,608
Before that the women were very moral,

572
00:45:54,608 --> 00:45:57,067
very good women lived here,

573
00:45:57,566 --> 00:46:01,983
and some of them are now in India as I told you, they came with Alexander,

574
00:46:02,566 --> 00:46:06,566
and they were very good husbands and wives and very good families.

575
00:46:06,608 --> 00:46:08,941
This is only – I don’t know why – about twenty years

576
00:46:08,941 --> 00:46:11,566
or twenty-five years at the most, you can say,

577
00:46:11,566 --> 00:46:14,566
the Kali Yuga is showing its effects here also,

578
00:46:14,566 --> 00:46:18,192
but it’s a very solid country and still they respect,

579
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:22,608
respect a woman who has character; respect her.

580
00:46:23,067 --> 00:46:25,983
They may use a woman who has no character

581
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:28,192
but they respect the woman who has character

582
00:46:28,192 --> 00:46:30,566
and also respect the mother.

583
00:46:30,691 --> 00:46:33,983
So there are lots of qualities in this country

584
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:37,649
which are still existing,

585
00:46:37,816 --> 00:46:42,192
in some places lingering, and some places effective.

586
00:46:42,608 --> 00:46:46,608
So the job of Sahaja Yogis is to, somehow or other,

587
00:46:46,733 --> 00:46:52,900
evoke that integrating force in them of the Athena,

588
00:46:52,941 --> 00:46:56,233
and I’m sure you can purify this country.

589
00:46:56,775 --> 00:46:58,816
May God bless you!

590
00:47:15,858 --> 00:47:18,941
Alexander was two hundred before Christ…

591
00:47:18,941 --> 00:47:21,858
a hundred, two hundred before Christ.

592
00:47:34,816 --> 00:47:38,816
He was very much respected in India, always,

593
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:42,649
Alexander was very much respected in India,

594
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,900
and because he went away

595
00:47:46,608 --> 00:47:49,608
and he didn’t take away anything from India.

596
00:47:50,816 --> 00:47:55,067
Like any other invaders who came, who just looted us, he did not.

597
00:47:56,108 --> 00:47:58,275
I think he got quite detached

598
00:47:58,733 --> 00:48:01,941
after coming to India. Anybody who has

599
00:48:01,941 --> 00:48:06,108
come to invade India, and has really gained something

600
00:48:06,108 --> 00:48:09,233
out of the spirituality of India, was Alexander;

601
00:48:09,566 --> 00:48:12,566
otherwise the English lived for three hundred in India,

602
00:48:12,566 --> 00:48:13,733
three hundred years.

603
00:48:13,733 --> 00:48:16,691
Nothing went into their heads, nothing.

604
00:48:17,566 --> 00:48:20,566
Three hundred years! Can you believe it?

605
00:48:20,941 --> 00:48:24,608
They used to laugh at everything, they used to make fun of everything,

606
00:48:24,816 --> 00:48:26,816
nothing went into their heads.

607
00:48:28,733 --> 00:48:32,275
But so many Greeks stayed on because they liked India very much,

608
00:48:32,649 --> 00:48:35,192
so they stayed back, they wouldn’t come back.

609
00:48:35,192 --> 00:48:39,192
So many are there even now living in the forests.

610
00:48:40,608 --> 00:48:45,067
So, this is something, is the sensitivity, the awareness,

611
00:48:45,067 --> 00:48:48,566
which has grown through times in the Greek people.

612
00:48:48,775 --> 00:48:51,983
You can see in the character of Alexander, how he was.

613
00:48:51,983 --> 00:48:55,691
There’s a poet in India called Chandav Rai,

614
00:48:55,983 --> 00:48:59,566
who was at the time of Alexander.

615
00:48:59,775 --> 00:49:04,275
Alexander brought him here, honoured him, kept him here,

616
00:49:04,649 --> 00:49:07,775
he was here, and he wrote poems about Alexander,

617
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,941
about his greatness and things, praised him so well.

618
00:49:11,608 --> 00:49:16,192
I mean I can’t think of English people carrying any Indian as a poet

619
00:49:16,566 --> 00:49:17,733
to England;

620
00:49:19,816 --> 00:49:21,733
there’s no question. I mean, they didn’t…

621
00:49:21,733 --> 00:49:24,733
and the sign of awareness is this, that

622
00:49:24,733 --> 00:49:28,067
you don’t respect anybody else, you say, “Oh, I am the greatest”.

623
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:32,900
Then you cannot see the goodness of other people.

624
00:49:33,608 --> 00:49:37,691
Same with Portuguese. Of course, Vasco de Gama was a simple man

625
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:41,025
and when he came first to India, he saw Indians

626
00:49:41,025 --> 00:49:44,816
and he went to Goa and he saw the temple of the Goddess

627
00:49:44,858 --> 00:49:46,566
there, is the Shanta Durga’s,

628
00:49:46,649 --> 00:49:48,608
so he went back and told his king that,

629
00:49:48,608 --> 00:49:51,733
“They are all Christians because they follow the Mother.

630
00:49:51,733 --> 00:49:53,649
They are not Muslims”.

631
00:49:56,025 --> 00:49:57,608
So simple he was.

632
00:49:57,608 --> 00:50:00,816
“There’s no need to make them Christians.

633
00:50:00,816 --> 00:50:03,733
They are already Christians because they follow Mother”.

634
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:05,608
He was a nice man.

635
00:50:05,608 --> 00:50:08,733
But Portuguese also never learned anything much,

636
00:50:08,733 --> 00:50:11,150
but still certain respect they showed, like

637
00:50:11,566 --> 00:50:13,941
the name of Bombay is Mumbai.

638
00:50:14,816 --> 00:50:16,649
They still call it Mumbai.

639
00:50:16,941 --> 00:50:18,691
many words Mumbai

640
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:22,941
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi, Mumbai  is the name.

641
00:50:23,067 --> 00:50:25,733
Means she is the Mother of Mumba.

642
00:50:25,858 --> 00:50:27,233
Like ‘ayi’ is the Mother,

643
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,691
so they call it Mumbai –

644
00:50:29,941 --> 00:50:31,941
is the name of the Goddess.

645
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:34,150
So they didn’t want to change it.

646
00:50:34,649 --> 00:50:37,691
And in Portugal, when I went, they were saying “Mumbai”.

647
00:50:37,858 --> 00:50:39,816
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi is the name.

648
00:50:39,858 --> 00:50:42,067
“After all, it’s the name of the Goddess; isn’t it?”

649
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:43,649
I said, “It is.”

650
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:47,566
But the English came, called it “Bombay”- finished.

651
00:50:50,941 --> 00:50:54,067
So you see the… see the awareness,

652
00:50:54,067 --> 00:50:56,733
you can see the awareness of people

653
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:02,108
because they were so aware about the serenity,

654
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:05,733
about the holiness, about the auspiciousness and all that,

655
00:51:05,858 --> 00:51:07,608
so they said, “How can we call it Bombay

656
00:51:07,608 --> 00:51:10,150
because it is the name of the Goddess?”

657
00:51:10,941 --> 00:51:14,192
Just think- the depth, no? “We cannot call.”

658
00:51:14,608 --> 00:51:16,858
But the English could have gone and found out

659
00:51:16,858 --> 00:51:20,733
what is this place called, why is it called Mumbai.

660
00:51:20,816 --> 00:51:22,025
But they did not.

661
00:51:22,025 --> 00:51:25,025
But even if they had found, I don’t think they would have

662
00:51:25,067 --> 00:51:27,733
kept it as Mumbai. They would not have

663
00:51:28,233 --> 00:51:31,233
because, you see, that respect

664
00:51:31,775 --> 00:51:34,108
for serenity and all these things,

665
00:51:34,566 --> 00:51:38,900
somehow or other, in these people who ruled us, it was not there.

666
00:51:38,983 --> 00:51:42,858
Now the children of Britain

667
00:51:43,067 --> 00:51:46,608
are better, are very different, very different.

668
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:50,233
But those who ruled us had no respect at all.

669
00:51:51,649 --> 00:51:57,775
They would only go to church, and nothing, no respect.

670
00:51:58,775 --> 00:52:02,775
While the Greeks had always respect for Indians,

671
00:52:03,566 --> 00:52:04,941
they came with respect.

672
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:12,108
Now, the respect, also, is a kind of an awareness within us.

673
00:52:13,067 --> 00:52:15,067
And now, as the time has passed,

674
00:52:15,067 --> 00:52:17,649
I find Britishers have respect for others,

675
00:52:18,025 --> 00:52:21,233
they’re respecting, many.

676
00:52:21,233 --> 00:52:24,691
I mean, I would not say all, but quite a lot, isn’t it.

677
00:52:24,691 --> 00:52:28,649
Well, what do you say? He has not met any.

678
00:52:33,941 --> 00:52:37,941
Yes, that’s the part lacking- respect.

679
00:52:38,275 --> 00:52:40,775
That is the part lacking in England.

680
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,233
And imagine in the heart, if there is no respect,

681
00:52:44,608 --> 00:52:46,941
then what sort of a heart it must be?

682
00:52:47,775 --> 00:52:50,775
The whole world can get ruined by that heart.

683
00:52:53,983 --> 00:53:01,150
So that’s the thing – one has to create respect:

684
00:53:01,691 --> 00:53:07,733
respecting others, respecting their culture,

685
00:53:07,733 --> 00:53:11,858
respecting their lifestyle.

686
00:53:12,108 --> 00:53:17,608
But, I mean whatever you may say, but theoretically it is there;

687
00:53:17,941 --> 00:53:21,566
may not be in practice. Theoretically it is working,

688
00:53:21,941 --> 00:53:24,775
because you’re not supposed to insult anybody

689
00:53:24,941 --> 00:53:28,150
who is from the ethnic group and all that is there legally,

690
00:53:28,649 --> 00:53:31,192
theoretically; but in practice it is not,

691
00:53:31,192 --> 00:53:34,192
I agree; but theoretically it is working.

692
00:53:34,858 --> 00:53:39,691
You can’t insult somebody because he’s a black man or he’s

693
00:53:39,858 --> 00:53:43,275
an ethnic group, you cannot, under law, you cannot do it.

694
00:53:43,608 --> 00:53:46,691
So that is there but just theory.

695
00:53:46,858 --> 00:53:50,608
But still, awareness-wise also, people are aware.

696
00:53:50,775 --> 00:53:56,192
I know of so many of them who were sitting in the sun

697
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:59,566
and fasting for South Africa.

698
00:54:00,983 --> 00:54:03,275
So between the South African awareness

699
00:54:03,649 --> 00:54:06,983
and British awareness, we must say, we should be proud

700
00:54:07,108 --> 00:54:11,108
that in British awareness there is lot of sense,

701
00:54:12,067 --> 00:54:16,900
and that sense, once it comes to the point of respecting others,

702
00:54:17,025 --> 00:54:20,025
I think it can transform the whole world.

703
00:54:20,608 --> 00:54:24,067
But I don’t know how I have to do it, I’ve tried.

704
00:54:24,941 --> 00:54:26,983
It has to be respect.

705
00:54:31,816 --> 00:54:33,941
It is not insulting now,

706
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:37,608
but it is not positive respect.

707
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:41,691
So one has to learn how to positively respect;

708
00:54:41,691 --> 00:54:45,275
at least Sahaja Yogis must be positively respected.

709
00:54:45,275 --> 00:54:48,192
This is what I have been talking about,

710
00:54:48,608 --> 00:54:51,983
about Buddha, about truth, about respect.

711
00:54:52,816 --> 00:54:56,941
But once you know that they are Sahaja Yogis, one has to respect.

712
00:54:57,275 --> 00:54:59,691
And this one has to learn from the Greeks

713
00:54:59,691 --> 00:55:02,691
because still they have a sense of respect.

714
00:55:05,649 --> 00:55:09,649
They know how to respect, isn’t it?

715
00:55:10,858 --> 00:55:15,025
That part is there, that one has to learn.

716
00:55:15,025 --> 00:55:19,025
Even the Egyptians are, and also the Chinese,

717
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:26,108
because out of all these years of traditional growth,

718
00:55:26,733 --> 00:55:29,941
they have realised one thing: that if you have to really

719
00:55:29,941 --> 00:55:33,900
exist in this world you have to learn how to respect others.

720
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,275
And respect is something from your heart.

721
00:55:41,858 --> 00:55:45,691
Like the Japanese have no respect for anyone

722
00:55:45,816 --> 00:55:48,108
but they’ll go and bow ten times,

723
00:55:49,067 --> 00:55:52,858
don’t know when to stop if they bow, and if you bow they’ll go on,

724
00:55:52,858 --> 00:55:56,025
permanently, so it’s best if you stop.

725
00:55:56,025 --> 00:55:59,275
But it’s artificial; it’s not real.

726
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:06,108
So it should come from your innate being to respect others,

727
00:56:06,941 --> 00:56:09,983
and when that works out then

728
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:13,691
your awareness has definitely reached a very high state,

729
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:18,816
high state of understanding of Divinity.

730
00:56:19,067 --> 00:56:24,067
So then you come to a point of respecting the Adi Shakti

731
00:56:24,691 --> 00:56:28,691
and then, when you have respect, it’s not artificial respect,

732
00:56:29,067 --> 00:56:32,233
it’s not artificial, it should be from your heart.

733
00:56:32,233 --> 00:56:36,233
And once you start doing that your awareness will improve.

734
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,150
And that it’s not what you get,

735
00:56:39,566 --> 00:56:41,733
it’s not what you have,

736
00:56:41,858 --> 00:56:46,858
but what you give to yourself by respecting.

737
00:56:49,941 --> 00:56:53,983
And this respect in which transform you completely, I can tell you,

738
00:56:54,067 --> 00:56:56,192
because there’s a big understanding

739
00:56:56,192 --> 00:56:58,275
now between you and the Divine,

740
00:56:58,608 --> 00:57:01,067
and I’m sure everything will work out very well.

741
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:05,150
The way the Deities respect the Adi Shakti, if you also

742
00:57:06,233 --> 00:57:10,608
learn that respect, then things will work out.

743
00:57:10,649 --> 00:57:12,775
And I think Greeks will lead us very well,

744
00:57:12,816 --> 00:57:16,275
the whole of Europe, in this respect; I’m sure about it.

745
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,025
May God bless you!
