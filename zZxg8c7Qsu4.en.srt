1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:07,800
We are living in these modern times

2
00:00:07,865 --> 00:00:10,785
which are very eventful

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:22,113
In last 50 or 60 years so many things have happened

4
00:00:27,286 --> 00:00:35,326
and the churning should bring forth many truths before us

5
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:52,912
First we have to realize that man has separated from each other.

6
00:00:59,547 --> 00:01:02,667
The relationships that existed once upon a time

7
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:06,549
are no more to be found today.

8
00:01:12,993 --> 00:01:20,553
And on the collective level we are waiting for a shock.

9
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:30,939
God knows what sort of a disaster is going to fall upon us.

10
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:41,735
Loudly. God knows what sort of a disaster is going to fall.

11
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,520
You can come here, better.

12
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,500
And in these uncertain times only

13
00:01:59,949 --> 00:02:06,069
we have to realize that there must some way out.

14
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:21,479
The way we understand through our mental projections,

15
00:02:27,573 --> 00:02:31,653
the solution is not in the view.

16
00:02:35,554 --> 00:02:41,914
The solution that we think is the solution becomes a bondage, a system.

17
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:54,486
We try to break one system and build up another one

18
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:58,415
and that's how we find ourselves

19
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,520
miserably caught up into these systems.

20
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:17,034
So there has gone something wrong in our understanding of the problem.

21
00:03:21,215 --> 00:03:24,255
We have to little bit stand back

22
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,425
and see what mistake we must have committed.

23
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:40,935
Once upon a time I came to Belgium on a ship,

24
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,120
it was a very thriving shipping company.

25
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,760
All that is showing us

26
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:03,240
that even our economic enterprises come to a halt.

27
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:23,966
Now other enterprises on the emotional basis

28
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:35,248
or on the physical basis are giving us a feeling of confusion.

29
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,560
Like today only a gentleman told me

30
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,476
that allopathic medicines are rather dangerous.

31
00:04:56,527 --> 00:04:59,647
So I said: "What is the solution you have for it?"

32
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,640
The reason the cement is very dangerous

33
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,840
because it retains lot of moisture.

34
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,620
Then he said that the plastic is very dangerous ...

35
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:29,415
Ultimately it looked as if everything that we eat or live into

36
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,360
seems to be a dangerous spot.

37
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:48,165
Now we should understand that the progress that we have made so far

38
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,282
is recoiling back upon ourselves.

39
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,150
As if the progress was linear.

40
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:10,561
I went to Houston 10 years back nobody would look at you.

41
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,800
Nobody would look at you, there were so rich you see.

42
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,080
Dynasty and all that, in Houston.

43
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:29,842
And today they told me if anybody is willing to pay even the amount

44
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:34,200
we have to pay to the bank we are willing to sell our houses.

45
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:50,060
This ask for oil, oil, oil, oil, now they don't want oil.

46
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,880
Then in the science we discovered atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb,

47
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,880
all kinds of things.

48
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:14,487
Then we have discovered our computers.

49
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:22,297
And now we are worried that this computer will take over us.

50
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:31,594
Everything is getting out of control.

51
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,080
Where does the control lie?

52
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:47,687
We talk of peace but how will you establish it?

53
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:52,851
There is a control within us.

54
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:00,183
We can control everything.

55
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,420
First we have to be in control with ourselves.

56
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:14,026
First we have to know ourselves.

57
00:08:16,294 --> 00:08:21,494
And this feeling is very fashionable I should say.

58
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,144
So many people are seeking the truth.

59
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:37,328
Is a special quality of human beings who are seekers.

60
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:48,205
And when they try to seek the idea goes to the market as usual.

61
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:53,402
It goes to the market, the idea.

62
00:08:56,043 --> 00:09:02,483
So the demand is there for somebody to guide you in your seeking.

63
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:11,767
So you have people who provide a kind of a market.

64
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:18,767
You get so many money spinning gurus,

65
00:09:21,776 --> 00:09:30,056
they talk to you about peace and happiness and emancipation.

66
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,954
But you have to pay.

67
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,920
Today somebody told me in the car that the people who

68
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,760
were telephoning asked how much do we have to pay.

69
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:57,946
How much did you pay to Christ?

70
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:05,220
How much are you going to pay for the love of God?

71
00:10:07,646 --> 00:10:12,886
Is nothing human that you can purchase it.

72
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:19,295
The seekers if they realize one little point

73
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,040
that you cannot pay for it, for your evolution you cannot pay.

74
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,360
That's one point, if you realize, half of the work is done.

75
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:46,175
The second point is that it is your evolution

76
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,800
which is a living force, of living divine.

77
00:10:58,135 --> 00:11:03,055
This living force which has made you from amoeba stage

78
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,960
to human being is going to make you something higher.

79
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:18,735
The living force that has created these beautiful flowers,

80
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,560
how much did these flowers pay to that?

81
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:33,328
How much did they pay for it? Or how much did they exert for it?

82
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:40,485
So this evolution has to be spontaneous.

83
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:46,483
Effortless.

84
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:50,844
And that is what is Sahaja.

85
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,320
'Saha' means 'with' and 'ja' means 'born with you'.

86
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:07,051
It is born with you, the power.

87
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:13,376
And 'yoga' means 'the union with the divine'.

88
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:22,375
So every human being has a right to get to that state

89
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,160
where you become one with the divine.

90
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:39,246
We have heard about the all-pervading divine power.

91
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:48,895
Right from Lao Tse to Christ to Buddha,

92
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,760
all of them have talked about it.

93
00:12:57,301 --> 00:13:01,301
We did not know about the ether before.

94
00:13:06,497 --> 00:13:12,057
But we have heard about the Divine power, which is all-pervading.

95
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:23,360
Once you are united with it, connected with it,

96
00:13:24,478 --> 00:13:32,478
then only you realize that you are a part and parcel of the whole.

97
00:13:39,895 --> 00:13:45,175
But before that it's only talk, talk of religion,

98
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,080
talk about all philosophies, it's just a talk.

99
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:00,660
Without any experience of this Divine power,

100
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:06,455
if we are going to believe into these talks and these dogmas

101
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,680
also these mental projections

102
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,760
we reach a state where we will say we don't believe in it.

103
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:29,563
But this is not the way to know the Divine.

104
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,720
In the Bible it is said that, "I will appear before you

105
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,720
like tongues of flames."

106
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:48,975
In the Koran it is said that at the time of resurrection

107
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:51,224
your hands will speak.

108
00:14:56,375 --> 00:15:01,615
You'll be surprised in the Koran, more chapters are dedicated

109
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,240
to the resurrection time than to the doomsday.

110
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:21,037
They talk of the doomsday because that is how you frighten people.

111
00:15:25,418 --> 00:15:28,538
So this resurrection has to come first.

112
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:37,775
Of course in all the Indian scriptures it is described

113
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:44,215
that the only way to be in charge,

114
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,960
to be in control yourself is through Self-realization.

115
00:15:57,406 --> 00:16:00,166
We do not know ourselves.

116
00:16:02,452 --> 00:16:07,212
People get cancer, they don't know they have cancer.

117
00:16:11,508 --> 00:16:16,308
People get mad, schizophrenic, they don't know they are mad.

118
00:16:21,135 --> 00:16:23,775
They don't know because they don't know their body,

119
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,520
they don't know themselves.

120
00:16:30,138 --> 00:16:34,258
So to find out about ourselves we have to go inside.

121
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,370
By going outside you cannot find out.

122
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:47,338
How do you go inside?

123
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,970
You are all paying attention to me.

124
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,240
But if I say please pay attention to yourself, you'll say, "How?".

125
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,364
You cannot take your attention inside.

126
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:11,575
But you must know: the One who has made us

127
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,880
has put all that in image within us.

128
00:17:18,975 --> 00:17:21,575
As the one who has made this instrument

129
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,040
has also left the connection there.

130
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:31,974
So it has just to be plugged to the mains, that's all.

131
00:17:34,915 --> 00:17:37,195
Then it works, fantastically.

132
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:42,095
Only we are not connected to mains, that's all.

133
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,880
There's nothing else to be done.

134
00:17:48,895 --> 00:17:51,455
Once you are connected to the mains

135
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:55,615
you'll get all your physical benefits,

136
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,171
mental benefits, emotional benefits and spiritual benefits.

137
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:12,650
I'll tell you about the spiritual.

138
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:23,273
The spiritual benefit is that you get awakened to a new awareness.

139
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:32,679
That on your central nervous system

140
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,981
you can feel the collective consciousness.

141
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:51,873
That you can feel yourself and you can feel others within yourself.

142
00:18:57,696 --> 00:19:01,149
We have a force within us

143
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,024
which is the power of pure desire.

144
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:11,880
Is not an impure desire.

145
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:20,295
As you know in economics it is said that the power, the

146
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,255
satisfaction out of anything passes on from one to another.

147
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,624
Like I want to buy a house then I want to buy a car

148
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:32,719
then I want to buy that, I am never satisfied.

149
00:19:32,744 --> 00:19:35,514
So in general it is never satiable.

150
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:54,055
But the pure desire within us is the desire to be one with the divine

151
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,239
so that we get into the eternal life.

152
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,632
This desire has to be awakened.

153
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:17,311
Once it is awakened in this human awareness

154
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:21,696
you can feel on your central nervous system

155
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,251
these centers that are within your body

156
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:38,490
which are subtle centers

157
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:48,971
and when they are in any way in trouble you get all these problems.

158
00:20:55,144 --> 00:20:59,701
You can feel them on your fingertips.

159
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:06,615
It's something in English, to feel something on your fingertips,

160
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,269
means it is very easy.

161
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:16,575
So you feel it on your fingertips,

162
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,920
your own centers which are in trouble.

163
00:21:24,387 --> 00:21:29,600
And you feel the centers of another person.

164
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:38,895
Then if you know how to correct them

165
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,641
in a very simple way, maybe just rubbing.

166
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,700
And which are these centers.

167
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:58,010
You can correct everything that is physical, mental and emotional.

168
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,920
That's how you come in control of yourself, you control yourself.

169
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:18,920
We are at a stage which I can describe you with an analogy.

170
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:31,107
Like in the car you have got a brake and an accelerator.

171
00:22:34,575 --> 00:22:38,695
In that way in our body also there are two nadis, two systems,

172
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,393
two channels, left and right which act

173
00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:45,880
as the brake and the accelerator.

174
00:22:52,306 --> 00:22:56,506
In the autonomous nervous system the left and the right sympathetic.

175
00:23:00,894 --> 00:23:05,039
The central part is for our evolution.

176
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:15,135
So once we learn how to use the accelerator and also the brake

177
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,465
we become a driver. That means we come in the center.

178
00:23:29,182 --> 00:23:33,815
That means we become evolved enough to be

179
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,160
automatically driving the car.

180
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:46,187
But then there is the master sitting behind.

181
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,760
Second stage you become the master.

182
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,255
And you see the driver in you and

183
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:06,008
you see the brake and the accelerator.

184
00:24:11,286 --> 00:24:13,790
And you are in charge.

185
00:24:16,314 --> 00:24:24,314
In the same way today I hope today many of you will become in charge.

186
00:24:30,221 --> 00:24:35,519
It is a very simple spontaneous matter.

187
00:24:40,135 --> 00:24:42,975
Like I would say if you have to put lights,

188
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,055
so beautiful, so many beautiful lights

189
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,480
you have to just put on one switch and then everything gets light.

190
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:57,656
But behind that is a big history.

191
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:04,496
Behind that there is a big organization.

192
00:25:06,615 --> 00:25:08,935
I need not explain all that to you.

193
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,239
It's better to put on the light first.

194
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,838
And it has worked.

195
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,020
Yesterday it worked and I am sure today it must work.

196
00:25:33,246 --> 00:25:39,591
And this has to take place in a very smooth manner.

197
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:49,495
There are people who have read some books on Kundalini, I believe.

198
00:25:54,374 --> 00:25:57,639
First when I read them I was shocked.

199
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:06,637
They are really absolutely against what is Kundalini awakening.

200
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:14,919
They say it creates heat within you.

201
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,853
They say that it burns you.

202
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,400
Just the opposite.

203
00:26:25,095 --> 00:26:29,295
The reason is those who are trying the Kundalini awakening

204
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,080
are not authorized people.

205
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:41,495
The one who doesn't understand about electricity

206
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,720
and puts his hands in the plug will get a shock.

207
00:26:50,726 --> 00:26:52,646
You have to be authorized.

208
00:26:54,954 --> 00:26:57,627
These people have no authority.

209
00:26:59,845 --> 00:27:02,001
It has to be a divine authority.

210
00:27:04,196 --> 00:27:06,135
A person who leads a life

211
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,780
of taking money from others in the name of God

212
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,915
is not a pure person at all.

213
00:27:17,883 --> 00:27:20,723
And moreover he has no self-respect.

214
00:27:23,495 --> 00:27:25,824
Or we can say he's a cheat.

215
00:27:28,257 --> 00:27:31,697
Such a horrid person, how can he raise the Kundalini?

216
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,455
That's the purest form of energy,

217
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,130
for that a person has to be a pure person.

218
00:27:46,263 --> 00:27:51,992
He talks to you about God and accumulates Rolls Royces.

219
00:27:54,385 --> 00:27:56,000
It's nonsense.

220
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,455
But what happens to people I don't understand.

221
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,920
That they accept such situations and such people as their leaders,

222
00:28:03,945 --> 00:28:06,197
who are cheats, who are fake.

223
00:28:13,251 --> 00:28:18,571
It's very agonizing, to see the way people accept them.

224
00:28:23,055 --> 00:28:29,055
You'll be amazed in 1970 I openly denounced all of them one by one

225
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,691
and told them, "Be careful about these cheats."

226
00:28:39,229 --> 00:28:45,180
And I said it on a very big platform.

227
00:28:48,948 --> 00:28:52,295
People were very frightened and they said, "You shouldn't have said it,

228
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,299
they will prosecute you or they will kill you".

229
00:28:59,244 --> 00:29:02,332
I said, "I'll have to see a person who can kill me".

230
00:29:05,713 --> 00:29:09,005
They have no courage because they are cheats.

231
00:29:12,295 --> 00:29:15,855
And they have cheated you people, you must understand this,

232
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,095
that you cannot have a fake person to raise your Kundalini

233
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,242
or to give your rebirth.

234
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,670
Buddha has said that ignorance is the biggest curse.

235
00:29:39,055 --> 00:29:42,935
Though we have progressed very much outside, like a tree

236
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,796
we are very ignorant about the roots, I think.

237
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:56,815
And very beautiful people, seekers are lost

238
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,320
because they did not know about the roots.

239
00:30:07,092 --> 00:30:12,228
In India we know the category of gurus.

240
00:30:15,865 --> 00:30:20,295
Therein a guru who is called as Kuguru

241
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,360
means who is not a guru but a bad man.

242
00:30:29,581 --> 00:30:33,304
And they are all out in the market, in the West.

243
00:30:36,088 --> 00:30:38,393
Because they can't exist in India.

244
00:30:40,724 --> 00:30:47,335
If they try to spread their ideas in India a farmer will say,

245
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,080
"All right, you get lost. We know all this nonsense."

246
00:30:56,225 --> 00:30:59,541
We have had this absurd in the sixth century sometimes

247
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:03,620
but we have known all this, we have gone through all this.

248
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:15,439
Now, one has to realize that you have to become your own master.

249
00:31:20,103 --> 00:31:26,151
That is the sign of reality.

250
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:34,615
So they say that there are gurus which are just called gurus

251
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,655
but they are agurus, mean they are not gurus but they do the job

252
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,535
like priests and all these people are not gurus but they do the job

253
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,510
you see they are paid for it.

254
00:31:49,273 --> 00:31:55,553
But the sat guru is the one that makes you meet the Divine.

255
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:04,495
That's the thing. So now what happens if your Kundalini is awakened.

256
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,826
What happens when you get your realization, what should happen?

257
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:19,255
When the disciples of Christ were blessed by Holy Ghost what happened?

258
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,080
they felt the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

259
00:32:28,831 --> 00:32:33,855
They started the language, speaking the language of centers, chakras.

260
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,994
And people thought they're speaking some Latin or Greek.

261
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:49,995
If you become divine person you don't speak human languages do you?

262
00:32:54,651 --> 00:32:56,971
Then you speak divine language.

263
00:32:59,831 --> 00:33:06,590
And the divine language is the language of the chakras, the centers.

264
00:33:13,634 --> 00:33:17,353
The people thought they were mad.

265
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:24,620
I mean if you go in the madhouse everybody thinks you are mad, isn't it.

266
00:33:28,296 --> 00:33:31,729
No use talking to the blind people about the colors.

267
00:33:35,088 --> 00:33:39,972
But here now we are to prove of the existence of God.

268
00:33:43,784 --> 00:33:47,120
And existence of this divine power.

269
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:52,545
Existence of the divine laws.

270
00:33:54,979 --> 00:33:56,890
On your fingertips.

271
00:33:59,284 --> 00:34:04,338
The time has come, the blossom time has come

272
00:34:04,363 --> 00:34:07,815
so thousands have to become the fruit.

273
00:34:14,935 --> 00:34:17,335
The other day another gentleman just raised

274
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,055
a question for nothing at all.

275
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,640
That it is called as a serpent power.

276
00:34:20,665 --> 00:34:24,320
I mean I never called it, but somebody must have called it.

277
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:34,080
Because I think in the West people are very allergic to the word serpent.

278
00:34:38,492 --> 00:34:46,092
But this energy is coiled into three and a half coils.

279
00:34:47,455 --> 00:34:51,855
And in some people you can even see the pulsation,

280
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,479
just like a heart on the triangular bone.

281
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:06,195
When there is obstruction in the stomach on the solar plexus

282
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:16,067
but it rises

283
00:35:18,036 --> 00:35:20,761
it pierces through your fontanel bone area.

284
00:35:23,346 --> 00:35:28,163
And you get a cool breeze coming out of your own head.

285
00:35:33,784 --> 00:35:39,219
It's an experience which is just the beginning.

286
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:45,230
Then you have to feel your own centers on your fingertips.

287
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:53,264
This is the actualization of baptism.

288
00:35:59,095 --> 00:36:02,615
It's not something artificial, that you put some water

289
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,666
on somebody's head and now you are baptized.

290
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:14,434
And we accept it. We accept all these certificates we accept.

291
00:36:19,718 --> 00:36:26,633
William Blake writes, "A priest cursed me on my head",

292
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:38,858
because he was a realized soul.

293
00:36:41,335 --> 00:36:44,575
We had so many realized souls but they could not

294
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,480
convince people about it.

295
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:53,889
At the most they were called as mad people.

296
00:36:56,189 --> 00:36:58,349
Nobody tried to understand.

297
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:05,314
Doesn't matter. Now when we will know the truth,

298
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:09,200
that we are the Spirit, that we are in charge.

299
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,080
Then you will see for yourself that

300
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,578
whatever all these great incarnations have said,

301
00:37:16,798 --> 00:37:20,745
all these prophets have said is the truth.

302
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:34,516
We may say that is the knowledge of the roots.

303
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:40,415
To know the knowledge of the roots we have to be

304
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,800
at a subtler situation.

305
00:37:47,651 --> 00:37:50,571
We have to become a subtler personality.

306
00:37:53,055 --> 00:37:56,495
And when we become that subtler personality

307
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:02,483
we know that we are collectively conscious.

308
00:38:08,607 --> 00:38:12,092
Truth must be experienced, one thing.

309
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:19,879
And everybody must say that that is so.

310
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:26,214
Like say you can say that I am wearing a red shawl all right.

311
00:38:30,317 --> 00:38:33,975
Everybody sees it's a red shawl.

312
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:38,228
It is not that for some people it is green.

313
00:38:40,995 --> 00:38:44,560
In the same way truth should be universal.

314
00:38:48,736 --> 00:38:53,176
And truth should be expressed on our central nervous system.

315
00:38:57,913 --> 00:39:02,985
Like for a dog to go through a dirty lane is no problem.

316
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:09,720
Dog. For a dog to go through a dirty lane is no problem.

317
00:39:14,742 --> 00:39:17,742
He cannot smell the filth.

318
00:39:21,077 --> 00:39:23,863
But he can feel a thief.

319
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:31,959
But for a human being it is difficult to go through a dirty lane.

320
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:39,504
But he can trust a thief.

321
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:46,320
So the central nervous system is the one that tells you the truth.

322
00:39:50,215 --> 00:39:54,135
Our central nervous system as it is at the human level

323
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:04,168
has to be enlightened by the Spirit.

324
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:12,725
Lots of confusions there are already, I find, about the Spirit.

325
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,360
Language problem.

326
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,219
Like the Spirit could be dead body which is haunting

327
00:40:28,898 --> 00:40:33,480
or could be the Spirit, the Atma the reflection of God almighty.

328
00:40:35,596 --> 00:40:37,213
Or could be alcohol.

329
00:40:38,497 --> 00:40:40,775
Now which one I am talking about.

330
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,317
It's the Spirit in your heart.

331
00:40:46,107 --> 00:40:50,827
Same about eternal life, there's a confusion I think.

332
00:40:55,135 --> 00:41:00,375
Some people think that if you die and become a ghost or a vampire,

333
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,360
you have an eternal life.

334
00:41:06,684 --> 00:41:08,335
It is not.

335
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:14,911
Eternal life is a life where you become the Spirit which is eternal.

336
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:25,455
I must confess in this short time is not easy to explain everything

337
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,392
about this ocean of knowledge.

338
00:41:36,524 --> 00:41:39,135
I must have given thousands of lectures before

339
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:45,473
so I would apologize for not explaining everything

340
00:41:50,613 --> 00:41:53,687
but need not explain at all

341
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,440
As I said that you have to just switch the button on and you get it.

342
00:42:03,061 --> 00:42:06,654
So why not have it.

343
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,840
May God bless you.
