1
00:09:36,114 --> 00:09:42,914
So welcome to you all, Sahaja Yogis,

2
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:49,373
to this great country of yoga.

3
00:09:54,248 --> 00:10:02,664
Today first of all we have to establish

4
00:10:04,331 --> 00:10:09,914
our desire within ourselves

5
00:10:09,997 --> 00:10:12,664
that we are seekers

6
00:10:12,747 --> 00:10:19,914
and that we have to achieve our full growth and maturity.

7
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:26,914
Today's puja is for the whole universe.

8
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,497
The whole universe

9
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:37,414
should be enlightened with your desires.

10
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:41,747
Your desires should be so intense

11
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:46,164
that they should emit out

12
00:10:46,248 --> 00:10:51,831
the pure vibrations of Mahakali Shakti,

13
00:10:51,914 --> 00:10:56,997
which is the pure desire

14
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:01,414
of attaining the spirit.

15
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,081
That's the real desire.

16
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:11,413
All the other desires are like mirage.

17
00:11:14,831 --> 00:11:23,413
You are the people who are chosen by God.

18
00:11:25,497 --> 00:11:33,497
Specially, first to express your desire,

19
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,414
and then to achieve it.

20
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:49,164
And by intense desire of purity

21
00:11:49,248 --> 00:11:53,914
you have to purify the whole world.

22
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:56,164
Not only the seekers,

23
00:11:56,248 --> 00:12:00,497
but even those who are not seekers.

24
00:12:04,914 --> 00:12:13,248
You have to create an aura around this universe,

25
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:21,248
of desire to achieve the ultimate,

26
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:24,747
the spirit.

27
00:12:30,497 --> 00:12:36,831
Without desire this universe would not have been created.

28
00:12:39,414 --> 00:12:48,914
This Desire of God is the one that is the Holy Ghost,

29
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:53,081
is this all-pervading power,

30
00:12:53,164 --> 00:12:58,164
is the Kundalini within you.

31
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:02,414
Kundalini has only one desire,

32
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,997
is to be the spirit

33
00:13:06,164 --> 00:13:10,997
and anything else if you desire

34
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:15,164
the Kundalini doesn't rise.

35
00:13:15,414 --> 00:13:18,664
Only when it knows

36
00:13:18,747 --> 00:13:25,331
that this desire is going to be fulfilled

37
00:13:27,664 --> 00:13:36,331
by somebody, who is facing the seeker,

38
00:13:37,414 --> 00:13:40,997
it is awakened.

39
00:13:41,914 --> 00:13:48,664
If you do not have the desire,

40
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:51,664
no-one can force you.

41
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,164
Sahaja Yogis should never try

42
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:59,497
to force this desire on other people.

43
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,164
The first ordeal we face,

44
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:05,747
as soon as you get your Realization,

45
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:11,414
is that you just start thinking of your family.

46
00:14:12,497 --> 00:14:16,081
You start thinking: 'My mother has not got it,

47
00:14:16,164 --> 00:14:19,413
my father has not got it,

48
00:14:19,414 --> 00:14:22,081
my wife has not got it,

49
00:14:22,248 --> 00:14:26,413
my children have not got it.'

50
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:35,331
You must know that these relations are worldly.

51
00:14:35,413 --> 00:14:37,580
Sanskrit is loukik.

52
00:14:37,664 --> 00:14:40,164
They are not aloukik,

53
00:14:40,248 --> 00:14:44,164
they are not beyond the worldly relationships.

54
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:46,413
These are worldly relations,

55
00:14:46,497 --> 00:14:49,664
and these attachments are worldly.

56
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:54,664
So if you play into that of course as you know,

57
00:14:54,747 --> 00:14:58,081
that Mahamaya Shakti allows you to play with that.

58
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:01,331
You go ahead, as long as you like.

59
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:04,914
People bring Me all their relations,

60
00:15:04,997 --> 00:15:07,164
parents, this and that

61
00:15:07,248 --> 00:15:09,664
and ultimately they discover

62
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:14,997
that this was a very wrong thing they did.

63
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:21,997
They lost so many precious moments,

64
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:24,664
so many hours, so many years,

65
00:15:24,747 --> 00:15:27,580
wasting their energy on people

66
00:15:27,747 --> 00:15:32,747
who never deserved any attention of Mother.

67
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:39,248
Sooner you realize the better that this desire

68
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,497
may be within you,

69
00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:50,248
and may not be in anyone of your so-called worldly relations.

70
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:55,164
Makes no difference.

71
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,580
As Christ was told

72
00:15:57,664 --> 00:16:01,497
that His brothers and sisters are waiting outside,

73
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:07,997
He said: 'Who are My brothers and who are My sisters?'

74
00:16:09,997 --> 00:16:14,081
So one has to realize that those people who involve themselves

75
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:17,497
into the problems of their family all the time,

76
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:20,580
and attract My attention,

77
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:24,414
you must know that I am just playing about.

78
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:28,497
It is of no value to you.

79
00:16:28,664 --> 00:16:32,164
For your ascent it is important first of all

80
00:16:32,248 --> 00:16:34,497
to have no desires

81
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:39,664
to create desire in your kith and kin.

82
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:44,664
This is the first principle of establishment

83
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:48,831
of Mahakali Power.

84
00:16:51,497 --> 00:16:54,580
Specially in India

85
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:58,248
where people are too much attached to their family,

86
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:02,081
it's a very big problem.

87
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:05,497
If you give Realization to one person,

88
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:10,248
you are amazed to see that all relationship they have

89
00:17:10,331 --> 00:17:13,831
is with a big bunch of bhoots.

90
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:20,081
And once you give Realization to one person you are in for trouble.

91
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:24,331
Then all the bhoots walk in, slowly,

92
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:27,997
torturing My life, wasting My energy,

93
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:31,747
and absolutely disgusting.

94
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:35,081
It should happen to you to understand

95
00:17:35,164 --> 00:17:38,248
that this is not auspicious.

96
00:17:38,331 --> 00:17:40,914
If you want to waste your time,

97
00:17:40,997 --> 00:17:44,831
I will allow you to waste your time.

98
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:51,164
But if you want to have the ascent fast,

99
00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:53,413
first of all one must remember

100
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:58,414
that these are relations which are absolutely worldly relations

101
00:17:58,497 --> 00:18:02,414
and this is not your pure desire.

102
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:07,248
So try to separate your pure desire

103
00:18:07,331 --> 00:18:11,497
from your worldly desires.

104
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:15,997
It does not by any means,

105
00:18:16,248 --> 00:18:20,831
suggest that you give up your family,

106
00:18:20,914 --> 00:18:25,413
you give up your mother or give up your sister - nothing.

107
00:18:25,414 --> 00:18:27,747
But you witness them

108
00:18:27,831 --> 00:18:33,914
and see, as you would see anybody else,

109
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:39,413
and see for yourself, whether

110
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:43,413
they are really desirous or not.

111
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,164
If they are - well and good.

112
00:18:45,248 --> 00:18:48,831
They should not be disqualified because they are your relations.

113
00:18:48,914 --> 00:18:50,747
It works both ways.

114
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:54,497
As they cannot be qualified because they are your relations,

115
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:59,831
they cannot be disqualified because they're your relations.

116
00:18:59,914 --> 00:19:08,081
So in Sahaja Yoga to make your desire a pure desire,

117
00:19:08,664 --> 00:19:15,413
you have to get out of so many things.

118
00:19:15,497 --> 00:19:19,997
But for people who are attached to their family,

119
00:19:20,248 --> 00:19:23,747
are bound by their family,

120
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,914
they have to see to it

121
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,914
that they do not force Sahaja Yoga on anyone of their relations,

122
00:19:29,997 --> 00:19:33,997
at least don't force them on Me.

123
00:20:41,956 --> 00:20:48,123
Now this desire within us,

124
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,622
which is the Mahakali Power which is manifesting,

125
00:20:52,705 --> 00:20:56,081
comes to us in so many ways.

126
00:20:56,206 --> 00:20:58,622
As I told you first of all,

127
00:20:58,705 --> 00:21:01,164
it comes to us after Realization,

128
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:03,539
because you are all Sahaja Yogis,

129
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:09,123
to do something about our relations.

130
00:21:09,331 --> 00:21:12,580
Then the second desire that comes to us,

131
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:17,705
that let us try to cure people,

132
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:22,331
who are our relations.

133
00:21:23,123 --> 00:21:24,789
This is the second desire,

134
00:21:24,914 --> 00:21:26,331
you should face yourself and see,

135
00:21:26,414 --> 00:21:29,539
that this has happened to many of you.

136
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:35,164
So, right from leprosy

137
00:21:35,413 --> 00:21:40,539
to any small thing like cold or sneezing,

138
00:21:40,622 --> 00:21:42,872
whatever they have,

139
00:21:43,123 --> 00:21:48,831
you think you should bring to Mother.

140
00:21:50,622 --> 00:21:56,123
And all the worries of your families should be brought to Mother.

141
00:21:56,248 --> 00:22:00,664
Simple thing like pregnancy or sneezing,

142
00:22:00,872 --> 00:22:05,872
very simple things - which are so natural

143
00:22:06,164 --> 00:22:13,123
are brought into your attention.

144
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:16,580
So when you have them in your attention I say:

145
00:22:16,705 --> 00:22:22,039
'All right, go ahead with it. Try to solve it, if possible.'

146
00:22:22,164 --> 00:22:24,789
But if you do not have them in your attention

147
00:22:24,914 --> 00:22:28,831
they are in My attention.

148
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,747
You leave them in My attention, I'll manage that.

149
00:22:35,831 --> 00:22:39,872
But then it's a vicious circle.

150
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:44,539
It's a very subtle projection of the mind

151
00:22:44,622 --> 00:22:46,414
that thinks: 'All right,

152
00:22:46,497 --> 00:22:48,622
that Mother we don't have this in our attention,

153
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:54,455
You'd better look after it." That's not the way.

154
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:59,455
You should have only one intense desire within yourself:

155
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:03,248
"Have I become the spirit?

156
00:23:03,622 --> 00:23:07,455
Have I achieved my ultimate?

157
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:12,413
Have I risen above the worldly desires?"

158
00:23:12,455 --> 00:23:15,455
Purify it.

159
00:23:17,747 --> 00:23:21,289
Once you start purifying whatever falls off,

160
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:24,539
I'll look after that.

161
00:23:24,622 --> 00:23:30,539
This is just an assurance, but not a guarantee.

162
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:39,039
If it deserves My attention I will definitely look after you.

163
00:23:39,914 --> 00:23:48,248
You have to value your attention as I value My attention.

164
00:23:50,914 --> 00:23:56,664
I think you have to value much more of your attention

165
00:23:57,705 --> 00:24:02,413
than Me, because I can manage,

166
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,248
many more things within Myself,

167
00:24:04,373 --> 00:24:09,831
because everything is in My attention.

168
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:15,789
But you try to purify your desires,

169
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:20,914
away from the worldly problems that are facing you.

170
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,914
So you expand it more, then you start thinking:

171
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:32,206
'Mother, what about the problem of our country?'

172
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:39,206
All right, give Me the map of your country - finished.

173
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:42,872
That's more than sufficient.

174
00:24:46,413 --> 00:24:50,497
Then purify yourself.

175
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:55,705
The desire that you have, you leave it.

176
00:24:55,831 --> 00:24:57,413
And once you are purified

177
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:00,539
that area will be covered through your attention,

178
00:25:00,622 --> 00:25:04,539
it's very interesting.

179
00:25:04,622 --> 00:25:11,331
When you get over it then only you can throw light,

180
00:25:11,997 --> 00:25:14,622
but if you are inside you are hidden by that.

181
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:18,289
Your light is hidden, there's no light emitted.

182
00:25:18,413 --> 00:25:21,164
You all rise above that desire.

183
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:24,248
Every time you get a desire you rise above it,

184
00:25:24,373 --> 00:25:29,081
so your light is emitted on that wider problem

185
00:25:29,206 --> 00:25:30,956
that you are facing

186
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:36,413
which you think should be solved by Me.

187
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:42,373
These are all My headaches which you are taking on yourself.

188
00:25:42,414 --> 00:25:45,705
You have to do only one thing is to become the spirit

189
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:48,373
that's all. Is a simple thing.

190
00:25:48,455 --> 00:25:52,914
The rest of it is My headache.

191
00:25:54,831 --> 00:26:01,289
Now the problems

192
00:26:01,373 --> 00:26:08,373
that should take your desire on the collective

193
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:16,206
should be very different.

194
00:26:17,123 --> 00:26:22,081
To substantiate your purity,

195
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:27,331
to be fragrant with your purity,

196
00:26:27,414 --> 00:26:30,705
your attention should be on the other side.

197
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,497
Now you are not facing Me,

198
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,747
you are sitting with Me facing the whole world.

199
00:26:34,831 --> 00:26:40,164
See, the whole attitude will change.

200
00:26:40,248 --> 00:26:45,539
The attitude should be: 'What can I give?

201
00:26:45,664 --> 00:26:48,997
How can I give?

202
00:26:49,123 --> 00:26:52,413
What is my mistake in giving?

203
00:26:52,497 --> 00:26:55,039
I have to be more alert.

204
00:26:55,123 --> 00:26:59,455
Where is my attention?

205
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,956
I have to be more alert towards myself

206
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:06,331
what am I doing?

207
00:27:06,831 --> 00:27:11,455
What's my responsibility?'

208
00:27:13,455 --> 00:27:19,414
You must desire that you should be pure.

209
00:27:19,497 --> 00:27:22,664
You should be pure desire.

210
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:26,497
That means you should be the spirit.

211
00:27:26,622 --> 00:27:31,539
That, "What is your responsibility to yourself?"

212
00:27:31,664 --> 00:27:37,789
You should desire that your responsibility to yourself

213
00:27:37,914 --> 00:27:41,622
should be manifested,

214
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:46,206
should be complete.

215
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:51,997
Then your responsibility to this Sahaja Yoga.

216
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:55,997
What is your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

217
00:27:56,081 --> 00:27:58,539
which is the work of God,

218
00:27:58,664 --> 00:28:05,081
which has started and you are My hands.

219
00:28:06,831 --> 00:28:10,956
You have to do the work of God,

220
00:28:11,081 --> 00:28:15,414
and you have to fight the anti-God elements,

221
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,914
the satanic elements.

222
00:28:18,123 --> 00:28:20,539
You are not responsible for your family any more,

223
00:28:20,664 --> 00:28:24,289
those who are, are half-baked Sahaja Yogis

224
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:28,081
I said, are useless absolutely good for nothing.

225
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,914
All such will drop out, their families will suffer,

226
00:28:30,997 --> 00:28:33,580
I know this is going to happen.

227
00:28:33,705 --> 00:28:36,081
Because now the forces are gathering in such a way

228
00:28:36,206 --> 00:28:39,831
that sorting out will start.

229
00:28:39,956 --> 00:28:45,331
Your responsibility to yourself, to be the spirit,

230
00:28:45,414 --> 00:28:51,539
your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

231
00:28:52,413 --> 00:28:56,705
your responsibility to understand Me,

232
00:28:56,831 --> 00:29:01,373
better and better and better.

233
00:29:01,414 --> 00:29:04,455
Your responsibility to understand this mechanism

234
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:07,539
that is within you,

235
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:11,747
your responsibility to understand how this mechanism

236
00:29:11,872 --> 00:29:16,414
works out everything.

237
00:29:16,664 --> 00:29:22,413
The responsibility is to how to become a guru yourself.

238
00:29:23,331 --> 00:29:28,872
Your responsibility to be a dignified and a glorified personality.

239
00:29:28,997 --> 00:29:31,664
A responsibility to be a respectable person

240
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:36,539
and not a cheap personality.

241
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:39,664
Every one of you

242
00:29:39,747 --> 00:29:46,956
is worth the whole universe.

243
00:29:48,373 --> 00:29:53,164
If you want to rise to that height.

244
00:29:54,539 --> 00:30:00,831
Universes of universes can be thrown away at your feet.

245
00:30:01,373 --> 00:30:03,914
If you want to rise to that height,

246
00:30:03,997 --> 00:30:10,039
to that magnitude that is within you to prosper.

247
00:30:12,123 --> 00:30:14,622
But those people,

248
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:24,664
who still want to live on a very low level cannot rise.

249
00:30:26,664 --> 00:30:29,039
For example,

250
00:30:29,123 --> 00:30:33,831
the western Sahaja Yogis have certain problems

251
00:30:35,747 --> 00:30:42,206
of committing the sin against the Mother,

252
00:30:42,331 --> 00:30:45,373
and the eastern Sahaja Yogis have the problem

253
00:30:45,455 --> 00:30:50,164
of committing sin against the Father.

254
00:30:51,248 --> 00:30:57,164
It's not difficult at all

255
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:03,455
for you to get out of it.

256
00:31:10,206 --> 00:31:18,289
The attention is to be kept pure.

257
00:31:18,497 --> 00:31:23,331
In Sahaja Yoga you know all the methods

258
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:28,705
how the attention one can keep it pure.

259
00:31:28,914 --> 00:31:30,956
If the attention is not pure

260
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:34,164
then this desire

261
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:38,956
will be always attacked

262
00:31:39,081 --> 00:31:41,997
by all petty nonsensical things

263
00:31:42,123 --> 00:31:46,081
which has no meaning in your ascent.

264
00:31:46,164 --> 00:31:49,123
Now a person who is a good Sahaja Yogi

265
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,831
is not bothered about clothes, what others say to him

266
00:31:51,956 --> 00:31:54,081
or what others are talking to him,

267
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:55,997
how they are behaving towards him and

268
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:59,872
the attention is not on that

269
00:31:59,997 --> 00:32:05,039
criticism that this person is like this, that person is like that.

270
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:10,914
Nor there is the aggressiveness

271
00:32:13,123 --> 00:32:17,081
of anyone else,

272
00:32:17,164 --> 00:32:20,123
because nobody is the other.

273
00:32:20,248 --> 00:32:24,997
But the problem is when I say that,

274
00:32:25,248 --> 00:32:31,039
no-one thinks that I'm saying about you, each persons.

275
00:32:31,164 --> 00:32:35,539
Those who are aggressive take the other role

276
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:42,164
and those who are non-aggressive think the other way.

277
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:46,497
Like I say something for a person who is aggressive,

278
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,956
the non-aggressive immediately thinks of the person who is aggressive,

279
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:53,539
not about himself.

280
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:56,747
You immediately start shifting your mind to other person,

281
00:32:56,831 --> 00:33:01,413
finding faults with other people.

282
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:07,705
So this desire becomes

283
00:33:07,831 --> 00:33:13,539
gradually lower and lower and lower

284
00:33:13,664 --> 00:33:18,705
because of the loads that are put onto it.

285
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:22,206
So the alertness is very important,

286
00:33:22,331 --> 00:33:27,331
complete alertness - satarkata,

287
00:33:27,413 --> 00:33:32,455
that we should keep our attention

288
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:40,373
purely for the sustenance of our pure desire.

289
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:46,414
Desire comes from your heart

290
00:33:46,539 --> 00:33:48,289
and you are so built

291
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:52,872
that your brahmarandra is also the heart.

292
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:55,956
If you don't have a clean heart,

293
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:00,414
this won't keep clean.

294
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:03,206
There are people

295
00:34:03,331 --> 00:34:06,039
who think if they talk about Sahaja Yoga big,

296
00:34:06,123 --> 00:34:09,206
and all that, they are all right.

297
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:12,747
They are cheating themselves.

298
00:34:12,997 --> 00:34:16,747
If the heart is not open

299
00:34:16,872 --> 00:34:20,413
then this is closed.

300
00:34:20,455 --> 00:34:26,705
So try to open your heart by projecting.

301
00:34:31,664 --> 00:34:35,831
Projecting it.

302
00:34:35,914 --> 00:34:39,956
I hope today when you do this puja

303
00:34:40,081 --> 00:34:44,123
and you do the worship of Mahakali

304
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:49,164
and this special yagya,

305
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:53,956
we will definitely establish this aura,

306
00:34:54,081 --> 00:34:58,831
and enlighten the universe.

307
00:34:58,914 --> 00:35:00,747
But your outlook should be:

308
00:35:00,872 --> 00:35:05,872
'How much I have contributed to this.

309
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:10,123
Am I still thinking of other people,

310
00:35:10,248 --> 00:35:15,331
am I still thinking of my petty small problems,

311
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:21,664
or I'm thinking of my spirit?'

312
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:28,705
So, the left side

313
00:35:28,914 --> 00:35:36,039
starts and ends with Shri Ganesh.

314
00:35:36,123 --> 00:35:42,455
Shri Ganesh has only basic one quality,

315
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:45,414
that He's completely surrendered to His Mother,

316
00:35:45,497 --> 00:35:49,206
He does not know any other God,

317
00:35:49,331 --> 00:35:52,956
He does not even know His Father.

318
00:35:53,497 --> 00:35:55,664
He only knows His Mother

319
00:35:55,789 --> 00:36:02,248
and completely surrendered to Her.

320
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:11,914
But this pure desire has to have the action,

321
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:14,622
and about which I'll tell you later

322
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:19,289
as we will be having more pujas and more pujas.

323
00:36:19,373 --> 00:36:25,206
But today let us establish ourselves

324
00:36:26,248 --> 00:36:33,289
into that pure desire, to be the spirit.

325
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:41,455
Now, as it is, with the western mind we'll say: 'How?'

326
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:48,956
Is always coming, "How to do it?"

327
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:55,705
Should I tell you? It's very simple.

328
00:36:55,831 --> 00:37:00,705
Adi Shankaracharya wrote 'Viveka Chudamani'

329
00:37:00,831 --> 00:37:05,289
and so many other books of treaties,

330
00:37:05,373 --> 00:37:11,914
and then all these big intellectuals got after his life.

331
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:14,289
And they said:

332
00:37:14,413 --> 00:37:17,497
'How this and how that and how?'

333
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,081
He said: 'Forget these people.'

334
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:24,872
Then he wrote 'Saundarya Lahari',

335
00:37:24,956 --> 00:37:27,081
it's just a description of his Mother

336
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:29,622
and his devotion to Her

337
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:39,123
and every couplet that He wrote is a mantra.

338
00:37:39,747 --> 00:37:41,497
It is not the surrender

339
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:47,497
of your mind through your mind,

340
00:37:47,622 --> 00:37:53,373
but the surrender of your heart.

341
00:37:56,413 --> 00:38:00,331
Is absolutely the surrender of your heart.

342
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:04,373
Western Sahaja Yogis know very well

343
00:38:04,539 --> 00:38:07,914
how there have been attacks

344
00:38:07,997 --> 00:38:11,914
and attacks of negativity on them,

345
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:18,580
specially when horrible people like Freud

346
00:38:19,123 --> 00:38:26,539
came to destroy their basic, the roots.

347
00:38:26,622 --> 00:38:31,914
And how the West accepted it blindfolded,

348
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:37,081
and put them on the path of hell.

349
00:38:37,206 --> 00:38:40,914
All that has to be brought out.

350
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:45,206
That is all nonsense, is wrong, absolutely

351
00:38:45,331 --> 00:38:50,164
against God, it's anti-God activity.

352
00:38:50,373 --> 00:38:53,705
Then you will realize

353
00:38:53,831 --> 00:39:02,206
that you will fight fully, by saying,

354
00:39:02,331 --> 00:39:08,997
"This is the destruction of our basics, our roots,

355
00:39:09,123 --> 00:39:10,539
when our Mother is the source

356
00:39:10,664 --> 00:39:15,414
of everything that is sublime, noble,

357
00:39:15,831 --> 00:39:18,789
all that is nourishing,

358
00:39:18,872 --> 00:39:24,414
all that is elevating, emancipating.

359
00:39:24,497 --> 00:39:28,039
You have cutting us from our roots.

360
00:39:28,123 --> 00:39:33,622
"When he dealt with, I think, animal-like creatures

361
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:40,872
and he wants all of you to go down to that low level

362
00:39:40,997 --> 00:39:44,580
of human beings,

363
00:39:44,705 --> 00:39:52,747
which exist as pathological cases, I don't know.

364
00:39:52,872 --> 00:39:56,414
So it is important for you to understand all the attacks

365
00:39:56,539 --> 00:39:58,123
that came on you,

366
00:39:58,206 --> 00:39:59,705
and be alert

367
00:39:59,789 --> 00:40:05,413
and don't be identified with anyone of these.

368
00:40:05,455 --> 00:40:08,831
Last I would say you have come to this country

369
00:40:08,914 --> 00:40:13,373
to see the roots and not the shoot.

370
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:16,789
Change your attitude of western style.

371
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,289
Telephones are no good.

372
00:40:19,373 --> 00:40:21,789
You cannot get any telephones done here.

373
00:40:21,914 --> 00:40:25,039
Postage is horrible.

374
00:40:25,164 --> 00:40:27,164
Railways are worst.

375
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:33,414
I shouldn't say because we are in a railway.

376
00:40:38,373 --> 00:40:45,539
But, the people are excellent.

377
00:40:45,664 --> 00:40:47,497
They know what is dharma.

378
00:40:47,622 --> 00:40:49,414
They are not being attacked, somehow or other

379
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:51,413
because it being the Kundalini.

380
00:40:51,455 --> 00:40:57,081
The Ganesha is sitting here how dare anybody attack?

381
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:01,539
This great Maharashtra has got eight Ganeshas,

382
00:41:01,664 --> 00:41:02,747
protecting them.

383
00:41:02,831 --> 00:41:06,831
I don't know if these Maharashtrians know this fact.

384
00:41:06,956 --> 00:41:09,289
And so many marutis,

385
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:12,039
so who can attack this country?

386
00:41:12,164 --> 00:41:13,414
There is no negative attack

387
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:18,831
except that they themselves are rather money-minded sort.

388
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:21,997
That's the only curse they have, if they can get out of it

389
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:25,914
they are great people.

390
00:41:28,956 --> 00:41:35,831
So, we have come to this country not to enjoy the comfort

391
00:41:35,914 --> 00:41:41,206
of the West, but the comfort of the spirit.

392
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:46,747
So to change your attitude towards India

393
00:41:46,831 --> 00:41:52,164
I don't mean Air India, by any chance.

394
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:55,039
This is a wrong idea that you come by Air India

395
00:41:55,123 --> 00:41:57,622
because you are a Sahaja Yogi. Not at all.

396
00:41:57,705 --> 00:42:00,705
Air India is nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

397
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:03,206
All our railways, all our everything,

398
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:05,248
they have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga,

399
00:42:05,331 --> 00:42:07,664
so far.

400
00:42:10,123 --> 00:42:14,206
So you be patriotic and use your own airlines,

401
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,789
for heaven's sake.

402
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,539
But when you arrive here

403
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,664
you will see that the people are too innocent,

404
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:27,248
they can't understand Freud, you can't talk to them,

405
00:42:27,331 --> 00:42:29,956
it's beyond them.

406
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:32,414
They are a higher type of people in this respect

407
00:42:32,539 --> 00:42:34,705
now because they are not attacked,

408
00:42:34,831 --> 00:42:37,497
while you are higher in a way that though you are attacked

409
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,997
you've come out of it.

410
00:42:41,123 --> 00:42:44,539
You just turn your faces and you are on the other way.

411
00:42:44,664 --> 00:42:49,747
That's something great.

412
00:42:49,872 --> 00:42:52,497
So you would also have a confidence

413
00:42:52,622 --> 00:42:55,664
there are many people who believe the same way as you believe,

414
00:42:55,747 --> 00:43:01,206
in this big country where there's such a big population to support you.

415
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:06,413
So you shouldn't feel lost.

416
00:43:07,497 --> 00:43:12,206
Thus today, we have to start this puja,

417
00:43:12,331 --> 00:43:16,123
on Mahakali Day.

418
00:43:16,206 --> 00:43:20,539
And it's the Day of the Gauri we can say,

419
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:23,747
and Ganesh-Gauri's Day today,

420
00:43:23,872 --> 00:43:30,373
though according to the schedule time it may not be.

421
00:43:30,455 --> 00:43:32,289
But according to Me,

422
00:43:32,373 --> 00:43:36,872
let us establish within ourself on a subtler level

423
00:43:36,997 --> 00:43:42,747
the desire to be pure,

424
00:43:45,997 --> 00:43:50,123
and to be cleansed out.

425
00:43:50,206 --> 00:43:57,455
All the barriers and unclean things that are within us,

426
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:02,705
to desire to be great Sahaja Yogis,

427
00:44:02,831 --> 00:44:09,414
desire to be responsible Sahaja Yogis

428
00:44:09,497 --> 00:44:14,413
and desire to be surrendered to your Mother.

429
00:44:14,664 --> 00:44:16,497
It's not difficult.

430
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,622
That is the easiest, the last one is the easiest,

431
00:44:19,705 --> 00:44:21,705
because what you surrender,

432
00:44:21,831 --> 00:44:24,789
I don't want anything from you,

433
00:44:24,914 --> 00:44:29,956
except that you accept My Love.

434
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:34,956
Surrendering just means you open your heart to accept My Love.

435
00:44:35,081 --> 00:44:37,914
Give up this ego.

436
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:41,248
That's all and it will work out.

437
00:44:41,331 --> 00:44:45,539
I'm sure it's going to work out.

438
00:44:45,664 --> 00:44:49,039
I am trying to push Myself into your hearts

439
00:44:49,164 --> 00:44:53,081
and I'll definitely settle down there.

440
01:09:50,164 --> 01:09:55,206
Mahakali has a special capacity to weep,

441
01:09:55,414 --> 01:09:57,455
because She is left-sided.

442
01:09:57,539 --> 01:09:59,956
When She's helpless and She cannot act,

443
01:10:00,081 --> 01:10:02,831
She weeps.

444
01:10:02,956 --> 01:10:05,123
This is the only manifestation

445
01:10:05,248 --> 01:10:08,331
of Mahakali is that She desires,

446
01:10:08,414 --> 01:10:11,831
and if She doesn't get Her desire enacted

447
01:10:11,914 --> 01:10:13,331
then She just weeps,

448
01:10:13,414 --> 01:10:16,539
that's the only thing She can do in helplessness, isn't it.

449
01:10:16,705 --> 01:10:20,956
And sometimes when She's full of Love

450
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:24,081
as I've seen you today all of you coming down here

451
01:10:24,164 --> 01:10:27,206
and all these people sitting down here.

452
01:10:27,331 --> 01:10:30,289
When She cannot express Herself fully,

453
01:10:30,413 --> 01:10:32,455
with full heart,

454
01:10:32,664 --> 01:10:42,789
also She feels that joy pouring as tears.

455
01:10:43,206 --> 01:10:45,081
May God bless you for today's puja,

456
01:10:45,164 --> 01:10:48,789
I hope all of you will take it in such a way

457
01:10:48,914 --> 01:10:51,414
that the subtlest of subtle

458
01:10:51,539 --> 01:10:54,081
will be awakened within you, the sensitivity

459
01:10:54,206 --> 01:10:58,206
every way, and the Love,

460
01:10:58,414 --> 01:11:01,497
which culminates into joy.

461
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:07,914
Love that flowers into the fragrance of joy

462
01:11:08,039 --> 01:11:13,206
will manifest in today's puja.

463
01:11:13,289 --> 01:11:16,123
May God bless you!
