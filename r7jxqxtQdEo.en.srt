1
00:00:01,524 --> 00:00:15,300
Today we are here to celebrate Sahastrar Day.

2
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:32,644
It was not very difficult for Me to open the

3
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:43,106
Sahastrar because there were so many seekers
in this world: because, of course, I had studied

4
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:58,922
also, the permutations and combinations from
which you all are, in a way, suffering. Also,

5
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:11,144
the time had come. I felt [that] horrible
gurus, who are really devils, are trying to

6
00:01:11,169 --> 00:01:23,125
capture all the seekers. I thought it's high
time that Sahastrara should be opened out.

7
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:42,778
It was not like Christ’s crucifixion by
any chance. In those days one had to do lot

8
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:49,803
of tapasya and that’s what He went through.

9
00:01:50,961 --> 00:02:05,771
But in these modern times, what you know
is much more important than what you do.

10
00:02:07,004 --> 00:02:20,284
It is such a universal awareness now because
of maybe, medias, because of communications,

11
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:30,679
because of travelling, that a human mind knows
a lot. It knows so much sometimes that its

12
00:02:30,704 --> 00:02:43,698
brain cannot even bear it. It is so overloaded
with ideas and also the human mind is all

13
00:02:43,723 --> 00:02:55,489
the time anxious to grasp, absorb and retain
whatever he thinks is knowledge. But he lacks

14
00:02:55,514 --> 00:03:03,978
discretion, so all kind of things are accumulated
in his brain in the modern times. Specially

15
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:19,756
with the advent of all this media like television,
computers. Not a media, but it’s quite a

16
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:28,090
complicated brain again...the man had to know
the technique of all these things very much.

17
00:03:28,115 --> 00:03:39,224
And this technique, if he understood, he could
do many things, many more things than your

18
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:53,899
forefathers could do. Thus, materialism started
taking its own development in the minds of

19
00:03:53,924 --> 00:04:06,135
people. So the curse of human beings, at that
time, was materialism: when I felt that Sahastrara

20
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,302
must be opened out.

21
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:18,238
Before that, people were just simple, innocent:
they all believed in God, they never doubted,

22
00:04:18,796 --> 00:04:30,639
and they didn't even seek the Truth. This
materialism created such a competition among

23
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:44,760
human beings, such hypocrisy, that people
started finding out that: this is not honest,

24
00:04:45,554 --> 00:04:57,295
materialism is not joy-giving, you can't get
peace out of materialism. Just it started

25
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,244
developing into their awareness that this
is not the end of our achievement, this is

26
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:11,976
not what we have to know, this is not what
is going to give us joy and peace.

27
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:20,114
Specially after war, this awareness started
growing very much among young people.

28
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:34,027
This is also because, now, the human awareness
had reached the state of the brain.

29
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:41,631
That's how they started knowing better, absorbing
better and retaining better.

30
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:51,054
You take a little child of today, he knows much better than
you would have known when you were even 25

31
00:05:51,054 --> 00:05:58,054
years of age; because he’s supposed to know
about everything.

32
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:08,468
And thus, there was no movement

33
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,870
towards knowing what is the Truth.

34
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:23,426
But, as this awareness grew more and more, lots of

35
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:27,576
seekers were created on this earth.

36
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:31,813
So many people, who never knew they were seekers,

37
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:37,733
suddenly became seekers. It's a atmospheric
effect, I should say.

38
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:42,771
 And thus, a new category

39
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:50,933
of people were born, became aware, that they
have to find out the Truth.

40
00:06:52,403 --> 00:07:01,929
So, it was all simultaneously, according to
the time,

41
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:06,313
 that Sahastrara was to be opened out.

42
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:13,807
And thus, this happened.

43
00:07:15,037 --> 00:07:20,197
For us sahaja yogis, of course, Sahastrara
 is the biggest event.

44
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:28,771
Or we should say - whatever work all
the incarnations have done, all the seers

45
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:35,093
and saints and prophets have done, this is
the culminating point.

46
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:38,645
They did it for individuals,

47
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:53,628
but to do for masses, that it should go to
every nook and corner of this world, is the

48
00:07:53,653 --> 00:08:04,969
ultimate end of all spiritual growth all over,
in every religion, through every great incarnations

49
00:08:04,994 --> 00:08:07,004
and prophets.

50
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:21,713
What They indicated about future, what They
talked about, what you are to know yourself,

51
00:08:22,343 --> 00:08:30,740
that you have to find yourself, that you have
to become a realised-soul, that you should

52
00:08:30,765 --> 00:08:36,973
have atmasakshatkar, that you should be a
wali.

53
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:45,278
All these indications....Even the Buddhists

54
00:08:45,494 --> 00:08:52,494
know that Matreya has to come. Ma-treya. “Ma”
is Mother. Three times. Trigunatmika.

55
00:08:53,674 --> 00:09:03,649
Even the Greeks had Athena with 3 powers in Her.
So, all of them have been predicting about

56
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:16,333
this time. And that time came and that’s
how I call it the blossom time and the fruits

57
00:09:16,658 --> 00:09:19,136
that are you people.

58
00:09:19,398 --> 00:09:32,338
So it is all so much, we can say, in the cosmic
cycle of different seasons - [that] this beautiful

59
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:42,089
time has come and, like the wheel of time,
has to turn and go further - [that] Sahaja

60
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:49,538
Yoga started. Of course, in a very small way,
but has now grown so big all over the world.

61
00:09:50,093 --> 00:10:06,380
Here now, there’s another thing that has
happened, which is rather remarkable, that

62
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:16,158
so far, people used to meditate alone and
maybe one of them might get realisation, but

63
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:23,375
there was no phenomena of en masse realisation,
nor of en masse meditation in those days.

64
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:28,788
They all used to disappear into some nook
and corner of a quiet place where they would

65
00:10:28,813 --> 00:10:42,230
sit down and meditate. But this en masse realisation,
en masse meditation, en masse understanding

66
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:53,805
and learning about your being was not even
imagined by Me: that it would go to such a

67
00:10:53,830 --> 00:11:03,617
limit, to such an extent, with leaps and bounds.
This year specially, it has taken a very new

68
00:11:03,642 --> 00:11:12,404
dimension, I think, everywhere and all that
is negative is being exposed

69
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:15,507
in most of the countries.

70
00:11:16,024 --> 00:11:26,760
So this is how, when the Sahastrara opened,
the Kundalini started moving towards this

71
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:40,169
Divine Power, getting connected with It and
was all the time flowing within you, when

72
00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:50,912
the nirvikalpa state came. Now when it is
coming through the Sahastrara, one has to

73
00:11:50,984 --> 00:12:08,037
know that the Sahastrara has to be clean,
so that the flow of Divine Power is going,

74
00:12:09,505 --> 00:12:21,377
penetrating, without any obstacle, without
getting impure, without getting into any kind

75
00:12:21,402 --> 00:12:23,790
of problems.

76
00:12:25,964 --> 00:12:35,416
So, to get tot hat level, to that state, all the sahaja

77
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:40,230
yogi, I am happy to know, are trying to work

78
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:50,669
it out, their own individual meditations also,
so that this growth should take place.

79
00:12:51,944 --> 00:13:04,548
Thus, you get enlightenment in a full way.
But then one must ask why, for what? What’s

80
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:17,185
the purpose? What’s the aim? The aim is:
your aim is lost. You don’t seek for aims

81
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:31,252
at all anymore. This pendal was built with
such great ability for which we didn't pay

82
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:39,838
anything. Everybody was working here day and
night, in the rainy season, and I was quite

83
00:13:39,863 --> 00:13:46,104
worried about them. I said, “What's the
matter?” they said, “We are enjoying,

84
00:13:46,104 --> 00:13:49,784
Mother. We are enjoying!” “What enjoying?”
“We’re enjoying the rain.” All right.

85
00:13:49,784 --> 00:13:55,383
“We are enjoying the cold.” All right.
“Enjoying everything, lifting all these

86
00:13:55,383 --> 00:14:01,794
heavy things, everything we are enjoying.”
I was quite surprised at them. Nobody had

87
00:14:01,794 --> 00:14:11,382
any complaints, but everybody was just on
the warpath, building this tent for you.

88
00:14:12,914 --> 00:14:23,159
So what happens? Once your Sahastrara is clean,
this flow of joy doesn't allow you even to

89
00:14:23,204 --> 00:14:30,015
think that you are exerting or you are working.
Normally, if you tell somebody that this is

90
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:38,809
to be erected [they say] “Aaaaaah!” Some
would faint and some would say, “Ah, this

91
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:44,844
will take at least one year.” Then they'll
start giving excuses. “This pole is no good.

92
00:14:44,844 --> 00:14:51,164
That is no good. It won't stand that. There’s
nothing, there's nothing…” Ultimately,

93
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:56,778
you'll find nothing is done. It will lie like
this for years together. “You better get

94
00:14:56,803 --> 00:15:03,234
another person. You better buy another one.”
Everything is postponed all the time and nothing

95
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:04,724
is done.

96
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:11,939
But here, you don't feel you are doing anything.
When you don't feel you are doing anything,

97
00:15:11,964 --> 00:15:17,837
how can you say then, “Why?” Because I'm
not doing anything, in any way, so I don't

98
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:27,399
ask question “Why?” Do I? And in any case,
I'm not doing anything. That is the state

99
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:43,429
where you are working in the Divine Plan.
You are doing lot of work, but nobody feels

100
00:15:43,454 --> 00:15:50,939
they are doing anything. They all think, we
are absolutely just enjoying ourselves, doing

101
00:15:50,964 --> 00:16:01,445
nothing. This kind of a state is the blessing
of Sahastrara because only in your brain you

102
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:08,650
think all these things; labour-saving devices.
I mean, you tell anybody, “You go and telephone

103
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:14,848
to this person.” Immediately, if it is a
modern man, he'll say, “He may not be there.

104
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:20,243
God knows. What’s the use? Telephone may
not be all right.” “Baba, you see! Why

105
00:16:20,243 --> 00:16:25,184
don't you see if the telephone is all right
or not?” Before that only he will give this

106
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:32,184
hundred and one explanations that it may not
be all right, it maybe something may be wrong

107
00:16:32,243 --> 00:16:39,243
and just labour-saving, first. That is one
of the tricks of the brain.

108
00:16:39,784 --> 00:16:45,924
Then this intelligence cheats you all the
time. It gives you rationality for everything.

109
00:16:45,924 --> 00:16:52,924
Like a person kills his father and you ask
him, “Why did you kill?” “Why not? He

110
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:56,383
was so old. He was suffering and I wanted
to have all the property,

111
00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:58,407
 so I thought better kill him”

112
00:17:01,682 --> 00:17:07,024
Like Queen Victoria became very
old, so her son was to think that “I'll

113
00:17:07,024 --> 00:17:12,123
never become a king if this lady goes on like
this!”

114
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:24,733
So, the brain starts giving lots of explanation
and cheating – because rationality. It gives

115
00:17:24,758 --> 00:17:33,139
rationality and rationality is nothing but
ego or your conditioning. Your ego tells you,

116
00:17:33,164 --> 00:17:39,743
“No, this is no good,” so you stick on
to that point, “This is not good.” Then

117
00:17:39,743 --> 00:17:48,120
another can ask you why it is not good. “I
think it is not good, so I think.” Or, like

118
00:17:48,145 --> 00:17:55,988
some say, “I believe,” but why? But in
Sahaja Yoga answer is simple, “Why do you

119
00:17:56,013 --> 00:18:02,983
do it?” - “I enjoy it.” What's the next
answer? “Why are you worried?

120
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:05,972
 I am enjoying it.”

121
00:18:08,074 --> 00:18:15,074
Now the people who also say like that, because
of their conditionings, “Oh, I am enjoying

122
00:18:15,284 --> 00:18:20,584
it.” Somebody will say, “I enjoy my drink.”
Somebody can say, “I enjoy my going to the

123
00:18:20,584 --> 00:18:26,674
church.” Sometimes I say going – something
else, you see, like that. They are enjoying

124
00:18:26,674 --> 00:18:32,564
something, which, according to Sahaja Yoga,
we too can never enjoy. But that enjoyment

125
00:18:32,564 --> 00:18:41,889
is not collective. That is not supported by
anyone. For example, somebody says, “I enjoy

126
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:50,189
drinking.” Nobody has erected any temple
or any statue of a man who drinks. Have you

127
00:18:50,214 --> 00:19:00,848
seen anywhere in the whole world? So, though
he may say that, “I enjoy,” it has no

128
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:12,238
sanction from the society. People can say,
“I enjoy stealing,” people can say, “I

129
00:19:12,263 --> 00:19:20,631
enjoy killing,” but it is very arbitrary,
it is very individual and never supported

130
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:28,688
by the society, even by the modern society
and there's always reaction to it.

131
00:19:29,074 --> 00:19:36,939
But Sahaja Yoga is not like them, when you
say, “I enjoy,” you say it because you

132
00:19:36,964 --> 00:19:45,458
have no ego and you have no conditionings.
It's a different situation because now the

133
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:53,547
Sahastrara is opened out. So, on one side,
your ego has gone down, another side, your

134
00:19:53,814 --> 00:20:03,029
conditioning is finished. You are no more
conditioned. Like you talk to a Catholic...so

135
00:20:03,054 --> 00:20:09,395
I started talking about Christ. Immediately
he said, “Mother, now please.” I said,

136
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:15,394
“I am talking about Christ, not about Catholicism.
Talking of Christ, why are you frightened

137
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:20,324
about?” “Mother, we shouldn't become Catholic
again, you know. That's why we are worried

138
00:20:20,324 --> 00:20:21,048
about.”

139
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:28,619
Babaa! Christ never started Catholicism. So
much so, they have developed a kind of a de-conditioning

140
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:38,364
of their minds, that they start seeing that
whatever these people have done so far was

141
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:45,799
wrong and that "Whatever I have done so far
was absolutely wrong and I'm not going do

142
00:20:45,824 --> 00:20:52,144
it." It's a very common thing. I have seen
the people who have worshipped Christ prefer

143
00:20:52,144 --> 00:20:57,233
to worship Ganesha and those who have worshipped
Ganesha prefer to worship Christ. [They are]

144
00:20:57,233 --> 00:21:03,424
just the same, the name is different, but
just the same, but they like it: because [to

145
00:21:03,424 --> 00:21:15,322
them] Christ means the priest, the confessions,
rosaries and also cemeteries. So they don't

146
00:21:15,347 --> 00:21:30,732
want to have. These conditionings, itself,
start showing their own forms, like devils,

147
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:35,348
and sahaja yogis want to avoid it, or have
nothing to do with them.

148
00:21:35,373 --> 00:21:41,844
I remember in the beginning, we had about
six, seven hippies from England and they had

149
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:48,024
come to Rahuri. We were having a program and
there were five, six real hippies. These were

150
00:21:48,024 --> 00:21:54,150
hippies [who] became sahaja yogis, real hippies
came to the program. I was just sitting like

151
00:21:54,175 --> 00:22:00,664
this and suddenly they said, “Ooooh nooooo!”
I said, “What has happened?” I started

152
00:22:01,184 --> 00:22:09,446
saying; as if some snake has entered or what
has happened? They were hippies, but with

153
00:22:09,471 --> 00:22:16,351
this de-conditioning of the conditions, they
just couldn't bear those same hippies - that

154
00:22:16,383 --> 00:22:30,757
they [once] were - coming inside. Because
you start seeing clearly, very clearly, that

155
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:40,413
all these conditionings had blinded us completely
and misled us into a wilderness.

156
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:50,337
Of course, about ego, in the West people are
extremely conscious. There was a leader’s

157
00:22:50,362 --> 00:22:55,253
wife. I said, “Why don't you help your husband?”
She said, “Mother, I’m worried about my

158
00:22:55,253 --> 00:23:00,194
ego.” I said, “Why?” “If I start doing
some work, this ego might develop again, so

159
00:23:00,194 --> 00:23:08,754
I'm rather worried.” They are so conscious
of it, that this ego should not come back.

160
00:23:09,474 --> 00:23:18,501
One fellow who came to Me and I was talking
to him, then he just ran away. I said, “What

161
00:23:18,526 --> 00:23:22,644
happened?” So he said, “No, those people
who go close to Mother always develop very

162
00:23:22,644 --> 00:23:29,644
bad ego. So I don't want to be there close
with Her.” So, is a such … (laughing)...

163
00:23:31,224 --> 00:23:41,598
such a mind that sees madness, that sees insanity,
that sees immaturity, it sees vulgarity, it

164
00:23:41,623 --> 00:23:50,442
sees deceit, hypocrisy, everything so clearly:
and in that state, he gets confused and quite

165
00:23:50,524 --> 00:23:56,883
upset, wants to run away from everyone.

166
00:23:56,883 --> 00:24:05,810
Then we have some sahaja yogis who have such
problems, who come to Sahaja Yoga with problems.

167
00:24:06,164 --> 00:24:11,574
Then, these people see them with these problems
they are still continuing. Now the Sahastrara

168
00:24:11,574 --> 00:24:18,304
doesn't want to accept it. “It's terrible.
I was like him. No, no, no more. Me, I don't

169
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:29,828
want to be like that.” So, they abhor the
person who was just like them; they just can't

170
00:24:29,853 --> 00:24:41,965
bear him, they just can't tolerate. Then I
would say still you have to grow. You have

171
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:53,379
to grow, your Sahastrara has to be cleansed
out at such a speed, at such a level and stage

172
00:24:53,404 --> 00:25:00,337
that, like soap cleanses everything, it should
cleanse everything else, should not be afraid

173
00:25:00,564 --> 00:25:09,799
of anything, should not have any worry about
the conditionings of others or ego of others:

174
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:12,794
that is the state now we have to reach.

175
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:26,791
Today is the Sahastrara Day, is the 23rd Sahastrara
Day and I shouldn't expect much, I don't want

176
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:35,339
to say anything much about it: but I wish
and I hope that all the thousand petals of

177
00:25:35,414 --> 00:25:42,566
your Sahastraras will be so cleansed that
you will never catch from anybody; you will

178
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:54,190
never be frightened of anybody. You will be
masters of all kinds of curatives and also

179
00:25:55,204 --> 00:26:06,509
you will be the one who can give solace, peace
to others; you will be the one who’ll be

180
00:26:06,534 --> 00:26:16,229
organising programs outside, you will the
one who will be responsible for Sahaja Yoga.

181
00:26:17,254 --> 00:26:27,316
And when that happens, then we can see that
these thousand petals of the Sahastrara have

182
00:26:27,341 --> 00:26:28,975
opened out.

183
00:26:37,404 --> 00:26:53,958
These thousand petals are not yet awakened.
They signify the different thousand powers

184
00:26:53,983 --> 00:27:08,883
of the Goddess, minimum of minimum. These
thousand ones you can open out yourself by

185
00:27:09,084 --> 00:27:17,129
introspection, by looking at yourself, making
fun of yourself.

186
00:27:17,154 --> 00:27:25,828
“Know Thyself” means know yourself with
all the defects you have and also the potential

187
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:33,572
you have and all the good points you have.
So as far as you are concerned, when you are

188
00:27:33,597 --> 00:27:40,201
looking at yourself you should just see to
the defects that you have. “Why do I behave

189
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:52,587
like this? Why do I assert so much? What's
the problem? Why can't I see myself clearly?”

190
00:27:52,724 --> 00:28:04,611
With that transparency of your Sahastrara,
you can see your heart, you can see your mind,

191
00:28:04,636 --> 00:28:14,952
you can see yourself fully, clearly, what's
wrong with you. This transparency can come

192
00:28:14,977 --> 00:28:25,396
only if you have really the pure desire,

193
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:30,361
shuddha iccha, to be of that level.

194
00:28:32,637 --> 00:28:35,599
 Now, there is no competition

195
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:46,679
between A and B. We don't say that, “You
got the first prize for coming out of the

196
00:28:46,704 --> 00:28:55,737
Sahastrara” (laughing) or we don't say,
“You have the second prize.” There's nothing

197
00:28:55,762 --> 00:29:06,630
like first, second in Sahaja Yoga, because
we are not running the race. There’s no

198
00:29:06,655 --> 00:29:14,255
competition between us. Whatever we are doing
is for our own satisfaction. Now think of

199
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:20,184
something. There are five people who are running.
Now they have to think, out of these five

200
00:29:20,184 --> 00:29:30,602
people, who goes first. Here it is the other
way round: The five people are meditating;

201
00:29:30,844 --> 00:29:40,449
now everyone individually has to see for himself
if he satisfies himself or not, nobody else

202
00:29:40,474 --> 00:29:46,323
is going to give you a certificate. It is
you who has to give certificate to yourself,

203
00:29:46,323 --> 00:29:51,254
honestly. It's a very different position.

204
00:29:51,254 --> 00:30:01,935
It is you, your Sahastrara and your attention
and you have to see, within yourself, “How

205
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:17,083
far have I realised my own powers, my own
compassion, my own personality?” You’ll

206
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:27,919
have to test it yourself. It is you are the
one who decides. When you are the one who

207
00:30:27,944 --> 00:30:38,098
is running, it is you are the one who decides
without running, then what is the question

208
00:30:38,123 --> 00:30:49,767
of competition? The whole thing disappears
into nothing.

209
00:30:50,980 --> 00:31:00,900
As I told you the other day, an analogy that,
if you are looking at the mirror, then you

210
00:31:01,432 --> 00:31:10,615
are the one who is observing, your reflection
is the one that is observed and there is the

211
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:21,319
action of seeing, so you are in 3 dimensions.
But supposing you become the mirror yourself,

212
00:31:25,478 --> 00:31:34,857
the whole process is reversed: You see yourself.
You don't have to see because you are seeing

213
00:31:34,882 --> 00:31:43,605
it all the time, it's just spontaneous. In
the same manner, when it comes to Sahastrara,

214
00:31:43,844 --> 00:31:51,630
it is your Sahastrara itself gives you the
full idea as to how you are. The diagnosis

215
00:31:51,655 --> 00:31:59,683
comes from your own Sahastrara. Your own Sahastrara
tells you what centres are catching because

216
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:08,736
all the peethas of these seven centres are
in the Sahastrara. As if the Sahastrara is

217
00:32:08,764 --> 00:32:17,018
now watching yourself and reporting to you,
“See, this is wrong with you. This is wrong

218
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:23,274
with you, this is wrong with you.” So, Sahastrara
being the best well-wisher that you have,

219
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:29,944
gives you the right information about yourself,
so the best is that you correct yourself.

220
00:32:29,944 --> 00:32:39,423
So then, achieve that perfect state: that
is what you have to do. But once you have

221
00:32:39,448 --> 00:32:47,115
achieved the perfect state, you have achieved
your aim, you have no aim left. Like the lights

222
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:53,404
now, till you have to make the lights, you
had to work hard, make the lights, put them

223
00:32:53,404 --> 00:33:01,639
right, do everything that is necessary. But
once it is made and the light comes into it,

224
00:33:01,664 --> 00:33:14,551
then the job of the light is to give the light.
So the first function is over.

225
00:33:18,175 --> 00:33:25,175
Now the second function is to give it back.

226
00:33:25,624 --> 00:33:32,174
You reach your aim, your destination. For
example, I had to come here. Alright? So I

227
00:33:32,174 --> 00:33:40,629
come all the way from My house, come in the
car, walking and come and sit down here. Now

228
00:33:40,654 --> 00:33:48,498
it’s finished that part, over. Now I don'
t have to walk, otherwise I’ll be all the

229
00:33:48,523 --> 00:34:02,032
time running. So, all this mad race of this
brain stops. For what should it be used now?

230
00:34:03,134 --> 00:34:15,669
For enjoying the peace, for enjoying the joy,
for enjoying the collectivity. So, the labour

231
00:34:15,694 --> 00:34:24,399
or the hard work or you can also say the planning
of the future finishes off. Only thing now

232
00:34:24,424 --> 00:34:28,434
you have got it, so better enjoy it.

233
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:40,639
It’s like you are coming from outside, you
are running, you are very hungry, you want

234
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:50,069
to reach home. Once you reach home, then the
food is served to you. Now what's your aim?

235
00:34:50,094 --> 00:34:56,214
Nothing, but to enjoy the food for which you
were running. But after that also, if you

236
00:34:56,214 --> 00:35:07,099
start running, then one should say it is absolute
stupidity! But the capacity of enjoyment only

237
00:35:07,124 --> 00:35:18,678
comes when your Sahastrara is absolutely open.
Otherwise the capacity to enjoy is much less

238
00:35:19,594 --> 00:35:27,175
and you become like a person who is running
all the time after something which you never

239
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:35,369
achieve. There are many like that. All their
lives they’re like mad, you know. They are

240
00:35:35,394 --> 00:35:43,538
working morning till evening, everyday, achieving
nothing! Next day again get up, again running!

241
00:35:43,563 --> 00:35:50,563
All their lives running like this till their
foot is in the grave, they are still running.

242
00:35:52,803 --> 00:36:02,008
But after getting to Sahaja Yoga, you stop
all these activities and leave it to your

243
00:36:02,033 --> 00:36:13,485
Sahaja Yoga to work, to your Sahastrara to
work it out. And it works out. You don't have

244
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:18,914
to rush. You don't have to be so competent.
You don't have to write down everything. You

245
00:36:18,939 --> 00:36:25,578
don't have to think of planning everything.
Just everything works out and it works out

246
00:36:25,603 --> 00:36:31,654
beautifully. The only thing that one has to
do is to accept whatever is happening for

247
00:36:31,654 --> 00:36:45,207
our good. Even in small, small things. For
today's delay in the puja, is the desire of

248
00:36:45,232 --> 00:36:53,449
some people who wanted to give you some sort
of a … I shouldn't say that, but some secret

249
00:36:53,474 --> 00:36:59,394
show was going to be there and they didn't
want any light. So they were thinking, “What

250
00:36:59,394 --> 00:37:03,354
will happen – the puja will be over by about
five, then by six o'clock they’ll eat their

251
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:09,584
food, but the sun would be there till nine
o'clock, then how can we show this?” All

252
00:37:09,584 --> 00:37:14,594
right, so have it in the night.

253
00:37:14,594 --> 00:37:21,594
In every small thing you will see. Some people
were coming from India and they had to bring

254
00:37:21,894 --> 00:37:28,894
My two boxes from there and they wouldn't
allow these boxes, they said it is overweight,

255
00:37:29,073 --> 00:37:33,344
overweight. So they didn't know what to do.
They thought that they should send them back

256
00:37:33,344 --> 00:37:41,949
and later on it can go till Guru puja or somewhere.
But they thought that there must be some plan,

257
00:37:41,974 --> 00:37:48,974
must be some drama. The plane was late [by]
19 hours, so they thought there must be some

258
00:37:49,334 --> 00:38:01,439
drama; and then they were put into some sort
of a tourist hotel for that night. Next morning

259
00:38:01,464 --> 00:38:16,105
they met two other Indians from, sahaja yogis,
from Poona, two boys. That settled it! My

260
00:38:16,144 --> 00:38:24,008
luggage, they could put it in their name and
that’s how the luggage came in. But they

261
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:31,033
never felt bored: 19 hours. “We had nice
time, Mother, together. We were enjoying and

262
00:38:31,303 --> 00:38:37,174
talking,” finished! Nobody feels the time
is passing out. Otherwise, anybody else would

263
00:38:37,174 --> 00:38:48,933
have eaten up all the airport personnel and
would have broken all the telephones. Waiting

264
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:52,484
for 19hours, “My God, what is this!!”
Would have given it in the newspapers. Everybody

265
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:59,334
… this is the greatest crime! While these
were enjoying life nicely.

266
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:09,903
So, we have lost now the sense of aim. We
don't have any aims. We just want to enjoy.

267
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:20,809
It’s a very, very big thing that has happened
because, as you know, the joy in the Sahastrara

268
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:33,899
is nira-ananda, nira-ananda. Of course, Nira
is My name also, but it means pure absolute

269
00:39:33,924 --> 00:39:47,689
joy. Nira-ananda. And that nirananda, that
joy has no other hues. It’s just pure, pure

270
00:39:47,714 --> 00:39:56,909
joy. Without thinking, it just pours into
it. After all, every activity is for what,

271
00:39:56,934 --> 00:40:04,707
for getting some sort of a pleasure, sensation
and also, some people believe, for joy. It’s

272
00:40:04,732 --> 00:40:05,604
not.

273
00:40:05,909 --> 00:40:11,324
Only after the opening of Sahastrara and the
cleansing of it, then you will know what is

274
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:12,199
joy.

275
00:40:12,405 --> 00:40:18,893
You can't explain it, how you can spend hours
together like this. People don't understand.

276
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:23,674
Like even our mayor was telling Me that, “We
can't sit in the church for more than fifteen

277
00:40:23,674 --> 00:40:31,849
minutes. And how people are sitting here for
so many hours. Fifteen minutes we cannot sit,

278
00:40:31,874 --> 00:40:38,664
but how these people are sitting for such
a long time. What are they doing there? What

279
00:40:38,664 --> 00:40:44,514
is their entertainment? How can they sit for
hours together, without saying anything, without

280
00:40:44,514 --> 00:40:51,514
dropping even a pin, they are just all the
time there. So what have you given them? What

281
00:40:51,594 --> 00:41:01,140
is happening to them?” This is very surprising
and remarkable that these people, who are

282
00:41:01,165 --> 00:41:06,874
not even sahaja yogis, can see clearly that
you people are least bothered, you are absolutely

283
00:41:06,874 --> 00:41:14,528
enjoying life. Whatever you may be doing is
not important, what is important is that,

284
00:41:14,553 --> 00:41:22,339
whether you are working in the office or outside,
you are full of joy, enjoying everything.

285
00:41:22,964 --> 00:41:29,964
This is the most important thing in life,
which you can have only through Sahaja Yoga,

286
00:41:30,553 --> 00:41:36,424
because your Sahastraras are open, because
they are opened out.

287
00:41:36,424 --> 00:41:44,594
There is now one more thing I have to tell
you, that is very important for all of you

288
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:56,696
to remember: that, while living in this Ocean
of Joy, we have to remember that there are

289
00:41:56,721 --> 00:42:03,919
many who have not yet jumped into it, so we
have to bring them in; and it’s such a pleasure,

290
00:42:03,944 --> 00:42:10,944
such a joy to give realisation to someone,
extremely joyful.

291
00:42:11,023 --> 00:42:19,900
So we need people who would come and say that
“We’ll definitely come for this [work].”

292
00:42:23,127 --> 00:42:32,701
I mean, they should really come forward and,
once they come forward, you'll be amazed how

293
00:42:32,726 --> 00:42:41,049
things will work out. There are many, I know,
who are going all over, everywhere and spreading

294
00:42:41,074 --> 00:42:48,569
Sahaja Yoga. So is very important for all
of you to know that you have got the light

295
00:42:48,594 --> 00:42:55,334
to be given to others. Come forward. Don't
have fear of your ego, conditionings, nothing.

296
00:42:55,334 --> 00:43:01,763
Come forward. You have all the strength, you
have everything within yourself and you will

297
00:43:01,763 --> 00:43:08,344
do everything with such happiness and joy.
Everywhere, in every country people are doing

298
00:43:08,344 --> 00:43:13,384
that, but some of them are doing, some of
them are not doing. All of you are quite capable

299
00:43:13,384 --> 00:43:22,515
of doing it, so please come forward and see
for yourself what you are capable of.

300
00:43:23,214 --> 00:43:29,904
First of all you should have faith in yourself.
If you have no faith in yourself, you cannot

301
00:43:31,706 --> 00:43:41,887
do anything. Have faith. You should have no
fears of any kind. And also to introspect,

302
00:43:41,912 --> 00:43:52,122
to see within yourself what's going on. To
be very frank, I find My brain absolutely

303
00:43:52,147 --> 00:43:58,484
empty. What I talk from this emptiness, I
don't know. You will also find your brain

304
00:43:58,484 --> 00:44:08,339
absolutely empty, and still with that empty
brain, you will be achieving a lot.

305
00:44:08,364 --> 00:44:14,324
It’s very remarkable, as you have seen,
that from the candle you get cool breeze.

306
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:20,504
How you can get it from the candle, cool breeze?
You do get.

307
00:44:20,813 --> 00:44:34,294
So, is important to recognise yourself as
a Sahaja yogi and to recognise - what have

308
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:42,806
you done for Sahaja Yoga? Without doing for
Sahaja Yoga, you cannot enjoy life. That was

309
00:44:42,831 --> 00:44:50,154
your aim and that aim you have reached. Now,
if you don't...supposing I have to come and

310
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:54,354
sit on this thing and I don't sit on this
thing, then what's the use of coming here?

311
00:44:55,169 --> 00:45:02,652
I came here to tell you something about Sahastrara
and if I don't tell you, then what's the use

312
00:45:02,677 --> 00:45:09,063
of My coming here and celebrating Sahastrara
Day? In the same way, when you have reached

313
00:45:09,063 --> 00:45:14,414
that state now, what you have to do is not
to use for your own purpose. You have used

314
00:45:14,414 --> 00:45:20,434
it, quite a lot, for your health, wealth,
everything. Now what are we doing about Sahaja

315
00:45:20,434 --> 00:45:28,434
Yoga? What have we done for Sahaja Yoga? After
some time, you will do a lot and you will

316
00:45:28,504 --> 00:45:34,543
never know you have done anything for Sahaja
Yoga. Very surprising, it happens to so many

317
00:45:34,543 --> 00:45:44,069
of you and should happen to all of you. I
hope all of you will realise that your Sahastraras

318
00:45:44,094 --> 00:45:49,594
are cleaned, completely. You are perfectly
alright. You don't have to worry about it

319
00:45:49,594 --> 00:45:56,594
and you can really go ahead with spreading
of Sahaja Yoga.

320
00:45:58,086 --> 00:46:00,086
May God bless you all.
