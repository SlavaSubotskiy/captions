Archive video: H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi at Conference 1985 0701 in International Press Center, Brussels (Belgium).

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,892
1985-0701 Press Conference Brussels Belgium DP-RAW

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,892
Shri Mataji: How do we start, am I suppose to say something about Kundalini?

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,892
Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji we would like to know   Shri Mataji Hmm Yogi: By your voice something about

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,892
Shri Mataji: You have told them already? I can I think they can ask me questions if you have already told them they know of the subject

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:31,892
Journalists discussing something among themselves Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon Journalist: says something Shri Mataji: Me?

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,892
Journalist: They would like to hear from you Shri Mataji

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,892
Shri Mataji: I see, I don�t know how what he has told you,

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:06,892
but I have come here to tell you about something that may be good for all our problems in the west.

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:22,892
The western mind has grown just like a tree has grown outside, without going into the roots,

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:42,892
so the outgrown tree has to know about the roots, and thus we are waiting for a shock.

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,892
Recently I have been to America and I feel that the danger to America is not from outside but from inside.

16
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,892
They have been indulging into things without knowing what relationship it has to the whole,

17
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:47,892
so the need of today is to know why we have these maladies. Where are we going?

18
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:11,892
I have been searching within human beings the problem in a different way, inside them,

19
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:25,892
I did my medicine and just to talk to `doctors and through meditative methods penetrating,

20
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:40,892
I tried to find out why human beings are diverted from real reality.

21
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:52,892
There are two categories of human beings actually, only two.

22
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:02,892
One category who has human awareness, human awareness,

23
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:20,892
and the other category is a special category I call it, who can be called as people who are realised souls,

24
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:31,892
(they all understand English that�s good).

25
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,892
This is a special category which is mentioned in all the religions, by all the prophets,

26
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:57,892
everyone has talked about this date, Tao, Zen, Buddha, Mahavira, Christ of course, everyone has talked about it.

27
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:16,892
What is gone wrong with religions is that, that they have not tried to find out their spirit,

28
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,892
the essence of it, they lost the point?

29
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:42,892
Now supposing if there is something called as spiritual awareness or a super awareness,

30
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,892
supposing, take a hypothesis, you have to keep your mind open as scientists.

31
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,892
If what I am saying if I can prove it to you, then you accept it but don�t keep your mind closed.

32
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:23,892
Even scientists are very much conditioned by science.

33
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,892
Science is a mental projection, it�s just a mental projection and whatever is in the nature that is what they discover,

34
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,892
they cannot create even a stone, we cannot create even a stone.

35
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,892
They must accept, we can analyse, we can find out whatever is in nature

36
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:00,892
but it is just a mental projection which is limited and which is linear.

37
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,892
Because of its linear movement it recoils back upon us, it cannot sustain itself,

38
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,892
so science has produced atom bomb and we are frightened of it,

39
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,892
now computer will produce another problem, one after another we�ll have problems after problems

40
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,892
machines have produced problems, we have acid drinks, the development,

41
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:36,892
the whole economic development ends up into a problem, plastic has produced problems for us.

42
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:57,892
Because we, it is not related to reality

43
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:11,892
Even when Confucius talked of humanism it was needed at that time when people were lethargic,

44
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,892
but the way people have developed themselves now, without any relationship to reality

45
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,892
or to the whole we have become malignant in a way in for trouble

46
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,892
and the trouble is we are not aware till it blasts off.

47
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,892
Without the transformation of human beings from within not only talking about it,

48
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,892
what we need is a transformation in our awareness,

49
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:56,892
so we have to see with an open mind if it is feasible if it exists with an open mind.

50
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:08,892
I think all thinking people should try to see if there is a possibility or not,

51
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,892
if so then we think positively about it, if so, how do we achieve it.

52
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,892
It�s a natural process within us built in, a living process

53
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,892
by which we have become human beings from amoeba stage,

54
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,892
and the second stage whatever if it is so, again I keep it as a hypothesis,

55
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:56,892
has to happen has to happen naturally, has to happen spontaneously.

56
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:15,892
But in the human stage, it is little different from the animal stage, a fish came out of the sea, one fish,

57
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,892
then ten followed, then hundreds and then a shoal of fishes followed.

58
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,892
But human beings not easy, because they have the freedom to decide,

59
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,892
they have freedom and their freedom is to be respected if they have to have ultimate freedom.

60
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,892
And very difficult for human beings to accept that anybody can tell them about it, very difficult,

61
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:07,892
that�s why they crucified Christ, poisoned Mohammed Saheb, tortured Buddha, Mahavira, they cannot accept.

62
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:37,892
When I was born, I tried to really understand human beings, and this big problem that they have,

63
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:48,892
so I thought no use talking about, the best thing is those who are born on the ground

64
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,892
are to be elevated at least on the second or third story so they know there is something beyond.
77
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:05,892
That�s the best way one can manage.

65
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:13,892
But the problem was that here is what you see is the seventh centre, within us the subtle centre was not opened.

66
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,892
It was to be opened. Where you get your baptism to actualise not artificial baptism,

67
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,892
it�s a real a baptism (beg your pardon),

68
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:43,892
so when that happened I could manage the awakening of this dormant energy within us

69
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,892
which is actually, whatever I am saying you should not take it for granted,

70
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,892
I am again saying with the open mind, it�s the knowledge of the roots.

71
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:05,892
Is the this is the power which expresses the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us.

72
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:19,892
Christ was given hardly three and a half years to talk, it�s no time for Christ to tell all these things,

73
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:29,892
and they crucified him. For four years I was struggling with seven British hippies

74
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,892
couldn�t do anything with them, because first of all, they do not have the tradition of our seeking,

75
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,892
they have no tradition, they have a desire but no tradition, they don�t understand what to seek,

76
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:52,892
what to achieve, there is no tradition at all, because the tradition is to grow outside not inside inward.

77
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,892
And this is like a plumule in a seed, which is to be awakened, it awakens

78
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,892
and pierces through your fontanelle bone area and you can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head you do feel.

79
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,892
It�s an experience, it may happen it may not happen you cannot be guaranteed.

80
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,892
but it happened to so many in Europe, I should say so many in America.

81
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,892
In India, it is in thousands, thousands because they have the tradition.

82
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,892
And it will work very fast in India, I know that very easy to work it out there,

83
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,892
people are not that materialistic, I mean here when I come in the west people say there is poverty,

84
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,892
we don�t think we are poor I don�t know what makes people think we are poor, which way,

85
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,892
we are much more generous than any other country people are, very generous people,

86
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,892
you go to an ordinary Indian, he would love to look after you, we are very happy joyous festive people,

87
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:26,892
here I find everybody so miserable, le miserable. They are satisfied people.

88
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,892
What is in matter, do you think you can get joy out of this matter alright a little bit we need for comfort,

89
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,892
we can sit on the ground in India, we don�t have such bad weather,

90
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,892
that all the time you have to cover yourself, we can live under a tree

91
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:55,892
and there is no poverty of the heart. Others are more concerned about our poverty

92
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,892
and also they do not want to think why we are poor because we were aggressed for three hundred years,

93
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,892
at least for three hundred years, you can imagine,

94
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:19,892
and also left all the funny things of materialism like you will be amazed that

95
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,892
in my father�s house I had never known locking the houses or theft or bribery we never knew,

96
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:36,892
all this was left behind by the British. So, we are still suffering the pangs you see of that slavery,

97
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:47,892
but the Indians as they live in the villages, these are the unknown Indians, they are very different.

98
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,892
Because materialism without relationship to the spirit can be very dangerous, we see that we see that.

99
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,892
Now you know there are diseases coming up in America and when I went there,

100
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,892
they said to me we have right to destroy ourselves what do you say to that, then I said alright you go ahead with it.

101
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:39,892
The positive attitude towards life if it is lost through materialism is better not to have it.

102
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,892
The attitude should be positive, constructive.

103
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:55,892
There�s no love there�s no compassion there�s no heart in the life, people are so frustrated, disgusted, unhappy.

104
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,892
Actually, I never had in my mind to come to the west but my husband got elected to this job by

105
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,892
134 nations elected him and I was forced to come to London.

106
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:34,892
That�s how I am here and I see it and I feel it that there are great saints born in this country great people,

107
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,892
great seekers you see those people who are taking now drugs and all that are seekers you must know they are seekers,

108
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:50,892
very beautiful people they are in heart, very nice people, they are to be saved. It has to be done.

109
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,892
In sahaja yoga when it happens you�ll be surprised overnight people have given up drugs, overnight,

110
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:11,892
overnight, people have been cured of incurable diseases like cancer so many diseases,

111
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,892
but AIDS, we have cured AIDS, you�ll be surprised but,

112
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,892
it is not that we should say that I have cured but this energy which is residual within you when

113
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,892
it awakens it nourishes you, by that nourishment you just get cured physically.

114
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,892
Mentally you get peaceful and it is not just talk it is actualization it�s becoming

115
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,892
that is what every human being can become, a little breakthrough is needed,

116
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,892
that�s how every human being can become that.

117
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,892
Now see our political systems are fighting for nothing at all, it�s all mental I think,

118
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:14,892
like we say somebody is a capitalist, a communist and this and that it is it�s not reality

119
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,892
I would say that I am the greatest capitalist I feel because I know everything about it, I have

120
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,892
all the powers I am the greatest communist because I must share it,

121
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,892
everything integrates once you become the spirit, everything, all these theories which have failed,

122
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:41,892
which we think look like just the words become reality when you become the spirit.

123
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,892
But one must turn one�s attention to it, it�s very difficult to break

124
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:56,892
because all our attention is involved into all useless things which are fruitless, joyless pursuits.

125
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:06,892
It is very difficult to turn I mean especially with journalism I find in the west is brought up in a very different manner.

126
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,892
I mean if Brussels journalist could do some justice to me I�ll be thankful

127
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,892
but I must say that countries of tradition like Italy have come along

128
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,892
because they are traditional they understand serenity, they understand auspiciousness,

129
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,892
they understand also holiness, sacredness, still surprisingly.

130
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:48,892
And I am sure one day everybody will pay some attention and you can�t pay for it,

131
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,892
you see how have gurus here this kind of a thing that kind of thing where people make money,

132
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,892
lynch others, is cannot do these things cannot do these things this is so spontaneous it�s your own

133
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,892
this is what you have to get.

134
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,892
And for that you cannot be obliged to anyone it is just your own like one light which is enlightened

135
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:25,892
if it enlightens another candle it doesn�t oblige it is just ready gets it, it�s no obligation nothing.

136
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,892
And Mohammed Saheb has specially said about it I must say I don�t know what the Muslims are doing

137
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,892
I mean they are all one better than the other all this fundamentalist better not deal with them,

138
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,892
but He himself has said that at the time of resurrection your hands will speak,

139
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,892
He has spoken more about resurrection than about doom�s day,

140
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,892
but they want to talk about doomsday because they can frighten people you see and develop their fundamentalism

141
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,892
not only Muslims everybody is like that, and nobody has done justice to their leaders

142
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,892
or to their prophets or to their incarnations nobody has done. They have nothing to do with them,

143
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,892
Christ himself has said, you �ll be calling me Christ, Christ I won�t recognize,

144
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,892
He has clearly said, you are to be born again so they certified themselves I am born again

145
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:21,892
I am baptized you cannot certify like that, you have to be, to be honest one has to be.

146
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,892
A dog cannot certify itself that I am a human being, can it?

147
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:34,892
Supposing it certifies it cannot be, he has to become.

148
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,892
Now you ask me questions because you see the thing is the subject matter is so big

149
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,892
and I have dealt in thousands and thousands of lectures and things and

150
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,892
so the best thing would be to ask questions about this will be a good idea.

151
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,892
Journalist: How did you discover this?

152
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,892
Shri Mataji: You see that I discovered because I have certain methods of doing it.

153
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,892
They say supposing somebody is a scientist and you are not a scientist so how can the scientist tell you how did I discover,

154
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:19,892
but I told you in way that I know how to do it I can know the inside of human being somehow,

155
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,892
but I have that within me what can I do if I have? Alright?

156
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,892
Journalist: What is the difference between what you are telling us and what all the yogis of the tradition

157
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,892
of the world telling this scheme appears to be in all books about yoga.

158
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,892
Shri Mataji: No the books you all have read are not traditional none of them is traditional,

159
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,892
you see about a hundred years back this some new stuff came in, I am amazed at what I tell you

160
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,892
and because the western mind is extrovert and extrovert mind always likes new things,

161
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,892
anything new, you see you tell them you put a tin on your head they�ll put it,

162
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,892
you tell them you make your hair like this they�ll make it, I mean it�s something new all the time they go to,

163
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:26,892
whatever you know about the traditional yoga it�s not, if you read Patanjali its very different from what you do in yoga.

164
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:34,892
He never talked of all these asanas you do to that extent, actually it was it is very recent I would not even say hundred years.

165
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,892
One fellow went to the Himalayas and was discarded by all the realized souls there.

166
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,892
He came down and he started writing about these asanas actually, it is all related to your chakras,

167
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:59,892
we too use asanas but how, when the kundalini rises we know on what centre it stops,

168
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,892
then we know how to correct that centre, supposing it is a physical problem then you have to do a particular asana,

169
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,892
but supposing you have a problem in the stomach and you do the asana for some other chakra what�s the use?

170
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,892
It�s a science, if you read Patanjali the whole book is like this in Sanskrit language,

171
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:25,892
it�s not translated in English the whole of it not at all and this one was a long time back,

172
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,892
fourteen thousand years back they mentioned kundalini,

173
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,892
sixteen thousand I would say Markandya was sixteen thousand years back he mentioned kundalini,

174
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,892
kundalini is the basis but about a hundred years back people started talking about all kind of nonsense.

175
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,892
Even in India, westernized Indians are impressed by all these kind of things. I went to Puna,

176
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,892
I was surprised people were having paralysis this that.

177
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,892
I said that how is it you have got all these problems, people said ah our guru has taught us all this.

178
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,892
What is your guru? What did he tell you?

179
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,892
They gave me names like Shaktipaya, Taruopaya, Darunopaya, this that, I said

180
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,892
I never heard of where did you learn this thing. They gave me one book,

181
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,892
which was written only seventy years back by some crazy fellow,

182
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,892
which is not mentioned anywhere in the thing, I mean

183
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,892
if you read even Adi Shankaracharya he has talked about it, Chaitanya lahari and all,

184
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:28,892
but that�s the sixth century. Kabira, now Kabira is much later, Nanaka throughout,

185
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,892
but how people can change it into something funny you see like the Greeks changed all the Gods

186
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,892
into something stupid like Kabira talked of this as a surati, called it as surati,

187
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,892
this kundalini as surati. Kabira called, but do you know when he was born in Bihar

188
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,892
they called tobacco as surati now what do you say to that.

189
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,892
Christ has talked about it, even Bible, I will appear before you like tongues of flames

190
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,892
He has said about the tree of fire, this is the same thing.

191
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,892
But according to time people have talked this was a secret knowledge for quite some time in India,

192
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:26,892
but it became quite an eloquent I think at the time of Adi Shankaracharya to begin with

193
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,892
but Kabira and Nanaka have already said it clearly. What about the Sikhs?

194
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,892
Do they know anything about it? It�s all they read from one page to another in two and a half hours the whole thing they can read.

195
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,892
But they miss all the points, you see reading is not the way to know it. It has to happen.

196
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,892
Like supposing you have a headache and I say you take Anacin

197
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,892
and you go on reading I take Anacin I take Anacin will it, it will work out?

198
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,892
So the knowledge that you have got about yoga books is only about hundred years old

199
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,892
which I don�t know from where it has come, when I read it I am amazed and I have read ,

200
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,892
seen such a thick book written on kundalini that the kundalini is in the stomach ,

201
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,892
it is not you can see at the times sometimes in some people when the centre of nabhi

202
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,892
or the centre of the solar plexus is under pressure

203
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,892
you can see even the pulsation of the kundalini very clearly on this triangular bone, very clearly,

204
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,892
but I would say even the Greeks knew about it because they called this bone as sacrum,

205
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,892
sacrum meaning sacred, they knew about it

206
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:41,892
definitely otherwise why did they call this bone sacrum.

207
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,892
Athena itself the Ath, Ath means primordial and Athena is the one stands with a snake-like

208
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,892
thing in her hand and with all the centres showing in her hand,

209
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,892
if you see the I have seen the I have been to Greece I know,

210
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,892
but all that was sort of brought down to some sort of a level which I don�t know understand

211
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:15,892
what should I call it we call it supra-conscious level, it is something on the right-hand side movement.

212
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,892
Or the left side movement as we call it as the subconscious or the collective subconscious

213
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,892
because they could not move higher they started giving supra-conscious aa experiences

214
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,892
and the collective subconscious experiences which are very dangerous very dangerous

215
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,892
like parapsychology now, how to convince them it is a collective subconscious entry

216
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:50,892
which is very dangerous. That cancer is triggered by that, how to tell them?

217
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,892
By entering into the collective sub-conscious, you will be amazed that people are such closed about things

218
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,892
There were four great scientists came to India to talk to me from America

219
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,892
and they wanted to become I don�t know what, they said we want to have that consciousness by which

220
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,892
you become subtle you can go to moon you can go to the sun.

221
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,892
I said why you are already flying in the air why do you want to become that.

222
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,892
They said no we want to become subtle personalities to go into the air if I do this. I said but why?

223
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,892
They said because Russians are doing it. I said they are doing wrong they�ll all suffer and you will also suffer.

224
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,892
I said who told you this, they gave a name of a journalist in India called Patanjali.

225
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,892
I said I am amazed at Patanjali himself because he was suffering from this kind of a disease,

226
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,892
and his wife came to me and I cured him now do you want me to put the disease into you.

227
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,892
It�s very dangerous to play about with the subconscious and the collective subconscious

228
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,892
or supra-conscious or the collective supra-conscious.

229
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,892
You are lost you do not know what you are doing.

230
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,892
That�s what some of these false and fake gurus and all these people

231
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:17,892
who are very powerful here are using that mesmerism, ESP all this is the same.

232
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:28,892
Thank God now we have published a book in French which you can see yourself and read.

233
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,892
Yes Journalist: Difference between what you are doing and certain other eastern religions in the west is that you don�t ask money

234
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,892
Shri Mataji: No no no how can you pay money? How can you pay money for? Now say

235
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,892
I am saying it�s a living process let be wise about it,

236
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,892
now If it�s the mother earth she is sprouting a seed, do we pay anything to the mother earth?

237
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,892
Do we? And be wise about it how can you pay for it? It is invaluable,

238
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,892
how much did we pay to become human beings from the monkey stage? Did we pay?

239
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,892
Let�s take it that way, I mean I am asking you a simple question.

240
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,892
It�s a living process how can you pay for it?

241
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,892
I, at the most you can pay for my ticket to the aero for the aeroplane, at the most I mean

242
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,892
if you have to pay anything that you can pay?

243
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,892
Journalist: You are too rich Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon Journalist: You are too rich

244
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:40,892
Shri Mataji: Luckily this time I am born in a rich family. I come from a royal family in India

245
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,892
which has a calendar and also my husband is quite well off and a generous man and he believes,

246
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,892
he believes that that�s the only way it can work out, he believes in Sahaja yoga,

247
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:02,892
he is a great sustenance for me. I live alright and you will also live alright.

248
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,892
For this, you don�t have to pay.

249
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,892
Krishna has said �Yog kashem vahameyam� when you get yoga real union, He looks after you

250
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,892
and wellbeing everything physical, mental, emotional, even material.

251
00:35:21,000 --> 00:39:57,892
Because you become such a satisfied soul also, now as you see me,
278
00:39:58,000 --> 00:35:35,892
I come from a rich family so called my husband is rich my house in London could be called as

252
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,892
a mini palace sort of a place may be, well I can live anywhere, I can live on the street

253
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,892
I can live in the jungles, this body of mine is very good it doesn�t trouble me at all

254
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:56,892
it�s comfortable anywhere. I am not bothered about what I eat, what I do, not bothered.

255
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,892
Comfort is another slavery, I mean those who sit on the chair cannot sit on the ground,

256
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:12,892
the chair comes on our head, the more we try to be comfortable the worst it is.

257
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,892
But the body can be your slave I mean it�s just it is for you, you are not for the body.

258
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,892
Journalist: But certain others like Bhagwan they do ask money

259
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,892
Shri Mataji: Babba don�t bring these controversial people it is how can it be?

260
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,892
Just tell me how can it be? They ask, let them ask, what to do, they will go with its all wrong,

261
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,892
you are people so naive, why do you give them? You are so naive,

262
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:58,892
like one fellow came to London and he said if you give me the 59th Rolls Royce then I�ll come, can you imagine,

263
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,892
ninth Rolls Royce, so the poor boy so sweet of them but stupid also,

264
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,892
starved themselves for one year, bought a Rolls Royce for him when this great man came in

265
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:21,892
and the big journalist of London and everybody was there to take photographs of the Rolls Royce.

266
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,892
And when some of the Sahaja yogis approached them they said why you want to give him a Rolls Royce

267
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,892
they said Rolls Royce is a metal we are giving him the metal he gives us the spirit.

268
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,892
How can you convert metal into the spirit? Can you?

269
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:46,892
You are intelligent people you have to tell them that it�s not possible to convert metal into

270
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:55,892
that�s why they are very angry with me all of them, you see after all you see are all very against me but what to do?

271
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,892
Yes, please Journalist: People do feel themselves

272
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:13,892
and realize themselves what are the means that like what are the exercises like in the traditional yoga

273
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,892
Shri Mataji: No, No you see there is no exercise it is effortless,

274
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,892
Sahaj, sah means with, sah means with, ja means born, is born with you, no nothing has to be done.

275
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:36,892
The realization goes into first the step of awakening when the kundalini herself comes up alright.

276
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:45,892
Now the advantage of this is like a lamp which is dirty, or something wrong with the lamp,

277
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,892
if you put a little light in it, it can see for itself, what�s wrong with me alright?

278
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,892
So, you start cleansing yourself, like you become your own guru you become your own master.

279
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,892
But first little light must come, that�s important, that�s the only job I do

280
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:12,892
the rest of it you look after. You have to become your own guru.

281
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:28,892
It�s not only I, supposing you get it and you master it, then you, you can do it,

282
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,892
we �ve one gentleman in India, he is just a farmer, has given realization to ten thousand people.

283
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,892
Well here is Dr Warren I don�t know how many people he has given realization I don�t keep count of it

284
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,892
because we have no organisation as such, we have no membership nothing of that kind.

285
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,892
We don�t have any organisation as such we have another Doctor here sitting.

286
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,892
Journalist: You have centres different? Shri Mataji: Yes centres we have,

287
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,892
but it�s not like the centres that others have, its actually like people when they are living in a place you see,

288
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,892
they pay the rent of the place, they manage I don�t know how they live they share among themselves,

289
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:28,892
the rent as well as the food and that they call as the centre.

290
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,892
They become so collective and you should see the joy that flows between them,

291
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,892
a person going from here to India and in India the people waiting for him to come a Sahaja yogi

292
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,892
is coming to the whole world becomes your family.

293
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,892
Journalist: Why don�t you call it an ashram? Shri Mataji: Hmm? Beg your pardon

294
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,892
Journalist: Why don�t you call it an ashram?                Why don't you call it an ashram? These centres.

295
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,892
Shri Mataji: We do, do call ashram, ashram also we call it, we call it ashram also we call it ashram,

296
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,892
also centres. If it�s a small place where only people can come to visit,

297
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,892
then it is a centre see whatever you may call that makes no difference.

298
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:19,892
We have ashrams everywhere except here we don�t have but hope to establish one here, we have just a centre.

299
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:36,892
We have an ashram in Italy where else, we have an ashram in Austria very good ashram,

300
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,892
we have a very good one in Switzerland. In England, we have five of them.

301
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,892
France, we have a very nice ashram.

302
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:16,892
It�s not just a lip service it�s an actualization, lip service, just talking about, it�s not just the theory,

303
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,892
it�s just the actualization, because you are that I mean it�s nothing difficult, you are all that,

304
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:30,892
just you have to have what you have, that�s all, you have to be aware of it that�s all.

305
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,892
It�s so simple that�s why people don�t like it You see if we tell them you can eat like this

306
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,892
no they don�t want to they want to eat this way that way that way (laughs),

307
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,892
what can we do about its very simple has to be because it is so vital like our breathing,

308
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,892
supposing for our breathing you have to read a yoga and go to a guru pay him thousand pounds,

309
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:01,892
how many will exist, it is so vital, and the time has come, this is the time,

310
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,892
the time, it�s all mentioned thousands of years back, if you heard about Bhrigumani,

311
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,892
he has written a complete book called as Nadi Granth,

312
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,892
about these times everything described Sahaja yoga everything,

313
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:23,892
even 100 years back I would say William Blake has described everything about Sahaja yoga everything,

314
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,892
but people called him crazy, they like people like Barron all imaginary people.

315
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:49,892
Journalist: William Blake was a poet and poetical mystic, are you mystic as well?

316
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,892
Shri Mataji: I don�t know what to call myself it�s very difficult (Laughs)

317
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,892
Journalist: You know what mysticism is? Shri Mataji: I know aha

318
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:05,892
you can call me everything I think, it�s quite an integration of so many things I have,

319
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,892
but I would like to call myself as the Mother that�s the sweetest and the best I think

320
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:18,892
because I am very patient, perhaps am extremely forgiving.

321
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,892
Journalist: And how does a Mother bring the light to Her children?

322
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:47,892
Shri Mataji: It�s a re-birth, re-birth and the birth is given by the Mother only, Father can�t give the birth.

323
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,892
It�s an immaculate re-birth.

324
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,892
Journalist: Once this re-birth has taken place, you�ll have two minds two ways of living

325
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,892
so no alcohol no drinks, how to move

326
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,892
Shri Mataji: No I don�t tell anything like that before that, but you just give up yourself

327
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,892
I don�t say anything, you just give up yourself, whatever is not good for you, you just give up

328
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,892
because you become joy, start feeling the cool breeze of the `Holy Ghost this gives you vibrations

329
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,892
and you don�t want to do anything like that, now for example if you ask me to take to drugs

330
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,892
I will not I mean I am never tempted for alcohol or any I am never tempted to anything

331
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,892
I am just don�t get tempted or anything you just don�t do it yourself because if you are the spirit

332
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,892
you are so detached. If you become the spirit you become the glory of the spirit,

333
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,892
you have the powers of the spirit, you become such a great personality yourself.

334
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:52,892
You just don�t do it, I don�t have to tell you, I don�t force anything whatsoever.

335
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:00,892
You become yourselves that�s only when you become yourself you are great no doubt about it.

336
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,892
It�s a very revolutionary time, \{year\}very revolutionary you should see

337
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,892
the signs of revolution we never had so many seekers we never had so many confusions

338
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:26,892
so many problems and in that confusion only, the lotus of your spirit is going to shine.

339
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:35,892
We say in Sanskrit that only in the mud and mire of confusion the lotus is born.

340
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,892
It cannot be a money making proposition I mean that you must have understood now,

341
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,892
cannot be and it has to be effortless, and you get empowered by it you see

342
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,892
if you say I am twice-born alright you certify, but what is your power?

343
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,892
If you are twice-born what do you know? You actually become, become, again I say become is very important

344
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,892
that on your central nervous system you can feel another person,

345
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,892
on your fingertips you can feel the centres of another person and your own,

346
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,892
now only thing what you have to know and get it corrected, that�s all

347
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,892
if you know the method it is finished, hardly you take a month at the most to know about.

348
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,892
Journalist: Can you explain to people, for instance, tonight in Brussels?

349
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,892
Shri Mataji: Yes I, I decode things now for example now supposing this centre is catching

350
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,892
this centre is catching supposing you are feeling the burning on these centres then what does it mean,

351
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,892
I am just decoding it, and then they verify it and is a fact it works out.

352
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,892
We are the real computer I tell you only we are to be put to the mains.

353
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,892
We are the masters of all the computers, we have created computers,

354
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,892
but we become the divine computers and there is divine all-pervading power

355
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,892
which does all living work like these flowers, flowers becoming fruits, we cannot do even one,

356
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,892
and when that starts flowing through us must only know how to manoeuvre it.

357
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:31,892
We are to be put to the mains, that�s the point is, and this kundalini acts like a chord.

358
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,892
It is there in all of us.

359
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:44,892
First, it was just people told about it, talked about it, and one or two flowers on the tree of life I should say.

360
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,892
It was a secret also, but now blossom time, so many flowers have to become fruits,

361
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,892
real blossom time, I tell you, beautiful people, we have in this world.

362
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:07,892
They are unknown but they are beautiful people. Sinister people are very few actually,

363
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,892
those who have made our lives miserable,

364
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,892
but we can outwit them once we get aware of ourselves we can outwit all of them.

365
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:26,892
Nobody can touch us, and there is divine power and such blessings you can�t believe it

366
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,892
the miracles of Sahaja Yoga you cannot believe it.

367
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,892
Today only when I came in the morning one of the Sahaja Yogi�s was standing very close to the car

368
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,892
and the whole of Mercedes went over his foot and nothing happened to his foot, nothing,

369
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:57,892
he didn�t even get the pain, we saw it, it is, God is very great He�s the He�s the real charismatic personality you can�t think of.

370
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,892
You can�t imagine how great he is we just have to know Him,

371
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,892
but when you talk of God in these modern times people don�t want to hear from you.

372
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,892
It�s not fanaticism it�s not all that non-sense its actualization.

373
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,892
Journalist: Did you meet the Pope anytime? Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon

374
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,892
Journalist: Did you meet the Pope anytime? Or did you think of meeting him?

375
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:41,892
Shri Mataji: Oh, (laugh) They are just the same, actually I met Pope much earlier,

376
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,892
that you need not write I am just telling you, when I went to Poland,

377
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:55,892
I went on 1st of September to Poland about just before he became the Pope,

378
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:04,892
I don�t remember the year and because my husband is a VIP and all that is they asked me

379
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,892
where would you like to go so I said I would like to see a good church and an organ

380
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,892
so they took me to Cracow while my husband went for his own work,

381
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,892
and there it was this gentle man was a cardinal, I raised his Kundalini alright

382
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,892
but I didn�t tell him because I mean he won�t take it from me anything, it does,

383
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,892
it did pierce no doubt it did pierce, it comes up sometimes but then again it goes down,

384
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:41,892
I am sorry but that�s what it is, so to become a Pope is very easy, very easy,

385
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,892
I mean to become a Pope what is so great I mean you can be elected human made its a manmade stuff,

386
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:57,892
for God made, you have to little bit work it out, that�s what has happened in his case I wish,

387
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:04,892
sometimes he does gives vibrations, again it stops again he has to work it out.

388
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,892
I went to Cracow but it was so it was so, it was so historical I should say

389
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,892
because it was the first of September and I was very sad, and my husband said why are you so sad

390
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,892
I said this country must be very sad on this day sometime,

391
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,892
and then we discovered it was the day first day when it was bombed, Warsaw was bombed

392
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:32,892
and eighth of September is the day they celebrate the Black Mary�s a birthday,

393
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,892
and they take out the image of Black Mary, before that I met and then I saw that all that,

394
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,892
it�s very historical I should say, but who can talk to him, I mean they wrote a letter to him

395
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,892
whether he�s protected and you see you can�t talk to him like that cannot.

396
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:02,892
All that kind of a thing I don�t need. I mean Christ never had that kind of a protocol this that,

397
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:11,892
I mean something different world they live in, I mean you just what can I do, will they listen to me?

398
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:18,892
Will they recognize Christ? If Christ comes here will he recognize Christ? How will he recognize?

399
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:27,892
Pope even, how will he recognize? Can he? Is there any measure?

400
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,892
I don�t want to criticize anyone that�s one thing I would like to say no controversies, please.

401
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,892
This is what it is when you ask me the question, I have to say this,

402
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,892
everybody is capable of becoming the self but must know that by becoming something like a king

403
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:50,892
or a Pope or a Guru, you are not there you have to become.

404
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:04,892
These are all the appointments by human beings not by God.

405
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,892
All these are appointments by God, here you have Pope, in India we have Shankracharayas

406
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,892
aaa in Zen system also we have, I met the head of Zen I was amazed,

407
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,892
his kundalini was frozen there, I didn�t know what to say to him, so I said Sir are you are you, not a Kashyap?

408
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,892
He said no, we never had them for the last aaa six centuries. I said you never had it,

409
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,892
they call it a Kashyap never had a Kashyap for six centuries so what are you doing Zen.

410
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:42,892
Zen you cannot do without realization, everybody is doing all these things without realization,

411
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,892
imagine we are telephoning without connection,

412
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:52,892
it�s like that very difficult you know because you are so conditioned by them.

413
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,892
In India also the same thing, we are so conditioned by the so-called Hindu religion.

414
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,892
Everybody is conditioned and everybody�s religion is in danger,

415
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:14,892
I don�t understand how can religion be in danger, it cannot be destroyed,

416
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,892
only thing is according to the time when they came, on the different times

417
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,892
they were like flowers on the same tree, living tree same,

418
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,892
but they are different times and according to the times they preached.

419
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,892
Whatever was the problem at that time they had to face it, you see,

420
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:40,892
today is the problem of evolution. Whatever they said people took out this flowers, this is mine,

421
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:47,892
this is mine, these are all dead flowers we are fighting with it, you can�t blame anyone,

422
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,892
maybe some are very gross we can say like Shiites we can call them gross,

423
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,892
I was born in a Protestant religion and I thought they are the most sophisticated (laughs) fanatics

424
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:06,892
they were known very sophisticated, extremely sophisticated are the Protestants,

425
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:14,892
you cannot catch them. They will have a red cross everything all humanitarian,

426
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:21,892
that�s not God�s job, that�s not God�s job, Missionaries job is not God�s, its human job,

427
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,892
you have created problems you have poverty alright you look after it,

428
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:32,892
God�s job you see is silent it doesn�t talk. Like say, I am sitting before you alright,

429
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,892
I don�t do anything am I doing anything? I am just talking to you don�t know what I am doing to you,

430
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,892
it just flows just acts it works. We have seen in the life of Christ somebody touched

431
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:51,892
the cloth of Christ and the energy flow, he didn�t have any Missionaries did he?

432
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,892
And imagine the missionaries came to India with the gun in the one hand

433
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,892
and the Bible in the another and do you know who Christ was,

434
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:07,892
it�s all described in the books our books as Mahavishnu it is described very well clearly who He is.

435
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,892
But Indians could not relate Him to that because with the gun they never said, they said

436
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,892
he is with very saumya is the one who is very mild and these people came with the gun

437
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:25,892
and Bible they could not place Him there, I don�t blame that way Indians because you see

438
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:33,892
you can�t expect Christ to come with the gun, not only gun

439
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,892
but some Portuguese took cannons to blast the temples,

440
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:47,892
they have blasted our temples with cannons can you believe it? Must be crazy people.

441
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,892
Thank God one thing good has happened, Columbus did not go to India,

442
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,892
if he had gone all of us would have been finished by now like the Red Indians were

443
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:03,892
I tell you thank God. He didn�t come here.

444
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:12,892
Like it if you go to Argentina you won�t find one Red Indian. I went to Chile not one Red Indian,

445
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,892
can you imagine what these people are doing?

446
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:26,892
People are not aware of what they are doing what they have done,

447
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,892
and if you see the massacring Spain I am coming from Spain and when I knew about it the way

448
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:40,892
people this inquisition they had for religion, how can you have inquisition Christ was crucified himself,

449
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:48,892
what are the basis how can you do such things?

450
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,892
If you read the history, you�ll be shocked I mean I was shocked the way they showed the inquisition there.

451
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:03,892
Actually, I was not aware of it, we have to see what we have done in the name of God,

452
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:10,892
in the name of compassion, in the name of love, what we have done.

453
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,892
They are trying to save now animals, for example, chickens they are trying to save the chickens,

454
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,892
what�s the use of saving chickens, they have to save the human being, I can�t give realization to chickens, can I?

455
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,892
You see a political reform or anything you try to do is not going to help you,

456
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,892
if you think democracy has worked very well I must say it�s not, I have seen Russia,

457
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:50,892
I have seen China, I have seen also democracy, everything is about the same, nothing to choose.

458
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,892
I assure you by changing the forms of government nothing is going to happen

459
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:07,892
but the changing the forms of human being only will achieve that kingdom of God which is promised to us.

460
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,892
We have to get out of it, our forefathers have done it, their forefathers have done it

461
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:21,892
where have we reached, nowhere, there is no peace in the world unless and until

462
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:29,892
we have peace within ourselves, especially, for Brussels when I came I must say about Brussels

463
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,892
I must say people are very hectic here, extremely hectic

464
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,892
because I could feel it within myself you see there�s a centre

465
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:45,892
which goes wobbly when the place is hectic extremely hectic speedy frustrated people,

466
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,892
and this centre was doing like this and for three hours I was trying to cleanse it

467
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,892
I mean I have I was trying to put it right just going on like this I was worried that when I face you

468
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:01,892
people I hope it doesn�t go into (laughs) another wobbly condition very wobbly people are very wobbly

469
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:09,892
we must understand. Extremely hectic, now in a person who has got blood cancer

470
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,892
you have this problem the centre goes off like that, the blood cancer people,

471
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:22,892
because the spleen which is the speedometer you see becomes crazy, and it starts wobbling,

472
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,892
starts producing blood cells of that kind, of course its triggered by something else

473
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:36,892
but the vulnerability of cancer is like that and that�s what I felt when I came I was surprised how people are like that here,

474
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:46,892
no peace. And we have the Europeans what is it here parliament (What is it here?) Common Market in Brussels,

475
01:01:47,000 --> 01:02:00,892
imagine in Brussels. We have no peace within, when I come to Brussels, I am Belgian,

476
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:10,892
because I can feel that, I really felt you all, it is very simple to cur correct it very simple

477
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:18,892
only this kundalini within you is to rise and everything will be so peaceful.

478
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:27,892
We are so nervous, and if it is our own why not have it?

479
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,892
Supposing this is your property why not have it? It�s your right to have it.

480
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,892
It�s your own property you don�t have to give anything. Like somebody asked me, Mother,

481
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,892
I cannot surrender, I said what have you got to surrender me when, what can you give me

482
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,892
I don�t need anything, what you have to surrender is your ego or your conditioning one of the two.

483
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,892
What do you surrender there is nothing but ego.

484
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:04,892
Only one simple thing we have to know and understand that still we are not complete

485
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:10,892
we have not reached our absolute state, we are living on a relative level,

486
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,892
we have to become the absolute, finished once you realize that much finished,

487
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,892
just we have to become the absolute, we have been living relatively,

488
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:26,892
it�s our own power we have got within ourselves why not have it, for which you cannot pay,

489
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,892
even but it is a very big problem it�s a very very big problem I must say it�s like a balloon.

490
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,892
It floats people into the air of course conditioning is also there, in the west,

491
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,892
there is big conditioning especially of feeling guilty, for nothing at all they feel guilty.

492
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,892
In the west people feel so guilty for I just don�t know why and the catch in this centre

493
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,892
gives trouble in the centre, this is the biggest conditioning you have is to feel guilty

494
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,892
for anything like you see now in England, supposing you use a fork and a spoon

495
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,892
in a different way they feel guilty, I mean you yourself have created these norms

496
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,892
like for alcohol you�ll have this kind of a glass that kind of a glass this that all nonsense

497
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:17,892
now if you don�t have that way you�ll feel guilty what is this?

498
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,892
I mean you are very simple people also to feel guilty for all the nonsensical things.

499
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:30,892
If a lady is wearing say a sweater or a coat say with beige colour,

500
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:41,892
she�s carrying a white coloured purse, she feels guilty, very seriously guilty, I tell you,

501
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:50,892
this is so frivolous, they are like children sometimes I feel Indians will not they are shameless

502
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:58,892
(laughs) I must say they don�t feel guilty at all, I mean you should not feel guilty for this ,

503
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,892
Haa one can feel guilty for wars or things, but even by feeling guilty what is there

504
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,892
and now like English feel guilty for what English did before, why they are dead and finished,

505
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,892
now gone case you are different you are not them your forefathers are finished now forget the past.

506
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:24,892
Now say simple thing forget the past future doesn�t exist in the present how can you be guilty,

507
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:34,892
simple logic (laughs), how can you be guilty in the present forget its finished.

508
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:41,892
Like that forget and finished is your past, so how can you be guilty?

509
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,892
You have to be in the present, actually, we must respect ourselves.

510
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,892
You are at the epitome of evolution we don�t respect our self, we have to love our self

511
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,892
and respect we are human beings we are on top of everything

512
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,892
we are not ego at all, but we are not also conditioning.

513
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,892
No question because you have gone beyond though I know that

514
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,892
you won�t have you are feeling the cool breeze, you can feel it, just feel it just now, try to feel,

515
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,892
Madam, you also have the experience just one minute you just have the experience,

516
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,892
just put your hands like this you�ll feel it the cool breeze,

517
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:39,892
just to open your hands have I not, have it, why not have it? It is free, alright?

518
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,892
Left is there Do you smoke? No,

519
01:06:50,000 --> 01:07:00,892
Heart, Heart, how are you feeling? Yes, feeling, the feeling, what about you?

520
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,892
Are you Catholic? Yes

521
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:09,892
Then you feel guilty (everyone laughs) that�s one thing Catholics have done

522
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,892
I tell you Catholics are the greatest guilty people, for nothing at all, if you go to Argentina

523
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:23,892
you�ll be shocked they walk like this, all the time they are told they are sinners, sinners, sinners,

524
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:35,892
they are not, that�s the reason, she�s left Vishuddhi catching but you know it�s very dangerous,

525
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:44,892
you get troubles with this Spondolytis physical you also get angina to feel guilty

526
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:52,892
only there is one chanting for that �I am not guilty� Then it works out,

527
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:01,892
that�s the reason it�s not rising above this but it will rise, are you alright? Are you feeling?

528
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,892
You are feeling relaxed though. Yes actually, there is no worry now.

529
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:14,892
No there were lots of wrinkles here when I came now you go and see they are all vanished,

530
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,892
yes. Are you alright? Little bit. Good. A little bit, yes that�s true its very subtle

531
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:26,892
and we are rising from a gross attention to this subtle attention alright?

532
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:32,892
And we should be selfish about it why we are attached to anything?

533
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,892
Attached to any ideology, any theory, anything we should get it you see

534
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:47,892
this is what Christ has said you have to get it. Those who are sitting behind you have got it.

535
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:57,892
They also argued a lot with me but you did not I must say not at all they did not, never argue.

536
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,892
But religion cannot be organised one thing you must know it cannot be organised.

537
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,892
Once you start organizing religion you kill the essence of religion. You cannot.

538
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:21,892
That�s the mistake, thank God in India religion could not be organised thank God for that,

539
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,892
where ever they have organised religion they became fanatics, so much,

540
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,892
so much rooted into the conditioning of the religion, anywhere I mean I must say everybody is like that ,

541
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,892
they think no end of themselves or they get ideas sometimes that we are the best,

542
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,892
we know the best we got everything, that�s not true,

543
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,892
anywhere like Sikhs now I used to think Sikhs at least are better off, now look at them,

544
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,892
gone off their heads, putting bombs everywhere, why should anybody who follows any religion

545
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:59,892
should put bombs anywhere, just I mean is it relevant?

546
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:07,892
They were also organised in India, very well organised, we have another one called Arya Samaaj,

547
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,892
they are very ego-oriented nonsense, now the people coming out of it because when they get old

548
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,892
they really become senile and they talk so much

549
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:22,892
they just go on talking they don�t know what they are talking irrelevantly they just talk.

550
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:35,892
You cannot be anything, you have to be human being first, when we claim I am a Belgian,

551
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:43,892
you are not, you could have been anything, just by chance you are born here or maybe you chose,

552
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,892
doesn�t matter but still you don�t become Belgian, you are a human being,

553
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:57,892
you laugh the same way, you smile the same way, feel the same way, only you think differently, maybe.

554
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,892
So it is the difference and all that doesn�t exist in the mind of God

555
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:10,892
He doesn�t create this world like Belgium, France this that, no he did not, we have done all this.

556
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:24,892
This is difficult because conditioning also is too much, conditioning of materialism is also here,

557
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:33,892
and no tradition of seeking, this is the biggest problem I feel no trade every Indian knows

558
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,892
that he has to seek his spirit and he knows what kundalini is I mean if he is not westernised,

559
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,892
that�s one of the conditions, if he is westernised he is just like you,

560
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,892
doesn�t know anything about it doesn�t want to know,

561
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:54,892
anyone who is not westernised knows that it�s the kundalini awakening that brings forth the realisation in India.

562
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,892
I went to the Himalayas, Dharamshala,

563
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,892
people are uneducated absolutely came down over three to four thousand people, just came

564
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,892
and they were told Devi Jagran, the Goddess will be awakened within,

565
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:14,892
they know who is the Goddess is, they just came, I gave them a lecture, any problem?

566
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,892
No Mother awakened our Goddess I said alright done. And such tremendous vibrations,

567
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,892
they are not educated, they haven�t got all this conditioning on them simple village folk,

568
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,892
all of them got realisation, they knew they have got it.

569
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,892
They started singing dancing enjoying themselves oh we have got it now we �ve got they know

570
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:39,892
despite their aaa I should their no exposure to western thinking or to education as such,

571
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,892
they know this they know for tradition from mother,

572
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,892
mother knows from her mother like that it comes to them from generations

573
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,892
that you have to be the spirit.

574
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:58,892
Even Christian should know and I think they knew the whole thing got diverted,

575
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,892
now there is a big controversy you must know, Christianity itself is a challenge,

576
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:10,892
thanks to theologians, you must have a word about Mr, what �s his name Bishop of Durham

577
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:16,892
did you hear about him? No? Oh! you must that�s the latest,

578
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,892
Bishop of Durham says there was no immaculate conception according to Paul,

579
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:33,892
there was no, no this thing, this is what it is, closed mind and then criticize me.

580
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:40,892
what�s the use of adherence to something that is ignorance now this Bishop of Durum

581
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,892
has to I mean attacked Christ immaculate conception His divinity everything he has attacked

582
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:54,892
and for your information, the Archbishop of Canterbury has supported him,

583
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:03,892
so now the whole Catholicism goes to dogs. but they cannot give up Paul also but,

584
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,892
to be frank why Paul is then I don�t understand, can you explain?

585
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,892
Why Paul is in the Bible, he has nothing to do with Christ.

586
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,892
Not only I say that but if you have read Khalil Gibran he was a realised soul,

587
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:30,892
this Paul is a strange man, he�s written a complete chapter on Paul, how is he there?

588
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,892
Anybody who is a realised soul will say that he has nothing to do with God.

589
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,892
He doesn�t understand God at all.

590
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:47,892
Then came Augustine, same, same style, maybe the same incarnation, he also ruined it.

591
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,892
Now if you want to know about Catholics go and ask the Muslims,

592
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,892
if you want to know about the Muslims go and ask Hindus,

593
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,892
This is better to know from them, they are all sailing in the same boat,

594
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:10,892
but criticizing either blaming each other. No use. How will they recognize Christ?

595
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:26,892
Is the first question one should ask. When He comes there will be no Sahaja yoga then the last,

596
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,892
he just sorts you out, the judgement is now, he just sorts you out.

597
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:40,892
There will be no question and Michel Angelo has clearly shown it if you should see the Sistine Chapel very clearly.

598
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,892
He is just standing there throwing people this side and that side that�s the Agnya Chakra where He stands,

599
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:57,892
just throwing out He doesn�t do anything of that kind He has no patience, that�s what it is, and that�s coming very soon.

600
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,892
Journalist: You explain why the time has now arrived?

601
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,892
Shri Mataji: You see you are the time has to arrive according to your awareness you see.

602
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:17,892
And the awareness today is that of that level, so it has come.

603
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:28,892
That�s like supposing you are learning to aaa balance a cycle, now when do you balance the cycle when you balance it. (laughs).

604
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:35,892
It is just like that when you balance the cycle then you get it isn�t it so now you are in that situation,

605
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:42,892
so it is going to work out. It�s the season I would say,

606
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:49,892
now supposing you want to have in those days Tulips, you can�t have isn�t it,

607
01:16:50,000 --> 01:17:00,892
now the time the seasons, and imagine with Christ do you think so many people would sit down and listen to Him.

608
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:09,892
No, very difficult, now we have sensible people, wiser people, nobody is going to crucify me now,

609
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:18,892
you think anybody can crucify me, no cannot, I mean maybe journalist may, later on (laugh).

610
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:25,892
Alright thank you very much, very kind of you, you have given me very patient hearing

611
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,892
I am sorry for the Catholic lady she didn�t like me much you see,

612
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,892
but you should not be biased if you are a journalist you have to be a witness, a detached witness,

613
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,892
then only you can help people, but if you are biased then you cannot work out,

614
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:46,892
so I have seen journalists are either biased or they want some sort of a sensation to believe,

615
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:52,892
now this is I am taking away from that sensationalization

616
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,892
I am giving you a news by which everything will be smoothed out,

617
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,892
it will be better and there will be a journalist but of a divine nature.

618
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:10,892
We have journalism also in Sahaja yoga but then we talk of the miracles we talk of the savings,

619
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,892
we talk of the good things that have happened we have, we have our newsletters and all that,

620
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:30,892
but it�s a very different type, another world. We have some journalists with us also.

621
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,892
Done now? Journalist: I thought there was no question

622
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:47,892
Shri Mataji: I think he has gone beyond questioning. (laughs) Alright.

623
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,892
So thank you very much. Sahaj Yogi: Why don�t you come along tonight here. Shri Mataji: Yes Try,

624
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,892
Sahaja Yogi: See how it works

625
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,892
Shri Mataji: If you can come along that�s the best way, you see , best way,

626
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:04,892
there�s no challenge for it nothing no challenge, but it�s something very really to be very frank,

627
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,892
very new for you, not for Indians but for you its new, you must come and have a look,

628
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:16,892
maybe I might be making money also possibly, �laughs.

629
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:24,892
Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you all. May God Bless you.

630
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,892
This is the book. Have got some copies of that?

631
01:19:51,000 --> 01:20:04,892
We�ll send it, tonight at the program you can have it. Should we go now, Thank you very much.
