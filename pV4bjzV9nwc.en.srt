Shri Devi Puja. Rahuri (Hindistan) 
26 Ocak 1984

2
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,860
Rahuri has a special significance in the history of the Goddess,

3
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:53,940
that when the horrible rakshasa, called Rahu,

4
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,110
started ruling this area and devastating it.

5
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,900
The whole suffered, all the God-fearing people ….

6
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,360
Then the Goddess took Her incarnation

7
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,480
here and She killed this man, this rakshasa

8
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,030
and there are different places

9
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,480
where how he ran, how She caught him

10
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,480
and ultimately killed – he was killed in Rahuri.

11
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:39,030
And that’s why rahu-ri – “ri” starts from the Hrim,

12
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,110
as you know that: Aim, Klim, Hrim

13
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,110
are the three words denoting the three powers of the Goddess.

14
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,820
Aim, Hrim and Klim: Aim is the Mahakali,

15
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,480
Hrim is the Mahalakshmi and Klim is the Mahasaraswati.

16
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,360
So, with the Hrim-power She killed this rakshasa,

17
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,030
and then – after that killing –

18
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,110
bhaktas started living here.

19
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,280
And a king came all the way from Rajpur,

20
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Rajputana – and started worshipping the Goddess.

21
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,820
And went – he was a poor man, he came here as a poor man –

22
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,820
while worshipping the Goddess

23
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,480
he raised this again into another kingdom,

24
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,360
and that’s why they are called as Shalivahanas

25
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,820
because they carry the shawl of the Goddess.

26
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,150
This Shalivahanas, later on in the dynasty, was a [INDIST., SOUNDS LIKE Bhobruvaha]

27
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,110
who fought with the [INDIST. SOUNDS LIKE Maharaja]

28
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,820
and defeated him, who was from Ujiara [?]. Surprisingly

29
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,900
many of My relations are still in Ujiara

30
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,980
and they are following a new vision.

31
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,110
So because he fought him

32
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,820
and he captured him

33
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,980
many people from here shifted there

34
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:28,230
and settled down in Ujiara.

35
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:35,440
Now this Rahuri developed gradually

36
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,900
into a very modern city,

37
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,480
or you can say in a modernized.

38
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:51,280
And when we go to [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE Nankhara] you will be able to see it.

39
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,480
The forefathers

40
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,400
of Mine were called as Shalivahanas

41
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,900
and My mother`s place [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE Rhaduvas] where they resided and lived.

42
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,820
So Rahuri has a special significance

43
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,820
in the life of Sahaja Yoga, or I should say in My own life.

44
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,320
And that is why surprisingly that in Rahuri we have established

45
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,070
our center in the biggest way.

46
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,070
Because the kings here worshipped

47
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,280
the Mother with a shawl.

48
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,820
Now this has a special meaning as the significance

49
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,820
goes, or you can say the symbolic - it is -

50
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,980
it covers the modesty of the Mother.

51
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,480
Mother protects us, She looks after us.

52
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,820
So this is the one which covers Her,

53
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,940
gives Her the grace,

54
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,070
gives Her the protection from the cold

55
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,480
and when the children are suffering,

56
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:05,110
or are tired, or are sick She covers them with the shawl.

57
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,400
So the shawl has a very big meaning

58
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,230
and because the used to carry the shawl of the Mother

59
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,480
all the time in their hands,

60
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,780
that’s why they are called as Shalivahanas.

61
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,320
So the significance of Rahuri is very great

62
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,480
and you will also see that

63
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,150
in the gross also the people here are very receptive to Sahaja Yoga.

64
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:35,480
Even the factory people – I went to see them before I came here,

65
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,860
to talk to them. And they are so much submerged

66
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,070
in the developments of Sahaja Yoga

67
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,230
and amount of things they want to do,

68
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,480
and want to take advantage of Sahaja Yoga here.

69
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
As they are built for you especially too

70
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,360
was made with great care about from that they thought

71
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
that it was finished and worked very hard.

72
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,780
Day and night, just to prepare this hall for you.

73
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,150
So this is how it is going to work out,

74
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,820
and last time I told them that you should not make

75
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,360
an alcohol out of these molasses

76
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,900
[??] and sell it at the market at a cheap rate,

77
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,280
but make something useful.

78
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,940
So they are trying to find out

79
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,230
a technique about which I talked to them now.

80
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,480
So they are very religious people also.

81
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,110
And they are trying to improve the lot of the people,

82
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,480
by removing all these addictions among the people.

83
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,480
So that is the significance of Rahuri-Puja

84
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,860
and that’s what it is, that you are like Shalivahanas

85
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,440
who are worshipping the Mother and Her shawl.

86
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,480
So today’s Puja has a special significance

87
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,480
– that’s why Rahuri we have very good Sahaja Yogis here,

88
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:58,940
very developed, very evolved, moral people.

89
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,400
They are not scholars of Sanskrit,

90
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,940
but they are scholars of Sahaja Yoga.

91
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,980
There is a difference between being a scholar of Sanskrit

92
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,320
and a scholar of Sahaja Yoga.

93
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,030
Now for you people I hope it has been a comfortable

94
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,360
stay for you here and

95
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:32,230
we hope also for the future you are going to enjoy

96
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,820
your journey and enjoy the bliss of the Divine!

97
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:46,360
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

98
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,320
We don’t read about Rahul`s killing,

99
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,110
because it is Mahalakshmi who killed,

100
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,480
but what we read in the Devi-Mahatmya is the Mahakali`s powers.

101
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,820
But Rahul was killed here in Rahuri by Mahalakshmi,

102
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,110
and that Mahalakshmi power is called as Hrim power,

103
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,280
so that’s why this is Rahu-ri.

104
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,030
Actually it is Rahu-hrim we can say it is Rahu-ri to make it simple.

105
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,480
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

106
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,780
And according to that calendar only

107
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,480
all the Maharashtrians are living,

108
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,440
which is very, I should say, much more subtler than vikram,

109
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,400
this thing. Because in the [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: vikram-panjaga]

110
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,780
this area is still called as Kali-Yuga, Kali-Yuga,

111
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,360
but in this [INDIST: SOUNDS LIKE: panjaga; Then: Shalivahana-Panjaga]

112
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,190
it is called as Krita-Yuga. It’s much subtler.

113
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,440
That’s a very wider thing

114
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,820
and it doesn’t give you the different sections

115
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,110
of Kali-Yuga, that how it becomes Krita-Yuga

116
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,320
and ultimately a Satya-Yuga.

117
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:10,480
The calendar that was used by the North Indians

118
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,480
was the Vikram, and the South Indians used the Shalivahana,

119
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,360
but especially in Maharashtra. But the support came mainly from

120
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,110
[INDIST.] direct, who said that this is the better [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: panjaga]

121
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:30,400
because it deals with subtler side of time.

122
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,440
Subtler side of time.

123
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,480
And that’s why it was regarded as a greater thing.

124
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:42,230
Now on the first day of

125
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,230
this calendar they put a kalasha

126
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,820
[? A pot] with a shawl as a banner, a kalasha and a shawl as a banner.

127
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:00,110
That’s why kalash, which is the Kundalini, is the Aquarius.

128
00:13:02,820 --> 00:14:24,860
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

129
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,480
In the older days all the Maharashtrian women used to have

130
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:34,480
some sort of an additional cloth, a shawl, which they used to carry.

131
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,440
If it was a marriage then they used to have a marriage sari,

132
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,480
[INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: completed with that shawl].

133
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,070
All the time they had to wear something, a covering over the sari.

134
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,230
Sari was not the end-cloth but now we have become modern,

135
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,480
so we don’t use the, that, another cloth which one has to use.

136
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,480
So, but this is only the custom.

137
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,030
In India is not the point, it is not only in Maharashtra, everywhere.

138
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,480
But there, because a dress was not a sari,

139
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,900
but those who bore the sari did not use, in the North.

140
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:10,150
But here those who use the sari also use the shawl, on top of that.

141
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,400
And that’s why, you see, this country has a speciality,

142
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,900
this part that they always had this shawl,

143
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,110
whether they went out, for their protection,

144
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,480
or they went for a marriage

145
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,940
or anything they used to have another thing on top.

146
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,230
Now of course we have, symbolically, something modernized.

147
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,110
This is, wearing little pieces to be used as shawls.

148
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,230
You see, everything is getting modernized.

149
00:15:35,280 --> 00:16:12,480
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

150
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,480
You must, all right, touch the feet of this Rahuri-Land.

151
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:24,860
Then after, Ganesha, we must also touch the feet.

152
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,070
As soon as I get the land, first we establish Ganesha here,

153
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,030
and once this land, we get

154
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,400
everywhere in the whole world, we get land

155
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,440
and we have no problems of any kind as far as the land is concerned.

156
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,440
When the Ashram is built here, everywhere in the whole world

157
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,480
we’ll have Ashrams. So the beginning has to be at the right place.

[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

159
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,110
They have come all the way from Germany.

160
00:19:48,070 --> 00:21:00,480
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi; then the Puja starts]

161
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,030
[during the Puja:] Husband and wife, are you? Ha?

162
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,400
You both are husband and wife – are you?

163
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,400
You have to be husband and wife! [Yogi: Yes!]

164
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Shri Mataji: You are? You both are husband and wife? [Yogi: Not!]

165
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:38,480
Shri Mataji: Yes! [Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

166
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,820
Means: the husband and wife should sit together!

167
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,110
That’s the only time when a man and a woman

168
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,940
sits together in this country. Not the brother.

169
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:55,480
Not even sisters and brothers. Only husband and wife.

170
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:16,900
[Puja continues]
