1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,041
… wife of a United Nations diplomat.

2
00:00:02,291 --> 00:00:03,333
She lives in London now

3
00:00:03,542 --> 00:00:05,750
but has thousands of followers around the world,

4
00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:08,875
who hail Her as India’s greatest living saint.

5
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:12,375
She teaches a state of self-realization and happiness, and says

6
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:16,291
that with a spiritual force She can cure the incurable.

7
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:18,625
She’s speaking at public meetings in Bedford tonight

8
00:00:18,834 --> 00:00:20,125
and Northampton tomorrow,

9
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,166
and today She gave Her first television interview in England.

10
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,625
Our reporter is Rebecca (inaudible) .

11
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,583
Her Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi

12
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:31,291
is known around the world for Her healing powers.

13
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:33,959
Her followers look upon Her as Divine.

14
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:37,667
Mother, as She is referred to, preaches a gospel of peace

15
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:40,999
and has discovered a spiritual force called Kundalini,

16
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,125
which is shown on this chart.

17
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,875
She can release it in seekers, as She calls them,

18
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,500
to give them complete awareness.

19
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:51,792
She admits that many Westerners are sceptical of Her powers,

20
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:54,959
but She scorns the idea of charging money for Her gifts.

21
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:58,542
Her claims of success in curing and healing are remarkable.

22
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,959
Alcoholics have been known to give up drink,

23
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:04,917
drug-takers have been cured, but perhaps most extraordinary of all,

24
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,917
She claims to have cured many cancer victims.

25
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:11,208
REPORTER: How many people have you managed to cure who have had cancer?

26
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:13,291
SHRI MATAJI: Thousands… I don’t know… I should say…

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,583
REPORTER: Thousands? What do doctors think of what you’re saying?

28
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:19,375
SHRI MATAJI: You see the trouble is

29
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:24,041
I Myself I have done medicine and… the doctors are the people

30
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,458
who are working with the “shoot” side of life, you see,

31
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:28,166
not the “roots” of it.

32
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,125
So the trouble with them is

33
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,834
that anybody starts talking that it can be cured

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,999
by a higher method than a human awareness,

35
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:39,125
then they don’t want to jump into that awareness,

36
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,250
which is a higher awareness that one has to achieve,

37
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:45,125
because human awareness is still transitory.

38
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,375
You have to achieve that awareness which is the divine awareness.

39
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,667
When you have that awareness, then only you can cure it.

40
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:53,458
REPORTER: How would You describe Yourself,

41
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:56,500
as a healer or a spiritualist?

42
00:01:56,709 --> 00:02:00,333
SHRI MATAJI: You see, I do not want to fall into any category Myself

43
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:04,125
because… I’m a housewife

44
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,333
and I have to do all the jobs of a housewife,

45
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:10,625
I’m also a diplomat’s wife, so I have to act as a diplomat’s wife,

46
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:17,166
I’m also a person who has to do this work of Sahaja Yoga…

47
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:20,083
So I don’t know how to describe Myself.

48
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,083
REPORTER: Can I ask You if You can reach me?

49
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,542
SHRI MATAJI: Yes yes, see, one can reach masses.

50
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,417
Now, we have to first see in your case now what is the problem.

51
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,500
First is that there’s an imbalance, a little imbalance,

52
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:35,125
because you have to work outside too much, I think,

53
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,208
you have to go out too much

54
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:40,208
and don’t have much time for your emotional life.

55
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:43,999
So it’s more that you are more mental and physical,

56
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:47,166
but less of emotions in you, so there has to be a balance.

57
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,917
So first I have to give a balance like this, all right?

58
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,166
I have to put you into balance now.

59
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:56,709
Now, this is, you are working with your mind too much,

60
00:02:56,917 --> 00:03:00,625
so you are over-working it, so your liver is out.

61
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,458
And the liver is also excited.

62
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:08,875
So to put it right what we have to do is to just put you…

63
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,417
REPORTER: What are you doing?

64
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,625
SHRI MATAJI: Just I’m removing the liver pressure.

65
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:17,125
The liver is expressed in this part and this part of the hand.

66
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,875
So your liver pressure is reduced. It’s very simple.

67
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,542
REPORTER: Now, is anyone watching this

68
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,959
going to have, feel any effect from You?

69
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,208
SHRI MATAJI: From Me? REP: Yes.

70
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,542
SHRI MATAJI: No no, no effect. No, nothing.

71
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,000
Because it is just, you see,

72
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,750
it’s like construction of the destruction;

73
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:33,667
you just take out

74
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,458
the destruction out of the construction, that’s all.

75
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,875
It’s very simple. Now, what I am doing now.

76
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,458
You have to now just say

77
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,750
within yourself — or loudly if you want to —

78
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,542
say that “Mother, I forgive everyone.” Just say that.

79
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:50,041
REPORTER: Mother, I forgive everyone.

80
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,625
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, you have to say thrice. Now let’s see. Say it.

81
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:54,959
REPORTER: Mother, I forgive everyone. SHRI MATAJI: Again.

82
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,166
REPORTER: Mother, I forgive everyone. SHRI MATAJI: Again.

83
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,166
REPORTER: Mother, I forgive everyone.

84
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,000
SHRI MATAJI: Now see.

85
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,625
Is it flowing? A little bit.

86
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:09,375
It’s very sensitive, it’s very subtle.

87
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,333
REPORTER: Well, I can… I can feel the clearness of it. Yes.

88
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:17,083
SHRI MATAJI: It’s started. Started, see?

89
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,709
Just I… what I’m making — a cross on your hand.

90
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:22,999
You see, that’s Christ, who said you have to forgive.

91
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,500
Now see. It’s working?

92
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:27,792
REPORTER: And what will it do for me in the long run?

93
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:29,458
SHRI MATAJI: In the... in the long run that it is your…

94
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:32,041
own power now will manifest.

95
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,792
You have this power within yourself.

96
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:36,667
Now with this you will feel very peaceful,

97
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:38,208
you will

98
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:40,208
control your thoughts. You don`t have to think

99
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,083
all the time. You can rest without thinking.

100
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,125
If you want you can think, otherwise you need not think.

101
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,291
Then your own powers will be manifested,

102
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,208
by which you can give this power to others.

103
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:51,709
There’s so many things you can do.
