1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,861
So first of all we’ll start talking about 
energies.

2
00:00:03,861 --> 00:00:07,930
Shri Mataji to someone: That, is that for 
me?

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:17,790
These energies are moving within us and how 
they activate and we’ll talk about the third

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:23,700
energy which is the one which has evolved 
us within us and that’s how we are here.

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:35,449
And we’ll talk about your Self, the controlling 
part, which is controlling you, the Spirit.

6
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:47,589
So if you go on an abstract line, it will 
be very appealing [?] with it.

7
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:52,780
Then afterwards, you see, when we have talked 
about energies, this, that, once the people-

8
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,030
that is within you- you see, sort of they’ll 
feel ego, this ego: “we have these energies

9
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,559
we can utilize these energies, do this, do 
that” and then you’ll bring them down

10
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,030
to Sahaja Yoga, later on.

11
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,980
But to begin with, better talk of abstract.

12
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:15,270
Because Indians are different, Western people 
are different, they are fed up of religion,

13
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,979
they are fed up of all this.

14
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,549
So if you talk of religion, it gives, creates 
a problem.

15
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:26,740
That’s why in the beginning, you see, Vedas, 
they were written down.

16
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,759
They didn’t talk of God or Deities at all.

17
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:37,280
They talked about God, God the Creator, but 
just about Brahmadeva, throughout Hiranyagarbha,

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,409
Brahmadeva, right side they talked, you see.

19
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:46,210
And the all thing is said, mantra is like 
: “Bhur, Bhuvah, swaha”.

20
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,210
3 things.

21
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:55,969
Now, Bhur is actually the Mooladhara, is the 
earth upper it, the Mooladhara.

22
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:58,680
Mooladhara chakra and Mooladhara itself.

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,840
Then Bhuvah.

24
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,499
Bhuvah is the one which is called the antariksha 
[atmosphere, intermediate space], is the one

25
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:09,500
which is all created, in talks of Brahmadeva.

26
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,160
Then swaha.

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:20,240
Swaha is capacity to burn out, of the agny 
[fire] you see?

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:30,290
It is so surprising and then they talk of 
mahatapa, tapaha and maha.

29
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,230
“Bhur, Bhuvah, swaha, maha tapa”.

30
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,830
So when they talk of swaha, they talk of maha.

31
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:48,180
Maha is what you call the great, Allah Hou 
Akbar, and of tapa.

32
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:55,480
Tapa is the one where you have to become a 
tapasuy, means a person who is going into

33
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,670
penance, that of Christ.

34
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:07,310
And they say that you have to penetrate through 
the Surya, that is this.

35
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,020
And the all thing is such an obstacle, and 
then you get your moksha [liberation].

36
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,570
So they have talked of all the charkas.

37
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,020
But if you talk about the abstract part of 
it, people have no objection, they listen

38
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:26,050
to it, listen as [inaudible] there’s no 
religion as such.

39
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,470
[Cut in the audio?]

40
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:38,700
Today specially I’m talking about the Vedas 
and these havanas we do.

41
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:47,590
When we do the havana it is a Yagnya.

42
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,120
Yagnya means “by which you know”.

43
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,590
Yagnya means to know.

44
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,879
Yagna.

45
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:58,880
And this is done where you use ‘Svaha’ 
as the word.

46
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:11,740
That means you use the principle of fire to 
burn off all that is wrong in you, ‘Svaha’.

47
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:21,030
And you awaken it by taking the different 
names of the God.

48
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:26,040
And it started at the time of Rama.Today is 
Ram Navami.

49
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,560
I should say it was not started, we should 
say, but it was very much invoked when Rama

50
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,230
lived and they used to do Yagnyas at that 
time.

51
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:44,630
The reason was, the people had just started 
realising that there is something higher and

52
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:50,150
you have to worship that higher Self, the 
seers had said, and they thought that the

53
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,830
best thing is to do Yagnyas.

54
00:04:53,830 --> 00:05:00,790
[Inaudible] On the left side, of course, the 
people started the worship of God and the

55
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:08,170
dedication to God and all those things, that 
is Bhakti[, [devotion] but mainly what they

56
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:18,500
did before Rama was the Yagnyas, the Vedas, 
with which they prayed to different elements-

57
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,670
elements have made our charkas – and tried 
to evoke the deities of the Elements.

58
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:33,420
But actually it amounts to the same.

59
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:48,150
So as a child, Rama was studying with a very 
great saint, and when he was studying with

60
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:53,980
him, Vashishta was the name of the great saint.

61
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:01,760
And Vashishta had an ashram where Rama and 
his brothers studied.

62
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,820
Shri Mataji to a lady: come along, come in, 
come forward.

63
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,590
Give her a chair to sit down.

64
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,880
Can you, is there a seat here?

65
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:22,030
I think Gavin can go, lots of seats are there.

66
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:40,460
Rama was studing with this Vashishta and they 
used to come for holidays to father’s place.

67
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:48,150
Then, he had the capacity to kill a demon 
with only one arrow.

68
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:53,040
It’s called as Ekabani, one arrow was sufficient 
of Sri Rama.

69
00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:00,960
And he was a small little child, say about 
seven-eight years of age and people were surprised

70
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,639
how he could do it.

71
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:12,490
So whenever they had a Yagnya- now these Yagnyas 
were created to awaken, evoke the Deities

72
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,400
within the spinal column actually.

73
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,470
And for these Yagnyas they used to sit down 
and do all these havanas the way we do it.

74
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,500
But at that time, the Rakshasas would come 
and try to spoil the Yagnya.

75
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:34,300
Because Yagnyas are to be done with pure heart 
and with cleanliness and with purity.

76
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,139
It should not be insulted, there is a protocol 
about it.

77
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:44,169
While they thought that if we insult the Deities 
there, then the Deities will disappear and

78
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:46,389
their Yagnyas will be spoiled.

79
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:54,880
Now these Yagnyas were done, in the olden 
times even, even when Rama was not here.

80
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:02,020
But at the time of Rama also, there were some 
Rakshasas who took a special pleasure in spoiling

81
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:09,750
these Yagnyas and Rama as a child would go 
and protect them from the demons.

82
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:19,669
And the demons would take on some sort of 
a funny form, and come like invisible creatures

83
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:26,180
and put some bones of animals and things like 
that in the Yagnya.

84
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,120
And that would spoil the effects of the Yagnya.

85
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,949
And Rama would protect that, as a child.

86
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:37,909
Imagine, as a child he used to do that.

87
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:43,819
They would be doing the Yagnya and he would 
be sitting outside with all his small brothers

88
00:08:43,819 --> 00:08:48,720
around him and they would kill the demons 
who would try to destroy the Yagnya.

89
00:08:48,720 --> 00:09:07,949
This is the early life of Rama in which you 
see how, as a child also, he showed us amount

90
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:16,470
of expertise, you can say, in arrow and bow, 
you see.

91
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,259
So any time you see a statue, how to make 
out if it’s Shri Rama’s statue?

92
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:32,610
Is to see if there’s an arrow and a bow, 
then its a Rama’s statue.

93
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:40,980
Now his coming on this earth, gave us the 
development of the right side and so the Yagnyas

94
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,839
were also on the right side.

95
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,240
Because first of all when human beings came 
on this earth, they were frightened of all

96
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,920
the animals who would invade them and all 
kinds of horrible Rakshasas and all those

97
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,029
people, and negative forces that would trouble 
them.

98
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:08,550
In that state they needed to create a king, 
a ruler, who was an ideal king and who would

99
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,990
rule according to the laws of dharma.

100
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:24,350
So He was the one in charge of that era, what 
you call as Satya Yuga, but actually, He was

101
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,369
here in Treta Yuga.

102
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:33,320
That’s the time when He as here, that’s 
Treta Yuga, and Krishna came at the lime of

103
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,980
Dwapara Yuga.

104
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:41,230
And today is the time, when I came, it was 
Kali Yuga.

105
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:47,450
But now today the time is of Krita Yuga, the 
Yuga where work will be done: “Krita”

106
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,480
means, “work will be done”.

107
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,149
This is the time where work will be done.

108
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:56,389
So how things have moved from one to another?

109
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:07,240
Now in the Dwapara [Shri Mataji means Treta] 
Yuga when Shri Rama came, the idea of kingship

110
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,610
and rulership started.

111
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:21,550
So the greatest emphasis was on the goodwill 
of the people.

112
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:34,740
The people had to have goodwill, for the people 
and for the king, and for the betterment of

113
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,740
humanity.

114
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,149
The will: that is the right side.

115
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:43,040
So how to create the goodwill in people?

116
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:51,839
First the leader has to sacrifice and show 
how far he can go in sacrificing to keep the

117
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,119
moral and the goodwill of the people.

118
00:11:56,119 --> 00:12:02,489
So the right side was created by the advent 
of Shri Rama, because he showed a path of

119
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:14,689
creating among people the awareness that they 
should be ruled, that they should not be anarchists,

120
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:24,579
there should be one head who should be able 
to organize, co-ordinate and work out a collective

121
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:25,579
thing.

122
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:36,329
You see, when we think of a king we want to 
oust him because we don’t like the idea

123
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:43,949
of being ruled by him, because he’s not 
a good king perhaps, or he doesn’t represent

124
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:52,199
that will of the people which is a common 
will, which creates this king who rules for

125
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:55,100
the maintenance of that goodwill.

126
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,019
See it as a symbolic expression of your “goodwill”.

127
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:08,420
So when you create a law, it is also the expression, 
common expression, of all the common people,

128
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,420
of the common feeling that they should abide 
with law.

129
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:22,949
It doesn’t come to you that you are a slave, 
or you have to be dominated, or you have to

130
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:26,630
be put down, but it is only your “common 
will” which is good.

131
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:43,069
The desire of all the people which is the 
good, the righteousness, incarnates as Shri

132
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:46,050
Rama and He looks after that will.

133
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,610
Because, supposing an individual may start 
saying that: ‘This is not good, this is

134
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,009
not good”.

135
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:55,470
An individual might take a different attitude 
about these things.

136
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:03,190
But you must have some symbol of that goodness 
placed onto someone.

137
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:13,869
And those symbols were created to symbolise 
your righteousness, your sense of good, so

138
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:16,299
that you can be saved yourself.

139
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:22,360
Supposing today somebody comes and hits you, 
alright?

140
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,310
Now you can feel how bad it is to be hit by 
someone or murdered by someone or else, so

141
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,819
you decide there should be a law protecting 
you.

142
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:33,149
But tomorrow you may do the same thing.

143
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:45,560
So what you do is to take out your goodwill, 
represent it as the kingdom or a king or a

144
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,470
governing body.

145
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:57,670
So, the government as it is represents, should 
represent also its both ways, it’s not that

146
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:02,369
it always represents it, it may not at all 
represent it, may not, possibly.

147
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:08,839
But the government itself should represent 
the good in you, the purity in you, the pure

148
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:16,459
will to be good, to be protected and that 
you also should abide by it.

149
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:19,240
It’s a very mutual thing.

150
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,809
But what happens, that once you start electing 
someone like that, or making someone like

151
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:31,799
that, or appointing someone like that, as 
usual he goes into an ego trip, simple thing

152
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:32,799
like that.

153
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,679
It’s absolutely a simple thing.

154
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,679
Ego trip.

155
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:42,199
The government gets into an ego trip, people 
get, you see, amazed how people behave.

156
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:48,749
They’ll elect, supposing, a Prime Minister 
and suddenly you find the Prime Minister behaves

157
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:49,779
like a brute.

158
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:50,779
You can’t understand.

159
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:55,790
“We have elected somebody like a Prime Minister 
thinking that he will do the good to us.”

160
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,850
You see, it’s possible.

161
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,910
And then the revolutions take place while 
people revolt, fight it out.

162
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,290
Again the will of the people fights it and 
makes it alright.

163
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,160
Shri Mataji to someone: Come along.

164
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,269
Come here forward, you can come forward.

165
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:12,589
Ah.

166
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:13,910
So.

167
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:19,209
So we have to have something absolute, you 
see, because all these values are changing

168
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:25,220
every moment, isn’t it ? We think that this 
government did not do so well, for example,

169
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,540
we think like that, so, we want to demolish 
this government.

170
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,540
Then you bring another one.

171
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,720
We find the same thing happening.

172
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:39,589
See, whether you bring a communist or you 
bring a socialist or you bring a democrat

173
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:43,249
or you have a monarchy, whatever you may have.

174
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:51,679
But still, what happens actually is that, 
all these things that come up and go away-

175
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,930
Shri Mataji to someone: Now, you’ll come 
here, then you move forward a little bit so

176
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,940
that every body can see.

177
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:11,510
All these changes that take place, go on creating 
a feeling in a man that he should be anarchist.

178
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:16,870
Why should we have any government ? Why should 
we have any king?

179
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:23,000
Why should we be ruled by anyone ? Because 
you find the person who’s ruling is not

180
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,350
up to the mark and he is just trying to deceive 
you.

181
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:35,429
At that point you have to have some absolute 
standards.

182
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:41,360
If you have an absolute standard then you 
can always judge that this king is deviating

183
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,750
from the right path, is not doing what a king 
should do.

184
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,559
A king has to be like Rama.

185
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,390
He has to be like Rama.

186
00:17:51,390 --> 00:18:01,559
Representing your will, your goodwill, your 
sense of proper judgement, fair play and righteousness.

187
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:11,450
If the king is not righteous then your collective 
goodwill will go against the king.

188
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,630
Now you go and throwing one from another.

189
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,870
Say, I’ve seen now for example in France.

190
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,850
We had one kind of a Prime Minister.

191
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,760
He did lots of things which were not good 
so he was thrown away.

192
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,769
So you had another one kind of, now he’s 
doing another thing so he’s going to be

193
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:32,769
thrown away.

194
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:33,769
And we are just playing games you see.

195
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:34,769
First of all we have say Labour Government.

196
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:35,769
We don’t like it.

197
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:37,350
So then we have another Government, Conservative 
Government.

198
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,049
We don’t like it so throw it away.

199
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:41,090
We go on playing with it all the time.

200
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,890
But in this relativity, we are improving.

201
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:53,149
Definitely we are more aware, understanding 
the value of these people, and also the public

202
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:55,320
is understanding.

203
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:04,360
But then when, you see, too many such people 
come in, who are negative, they also bring

204
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,529
down the will, the collective will very low.

205
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:19,600
And people start identifying themselves with 
these autocrats or those people who are ego

206
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:33,881
orientated, who have no moral values, who 
have no fear of God, who deny religion, who

207
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,130
deny evolution.

208
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:44,090
And the Government starts behaving in such 
a manner that you are amazed that how this

209
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,220
is the Government?

210
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:50,320
Like in Chile and Argentina, the way the Government 
is behaving and is putting down the people.

211
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,950
All these things are happening, you don’t 
know.

212
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,530
It’s such a relative terminology.

213
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,160
Like El Salvador.

214
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:00,030
You don’t know what to do over there now.

215
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:05,170
Whom to support ? Whether to support the Americans, 
or to support the Russians and all that.

216
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:12,200
Now under these circumstances a Sahaja Yogi 
can stand and say: “now, should we join

217
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,029
this or that?”

218
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:16,429
All is a wasteful thing.

219
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:18,600
It’s just a game going on.

220
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,830
Let them break their heads.

221
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,549
They are good for nothing, useless people.

222
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:26,970
So you cannot solve these problems and you 
are not supposed to solve them.

223
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:31,700
They must get their Realization and establish 
the Kingdom of God.

224
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:40,059
So really Rama rules [must be] on this earth 
and not these horrible kings who change their

225
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:47,630
morality every day, who change their ideas 
every day, those whose will is sometimes for

226
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,909
something materialistic.

227
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:55,179
Like I would say now in our country [U.K.] 
we thought that we’ll have Mrs. Thatcher.

228
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:59,080
Good, very good, she’s coming up well I 
should say, certain good things she is saying,

229
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,110
like self-restrain and all that.

230
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,210
We think she’s talking good things.

231
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,299
But what about herself following this?

232
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:11,690
Shri Rama, not only propounded what was good 
but he followed that.

233
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:19,059
He sacrificed for that and he established 
his own symbol as a pure symbol of that righteous

234
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:24,669
will, that is within the people, which is 
the collective righteous will.

235
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:30,669
Now, for example, you can see clearly how 
the ego oriented things work out, you see,

236
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:33,309
first of all by the misidentifications we 
can have.

237
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:36,330
“Now if you’re a communist, you have to 
be out and out communist, you cannot have

238
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:41,419
compromise between democratic methods and 
communist” They can’t find any integration.

239
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:44,799
They think: “If you have to be this you 
have to be absolutely this.

240
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,549
If you have to be that, you have to be absolutely 
that.”

241
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:52,519
But in Sahaja Yoga, what you find, is that 
both are integrated.

242
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:58,399
Because you have the complete capitalism, 
you have now to distribute it.

243
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:03,500
This is a complete integration here.

244
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,090
All these ‘isms’ are experiments of the 
artificial of the mind, just a projection

245
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:12,750
of the mind, which is, whatever is man-made 
is artificial, you know that.

246
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:20,320
But what is God made is all integrated, that 
whatever you have within yourself, you must

247
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,970
give it to others.

248
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:27,000
Now see for administration also, what happens 
after Sahaja Yoga.

249
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,630
Say, I am your Mother, here sitting down.

250
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,120
You like me to guide you.

251
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,470
You like me to govern you.

252
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:47,820
You like me to correct you, you like me to 
scold you and to even go to a great extend

253
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,639
to see that your life improves.

254
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:50,639
Supposing I say: “Alright, I give up.

255
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:53,360
I don’t want to talk about it.”

256
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,880
You don’t like, none of you will like such 
a situation, where I say: “Alright you are

257
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
a gone case, I have nothing to do.

258
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,880
You get out.”

259
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,900
Nobody will like such a situation.

260
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,460
You want me to govern you.

261
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,659
You want me to look after you.

262
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:09,779
You like that, automatically you have started 
liking it.

263
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:14,450
There’s no domination, but you want my domination.

264
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,400
You want me to dominate you.

265
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,730
You want that all my desire should be dominating.

266
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,730
Automatically.

267
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:26,919
Why you feel that: “ it is alright, it is 
very good if Mother takes interest in me,

268
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,559
corrects me, it’s a privilege.”

269
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:32,110
Why do you think like that?

270
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:36,990
Because by that there is a general good created.

271
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,530
It’s a general good created in you.

272
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:51,470
Because you have become integrated, your body, 
your mind and your soul, all of them think

273
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:56,880
the same way, they all want the same, there’s 
no difference.

274
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,259
Once there is integration, you’ll find that 
Sahaja Yoga is the easiest way to live in.

275
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:03,789
But if there is not, then it is difficult.

276
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:09,120
For exemple, if you are a lazy person, say 
for example, or you are a very hot tempered

277
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:20,760
person or you are a sort of a dual person, 
or you are playing tricks with yourself, you

278
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,860
are playing games.

279
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,299
Then you won’t like Sahaja Yoga.

280
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:32,190
As long as these situations are in you, you 
will not like Sahaja Yoga.

281
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:39,220
But once this situation is overcome, then 
you will like it, because then you will know

282
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:48,030
that whatever is good for your Spirit is for 
the well-being of you all, and of all the

283
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,669
people.

284
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:57,760
Once this well-being comes in, everyone feels 
absolutely nourished and fresh.

285
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:04,350
So the governing part is enjoyable.

286
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:12,809
The correction part is even more enjoyable 
and that you are in the attention of your

287
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:17,559
Mother is such a great feeling within yourself 
that: “yes nothing will go wrong with me,

288
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,600
She’ll look after me.

289
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,120
She’s there to look after me”.

290
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:29,929
But this integration part comes very late 
because of ego problems.

291
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:35,669
You have built up egos because of wrong type 
of people administering you.

292
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:41,490
From your childhood, you might have had bad 
parents who never talked of God, of good things

293
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,490
of life.

294
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,700
They themselves did not lead a life of sacrifice.

295
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,440
Very self indulgent parents can create a problem 
like that.

296
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,240
They never gave you the right type of life, 
a proper value system which should have been

297
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,240
there.

298
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,340
They never educated how to enjoy righteousness, 
virtues in life.

299
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:07,639
Possibly, later on the country in which you 
are born, the other people who surround you,

300
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:08,639
also might have done that.

301
00:26:08,639 --> 00:26:12,149
Also, your government, whichever you have 
known, must have done that.

302
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:18,500
So when these things change, when you find 
that you have achieved that kind of integration

303
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:25,029
within you, that whatever your body likes, 
is the good for your Spirit also.

304
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:28,139
Like say for example, I don’t like certain 
things myself.

305
00:26:28,139 --> 00:26:30,919
I don’t like things, I don’t like it.

306
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:34,049
I just don’t like it, nobody can tempt me.

307
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:36,990
I mean, no question of temptation, I just 
don’t like.

308
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,640
I will hate the things which are really bad 
for my Spirit.

309
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,640
Automatically.

310
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,920
I don’t have to tell myself; it’s just 
there.

311
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:49,559
To tell lies I don’t like, allright, because 
it harms me there.

312
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,309
I don’t like it.

313
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:57,299
Whatever is good for your Spirit will automatically 
work out as soon as this integration takes

314
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,190
place, and this is the work of Sahaja Yoga 
today.

315
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:03,470
That’s why I said it is Krita Yuga, is to 
be done.

316
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:10,600
And this integration must be achieved within 
ourselves, so sometimes you have to make your

317
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,690
body come to this level.

318
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:16,019
May be you are under the influence of some 
bhoots.

319
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:19,139
Your body doesn’t help you.

320
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:26,039
Little bit of tapasyas or penance is needed 
after Sahaja Yoga to make this possible and

321
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:32,429
then once you start enjoying, then you like 
it.

322
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:33,830
Like driving a car.

323
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,049
In the beginning it’s difficult.

324
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:36,070
Or swimming.

325
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,999
Anything, when you try to do it, it’s rather 
difficult in the beginning.

326
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:43,080
If I say you forget it now, whatever you have 
done in the past now forget it’ You have

327
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,080
to get to the new things now.

328
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,090
You have to do it.

329
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:52,970
So you have to put your mind to it with all 
your full zest.

330
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:58,000
That “Alright, if my body’s not helping 
me then I’ll try to improve the body because

331
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,740
I’m not the body.

332
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:04,190
If my mind is not helping me, I must improve 
my mind.

333
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:12,250
If my intellect is standing in the way I’ll 
have to put my intellect right because after

334
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,320
all I have to be integrated.

335
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:19,370
If I am not integrated I’m not going to 
enjoy anything nor am I going to do anything

336
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,380
good to myself or to others.

337
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:26,330
So why am I here ? Why am I trying to destroy 
myself ?” But when you are disintegrated

338
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,850
you’ll be surprised.

339
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:33,630
your one action will destroy your second action 
and your second action will destroy your third

340
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,630
action.

341
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,630
When you are disintegrated.

342
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,630
I’ll give you an example.

343
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:43,070
Supposing I am sitting here and somebody tells 
me that this will burn you.

344
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,940
This is my own maya, but the body wants to 
burn itself.

345
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,470
It says : no, don’t listen to this, just 
go ahead.

346
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,499
Now, when I say this it sounds absurd.

347
00:28:51,499 --> 00:28:58,240
But say, the mind says you should not take 
to alcohol but still you’ll go to the pub.

348
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,700
Then you are disintegrated.

349
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:10,760
Gradually once you start listening to your 
body too much, your mind gives in.

350
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,850
It just gives in.

351
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:17,700
In everything that you do, if you are integrated 
you’ll be amazed that you’ll really become

352
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,139
dynamic.

353
00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:27,070
Integration is nothing but your complete connection 
with your Spirit.The Spirit starts flowing

354
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,070
into you.

355
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:34,320
In every walk of life you’ll be amazed how 
dynamic you’ll become if you’re integrated.

356
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:43,100
Just the connection is to be absolutely achieved 
with your Spirit.

357
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:48,399
Whenever you think of something: “Is it 
good for my Spirit ? ”

358
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:56,440
Some people have a habit of thinking that 
spiritual life is such that you hang by the

359
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:03,519
shoestrings somewhere in the air with no connection 
to the day to day life.

360
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:04,909
So many people think like that.

361
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:13,580
They think: “Such a man should be a thin, 
miserable creature hanging onto some tree

362
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:22,940
or something, and should be absolutely in 
a paranoid state or something who is frightened

363
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:30,090
of the whole world, who cannot talk to anyone, 
who is so much exclusive that he becomes a

364
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,090
recluse.

365
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,159
These absurd ideas should to be given up by 
Sahaja Yogis.

366
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:41,279
You have to be very much there, absolutely 
there between all of them, but something:

367
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,370
you should be rare, a different type, a unique 
personality.

368
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:49,539
You are to be there with alI these things 
that are going on.

369
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:53,289
Now people are frightened, you know, even 
of Sahaja Yogis.

370
00:30:53,289 --> 00:31:00,570
They re frightened of Sahaja Yogis, they see 
somebody negative, they say: “Oh, this thing,

371
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,570
that thing.”

372
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,570
Now take a fight with that person.

373
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,570
Take a fight.

374
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,230
How could you dare to do this, such a thing?

375
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,220
You are a Sahaja Yogi.

376
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,220
Come up.

377
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,220
What do you mean by this?

378
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,220
You have to fight it out.

379
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,429
As long as possible you should try to salvage 
a person, talk to him in that manner.

380
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:25,450
The other side of it is that when you talk 
to others, when they come to you, then there

381
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:31,760
has to be a kind of a tremendous sincerity 
within.

382
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,200
If you are doing with that sincerity, people 
will know you are doing with sincerity.

383
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,779
When you talk to a person, they should know 
that sincerity of heart is there.

384
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:48,090
For example, you may talk to that person very 
sweetly, but your heart may not be there and

385
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:51,860
the person might think, “Oh, he’s just 
giving me lectures.”

386
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,860
Alright?

387
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:58,580
But if you talk to someone with a sincerity 
you’d say, “How could you do such a thing?

388
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,899
Can’t you see yourself?

389
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,139
Can’t you work it out?

390
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:03,139
That’s what it is.

391
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:05,000
You are here for that.”

392
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,710
Now in saying so, your sincerity, which is 
coming from your heart, is to be seen, and

393
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:19,519
that’s what is Shri Rama’s character is, 
that he was on the right side of the heart,

394
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,809
means the heart put to activity.

395
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:35,870
Do you understand that, where Kabira has said: 
” Mana mamta ko thir kara Launga” I will

396
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:43,049
make my compassion of my heart, mana, from 
my heart, the compassion, make it steady.

397
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:47,470
”Pancho tattva main Launga” and put them 
into five elements.

398
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:53,440
See, in the same way, when you are in the 
left hear, that’s your sincerity, it’s

399
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,820
your ‘heart-felt’ thing.

400
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,760
But the heartfelt thing, what’s the use, 
you see.

401
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,539
There are many Sahaja Yogis who really feel, 
this world is horrible and something must

402
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:05,350
be done, Sahaja Yoga must be brought in.

403
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:14,710
But how many of you are really putting that 
into action?

404
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,070
Absolutely into action.

405
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:21,200
Without that, your Rama’s tattva cannot 
be improved.

406
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:28,149
Rama’s tattva is only improved when you 
put all the things into action; that’s exactly

407
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:29,340
Shri Rama did.

408
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:36,100
So in the ascent of man, when he came up to 
Ramas place, the advent of Rama was not in

409
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,169
the centre, but on the right hand side.

410
00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:42,820
He moved aside so much so, that he forgot 
about his past.

411
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,500
It’s never mentioned that He’s an Incarnation.

412
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,490
He never told His father.

413
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,480
He never told his mother.

414
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,139
He never told anybody that He was an Incarnation.

415
00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:55,119
Of course it was evident that he was.

416
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:59,269
His brother knew about it.

417
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:03,419
Now he had two brothers.

418
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:04,419
Very interesting.

419
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:10,870
I mean he had other brothers also, but Bharat 
and another one Lakshmana, these two brothers,

420
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:15,330
now they show the two sides of a human being.

421
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:19,230
One was Lakshmana and he was a fiery type, 
you see.

422
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,450
He couldn’t bear anybody misbehaving towards 
Rama.

423
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:30,060
He couldn’t bear anybody talking in a very 
mundane type to Shri Rama and he used to get

424
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:37,860
so angry with all these people that he would 
just come out like a big thunderbolt on anybody

425
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:41,000
who tried to say anything about Shri Rama.

426
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:51,320
Even Parshurama, who was there, a contemporary 
Incarnation of Shri Rama Himself was Parshurama,

427
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,340
there’s a very interesting story about that.But, 
he could not bare Parshurama in any way.
