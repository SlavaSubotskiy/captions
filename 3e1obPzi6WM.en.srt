1
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:13,769
It is so great to be with you people
today on this auspicious day;

2
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:23,212
to be with Australians who have proved
to be very good Sahaja yogis

3
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:32,536
and who have progressed in a very
speedy manner

4
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:40,093
in their spiritual life.

5
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:48,868
It gives me greatest pleasure to be
with my children here.

6
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:05,210
As you know I have so many children
all over the world

7
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,346
apart from the ones whom I actually
physically gave birth.

8
00:05:13,572 --> 00:05:23,003
We have to think of all those today who
are away from us, thousands of miles,

9
00:05:27,604 --> 00:05:34,639
praying to God Almighty for their
spiritual ascent.

10
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:40,491
One has to only pray for the spiritual
ascent.

11
00:05:40,692 --> 00:05:45,412
Because as you ascend you get all
the rest of it.

12
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:53,071
Because you do not ascend you do not
get what is needed.

13
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:58,520
That’s why there are problems.

14
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:05,481
And even today I had to solve some
problems before I could come to puja.

15
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:13,298
But if you decide that we have to ascend
spiritually within us

16
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,990
then everything that you have to receive,

17
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:26,755
all the blessings that God wants to shower
upon you,

18
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:32,645
to make you the citizen of His great
Kingdom,

19
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:38,857
where you are no more judged,

20
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,903
you are no more chastised,

21
00:06:48,877 --> 00:06:52,895
you are no more put to any test,

22
00:06:53,268 --> 00:07:04,481
of where you reside in eternal love
of God and in His glory.

23
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,642
I could not believe about ten years back,

24
00:07:14,843 --> 00:07:22,936
that within ten years I’ll be able
to achieve this result.

25
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:28,985
We should not judge the progress
of Sahaja Yoga

26
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:35,053
in relation to other plastic gurus.

27
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:46,643
Even to create one saint will require
thousand lives to pass,

28
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:58,171
and so many have become prophets,
it is a very big thing for you.

29
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:05,687
Let us forget about what dents we have
within ourselves.

30
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:13,592
We have to know that we are prophets.
This assumption

31
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:18,369
has to be established – that we are
prophets.

32
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:25,716
If you could just assume what you are,
what you have become,

33
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:33,844
you’ll emit the glory of God!

34
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:45,899
Like a flower when it blossoms,

35
00:08:47,146 --> 00:08:52,950
it has its fragrance which flows
automatically,

36
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,916
but it’s only human being who have
freedom even not to assume,

37
00:09:01,117 --> 00:09:06,375
to dramatise or to assume what they are.

38
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:12,819
Even if they have become prophets

39
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,454
they still linger on with what they
are not, in imagination

40
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:25,753
and are still frightened, are still
ego-oriented.

41
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:30,396
Is falsehood. Is not your true nature.

42
00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:41,520
 It’s like acting in a drama, becoming
the actor.

43
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,792
Like somebody is acting like Shivaji,

44
00:09:55,326 --> 00:10:00,803
so he becomes as if he’s Shivaji.

45
00:10:01,004 --> 00:10:05,352
The whole lifestyle, everything changes –
he becomes like Shivaji.

46
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:10,984
But the same person if he’s acting
like Hitler,

47
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:17,095
he becomes like Hitler. Both are
artificial.

48
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:21,480
But artificial they become.

49
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,801
Now when you are really prophets

50
00:10:25,002 --> 00:10:29,769
you find it difficult to be the real person
what you are,

51
00:10:29,978 --> 00:10:36,616
but artificial which has gone back,
which is no more there, all finished.

52
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:45,539
The sinner is dead, the egoistical
is not there,

53
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:53,324
the frightened one is gone forever,
you are a prophet.

54
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:59,330
Rise in the glory of that personality.

55
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:12,278
People who are not prophets, who are
not Godly,

56
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:18,181
who are doing anti-God activities can
assume to be prophets.

57
00:11:18,382 --> 00:11:20,911
But those who are really prophets

58
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:25,776
do not want to assume the situation –
that they are.

59
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:29,887
As soon as you assume, you become that.

60
00:11:30,545 --> 00:11:39,373
We must today get over this kind of a play
our mind has been doing so far.

61
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:46,897
All falsehood has to drop out.

62
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:55,179
Of course as I said,

63
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,966
I could never have dreamt that in ten
years, I’ll achieve these results,

64
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:06,807
with so many devils around us
to entice you.

65
00:12:08,346 --> 00:12:13,150
And credit (?) must go to you people also,

66
00:12:14,726 --> 00:12:24,993
that despite all hurdles and problems
you had, you have ascended,

67
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:35,629
ascended so far, and have become
beautiful prophets.

68
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,484
You are so transformed

69
00:12:38,685 --> 00:12:44,218
that little more – just to assume what
you are,

70
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:49,558
will make you feel so sweet.

71
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:55,008
I talked to my granddaughter, elder one,

72
00:12:55,222 --> 00:13:03,504
and she’s just a little girl, only 11 years
of age, but she told her mother:

73
00:13:03,705 --> 00:13:06,336
“Now I can’t talk to Nani (Grandmother)
because She’s a Goddess.

74
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:11,681
How can I talk to Her! I feel shy.”
At that age!

75
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:22,757
While in her own life as they are saying
she’s topped in all the class,

76
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:30,289
she’s got the, she’s the editor
in a magazine in her school.

77
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:35,205
She’s tremendous. And she’s so humble
that she told her mother,

78
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:37,583
“I feel shy to talk to Nani, She’s
a Goddess,

79
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:40,696
how can I talk to Her?”

80
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:48,433
And Rustom told Me that she, there are
vibrations emitting from her.

81
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:56,722
That’s how you have to grow.

82
00:14:05,249 --> 00:14:09,766
First of all you have to know you are
prophets

83
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:17,090
and you must know that I am the Holy Ghost.
I am the Adi Shakti.

84
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:23,417
I am the one who has come on this earth

85
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:29,612
for the first time in this form to do
this tremendous task.

86
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:36,773
The more you’ll understand this
the better it will be.

87
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,316
You will change tremendously.

88
00:14:56,776 --> 00:15:02,978
I knew I’ll have to say that openly
one day and we have said it.

89
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:09,742
But now it is you people who have
to prove it, that I’m that.

90
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:18,891
Christ had disciples who were not even
realised souls

91
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:22,867
and they have spread Christianity –
whatever it is.

92
00:15:23,068 --> 00:15:27,004
Under such circumstances that Christ
was crucified

93
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:32,603
and they were left high and dry,
just twelve people struggling

94
00:15:32,804 --> 00:15:35,540
but they put it up.

95
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:48,884
They were very humble people, their quality
was extremely humble

96
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:56,029
and they knew the difference between
them and Christ and the Mother.

97
00:15:58,335 --> 00:16:05,381
Also they knew the difference between
them and the others

98
00:16:08,305 --> 00:16:18,394
and they took to lives which were pure,
illumined by the name of Christ.

99
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:21,978
They were not realised souls.

100
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:33,450
They cleansed themselves and kept
their lives beautiful.

101
00:16:35,564 --> 00:16:43,041
So Sahaja yogis can’t afford to have
these six enemies.

102
00:16:43,242 --> 00:16:47,647
First of all, the temper

103
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:54,540
which really doesn’t behove.

104
00:16:54,741 --> 00:17:03,008
Compassion! Replace temper with compassion.

105
00:17:06,744 --> 00:17:12,269
Today is 60th birthday and we have
to just fight

106
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:18,338
only six enemies within ourselves.

107
00:17:30,556 --> 00:17:34,769
Second is which you have, most of you
have done,

108
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:40,402
is to retract your attention
from perversion.

109
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:50,118
Most of you have done it. Your eyes
are better now, steady.

110
00:17:56,357 --> 00:18:03,871
But still you are egoistical.

111
00:18:05,036 --> 00:18:07,256
Vanity.

112
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:21,659
Still people are jealous, competitive.

113
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:35,389
You still have some lurking materialism.

114
00:18:39,071 --> 00:18:44,898
A new thing that is coming, you are getting
attached to your families.

115
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:12,435
So we have to change it now,
in a different use.

116
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:18,683
Same thing can be used for doing
God’s work.

117
00:19:21,652 --> 00:19:27,340
They can be used as the six hands
of Sahaja yogis.

118
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:39,962
The first one is the anger. You have to be
angry with yourself

119
00:19:40,172 --> 00:19:43,763
when you do wrong things. And not
to feel guilty

120
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:48,349
but angry with yourself for doing
wrong things.

121
00:19:49,474 --> 00:19:54,639
Guilty is the best way never to get rid
of it.

122
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:00,701
It’s like a storehouse kept for personal
archives, locked up.

123
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:07,683
I have suffered a lot because of your
guilty business very much.

124
00:20:11,072 --> 00:20:14,586
And they come out one by one.

125
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:20,489
So you have to be angry with yourself
when you feel guilty:

126
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,504
“How can I feel guilty? Why did I do
such a thing?

127
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:26,648
I’m not going to do it.”

128
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:33,418
So develop your anger against yourself
and not against others.

129
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:42,371
And anger could be reserved for the day
of war.

130
00:20:44,485 --> 00:20:48,113
Otherwise when the war will break out

131
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:57,698
all the Arjunas will drop their weapons
and it will be said that,

132
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:02,519
“Arjuna was a great warrior – till the war
started.”

133
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:12,552
So we are not going to waste our energy
in warring with things

134
00:21:12,753 --> 00:21:19,657
which are just like shadows. Not to fight
the shadows.

135
00:21:26,345 --> 00:21:32,252
Sex, perversion, has to be diverted

136
00:21:32,453 --> 00:21:36,308
towards your family, your wife

137
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,223
and you have to respect your chastity now,

138
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:45,641
the whole thing becomes nothing but
chastity, you lead a chaste life.

139
00:21:45,842 --> 00:21:51,046
Not to be like a dog, but like to be like
a human being.

140
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:58,680
All that attention has to become chastity
which is your power,

141
00:21:58,881 --> 00:22:04,774
which is your protection, which is your
connection with the Divine.

142
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:08,445
Not forced chastity

143
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:16,929
but a chastity of balance and
understanding.

144
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:25,250
With your family, with your wife, in a very
chaste way you can live.

145
00:22:27,448 --> 00:22:31,808
Same with women – is more for women,
I would say.

146
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:37,650
That they should not join hands with other
men who talk against your husbands,

147
00:22:39,237 --> 00:22:42,887
or who teach you against your husbands.

148
00:22:45,923 --> 00:22:49,743
All such men should be thrown out
of Sahaja Yoga,

149
00:22:49,944 --> 00:22:55,009
who try to tell women against their
husbands.

150
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,955
This is a very sanctum sanctorum place

151
00:22:58,156 --> 00:23:02,986
where you should not interfere against
the husband.

152
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,205
Nobody has a right.

153
00:23:13,346 --> 00:23:18,875
If there is any problem you should let
me know.

154
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:27,147
It’s a sign of stupidity.

155
00:23:37,357 --> 00:23:42,223
Then the vanity must be made into pride.

156
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:46,501
You should be proud that you are
Sahaja yogis, really proud.

157
00:23:46,702 --> 00:23:52,214
Raise your heads with pride that we are
Sahaja yogis.

158
00:23:52,817 --> 00:23:58,211
Pride is never oppressive, it’s a glorious
thing to be proud.

159
00:23:58,412 --> 00:24:01,430
But vanity is.

160
00:24:03,562 --> 00:24:08,977
Actually pride is nothing but
the expression of self-esteem.

161
00:24:10,022 --> 00:24:17,366
Begging, borrowing, mimicry, all these
things come

162
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:26,251
from the less understanding of yourself.

163
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:29,124
So vanity should be the pride,

164
00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:33,933
and the pride should be the expression
of self-esteem.

165
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:38,063
Self esteem is very different from ego.

166
00:24:38,264 --> 00:24:43,567
One is reality, another is complete
artificiality.

167
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:49,257
Men now should behave like men and not
like women,

168
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:55,083
docile, like cows to be tied with a rope

169
00:24:55,284 --> 00:24:59,322
whenever their women want them to.

170
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:10,249
They have to lead the society.

171
00:25:16,351 --> 00:25:19,264
For the women’s rights in India, the women
never fought:

172
00:25:19,465 --> 00:25:23,311
is the men. They never fought;

173
00:25:23,512 --> 00:25:29,772
is the men, because men are also
the fathers, the brothers,

174
00:25:29,973 --> 00:25:33,956
and they are concerned about the well-being
of women.

175
00:25:34,947 --> 00:25:39,049
Women seldom fought there because
they knew once they start politics

176
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,115
of this fighting with men, there’s no end
to it.

177
00:25:42,316 --> 00:25:44,514
This is basically, they knew they have
to live with men,

178
00:25:44,715 --> 00:25:49,229
they can’t fight them. But men themselves
fought;

179
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,571
even in America it was Abraham Lincoln
who fought

180
00:25:51,772 --> 00:25:57,314
for the liberation of women, not women.

181
00:26:06,515 --> 00:26:16,839
So you have to be not egoistical,
but proud.

182
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,144
Proud that you are Sahaja yogis, proud that
you are born in such a time

183
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:26,194
when you have to carry on the duties
of God’s work.

184
00:26:26,395 --> 00:26:34,026
That God has chosen you! So that you
should come up to that level.

185
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:37,134
Like some people I find suddenly become

186
00:26:37,335 --> 00:26:40,449
morose recluses, in Sahaja Yoga.

187
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:45,808
They will never be forgiven because God
has given you so much.

188
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,377
Supposing somebody gives you a diamond.
You are proud,

189
00:26:49,578 --> 00:26:54,990
you put it on and show-off. But when you
have been given your Spirit

190
00:26:55,191 --> 00:26:59,116
you should be proud and not to behave
like recluses.

191
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:03,747
Some people feel, “I should not take
any job now.

192
00:27:03,948 --> 00:27:06,421
I’ll not go out, I’ll sit at home and
meditate.”

193
00:27:06,603 --> 00:27:10,580
There’s no place for such people
in Sahaja Yoga.

194
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:16,973
“I can’t do this.” The word “can’t”
should go away

195
00:27:17,174 --> 00:27:23,094
from the dictionary of people who are
supposed to be Sahaja yogis.

196
00:27:23,295 --> 00:27:26,716
You just can’t say, “I can’t do it.”

197
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:37,632
So the self-esteem will give you

198
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:40,515
that kind of a dynamism which is needed
for Sahaja Yoga,

199
00:27:40,716 --> 00:27:45,600
a discreet dynamism, a wise dynamism.

200
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:51,319
I won’t have to solve your problems
any more.

201
00:27:55,664 --> 00:28:00,330
The quality of competition and jealousy

202
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,266
should be brought round.

203
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,700
There should be competition between
yourself,

204
00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:16,283
the one what you were and what you are.

205
00:28:17,556 --> 00:28:22,847
Who wins? Whether your past or present?

206
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:31,809
Your present should go fast, faster
and faster,

207
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:37,107
leaving this past behind as much as
you can.

208
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:44,757
There should be no competition between
Sahaja yogis in acquisition.

209
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:49,535
Sometimes I have seen also competition
in shouting, screaming

210
00:28:49,736 --> 00:28:54,999
and being harsh to others – there’s
a big competition on.

211
00:28:56,602 --> 00:29:03,207
Let us have competition in compassion,
in mildness, in sweetness,

212
00:29:05,699 --> 00:29:12,081
in beautiful behaviour.

213
00:29:12,303 --> 00:29:18,687
Who is more cultured, who is more
gentlemanly, who is deeper;

214
00:29:18,888 --> 00:29:23,026
keep somebody an ideal before you
like that,

215
00:29:23,227 --> 00:29:31,537
whom you think is a very gentlemanly person
or a lady who is really like a lady.

216
00:29:33,341 --> 00:29:41,833
But on the contrary if you have a lady
who behaves like a man as your ideal,

217
00:29:42,034 --> 00:29:45,088
that is also not alright.

218
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:56,257
Or a man who behaves like a woman,
that’s also not ideal.

219
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:59,065
Or the other way round.

220
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:02,589
A woman who tries to show that women
are different from men

221
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,291
and women must get this…

222
00:30:04,492 --> 00:30:07,329
In Sahaja Yoga there is nothing like
women and men,

223
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,646
that women must get this and men
must get that.

224
00:30:09,847 --> 00:30:14,041
Because you are Spirit. But the cover
that you have,

225
00:30:14,242 --> 00:30:19,012
the body that you have, the light you have,
the lamp that you have,

226
00:30:19,213 --> 00:30:22,759
is a different thing, and to keep
the light on,

227
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,216
a woman has to be a woman and man
has to be a man.

228
00:30:27,462 --> 00:30:31,760
As yesterday I told you, that an apple
should not try

229
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,106
to be a mango and mango should not try
to be an apple.

230
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:46,592
It looks nice to be the best apple and
looks nice to be the best mango.

231
00:30:46,793 --> 00:30:50,919
So the recluses, those who say, that you
have to get out of it,

232
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:54,795
behave really not like human beings
but I think like –

233
00:30:54,996 --> 00:30:59,691
I don’t know what animals do that way.

234
00:31:01,863 --> 00:31:07,577
Like when you get your doles you cannot
become indolent, you cannot.

235
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:12,876
As far as possible I don’t like people
taking doles.

236
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:15,158
Not a sign of good Sahaja yogis.

237
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:17,716
You all should be hard working, you must
have qualifications,

238
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:22,640
you should be good people on top
of everything.

239
00:31:23,564 --> 00:31:30,710
Good students, good cooks, good mothers,
good fathers,

240
00:31:30,911 --> 00:31:36,420
good administrators – from where are we
going to get these people?

241
00:31:38,937 --> 00:31:42,625
We cannot be dishwashers, can we?

242
00:31:49,178 --> 00:31:53,619
So the competition between women and men
must be stopped.

243
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,780
Women must have their own place and men
must have their own place.

244
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:00,641
And women must know that men are
their hands.

245
00:32:00,842 --> 00:32:02,976
If you are the shakti, they are
the machines

246
00:32:03,177 --> 00:32:05,275
and don’t kill your machines by shouting
at them,

247
00:32:05,476 --> 00:32:11,150
by screaming at them and by putting them
down, making them diffident.

248
00:32:11,351 --> 00:32:14,301
We’ll have no place.

249
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,427
We have to encourage them to do God’s work.

250
00:32:25,628 --> 00:32:28,870
You have to support them, look after them,
because they are the machines,

251
00:32:29,071 --> 00:32:34,613
they are the hands and you are the power.

252
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:50,758
Of course if these hands go against
the power they will suffer.

253
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,429
So there should be no competition between
children and you –

254
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:01,389
my child, and his child, there should be
not such competition,

255
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:05,747
take out your mind from there. There should
be complete sharing.

256
00:33:05,948 --> 00:33:08,777
So the competition should end in sharing.

257
00:33:08,978 --> 00:33:13,739
How much we share? How much can we share?

258
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:21,854
See drunkards can’t sit and drink alone.
They have to have some people to share.

259
00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:27,749
The thieves must have ten people to thieve.

260
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,718
But when it comes to the nectar
of God’s love

261
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:40,025
how can we alone have it? Cannot enjoy.
There’s no enjoyment at all in it.

262
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:44,734
So let us be gentle and kind with
each other.

263
00:33:52,233 --> 00:33:56,692
The people who are going to enjoy
the nectar

264
00:33:57,655 --> 00:34:00,793
should have competition in sharing
that nectar

265
00:34:01,003 --> 00:34:04,743
by which they get more and more of that.

266
00:34:04,944 --> 00:34:09,458
Who shares more? Who is more generous?

267
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:18,938
Materialism should be taken to its beauty.

268
00:34:22,411 --> 00:34:26,350
You can have one thing done with your hand.

269
00:34:29,145 --> 00:34:35,105
That’s much more beautiful than running
after money, counting money,

270
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:39,579
you’ll become crackpots really.

271
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,880
Those who count their money morning
till evening are real crackpots.

272
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:50,165
They always lose money, there’s something
wrong with their brains.

273
00:34:51,553 --> 00:34:54,602
Count your blessings.

274
00:35:00,816 --> 00:35:07,682
See life, the beauty in matter.
How life has worked.

275
00:35:07,883 --> 00:35:14,501
See a wood, I see, I see the pattern
it has created on that, the life.

276
00:35:14,702 --> 00:35:25,683
But it’s not morose, it’s not dead,
it’s not insipid, it’s bubbling.

277
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:36,476
You can see in art, you can see in all
that is beautiful,

278
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:41,338
the reflection of God’s creative power

279
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,431
and the joy that He wanted to emit
for your happiness.

280
00:35:44,632 --> 00:35:46,302
While you become slaves of matter.

281
00:35:46,503 --> 00:35:51,075
He never wanted you to do that.
You are the masters.

282
00:35:53,441 --> 00:35:58,965
Last of all is the attachment to your
children,

283
00:35:59,821 --> 00:36:04,641
to your wife, your, your, your…

284
00:36:04,842 --> 00:36:13,093
Whatever is mine is not ‘I’. My house,
that’s not ‘I’.

285
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:19,883
My this, my, my, my, must be given up,
‘Mamatva’ is to be destroyed.

286
00:36:21,588 --> 00:36:26,760
Instead of that, you should say ‘we’.
‘We’ is a good word.

287
00:36:26,961 --> 00:36:32,190
I so many times say ‘we’. And then people
start wondering...

288
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:37,376
One day, somebody asked me, “Mother,
when you say ‘we’, what do you mean?

289
00:36:37,577 --> 00:36:44,500
How can you make us feel that way, that we
are all one, the way you say ‘we’?”

290
00:36:44,701 --> 00:36:51,060
I said, “Why not? You are part and parcel
of My body. Aren’t we ‘we’?”

291
00:36:51,261 --> 00:36:56,375
Do I separate My finger from My heart?

292
00:36:57,665 --> 00:37:03,521
If you are part and parcel of My body
then I have to talk like ‘we’

293
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:09,134
because I’m conscious of this collective
being sitting here.

294
00:37:10,683 --> 00:37:17,373
So we have to talk like ‘we’ and not
‘I, my’.

295
00:37:19,757 --> 00:37:26,199
And when you have to address about yourself
speak it in a third person.

296
00:37:26,957 --> 00:37:33,628
Like you can say: “This Nirmala is now
going to London.”

297
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:40,920
Really, is true, because this body’s going
there but My heart is going to remain here.

298
00:37:43,491 --> 00:37:52,107
So to say that I am going is not true –
if I am Adi Shakti where am I going?

299
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,513
I’m going nowhere, I’m everywhere.
Where can I go?

300
00:37:56,714 --> 00:38:01,570
There’s no place where I don’t reside
and if I have to go to such a place,

301
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:05,835
it’s Hell only where I don’t want to go.

302
00:38:09,656 --> 00:38:16,369
So, what I say that, “This Nirmala
is going now.

303
00:38:17,808 --> 00:38:23,723
Leaving Australia.” Tomorrow I’ll be
leaving.

304
00:38:23,924 --> 00:38:27,511
So what happens?

305
00:38:29,684 --> 00:38:36,578
Just this body has to move – that’s all.

306
00:38:36,779 --> 00:38:43,527
Like that, you start saying about your
body.

307
00:38:43,728 --> 00:38:48,705
“This mind of mine, this mind of Mr.
So and So.”

308
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:53,779
Is better to address yourself as Mr.
or Mrs. or Miss.

309
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:58,961
“So Miss, will you please get up now?”
Better address yourself.

310
00:38:59,162 --> 00:39:04,183
Children talk like that. Like a third
person.

311
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:11,378
You’ll be amazed, you will see the joke
behind the whole thing.

312
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,760
You’ll know how to laugh at yourself.

313
00:39:13,961 --> 00:39:19,447
“Oh so Mr., come along, now he’s behaving
like this.”

314
00:39:20,885 --> 00:39:23,396
And you’ll really become a master
of yourself,

315
00:39:23,597 --> 00:39:27,637
because you know how to handle this baby.

316
00:39:34,947 --> 00:39:38,820
It will give you that sense of maturity.

317
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:47,596
So to say, “This is my child, this is
my wife”;

318
00:39:47,797 --> 00:39:50,141
of course, you have to look after your wife
and your children

319
00:39:50,342 --> 00:39:54,088
because they’re your responsibility

320
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:59,774
but do for other children more than you
would like to do for your own child.

321
00:40:00,747 --> 00:40:03,938
(There is somebody who has come.)

322
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:35,740
So this complete identification with your
children, over protectiveness,

323
00:40:35,941 --> 00:40:39,699
will give you trouble. You have to believe

324
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:49,408
that your family is the family of your
Father,

325
00:40:51,143 --> 00:40:54,776
and your Mother is looking after it.

326
00:40:54,977 --> 00:41:00,443
If you think you can look after your family
by yourself – go ahead!

327
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:08,904
So don’t be overprotective, don’t be too
worried, too upset about your family.

328
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:17,037
And keep a very sociable temperament

329
00:41:17,238 --> 00:41:21,745
so that your children also don’t become
like you.

330
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:24,778
Tell them how to share.

331
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:30,968
If one child has fallen off ask other
children to help.

332
00:41:31,169 --> 00:41:33,906
Form plays in which you should show,

333
00:41:34,107 --> 00:41:38,578
how a child who is coming, who cannot
walk properly,

334
00:41:38,779 --> 00:41:44,191
how other children go and try and find out
methods how to help him to come out.

335
00:41:44,382 --> 00:41:50,983
Teach them, through dramas, through
stories, through various things,

336
00:41:51,184 --> 00:41:54,611
what is goodness.

337
00:41:55,536 --> 00:41:58,783
You must help even without the idea
of help.

338
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:07,719
It’s a pleasure, it’s a privilege.
It’s a great honour that you can do it.

339
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,058
We must change our ideas completely.

340
00:42:12,383 --> 00:42:14,800
Many people have a habit to serve
‘your’ child first –

341
00:42:15,001 --> 00:42:20,932
is absolutely very vulgar, shows bad
breeding.

342
00:42:21,227 --> 00:42:25,857
Must serve others first, and then your
own family.

343
00:42:28,332 --> 00:42:32,939
Keeping something back for your children,
hiding some food for your children –

344
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:39,155
is all a sign of a person who is like
a ‘kupamanduka’,

345
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:45,576
means ‘a frog who lives in a small well’.

346
00:42:47,615 --> 00:42:49,931
Get over it.

347
00:42:52,087 --> 00:42:56,969
Try, men to form your own group of men

348
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:01,098
and women should form their group of women.

349
00:43:01,299 --> 00:43:09,849
There should be no instruction to women
from men too much. Is not proper.

350
00:43:10,481 --> 00:43:14,119
I have discovered so many funny things,

351
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:19,508
I can’t understand, how these things
work out.

352
00:43:19,709 --> 00:43:26,018
But, it is because one side you feel your
family is too much,

353
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:33,062
your husband is too much, you must be
absolutely secluded from all the rest,

354
00:43:33,263 --> 00:43:37,280
or on the other side it is that you give up
your husband completely -

355
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,642
he is no good, the marriage is
unsuccessful, stick on to something else

356
00:43:41,843 --> 00:43:47,492
which is supposed to be a something,
higher goal of destruction.

357
00:43:48,027 --> 00:43:51,661
So both things are not good.

358
00:43:53,616 --> 00:44:00,825
You must stand for your husband or wife
or for your children, when it is right.

359
00:44:01,026 --> 00:44:04,388
But obviously you should not do it,
apparently you should not do it.

360
00:44:04,589 --> 00:44:06,832
You should tell your child, “Alright,
I understand,

361
00:44:07,033 --> 00:44:10,874
but I don’t want to do it in the public.”

362
00:44:11,976 --> 00:44:15,163
People should not also know that he’s
your child.

363
00:44:15,364 --> 00:44:18,500
The way he mixes up with others, stays
with others,

364
00:44:18,701 --> 00:44:23,007
shares with others, that’s how a Sahaja
yogi should be.

365
00:44:26,637 --> 00:44:28,238
You know as for myself,

366
00:44:28,439 --> 00:44:33,740
I’ve not even given realisation
to my children so far.

367
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:42,017
Can you believe it? Leave alone the
knowledge of Kundalini. You can teach them.

368
00:44:43,137 --> 00:44:47,071
I know I can give them any time I want to.

369
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:55,384
I have not given them time at all,
no time to them.

370
00:44:55,585 --> 00:45:01,377
If you see, how much time do I spend with
My own daughters? Very little time.

371
00:45:01,578 --> 00:45:07,442
In the whole year, this year I was there
for three days with her.

372
00:45:09,928 --> 00:45:13,069
So the relationship at this time is
the most important,

373
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:17,117
is of Sahaja Yoga and Sahaja yogis.

374
00:45:17,318 --> 00:45:20,716
I have seen some Sahaja yogis write
to their parents, to their mothers,

375
00:45:20,917 --> 00:45:26,239
to their brothers, much more than they
write to the other Sahaja yogis.

376
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:29,704
Is very amazing.

377
00:45:31,049 --> 00:45:36,019
To their fathers but not to other
Sahaja yogis.

378
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:38,834
You must start writing to other
Sahaja yogis.

379
00:45:39,035 --> 00:45:42,120
Those who have lived in London,
how many of them

380
00:45:42,321 --> 00:45:45,193
are writing to people in London? Have
they made any friends or anything? –

381
00:45:45,394 --> 00:45:49,592
Nothing of the kind. They are so busy
with their own problems,

382
00:45:49,793 --> 00:45:58,365
they’re not bothered, to create that
bondage of love.

383
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:04,092
As if they have no interest in Sahaja Yoga.

384
00:46:04,293 --> 00:46:10,538
They stayed in the ashram, in London. How
many of you are writing letters to them?

385
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,829
To London people. How many letters
do you write?

386
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:16,519
Now you have met them in this programme,

387
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,288
how many of you are writing letters
to them and keep in contact?

388
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:24,663
How much does it take to write a letter?
Nothing.

389
00:46:28,082 --> 00:46:31,550
I hope as soon as you go back today you
all should write letters

390
00:46:31,751 --> 00:46:36,447
about today’s Birthday – how it was
celebrated, in a beautiful way.

391
00:46:36,648 --> 00:46:43,403
Not to your family, not to your people,
but to others.

392
00:46:43,604 --> 00:46:46,708
All of them are all over, you know how
they are.

393
00:46:46,909 --> 00:46:50,386
You write to them because you know
they are the heads of the thing.

394
00:46:50,587 --> 00:46:57,394
Like if you write to Gregoire or you can
write to Ruth in Italy,

395
00:46:57,595 --> 00:47:03,918
you can write to Genevieve in Geneva.

396
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:08,326
You have met all of them – you should
write!

397
00:47:10,297 --> 00:47:13,996
Ladies must write to ladies and men must
write to men.

398
00:47:14,197 --> 00:47:18,149
Arneau is in Lausanne: why not write
to him?

399
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:23,739
He’s there; now do you know that his wife
has to go to America for a delivery?

400
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,099
We should know about each other,
very intimately.

401
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:32,131
About how many people I know so many
things, all the details.

402
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:42,518
That’s how; you must flood yourself
with that love.

403
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:47,639
Tomorrow you go to America or to any
one of these places,

404
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:52,407
you have there your brothers and sisters
already established.

405
00:47:53,035 --> 00:47:56,919
Write to them about your Mother,
what you think.

406
00:47:58,313 --> 00:48:03,529
You only write to Me sometimes but never
to each other.

407
00:48:05,588 --> 00:48:10,823
Don’t write too big letters to Me
especially.

408
00:48:13,592 --> 00:48:17,839
But write nice, sweet letters, poetic
letters,

409
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,930
they’ll feel happy, it’s like sending
flowers.

410
00:48:23,758 --> 00:48:29,153
Taking ideas from there it will be
a very good idea.

411
00:48:29,354 --> 00:48:31,797
(What’s the matter?)

412
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:52,197
This will overcome these six enemies
and make them your slaves

413
00:48:52,398 --> 00:48:56,309
and use them for your purpose.

414
00:48:56,684 --> 00:49:02,805
Then they’ll become great things.
Then they’ll be your assistants,

415
00:49:04,453 --> 00:49:15,677
then they wlll be your commanders of your
army, they’ll be your decorations.

416
00:49:17,565 --> 00:49:22,667
It is all in your hands. With wisdom,
you have to do it.

417
00:49:24,526 --> 00:49:30,400
At this time, at the age where I’ve
reached –

418
00:49:34,995 --> 00:49:39,203
I was always there, same age,

419
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:45,011
I’ve been always mature like this,
child like this,

420
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:52,077
just like a young girl and an old woman,
all put together,

421
00:49:52,278 --> 00:49:55,610
every year, every time.

422
00:49:55,986 --> 00:50:00,297
But I’ve definitely matured in understanding
human beings.

423
00:50:03,851 --> 00:50:06,989
I’ve definitely got better understanding
and maturity

424
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:11,532
as far as My knowledge about human beings
are concerned because they are...

425
00:50:11,733 --> 00:50:14,553
When I was born they were strangers
to Me – just strangers.

426
00:50:14,754 --> 00:50:18,598
Imagine that Adi Shakti should say this,
but it’s true!

427
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:26,490
Despite I have created you, I was
absolutely a stranger.

428
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:35,190
But now, I’ve grown, I’ve understood you
very well,

429
00:50:37,489 --> 00:50:43,875
I know you are My children, I know how much
you love Me

430
00:50:44,506 --> 00:50:47,099
and how much you are close to Me.

431
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,896
[Shri Mataji: Why is he crying so much?
Yogi: He wants to go to the toilet, Mother.

432
00:50:51,097 --> 00:50:53,894
Shri Mataji: Let him take away.
Yogi: He wants me to go with him

433
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:57,409
but I’m trying to say he can go himself,
but...

434
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,371
Shri Mataji: Let him go, this is the thing,
you see,

435
00:50:59,572 --> 00:51:01,375
these children are very obstinate,
I personally think.

436
00:51:01,576 --> 00:51:04,169
Yogi: Yeah. He wants me to go with him.
That’s the thing, that’s why.

437
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:06,011
Shri Mataji: That’s it. That’s bhootish,
isn’t it?

438
00:51:06,212 --> 00:51:08,964
Yogi: Yes, that’s what I’m saying.
Shri Mataji: We can think - let him go.

439
00:51:09,165 --> 00:51:12,036
He won’t listen.

440
00:51:12,546 --> 00:51:16,701
Better go. See.

441
00:51:21,436 --> 00:51:23,346
All right, take him down.

442
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:28,231
What to do, you see, they are very
obstinate. They are bhoots.

443
00:51:28,448 --> 00:51:32,282
Such a big boy can’t go to the toilet?
Yogi: Yes...

444
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:42,429
Shri Mataji: Just to disturb him,
that’s all.

445
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:48,824
May God bless you.

446
00:51:51,087 --> 00:51:52,595
You must really slap him now,

447
00:51:52,796 --> 00:51:56,179
if you give two slaps now, his bhoot
will go away.

448
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:58,478
Two slaps are needed. Next time
he won’t do it.

449
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,860
You see at this time you must slap,

450
00:52:01,061 --> 00:52:05,404
not very hard but let him know that
you don’t like it.

451
00:52:09,204 --> 00:52:11,688
Bhoots can sometimes can go away
only with slapping.

452
00:52:11,889 --> 00:52:14,808
I have seen especially with children
it happens.

453
00:52:15,009 --> 00:52:17,897
Two slaps on the face and they’re alright.

454
00:52:18,098 --> 00:52:21,850
Because they’re bhoots, you see, and they
have to go away.]

455
00:52:23,657 --> 00:52:28,371
Now whatever I have said to you yesterday
for children be careful.

456
00:52:28,572 --> 00:52:35,891
You have to make your children assets
and not liabilities, on Sahaja Yoga.

457
00:52:42,628 --> 00:52:45,232
So try to train them up properly.

458
00:52:45,433 --> 00:52:50,895
Bring them up, they deserve a good hand,
to handle.

459
00:52:51,312 --> 00:52:55,595
In the beginning you have to be very strict
and punish them if they do anything wrong,

460
00:52:55,796 --> 00:52:59,422
so they know what is right, what is wrong.

461
00:53:01,751 --> 00:53:06,581
And once they grow up you’ll be amazed
what an asset they are.

462
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:13,340
Some of them are very good children

463
00:53:13,804 --> 00:53:17,161
but if the influence of the bad children
comes up too much,

464
00:53:17,362 --> 00:53:20,589
they might spoil the good children also.

465
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:27,386
So better encourage children, who are good,
who have been very sweet.

466
00:53:29,616 --> 00:53:37,750
So I think of My young age, of My childhood

467
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:41,949
and the dream, how it has come true.

468
00:53:45,626 --> 00:53:50,944
Whatever I have dreamt, is beyond
my imagination.

469
00:53:53,578 --> 00:54:00,813
It’s done now, as far as I’m concerned
you don’t need Me much, any more.

470
00:54:01,107 --> 00:54:05,430
I’ve told you whatever was needed
for your counselling.

471
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:12,593
I have taught you the methods how to redeem
others, and comfort them.

472
00:54:12,794 --> 00:54:18,687
You know everything. Now just become
masters in this art.

473
00:54:19,865 --> 00:54:27,675
Forgetting your past. You are all great
people, all of you.

474
00:54:28,193 --> 00:54:35,189
So, even next year, I should see you

475
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:42,531
sitting on this seat, not in My lap.

476
00:54:45,322 --> 00:54:50,977
On your own, teaching your children.

477
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:57,225
Let the second generation start now.
The first generation is ready,

478
00:54:57,433 --> 00:55:00,077
now the second generation has to come
and you have to look after

479
00:55:00,278 --> 00:55:03,299
the second generation.

480
00:55:04,024 --> 00:55:11,435
I want to be a real grandmother of very
grand children,

481
00:55:16,642 --> 00:55:21,811
that’s a special privilege and real
promotion and maturity.

482
00:55:24,335 --> 00:55:27,005
Look at this (rain is pouring down).

483
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:31,211
He’s going to flood your Parramatta
(river in Sydney).

484
00:55:32,999 --> 00:55:37,692
Because I have said now I’m the Holy Ghost,

485
00:55:40,949 --> 00:55:45,829
everybody seems to be over-happy and
joyous.

486
00:55:51,605 --> 00:55:56,584
So thank you very much, for having Me here

487
00:55:56,785 --> 00:56:01,948
and think of all the Sahaja yogis all
around the world, all of them.

488
00:56:02,149 --> 00:56:06,056
Today, I think we should send some

if possible, to all the centres, saying

490
00:56:11,441 --> 00:56:16,779
60th Birthday of Mother was celebrated
with great joy.

491
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:21,873
She sends blessings, or something.
They’ll be very happy.

492
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:29,378
But according to Indian method it is 61st

493
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:33,636
because the day I was born, that was also
a birthday.

494
00:56:33,837 --> 00:56:38,119
That was a real birthday. So they
call it 61,

495
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,791
and we are going to have a big programme
in India also.

496
00:56:43,918 --> 00:56:49,872
You are specially favoured people,

497
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:53,583
and I hope you’ll favour Me specially too.

498
00:56:53,768 --> 00:56:59,203
This year I hope, all of you are going
to take up a new role

499
00:56:59,404 --> 00:57:04,290
and a new style of life where you become
mild people,

500
00:57:04,616 --> 00:57:11,194
not docile men but mild people and docile
women.

501
00:57:16,415 --> 00:57:23,962
Women have to be more docile, domesticated.

502
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:27,028
They’ll look nice.

503
00:57:27,782 --> 00:57:35,656
They’ll become gentle, they’ll smile
better, they(’ll) create such joy.

504
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:42,136
We are here to create joy and not to enjoy
some rights, which are artificial,

505
00:57:42,337 --> 00:57:46,336
to create joy. How much joy do we create?

506
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:55,249
How much joy do we give to others?
So today on this great occasion,

507
00:57:56,372 --> 00:58:02,278
we have to feel our joy, within our heart.

508
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:08,467
Very deep down within us lies that source
of joy.

509
00:58:08,668 --> 00:58:12,073
So we have to go deep down within ourselves

510
00:58:12,274 --> 00:58:18,978
and feel the joy of this sixty-year old
Mother of yours, that I have within Myself.

511
00:58:19,186 --> 00:58:24,707
Go deep down, it’s there, enjoy it and then
give it to others.

512
00:58:24,908 --> 00:58:28,290
Like a fountain of joy you should give.

513
00:58:29,917 --> 00:58:32,319
May God bless you.

514
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:41,871
Declare to all the nations now,
that I am the Holy Ghost

515
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:49,091
and I have come for this special time,
that is the resurrection time.
