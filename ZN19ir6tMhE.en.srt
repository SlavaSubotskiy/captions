1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:09,542
So welcome to you all, Sahaja Yogis,

2
00:00:09,834 --> 00:00:15,959
to this great country of yoga.

3
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:29,250
Today first of all we have to establish

4
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:36,500
our desire within ourselves

5
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,250
that we are seekers

6
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:46,500
and that we have to achieve our full growth and maturity.

7
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:53,500
Today's puja is for the whole universe.

8
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:59,083
The whole universe

9
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,000
should be enlightened with your desires.

10
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:08,333
Your desires should be so intense

11
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:12,750
that they should emit out

12
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:18,417
the pure vibrations of Mahakali Shakti,

13
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,583
which is the pure desire

14
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:28,000
of attaining the spirit.

15
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,667
That's the real desire.

16
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:37,999
All the other desires are like mirage.

17
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:49,999
You are the people who are chosen by God.

18
00:01:52,083 --> 00:02:00,083
Specially, first to express your desire,

19
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:04,000
and then to achieve it.

20
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:15,750
And by intense desire of purity

21
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:20,500
you have to purify the whole world.

22
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:22,750
Not only the seekers,

23
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:27,083
but even those who are not seekers.

24
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:39,834
You have to create an aura around this universe,

25
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:47,834
of desire to achieve the ultimate,

26
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,333
the spirit.

27
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:03,417
Without desire this universe would not have been created.

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:15,500
This Desire of God is the one that is the Holy Ghost,

29
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:19,667
is this all-pervading power,

30
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,750
is the Kundalini within you.

31
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:29,000
Kundalini has only one desire,

32
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,583
is to be the spirit

33
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,583
and anything else if you desire

34
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,750
the Kundalini doesn't rise.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,250
Only when it knows

36
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:51,917
that this desire is going to be fulfilled

37
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:02,917
by somebody, who is facing the seeker,

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,583
it is awakened.

39
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:15,250
If you do not have the desire,

40
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,250
no-one can force you.

41
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,750
Sahaja Yogis should never try

42
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:26,083
to force this desire on other people.

43
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,750
The first ordeal we face,

44
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:32,333
as soon as you get your Realization,

45
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:38,000
is that you just start thinking of your family.

46
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,667
You start thinking: 'My mother has not got it,

47
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,999
my father has not got it,

48
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,667
my wife has not got it,

49
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:52,999
my children have not got it.'

50
00:04:55,417 --> 00:05:01,917
You must know that these relations are worldly.

51
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:04,166
Sanskrit is loukik.

52
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,750
They are not aloukik,

53
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:10,750
they are not beyond the worldly relationships.

54
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:12,999
These are worldly relations,

55
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,250
and these attachments are worldly.

56
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:21,250
So if you play into that of course as you know,

57
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,667
that Mahamaya Shakti allows you to play with that.

58
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,917
You go ahead, as long as you like.

59
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:31,500
People bring Me all their relations,

60
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,750
parents, this and that

61
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,250
and ultimately they discover

62
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:41,583
that this was a very wrong thing they did.

63
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:48,583
They lost so many precious moments,

64
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,250
so many hours, so many years,

65
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,166
wasting their energy on people

66
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:59,333
who never deserved any attention of Mother.

67
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:05,834
Sooner you realize the better that this desire

68
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:11,083
may be within you,

69
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:16,834
and may not be in anyone of your so-called worldly relations.

70
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:21,750
Makes no difference.

71
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,166
As Christ was told

72
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,083
that His brothers and sisters are waiting outside,

73
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:34,583
He said: 'Who are My brothers and who are My sisters?'

74
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:40,667
So one has to realize that those people who involve themselves

75
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,083
into the problems of their family all the time,

76
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,166
and attract My attention,

77
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:51,000
you must know that I am just playing about.

78
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:55,083
It is of no value to you.

79
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,750
For your ascent it is important first of all

80
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:01,083
to have no desires

81
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:06,250
to create desire in your kith and kin.

82
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:11,250
This is the first principle of establishment

83
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:15,417
of Mahakali Power.

84
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:21,166
Specially in India

85
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,834
where people are too much attached to their family,

86
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:28,667
it's a very big problem.

87
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:32,083
If you give Realization to one person,

88
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:36,834
you are amazed to see that all relationship they have

89
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:40,417
is with a big bunch of bhoots.

90
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,667
And once you give Realization to one person you are in for trouble.

91
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:50,917
Then all the bhoots walk in, slowly,

92
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:54,583
torturing My life, wasting My energy,

93
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:58,333
and absolutely disgusting.

94
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:01,667
It should happen to you to understand

95
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,834
that this is not auspicious.

96
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,500
If you want to waste your time,

97
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:11,417
I will allow you to waste your time.

98
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:17,750
But if you want to have the ascent fast,

99
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:19,999
first of all one must remember

100
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:25,000
that these are relations which are absolutely worldly relations

101
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:29,000
and this is not your pure desire.

102
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,834
So try to separate your pure desire

103
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:38,083
from your worldly desires.

104
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:42,583
It does not by any means,

105
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:47,417
suggest that you give up your family,

106
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,999
you give up your mother or give up your sister - nothing.

107
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,333
But you witness them

108
00:08:54,417 --> 00:09:00,500
and see, as you would see anybody else,

109
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:05,999
and see for yourself, whether

110
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:09,999
they are really desirous or not.

111
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,750
If they are - well and good.

112
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:15,417
They should not be disqualified because they are your relations.

113
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,333
It works both ways.

114
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:21,083
As they cannot be qualified because they are your relations,

115
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:26,417
they cannot be disqualified because they're your relations.

116
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:34,667
So in Sahaja Yoga to make your desire a pure desire,

117
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:41,999
you have to get out of so many things.

118
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:46,583
But for people who are attached to their family,

119
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:50,333
are bound by their family,

120
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,500
they have to see to it

121
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:56,500
that they do not force Sahaja Yoga on anyone of their relations,

122
00:09:56,583 --> 00:10:00,583
at least don't force them on Me.

123
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:14,709
Now this desire within us,

124
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:19,208
which is the Mahakali Power which is manifesting,

125
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,667
comes to us in so many ways.

126
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:25,208
As I told you first of all,

127
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,750
it comes to us after Realization,

128
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,125
because you are all Sahaja Yogis,

129
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:35,709
to do something about our relations.

130
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:39,166
Then the second desire that comes to us,

131
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:44,291
that let us try to cure people,

132
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:48,917
who are our relations.

133
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,375
This is the second desire,

134
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,917
you should face yourself and see,

135
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,125
that this has happened to many of you.

136
00:11:56,208 --> 00:12:01,750
So, right from leprosy

137
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:07,125
to any small thing like cold or sneezing,

138
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,458
whatever they have,

139
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:15,417
you think you should bring to Mother.

140
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:22,709
And all the worries of your families should be brought to Mother.

141
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:27,250
Simple thing like pregnancy or sneezing,

142
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:32,458
very simple things - which are so natural

143
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:39,709
are brought into your attention.

144
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,166
So when you have them in your attention I say:

145
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:48,625
'All right, go ahead with it. Try to solve it, if possible.'

146
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,375
But if you do not have them in your attention

147
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,417
they are in My attention.

148
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:02,333
You leave them in My attention, I'll manage that.

149
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:06,458
But then it's a vicious circle.

150
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:11,125
It's a very subtle projection of the mind

151
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,000
that thinks: 'All right,

152
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,208
that Mother we don't have this in our attention,

153
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:21,041
You'd better look after it." That's not the way.

154
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:26,041
You should have only one intense desire within yourself:

155
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,834
"Have I become the spirit?

156
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:34,041
Have I achieved my ultimate?

157
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:38,999
Have I risen above the worldly desires?"

158
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,041
Purify it.

159
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,875
Once you start purifying whatever falls off,

160
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:51,125
I'll look after that.

161
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:57,125
This is just an assurance, but not a guarantee.

162
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:05,625
If it deserves My attention I will definitely look after you.

163
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:14,834
You have to value your attention as I value My attention.

164
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:23,250
I think you have to value much more of your attention

165
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:28,999
than Me, because I can manage,

166
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,834
many more things within Myself,

167
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,417
because everything is in My attention.

168
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:42,375
But you try to purify your desires,

169
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,500
away from the worldly problems that are facing you.

170
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:51,500
So you expand it more, then you start thinking:

171
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:58,792
'Mother, what about the problem of our country?'

172
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,792
All right, give Me the map of your country - finished.

173
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:09,458
That's more than sufficient.

174
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:17,083
Then purify yourself.

175
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:22,291
The desire that you have, you leave it.

176
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:23,999
And once you are purified

177
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,125
that area will be covered through your attention,

178
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:31,125
it's very interesting.

179
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:37,917
When you get over it then only you can throw light,

180
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,208
but if you are inside you are hidden by that.

181
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,875
Your light is hidden, there's no light emitted.

182
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:47,750
You all rise above that desire.

183
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,834
Every time you get a desire you rise above it,

184
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,667
so your light is emitted on that wider problem

185
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,542
that you are facing

186
00:15:57,667 --> 00:16:02,999
which you think should be solved by Me.

187
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:08,959
These are all My headaches which you are taking on yourself.

188
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,291
You have to do only one thing is to become the spirit

189
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:14,959
that's all. Is a simple thing.

190
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:19,500
The rest of it is My headache.

191
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:27,875
Now the problems

192
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:34,959
that should take your desire on the collective

193
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:42,792
should be very different.

194
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:48,667
To substantiate your purity,

195
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:53,917
to be fragrant with your purity,

196
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,291
your attention should be on the other side.

197
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,083
Now you are not facing Me,

198
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,333
you are sitting with Me facing the whole world.

199
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:06,750
See, the whole attitude will change.

200
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:12,125
The attitude should be: 'What can I give?

201
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,583
How can I give?

202
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:18,999
What is my mistake in giving?

203
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,625
I have to be more alert.

204
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:26,041
Where is my attention?

205
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,542
I have to be more alert towards myself

206
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:32,917
what am I doing?

207
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:38,041
What's my responsibility?'

208
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:46,000
You must desire that you should be pure.

209
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,250
You should be pure desire.

210
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:53,083
That means you should be the spirit.

211
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:58,125
That, "What is your responsibility to yourself?"

212
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:04,375
You should desire that your responsibility to yourself

213
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,208
should be manifested,

214
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:12,792
should be complete.

215
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:18,583
Then your responsibility to this Sahaja Yoga.

216
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:22,583
What is your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

217
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:25,125
which is the work of God,

218
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:31,667
which has started and you are My hands.

219
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:37,542
You have to do the work of God,

220
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:42,000
and you have to fight the anti-God elements,

221
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,500
the satanic elements.

222
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:47,125
You are not responsible for your family any more,

223
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,875
those who are, are half-baked Sahaja Yogis

224
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:54,667
I said, are useless absolutely good for nothing.

225
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:57,500
All such will drop out, their families will suffer,

226
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,166
I know this is going to happen.

227
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,667
Because now the forces are gathering in such a way

228
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:06,417
that sorting out will start.

229
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:11,917
Your responsibility to yourself, to be the spirit,

230
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,125
your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

231
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:23,291
your responsibility to understand Me,

232
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:27,959
better and better and better.

233
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,041
Your responsibility to understand this mechanism

234
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,125
that is within you,

235
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,333
your responsibility to understand how this mechanism

236
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:43,000
works out everything.

237
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,999
The responsibility is to how to become a guru yourself.

238
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:55,458
Your responsibility to be a dignified and a glorified personality.

239
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,250
A responsibility to be a respectable person

240
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:03,125
and not a cheap personality.

241
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:06,250
Every one of you

242
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:13,542
is worth the whole universe.

243
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:19,750
If you want to rise to that height.

244
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:27,417
Universes of universes can be thrown away at your feet.

245
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:30,500
If you want to rise to that height,

246
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:36,625
to that magnitude that is within you to prosper.

247
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:41,208
But those people,

248
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:51,250
who still want to live on a very low level cannot rise.

249
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,625
For example,

250
00:20:55,709 --> 00:21:00,417
the western Sahaja Yogis have certain problems

251
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:08,792
of committing the sin against the Mother,

252
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:11,959
and the eastern Sahaja Yogis have the problem

253
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:16,750
of committing sin against the Father.

254
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:23,750
It's not difficult at all

255
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:30,041
for you to get out of it.

256
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:44,875
The attention is to be kept pure.

257
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:49,917
In Sahaja Yoga you know all the methods

258
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,291
how the attention one can keep it pure.

259
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,542
If the attention is not pure

260
00:21:57,667 --> 00:22:00,750
then this desire

261
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:05,542
will be always attacked

262
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:08,583
by all petty nonsensical things

263
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:12,667
which has no meaning in your ascent.

264
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,709
Now a person who is a good Sahaja Yogi

265
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,417
is not bothered about clothes, what others say to him

266
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:20,667
or what others are talking to him,

267
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,583
how they are behaving towards him and

268
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:26,458
the attention is not on that

269
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:31,625
criticism that this person is like this, that person is like that.

270
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:37,500
Nor there is the aggressiveness

271
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:43,667
of anyone else,

272
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,709
because nobody is the other.

273
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:51,583
But the problem is when I say that,

274
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:57,625
no-one thinks that I'm saying about you, each persons.

275
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,125
Those who are aggressive take the other role

276
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:08,750
and those who are non-aggressive think the other way.

277
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:13,083
Like I say something for a person who is aggressive,

278
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:16,542
the non-aggressive immediately thinks of the person who is aggressive,

279
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:20,125
not about himself.

280
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:23,333
You immediately start shifting your mind to other person,

281
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:27,999
finding faults with other people.

282
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:34,291
So this desire becomes

283
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:40,125
gradually lower and lower and lower

284
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:45,291
because of the loads that are put onto it.

285
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:48,792
So the alertness is very important,

286
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:53,917
complete alertness - satarkata,

287
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:59,041
that we should keep our attention

288
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:06,959
purely for the sustenance of our pure desire.

289
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:13,000
Desire comes from your heart

290
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,875
and you are so built

291
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:19,458
that your brahmarandra is also the heart.

292
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,542
If you don't have a clean heart,

293
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:27,000
this won't keep clean.

294
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,792
There are people

295
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:32,625
who think if they talk about Sahaja Yoga big,

296
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:35,792
and all that, they are all right.

297
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:39,333
They are cheating themselves.

298
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:43,333
If the heart is not open

299
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:46,999
then this is closed.

300
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:53,291
So try to open your heart by projecting.

301
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,417
Projecting it.

302
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,542
I hope today when you do this puja

303
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:10,709
and you do the worship of Mahakali

304
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:15,750
and this special yagya,

305
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:20,542
we will definitely establish this aura,

306
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:25,417
and enlighten the universe.

307
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,333
But your outlook should be:

308
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:32,458
'How much I have contributed to this.

309
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:36,709
Am I still thinking of other people,

310
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:41,917
am I still thinking of my petty small problems,

311
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:48,250
or I'm thinking of my spirit?'

312
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:55,291
So, the left side

313
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:02,625
starts and ends with Shri Ganesh.

314
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:09,041
Shri Ganesh has only basic one quality,

315
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:12,000
that He's completely surrendered to His Mother,

316
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:15,792
He does not know any other God,

317
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:19,542
He does not even know His Father.

318
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,250
He only knows His Mother

319
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:28,834
and completely surrendered to Her.

320
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:38,500
But this pure desire has to have the action,

321
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:41,208
and about which I'll tell you later

322
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:45,875
as we will be having more pujas and more pujas.

323
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:51,792
But today let us establish ourselves

324
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:59,875
into that pure desire, to be the spirit.

325
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:08,041
Now, as it is, with the western mind we'll say: 'How?'

326
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:15,542
Is always coming, "How to do it?"

327
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:22,291
Should I tell you? It's very simple.

328
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:27,291
Adi Shankaracharya wrote 'Viveka Chudamani'

329
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:31,875
and so many other books of treaties,

330
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:38,500
and then all these big intellectuals got after his life.

331
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:40,875
And they said:

332
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:44,083
'How this and how that and how?'

333
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,667
He said: 'Forget these people.'

334
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:51,458
Then he wrote 'Saundarya Lahari',

335
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:53,667
it's just a description of his Mother

336
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:56,208
and his devotion to Her

337
00:27:56,291 --> 00:28:05,709
and every couplet that He wrote is a mantra.

338
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:08,083
It is not the surrender

339
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:14,083
of your mind through your mind,

340
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:19,959
but the surrender of your heart.

341
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:26,917
Is absolutely the surrender of your heart.

342
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:30,959
Western Sahaja Yogis know very well

343
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:34,500
how there have been attacks

344
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:38,500
and attacks of negativity on them,

345
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:45,166
specially when horrible people like Freud

346
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:53,125
came to destroy their basic, the roots.

347
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:58,500
And how the West accepted it blindfolded,

348
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:03,667
and put them on the path of hell.

349
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:07,500
All that has to be brought out.

350
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:11,792
That is all nonsense, is wrong, absolutely

351
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:16,750
against God, it's anti-God activity.

352
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:20,291
Then you will realize

353
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:28,792
that you will fight fully, by saying,

354
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:35,583
"This is the destruction of our basics, our roots,

355
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:37,125
when our Mother is the source

356
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:42,000
of everything that is sublime, noble,

357
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:45,375
all that is nourishing,

358
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:51,000
all that is elevating, emancipating.

359
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:54,625
You have cutting us from our roots.

360
00:29:54,709 --> 00:30:00,208
"When he dealt with, I think, animal-like creatures

361
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:07,458
and he wants all of you to go down to that low level

362
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:11,166
of human beings,

363
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:19,333
which exist as pathological cases, I don't know.

364
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:23,000
So it is important for you to understand all the attacks

365
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,709
that came on you,

366
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:26,291
and be alert

367
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:31,999
and don't be identified with anyone of these.

368
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:35,417
Last I would say you have come to this country

369
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,959
to see the roots and not the shoot.

370
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,375
Change your attitude of western style.

371
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,875
Telephones are no good.

372
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:48,375
You cannot get any telephones done here.

373
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,625
Postage is horrible.

374
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,750
Railways are worst.

375
00:30:53,875 --> 00:31:00,000
I shouldn't say because we are in a railway.

376
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:12,125
But, the people are excellent.

377
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,083
They know what is dharma.

378
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:16,000
They are not being attacked, somehow or other

379
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,999
because it being the Kundalini.

380
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:23,667
The Ganesha is sitting here how dare anybody attack?

381
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:28,125
This great Maharashtra has got eight Ganeshas,

382
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,333
protecting them.

383
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:33,417
I don't know if these Maharashtrians know this fact.

384
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:35,875
And so many marutis,

385
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:38,625
so who can attack this country?

386
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,000
There is no negative attack

387
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:45,417
except that they themselves are rather money-minded sort.

388
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:48,583
That's the only curse they have, if they can get out of it

389
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:52,500
they are great people.

390
00:31:55,542 --> 00:32:02,417
So, we have come to this country not to enjoy the comfort

391
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,792
of the West, but the comfort of the spirit.

392
00:32:07,917 --> 00:32:13,333
So to change your attitude towards India

393
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:18,750
I don't mean Air India, by any chance.

394
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:21,625
This is a wrong idea that you come by Air India

395
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:24,208
because you are a Sahaja Yogi. Not at all.

396
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:27,291
Air India is nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

397
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:29,792
All our railways, all our everything,

398
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:31,834
they have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga,

399
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:34,250
so far.

400
00:32:36,709 --> 00:32:40,792
So you be patriotic and use your own airlines,

401
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:44,375
for heaven's sake.

402
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:48,125
But when you arrive here

403
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:51,250
you will see that the people are too innocent,

404
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:53,834
they can't understand Freud, you can't talk to them,

405
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:56,542
it's beyond them.

406
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:59,000
They are a higher type of people in this respect

407
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:01,291
now because they are not attacked,

408
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:04,083
while you are higher in a way that though you are attacked

409
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:07,583
you've come out of it.

410
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:11,125
You just turn your faces and you are on the other way.

411
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:16,333
That's something great.

412
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:19,083
So you would also have a confidence

413
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:22,250
there are many people who believe the same way as you believe,

414
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:27,792
in this big country where there's such a big population to support you.

415
00:33:27,917 --> 00:33:32,999
So you shouldn't feel lost.

416
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:38,792
Thus today, we have to start this puja,

417
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:42,709
on Mahakali Day.

418
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:47,125
And it's the Day of the Gauri we can say,

419
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,333
and Ganesh-Gauri's Day today,

420
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:56,959
though according to the schedule time it may not be.

421
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:58,875
But according to Me,

422
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:03,458
let us establish within ourself on a subtler level

423
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:09,333
the desire to be pure,

424
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:16,709
and to be cleansed out.

425
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:24,041
All the barriers and unclean things that are within us,

426
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:29,291
to desire to be great Sahaja Yogis,

427
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:36,000
desire to be responsible Sahaja Yogis

428
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:40,999
and desire to be surrendered to your Mother.

429
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,083
It's not difficult.

430
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:46,208
That is the easiest, the last one is the easiest,

431
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,291
because what you surrender,

432
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:51,375
I don't want anything from you,

433
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,542
except that you accept My Love.

434
00:34:56,667 --> 00:35:01,542
Surrendering just means you open your heart to accept My Love.

435
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:04,500
Give up this ego.

436
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:07,834
That's all and it will work out.

437
00:35:07,917 --> 00:35:12,125
I'm sure it's going to work out.

438
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,625
I am trying to push Myself into your hearts

439
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:19,667
and I'll definitely settle down there.

440
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:21,792
Mahakali has a special capacity to weep,

441
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,041
because She is left-sided.

442
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:26,542
When She's helpless and She cannot act,

443
01:00:26,667 --> 01:00:29,417
She weeps.

444
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,709
This is the only manifestation

445
01:00:31,834 --> 01:00:34,917
of Mahakali is that She desires,

446
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,417
and if She doesn't get Her desire enacted

447
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,917
then She just weeps,

448
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,125
that's the only thing She can do in helplessness, isn't it.

449
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:47,542
And sometimes when She's full of Love

450
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:50,667
as I've seen you today all of you coming down here

451
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:53,792
and all these people sitting down here.

452
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:56,875
When She cannot express Herself fully,

453
01:00:56,999 --> 01:00:59,041
with full heart,

454
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:09,375
also She feels that joy pouring as tears.

455
01:01:09,792 --> 01:01:11,667
May God bless you for today's puja,

456
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:15,375
I hope all of you will take it in such a way

457
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,000
that the subtlest of subtle

458
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:20,667
will be awakened within you, the sensitivity

459
01:01:20,792 --> 01:01:24,792
every way, and the Love,

460
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,083
which culminates into joy.

461
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:34,500
Love that flowers into the fragrance of joy

462
01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:39,792
will manifest in today's puja.

463
01:01:39,875 --> 01:01:42,709
May God bless you!
