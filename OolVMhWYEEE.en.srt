1
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:07,916
I hope you all are meditating every morning

2
00:00:08,117 --> 00:00:11,129
and talking Sahaja Yoga, meeting each 
other,

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:18,552
and this is more to get together that we 
should all discuss about Sahaja Yoga

4
00:00:18,753 --> 00:00:23,143
and find out what is the way we can do it 
better.

5
00:00:23,344 --> 00:00:29,518
Morning time I was thinking that we can 
allot it now to people

6
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,219
who would like to have a sort of a,

7
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,911
they call it a brain trust sort of a thing, 
a conference. You could have it.

8
00:00:37,112 --> 00:00:41,433
Of course, day after tomorrow we are all 
very free. I’m sorry,

9
00:00:41,634 --> 00:00:45,358
tomorrow is the Puja but day after tomorrow 
we are free in the morning time

10
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:50,231
and also ninth we are free. So you all 
could discuss and talk about things

11
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:56,236
and about what has happened in Satara 
district

12
00:00:56,437 --> 00:01:03,071
and all those things can be discussed among 
all of you and it can be established

13
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:08,756
that we understand Sahaja Yoga properly 
among ourselves.

14
00:01:08,957 --> 00:01:12,118
Many people do not know much about 
Sahaja Yoga, especially ladies.

15
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,639
I think they have to know quite a lot.

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,066
They just think they are in Sahaja Yoga; 
so they are floating

17
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:26,226
with the big flow of water. That’s not 
the way to know about Sahaja Yoga.

18
00:01:26,427 --> 00:01:29,895
Sahaja Yoga you must know precisely, must 
know what is,

19
00:01:30,096 --> 00:01:33,886
what is there, what is not there. So I 
would say that you could have a meeting

20
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:38,322
tomorrow sometime or, I’m sorry, day after 
tomorrow, sometime

21
00:01:38,523 --> 00:01:42,760
and could discuss about what is it and how 
it helps you,

22
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:47,848
what are the chakras are, any problems, 
anything. We have all kinds of people here.

23
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:50,895
So it should not be just entertainment 
but it should be

24
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:56,418
more sort of a morning session for learning 
things.

25
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,736
We have, now tomorrow is a very important 
day for Puja.

26
00:02:02,937 --> 00:02:06,545
All of you are expected to come here for 
the Puja

27
00:02:06,746 --> 00:02:15,828
and I’m sure that it will help you all 
to achieve something in that Puja.

28
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:18,983
As it is, you know that you have to go 
beyond your thoughts

29
00:02:19,184 --> 00:02:24,648
to absorb the vibrations. In your thoughts 
you get lost.

30
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:28,625
but once you are above the thoughts you 
get absorbed.

31
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:33,881
Also most of the marriages have been fixed. 
But some people unnecessarily

32
00:02:34,082 --> 00:02:41,905
giving way to their conditionings or maybe 
unnecessary thinking and all that

33
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:46,763
have tried to say “No” to certain people 
without any rhyme and reason,

34
00:02:46,964 --> 00:02:50,214
without any rhyme and reason. So it is 
nonsense.

35
00:02:50,415 --> 00:02:53,468
And such people, I would say, that should 
not apply anymore

36
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:57,041
because we have wasted so much time. Of 
course, if they had some rhyme and reason

37
00:02:57,242 --> 00:02:59,966
one can understand but without rhyme and 
reason if you say,

38
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:04,379
“We don’t want to marry,” that mean it’s 
quite insulting to the other party.

39
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,542
So if you have just said “No” because you 
feel it from your heart

40
00:03:09,743 --> 00:03:14,255
and from your brain and from your these 
things, this is not the way to behave.

41
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:18,780
And before saying “No” you should see Me 
and I would request you, all of you,

42
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:24,611
to meet your fiancés and see for yourself. 
Even now there is time.

43
00:03:24,812 --> 00:03:28,966
But if there is no reason for saying “No”,

44
00:03:29,182 --> 00:03:36,323
if there is no understanding about any 
point,

45
00:03:36,524 --> 00:03:41,413
it is better to decide it now than to decide 
it later. Now I’ve been telling you.

46
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:43,707
Of course, you have all the freedom 
to do it.

47
00:03:43,908 --> 00:03:48,605
But for no rhyme and reason you have no 
business to insult other people.

48
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:53,852
So I would request you that even if you 
have any objections, even now,

49
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:56,772
please write it down and give it to Yogi 
Mahajan.

50
00:03:56,973 --> 00:04:01,439
He has really worked very hard and you know 
we have no choices.

51
00:04:01,615 --> 00:04:05,183
You see, it is very funny how so many 
marriages have come up. I didn’t expect

52
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:09,560
even to fix ten marriages,  because the age 
and the heights

53
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:14,915
and everything was so much from one 
extreme to another extreme.

54
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:19,676
Moreover, those ladies who have got 
children and all that, it’s rather difficult

55
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:24,670
because we find people who are not very 
happy about the situation.

56
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:28,926
So they should not feel bad about it. 
We hope to see people

57
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:33,245
who would love to have children. All such 
people should come forward

58
00:04:33,446 --> 00:04:37,528
and they should marry women who have 
children and look after them.

59
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:42,733
But it’s difficult. In the same way for men 
also, if they have

60
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:46,721
some children or something, there is 
a problem.

61
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:50,538
But one should not feel bad about it. 
One should know that we are here

62
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:55,017
for our Sahaja Yoga, for our ascent, and we 
have to rise higher.

63
00:04:55,218 --> 00:04:59,236
As it is, you know, one or two marriages 
do fail in Sahaja Yoga

64
00:04:59,437 --> 00:05:03,905
and they create lot of problems for Me. But 
is this the way are you helping Me?

65
00:05:04,106 --> 00:05:08,205
I am helping you in so many ways. Which 
is the way are you going to help Me

66
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:13,999
is to understand that if we are married 
let us try to improve ourselves.

67
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,959
Of course, I would say that certain 
problems come only from one side,

68
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,161
not from both the sides, but whatever it is

69
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:25,977
we have to understand that these marriages 
are not just for marriages

70
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:31,392
but for something great, to create a new 
progeny of realized souls,

71
00:05:31,593 --> 00:05:37,280
to emancipate human beings. There are many 
saints who want to be born on this earth.

72
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:45,379
So it is important that if you are married 
in that understanding

73
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,630
then you will try to see to the good points 
of others and not the bad points,

74
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:52,928
and should not see superficial things.

75
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,775
If you are superficial it is better you 
don’t marry.

76
00:05:55,945 --> 00:06:00,996
But if you have any depth then you should 
understand you are marrying for something

77
00:06:01,197 --> 00:06:06,295
that is the concern of God’s work.

78
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:10,835
I hope by this you’ll be able to sort out 
many of your problems.

79
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:14,424
And then some people when they get married 
they just get headlong,

80
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:20,831
absolutely get lost into it. This is the 
another stupid conditioning of romanticism.

81
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:24,882
You have married because you are in Sahaja 
Yoga, you want to help the Sahaj Yoga,

82
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:29,189
you would like to have a companion who 
will be helpful in Sahaja Yoga.

83
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,369
But they get so headlong into it that I’ve 
seen many characters have been ruined

84
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:39,462
and people have been spoilt. But in a way 
it’s good because this is Last Judgment.

85
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,928
If by marriage, by temptations, by wrong 
doings, by conditionings,

86
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:47,382
if you have to go out, you have to go out.

87
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:53,804
I must tell you that also there’s very 
little place in the kingdom of God.

88
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:58,160
Unless and until you prove to be good 
Sahaja Yogis there is no place for you.

89
00:06:58,361 --> 00:07:02,911
For mediocres there is no place. You have 
to be serious, deep,

90
00:07:03,112 --> 00:07:08,278
seeking, dedicated Sahaja Yogis. Otherwise 
you have no place.

91
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,984
If you are playing around only with your 
children, with your wife,

92
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:15,938
then all right; go ahead with it. You have 
to get out of that

93
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:20,732
and you must know that my first and 
foremost attention should be on Sahaja Yoga.

94
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:22,868
That is so very important today.

95
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:28,385
Formerly, that’s why people used to give 
sanyasa to their disciples.

96
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:33,244
No marriage, no children, no household. 
Just be sanyasis.

97
00:07:33,445 --> 00:07:38,316
So complete dedication to the guru, 
complete dedication to the work.

98
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:42,658
But in Sahaja Yoga it is not so. Because 
also I have given you realization

99
00:07:42,859 --> 00:07:46,359
so you can feel it within yourselves what 
is important.

100
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,247
If something goes wrong with you then 
the vibrations also go down.

101
00:07:51,448 --> 00:07:57,420
Then also I have reports, say, from many 
countries that people are very miserly.

102
00:07:57,621 --> 00:08:02,053
They do not donate for daily work. 
Of course, you don’t have to pay Me

103
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:05,319
but you must know that without donation 
we cannot do anything,

104
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,097
you cannot even buy a little thing like 
that, and from where it has to come?

105
00:08:10,298 --> 00:08:14,036
Of course, as far as possible I’ve tried 
to compensate

106
00:08:14,237 --> 00:08:16,823
but also you must know my husband is now 
retiring.

107
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:21,908
So I hope the whole, with his retirement, 
the whole of Sahaja Yoga will not collapse.

108
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:26,334
If you are such miserly people, only 
worried about your money,

109
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:32,084
you want to extract each and every pie you 
spend, each and every

110
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:38,736
little money you have given, then I must say 
such people are no good for Sahaja Yoga.

111
00:08:38,937 --> 00:08:41,605
Such calculating people, nobody wants 
to shell out.

112
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:47,654
I mean, I’ve seen people, even if they give 
a little bottle of, say, Limca to someone,

113
00:08:47,855 --> 00:08:51,491
they want to charge it. If you are that 
miserly

114
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:56,345
there is no place for miserly people 
in the kingdom of God.

115
00:08:56,546 --> 00:09:01,307
You have to be generous, you have to look 
after people, you have to love each other,

116
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:06,716
you have to give presents to others and you 
have to be very much giving.

117
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:12,699
And in this I find that people will live in 
a good house, they’ll have a good family,

118
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,466
they will spend on their children, for 
their holidays, for their education,

119
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:20,783
for everything. But Sahaja Yoga, they 
become very miserly.

120
00:09:20,984 --> 00:09:24,292
So they are still so conditioned. So this 
is the Last Judgment.

121
00:09:24,493 --> 00:09:28,652
And you will be judged for everything 
that you do for Sahaja Yoga.

122
00:09:28,853 --> 00:09:32,515
Is one has to be very careful as to how 
you behave,

123
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:36,521
what is your attitude is and how you should 
change.

124
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:40,568
Your attention is also very important, 
if your attention is not there.

125
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:45,367
I’ve seen some people still sitting 
outside, talking to people, doing this.

126
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:48,416
In between the program they just get up 
and walk off.

127
00:09:48,617 --> 00:09:53,751
When there’s an, some, some artist is 
sitting you are not to go like that.

128
00:09:53,952 --> 00:09:58,569
It’s an insult to the artist. I, I just sit 
for hours together.

129
00:09:58,758 --> 00:10:02,967
And if I am supposed to be your Guru, you 
must learn at least that much from Me,

130
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:07,493
how to respect and where to respect. So 
I have seen many people just getting up,

131
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:11,726
walking, sleeping down, this, that. If you 
are that kind

132
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:14,045
then you should sit on the corner and just 
disappear.

133
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:17,860
Nobody should walk this way back and this 
way. It’s not proper.

134
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:23,012
There should be, if you go to your church, 
do you do like that?

135
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:30,067
Church which is based on falsehood? 
While this is the church of truth.

136
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:35,376
And the way people take things without 
any discipline looks very funny.

137
00:10:35,577 --> 00:10:38,823
People start walking up and down, sitting 
the way they like.

138
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:42,323
There’s no alertness about them. 
This is all…

139
00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:47,312
You must know when the music is on, 
I am trying to spread

140
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:51,490
vibrations through that music. But some 
people are dozing off.

141
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:56,493
Some people are walking about. That is not 
a Sahaja Yogi.

142
00:10:56,694 --> 00:11:00,136
You have to be just Spartan and smart.

143
00:11:00,337 --> 00:11:04,538
Like any, if you see a saint, you see, 
if you see old saints we had,

144
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:08,608
their disciples used to be sitting straight 
before him for hours together.

145
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:11,794
Of course, I don’t say that you should sit 
here hours together

146
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:16,410
but if I am sitting here you have no 
business to behave like this dog

147
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:20,552
that runs about without knowing what 
he’s doing.

148
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:26,304
We are all human beings and there’s no, 
no reasoning behind it.

149
00:11:26,505 --> 00:11:29,478
I don’t understand - And there’s no 
explanation needed.

150
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,659
It’s the behavior itself is wrong.

151
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,973
Now anybody who has children and all that 
should sit on the other side.

152
00:11:36,174 --> 00:11:39,100
I would not like you to carry your children 
here and there

153
00:11:39,277 --> 00:11:40,679
when there is some program is going on.

154
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,903
We have to show at least this much 
of discipline.

155
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:48,445
So yesterday’s program was a little bit 
a farce, perhaps maybe because

156
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:53,214
some people really behaved in a manner 
that they should not have behaved.

157
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:57,236
All such people who want to go like that 
should wait

158
00:11:57,437 --> 00:12:02,163
because in between the program we’ll give 
you some interval when you can go out.

159
00:12:02,364 --> 00:12:08,176
So let us have a society, a proper

160
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:18,417
beautifully built-up collectivity which 
shows that we are very saintly people.

161
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:22,383
We have poise, we have adjustments, we have 
understanding,

162
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:27,465
we are doing everything in such a manner 
that it is all dignified.

163
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:33,050
Now also some people have a bad habit 
of raising their Kundalini

164
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:35,461
in the program, suddenly giving bandhans,

165
00:12:35,662 --> 00:12:38,719
giving bandhans to themselves, bandhans 
to others. Is nonsense.

166
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,546
Just now I am there. You don’t have to. 
Just you desire.

167
00:12:42,747 --> 00:12:46,474
You just try to develop your desire power 
and just desire.

168
00:12:46,675 --> 00:12:50,164
You desire something; it will work out.

169
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,486
I mean, I work like that and you should 
learn this trick, how to desire.

170
00:12:55,687 --> 00:13:00,292
But desire should be pure desire. Then 
Kundalini works it out.

171
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:04,996
I was in Kolhapur and I was telling him, 
our Yogi Mahajan,

172
00:13:05,197 --> 00:13:10,332
I want to buy those chimtas for the, 
for the,

173
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:17,006
we should say all the countries, western 
countries and also the leaders.

174
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:20,266
And just imagine, they said that you can’t 
get them in Kolhapur.

175
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,322
And there they are; they have bought it 
and brought it.

176
00:13:23,523 --> 00:13:26,661
I mean, it’s a small incident but there are 
thousand one things I can tell you.

177
00:13:26,862 --> 00:13:31,487
I have to just desire. I desired that 
the Eastern bloc

178
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:34,662
must be cleared out, must be freed.

179
00:13:34,863 --> 00:13:41,927
So a program of Sahaja Yoga, of what you 
call the Yoga seminar, was held in Russia.

180
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:45,641
And I told My husband and I told everyone, 
“I’m going there

181
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:49,338
to break the Eastern bloc.” I just told.

182
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:51,851
When I went there they gave Me hardly 
any time.

183
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:54,574
But I broke it because the people who got 
realization,

184
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:59,361
they were from all these countries and they 
just went and triggered it.

185
00:13:59,562 --> 00:14:01,978
So I had told beforehand that this is 
My purpose

186
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:06,922
but I am so intensely desiring anything;

187
00:14:07,123 --> 00:14:10,348
in the same way if you have a pure desire 
about it,

188
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:19,283
not from any, any malicious or some sort 
of a selfish attitude.

189
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:24,469
Like my brother, my sister, my... this is 
Indians have this greater problem…

190
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,500
my wife, this, that. The wife will support 
the husband,

191
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,241
the husband will support the wife, 
nonsensical things will go on.

192
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:35,904
But by this they are really taking them 
down.

193
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,233
And you people also should not sort 
of have, because somebody

194
00:14:41,434 --> 00:14:45,580
is from, say, Switzerland, Swiss people 
will sit together.

195
00:14:45,781 --> 00:14:49,600
It’s a very wrong thing to do. I’ve told 
hundred times, nobody from the same….

196
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:52,936
Now I can see it’s even that the same thing 
happening here.

197
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:56,290
English must sit together. And English have 
the worst habit in this,

198
00:14:56,491 --> 00:15:00,618
that they must form a group. That’s their 
style, is to have their group.

199
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:05,565
So this is all is our conditioning. You see, 
why I am telling you

200
00:15:05,766 --> 00:15:10,133
that Sahaja Yoga is not going to benefit 
by you but you have to be benefited.

201
00:15:10,294 --> 00:15:13,664
So all these little, little conditionings 
that you have, you just judge yourself:

202
00:15:13,865 --> 00:15:17,674
“Are we doing like that?”; “Are we 
sitting?”; “Am I sitting next to a Swiss?”;

203
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,104
“Am I sitting next to an English?”. 
Run away.

204
00:15:22,511 --> 00:15:25,778
And then maybe that you think you can speak 
in the same language

205
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:28,517
or whatever it is. No. Let us sit away.

206
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:31,819
Then Delhi people will sit together, Bombay 
people will sit together

207
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:35,304
and you ask them, “Do you know this lady?” 
“No, who was she?”

208
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:37,927
“I mean, she was there.” “No, I never 
met her.”

209
00:15:38,128 --> 00:15:43,327
Because nobody wants to meet, nobody wants 
to talk, nobody wants to know.

210
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:47,237
And it is to be understood that this is 
a place of pilgrimage,

211
00:15:47,438 --> 00:15:51,105
there’s no fashion show on.  And one should 
not go about putting

212
00:15:51,306 --> 00:15:55,472
fashionable clothes and fashionable dresses 
and... Be humble about it.

213
00:15:55,673 --> 00:15:59,350
This is sometimes I’m really shocked 
the way people are dressing up.

214
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:02,097
It’s all right, for Pujas and all that, 
you can come.

215
00:16:02,298 --> 00:16:05,262
But the way people are dressed up sometimes 
it’s surprising.

216
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:08,973
You are coming here, for what? For your 
meditation.

217
00:16:09,174 --> 00:16:14,482
So be in a simpler dress, in a simpler 
attitude, in a simpler mind.

218
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:17,944
Today I have to tell you because I’ve been 
noticing few things

219
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:23,398
that you are missing the point. We are 
here for our ascent.

220
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:29,399
We have come all the way. Pilgrimage is 
there for your ascent and for nothing else.

221
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,839
We are here only for our ascent, for our 
joy,

222
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,637
for opening out ourselves. And that is 
what we have to remember.

223
00:16:37,838 --> 00:16:41,127
I’m your Mother. I have to tell you 
the truth because it is your benevolence

224
00:16:41,328 --> 00:16:45,002
that I want, that you all should become 
great foundations

225
00:16:45,203 --> 00:16:48,594
of Sahaja Yoga which is going to emancipate 
the whole world.

226
00:16:48,795 --> 00:16:51,589
Moreover, anybody who is sick need not come 
to Me.

227
00:16:51,781 --> 00:16:55,147
You can cure that person with it. You can 
yourself cure.

228
00:16:55,348 --> 00:17:02,233
This person who is a realized soul can cure 
himself or herself, or you can cure.

229
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:06,054
What is the need to bring everybody to Me? 
This is sick, that is sick,

230
00:17:06,255 --> 00:17:08,553
that is there. No need.

231
00:17:08,754 --> 00:17:11,368
Among yourselves only you can have these 
things done,

232
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:16,173
and I think the doctors and all these people 
can also have a little conference together,

233
00:17:16,374 --> 00:17:20,485
and anybody who has problems can come and 
tell them what’s the problem is.

234
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:23,607
And can be done. There’s also no need also 
to have doctors.

235
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:27,299
We have some people here, very simple 
people, who can help you a lot.

236
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,917
So among yourselves you should help and you 
should learn how to do it:

237
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:34,300
how to raise the Kundalini; how to tie it 
up; how to clear the chakras;

238
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:38,092
what’s wrong with you. Attention should be 
how I am going to achieve it.

239
00:17:38,293 --> 00:17:40,842
But the attention is not so high.

240
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:45,931
So I would request you today that you 
please pay full attention to the program

241
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:52,536
and enjoy and really try to develop that 
sensitivity of enjoyment.

242
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,490
This is just you are clinging onto something 
which is not going to take you

243
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:02,237
to the Ocean of Joy. All right? 
May God bless you.
