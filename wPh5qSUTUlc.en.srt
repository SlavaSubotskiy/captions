1
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,250
Today we are going to celebrate the birth of Christ.

2
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:25,999
At a very crucial time we are doing that,

3
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:32,166
because there are some anti-Christ

4
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:38,709
who have become in charge of the Christian religion

5
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:43,125
and are talking against the birth of Christ.

6
00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:48,834
They have no authority, they are not realized souls,

7
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:53,542
they have no idea of the Divine, nothing,

8
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:57,875
and they are saying that it is all falsehood

9
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:02,583
that She was not a virgin

10
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:07,959
and that Christ was not born that way.

11
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,917
Who told them? Did Gabriel come and told them?

12
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:19,333
What right they have got to talk these things?

13
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:23,166
So because they are anti-Christ now they have become

14
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:28,375
in charge of Christianity. Even Pope is like that.

15
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,999
So in Satya Yuga they will be all exposed,

16
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:35,792
have to be exposed. But some people who are here,

17
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:39,875
can write to this man to ask, "What is your authority to say?

18
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:43,417
Have you felt the allpervading power of God's love?

19
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:48,625
Have you any divinity in you to challenge Christ like that?"

20
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:54,709
There must be some incarnations of Paul perhaps.

21
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:58,083
They cannot understand Divine.

22
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:01,333
They don't know what Divine can do.

23
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:07,500
They have no idea at all, how miraculous it is.

24
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:13,750
You all have felt the blessings of the Divine.

25
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:18,041
You all know that it is a miracle.

26
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:23,417
Every time there's a miracle produced.

27
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:30,375
I will narrate one simple example.

28
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:34,375
In the Navaratri Puja we had some photographs.

29
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:39,250
And behind the photograph some sort of a scene came

30
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:43,417
which I was wondering what is this is supposed to be.

31
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,375
The scene was that

32
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:52,542
the Surya was

33
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:55,583
moving a curtain.

34
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:59,291
Eyes of the, there were eyes for the Surya, mouth, nose

35
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,542
and He was smiling and moving a curtain like that.

36
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:07,625
I said, "What is this?

37
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:11,917
What this is indicative in the Navaratri Puja?

38
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:16,083
But when I went to Moscow, I was surprised,

39
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:20,291
that they had painted the background just like this.

40
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,291
Exactly like this there was the background.

41
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,667
So Navaratri Puja, which took at least one and a half month before,

42
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:33,333
the Paramchaitanya painted there.

43
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,208
It's very remarkable,

44
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:41,917
how things work out miraculously.

45
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:48,875
And there are thousand and one miracles we can talk about.

46
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:59,166
When we were in the aeroplane, going to Moscow

47
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,709
they said the temperature is minus twenty.

48
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:05,999
We got down, they said it is minus fifteen.

49
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,834
Next morning they said it is coming down very fast,

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,375
is touching about minus twelve.

51
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,999
And after one day they said it is minus four.

52
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:21,166
But next day it was plus ten.

53
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:25,375
I mean as the time passes,

54
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:29,291
it has to be cooler and cooler.

55
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,625
This time My husband was going to Moscow.

56
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:34,834
He said, "It's very cold there now, minus twenty".

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,291
He sent word that... I said, "Don't worry, it will put it right".

58
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,999
He said when he arrived it was only minus two.

59
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:49,166
So all these things show that all the elements are helping us.

60
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:54,083
All the

61
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:59,959
other problems, minor, big, anything, get solved in no time.

62
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:03,792
You are sometimes amazed how things are done.

63
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:08,583
So then they question, "Then why Christ had to be crucified?

64
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:13,959
Why could You not save Him from crucifixion?"

65
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:20,083
He was crucified because that was to be done in His case,

66
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,792
that He had to pass through the Agya,

67
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:25,083
He had to establish Himself in Agya,

68
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,999
and the cross, He had to pass through that.

69
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:34,583
So the message of His Life is never the cross,

70
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,999
but the message is His Resurrection.

71
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:43,166
He resurrected - that was one of the things He did very great -

72
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:47,709
so that now you can be resurrected also.

73
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:50,333
In every incarnation, in the evolution,

74
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:55,792
every incarnation did something very, very unique.

75
00:05:55,999 --> 00:06:01,125
At the end of it, Christ, did the Resurrection part.

76
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,959
And He did it because He had to die,

77
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:09,542
otherwise how can you resurrect yourself?

78
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:15,291
So there are lots of things which look mythical, which are not.

79
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:21,417
Tomorrow they'll say that Christ never resurrected Himself.

80
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:25,917
And actually He died later on in Kashmir.

81
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,583
There's a proof of it.

82
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:32,583
But still the people don't want to believe,

83
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,750
and they just wanted to spread Christianity,

84
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:40,542
because they know that if you have majority of people

85
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,375
then they can rule.

86
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,750
The same trick now is tried by politicians.

87
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,875
But this kind of a majority is not going to bring any solace

88
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:54,208
or any benevolence for people.

89
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:58,999
Christ's Mother Herself has been challenged by this man

90
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,999
and said all kinds of nonsense about Her.

91
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,999
On the contrary Mohammad Sahib in Quran says

92
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,542
nobody should challenge the chastity

93
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,125
of the Holy Mother, of Christ's Mother.

94
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,458
He has respected,

95
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:19,667
while there is no respect shown to Mother Mary

96
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,083
in the Bible, no respect. She's called "a woman".

97
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,875
Because of Paul

98
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,083
who was a horrible anti-Christ  who came over,

99
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,709
who took over Christianity, tried to spread Christianity

100
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:35,917
and with that what he wanted, to put his own importance.

101
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,458
And he used Peter

102
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:42,709
who was the worst possible disciple of Christ,

103
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:48,917
whom Christ has told that, "Satan will take you over".

104
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:52,166
So now,

105
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:57,291
they are telling people that, "It's impossible, how can it be

106
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:03,500
that Christ was born to a virgin?"

107
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:11,458
We  Indians  worship Shri Ganesh.

108
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:14,834
Shri Ganesh is the same as Christ,

109
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,792
and we believe that the Mother Herself created the Child

110
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,792
without, as a Virgin, as a Gauri.

111
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,083
Not only believe but we, it's our faith.

112
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:34,375
While the faith in the West  is all rationality.

113
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,709
They go on thinking like that

114
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:41,208
and they go on producing yarn of falsehood.

115
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:42,875
What was the need for newspapers

116
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:47,667
to publish this nonsense of this Dharam fellow?

117
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,792
And then he was honored,

118
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:55,792
honored by the archbishop of Canterbury, who is another anti-Christ.

119
00:08:55,999 --> 00:09:01,750
He honored him and just after that,

120
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,834
that church where he was honored,

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,709
was completely burned by Vishnumaya.

122
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,333
She was looming round it for one hour

123
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:14,375
and then She burn it completely.

124
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,166
Only the lower portion was left

125
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:21,166
because there were also very beautiful paintings, maybe.

126
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,750
Now the stupid fools are saying

127
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:29,792
that,  "it is God's grace on us that they saved us,

128
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:34,291
from this Vishnumaya, the lower portion of it".

129
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:38,291
But way did it burn?

130
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,709
So you have to understand that rationality can never

131
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:46,000
make you understand Divinity, can never.

132
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,959
It is so limited, so conditioned, full of ego.

133
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,625
How can the rationality

134
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:56,750
tell you what is the truth about Christ's life.

135
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:02,625
But we have proof also, scientifically.

136
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:05,667
So you must be knowing that

137
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,792
I told them that  if you see from right to the left

138
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:11,750
you see a swastika.

139
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,500
Because of carbon, the way it is made.

140
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:19,333
If you see the carbon atom, you see a swastika from left to right.

141
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:21,917
We have made a big model out of it.

142
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:25,834
And then you put

143
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:30,125
it in other way, means you see it from left to the right,

144
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,792
then you see Omkara, no doubt.

145
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:39,667
And then you see from down below, you see Alpha and Omega.

146
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:45,417
Christ has said it that ,"I am the Alpha and the Omega".

147
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:49,333
At that time I did know if these symbols were there or not.

148
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:54,166
Whatever it is, He did say, "I am the Alpha and the Omega".

149
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,417
Also it has another meaning

150
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,583
that "I am the beginning, I am the end".

151
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,125
But Alpha and Omega

152
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:06,375
the way He said it, you can see it clearly, symbolically,

153
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,208
clearly, if you see it from down upward.

154
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:13,709
So, the Omkara on one side, swastika on another side

155
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:17,542
join together when they ascend and incarnate,

156
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,709
they become Alpha and Omega.

157
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:24,875
But all these doesn't going to the heads of these anti-Christs.

158
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,333
They are all anti-Christ.

159
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:31,291
And they can not understand what Divinity can do.

160
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,375
You got your Realization, your second birth

161
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:39,000
just sitting here. How did you manage?

162
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,792
How did you get your second birth?

163
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:44,792
And the way these people talk

164
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:48,583
is definitely for their doom,

165
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,333
for their complete destruction.

166
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:58,375
It's too much of daring, as you know that

167
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:04,583
Shri Ganesha is a very powerful

168
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,041
deity.

169
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,375
Same Christ.

170
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,875
He has said, "If you say anything against the Holy Ghost,

171
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,291
I will not tolerate".

172
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,959
And also, against Christ I will not tolerate,

173
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,834
a word even.

174
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,041
Only on that point I'll have to see to it,

175
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,125
that all these horrible people, should be destroyed completely.

176
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:37,417
On this occasion of His birthday we have to realize

177
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:43,041
that Christ was born

178
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:49,041
from same things as Shri Ganesh.

179
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:54,291
So He was wisdom, source of wisdom.

180
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:59,834
He said few things because they didn't allow him to live long,

181
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,458
at the most three of,

182
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:04,250
three and a half years He could lecture to people.

183
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:10,458
But whatever He said is so truthful, so correct  and so wise.

184
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:13,750
Of course they might have tried to dabble with that

185
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,166
but still lots of truths are left in the Bible, no doubt about it.

186
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:22,875
And His lifetime He spent

187
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,625
in just telling them what is the truth is.

188
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:29,625
He is the first one

189
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:34,333
who talked so clearly about God.

190
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,875
On His level we have three other people,

191
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:41,083
in the area of tapa which is here.

192
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:46,458
One is Buddha, another is Mahavira.

193
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:51,542
Now, both Buddha and Mahavira were born at a time when they saw

194
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:56,375
that ritualism is taking place the reality.

195
00:13:56,583 --> 00:14:00,000
So they said, "We'll not talk of God, Anishwarwad.

196
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,333
We'll not talk of God". First we'll only talk about the Chaitanya.

197
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:06,999
That everybody did.

198
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:11,542
Even the Guru of Janaka,

199
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,250
who was Ashtavakra, only talked about the vibrations.

200
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,208
Even Nanaka did that.

201
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:21,792
When Namadeva went down to Punjab,

202
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:25,750
He told him, "Don't talk about God, don't talk about Hari,

203
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:30,750
better talk about Paramachaitanya, first of all",

204
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,000
because one can reach only Paramachaitanya to begin with

205
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,917
and then they will say, "Where is God after all"?

206
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,959
But it's only Christ who talked

207
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:47,792
about God at that time when it was more,

208
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:52,917
that they didn't want to talk about God Almighty.

209
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:57,999
He was a daring person, was never afraid of anything, no doubt.

210
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:03,083
But His childhood has not been described anywhere,

211
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,709
which is very sad.

212
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:09,125
We have got the beautiful description of Shri Krishna's childhood

213
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,417
and also Shri Rama's childhood.

214
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:16,917
Except that once He was in argument with some Pharisees,

215
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,959
and how clever He was,

216
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:26,208
and they were all flabbergasted at His discretion.

217
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:31,375
That's all, nothing more. But later on,

218
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,583
though that had shown no regard for Mary,

219
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:36,208
the people couldn't help it. They said,

220
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:38,875
"There has to be some Devi, some Goddess.

221
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:42,250
How can Christ take birth from Her?"

222
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,291
So they named Her Madonna,

223
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,000
and that's how this Mother Mary was called as Madonna,

224
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,709
means maiden, means virgin.

225
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:56,792
And this Madonna was then started occupying

226
00:15:56,999 --> 00:16:00,959
the place of our churches everywhere,

227
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:07,083
and people regarded Her as a, as a Goddess.

228
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,917
It is the people who said, not in the Bible, not in the Christianity

229
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,667
but the people start calling Her, Madonna,

230
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,500
and from that Madonna level

231
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:21,709
that people starting seeing the Mother

232
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:23,792
and the motherhood.

233
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:27,208
She was Mahalakshmi, we know that very well

234
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,959
and we worship Her as Mahalakshmi.

235
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:34,667
She was Radha. Radha also had a Son

236
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:39,041
and He was like an egg

237
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,792
and a half of the egg was Christ

238
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:47,000
and half of the egg was Shri Ganesh.

239
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:52,333
But when this Child was born He started crying for His Father.

240
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:56,125
Father was Shri Krishna.

241
00:16:56,917 --> 00:17:00,083
It's in the... if you read Devi Mahatmyam it is there.

242
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,917
So always He puts His hands like this, towards His Father.

243
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,999
So one is, as you know, is Shri Krishna's finger,

244
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,875
another is Vishnu's.

245
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,667
And She was Radha.

246
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:19,542
Ra means energy, dha means the one who has sustained the energy.

247
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:25,750
And She is the One, who called Him Jesus.

248
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:30,333
Actually in the Hebrew it is Yesu

249
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:33,709
and also in the - thank God I read Bible in Marathi,

250
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:36,208
which was directly translated from Hebrew -

251
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:38,375
Yesu is the name.

252
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:42,792
Yesu is the name of the Mother of Christ,

253
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:45,834
Mother of Shri Krishna.

254
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,917
Yesu, means as we call Her

255
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,291
Jesu or Yesu from Jesoda or Yeshoda.

256
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:57,999
From that She called Him, and Christ word comes from Krishna.

257
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:02,333
So She call Him Christ

258
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,999
and Yesu or Jesus.

259
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:10,542
We too call Yeshoda sometimes Jesu or Yesu.

260
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,083
So She called Him by that name

261
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:19,166
and that is how She put the link for us to understand

262
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:23,709
how close He was to Shri Krishna.

263
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:30,208
Shri Krisha came only, incarnated only in India

264
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:33,625
because He would have been

265
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:37,291
too lenient person to be incarnated in America.

266
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:43,041
As it is they have no limitations, they have no maryadas,

267
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,542
they have no idea of dharma, they are very great adharmis.

268
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,458
So only a person like Christ

269
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:57,333
who is absolutely pure, wise,

270
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:00,999
and does not believe

271
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:05,542
in the leela part of Shri Krishna.

272
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:09,041
Is Shri Krishna said that is this all leela

273
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:14,583
to overcome the strictness of Shri Rama.

274
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:17,792
But Christ did not said so

275
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:23,500
and despite that, all over wherever Christianity is practiced,

276
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:26,500
they think it's all leela, adharma is leela,

277
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:29,917
whatever wrong we do is leela, after all, all innocent.

278
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,792
It's surprising. Their logic is so funny

279
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:35,625
I've never been able to understand their logic.

280
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:39,417
All self-destructive, nonsensical logic they have.

281
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:43,458
So, for us Indians, we should know that we have

282
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:47,458
full idea of dharma. We know what is wrong and what is good.

283
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:51,333
But more credit I would give to Christians,

284
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:57,875
who are from such countries where they have no idea of Kundalini,

285
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,583
have come up so much

286
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:04,959
and have become such great Sahaja Yogis.

287
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,250
Now is the blessing of God,

288
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:11,250
because they were genuine, they were sincere.

289
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,875
It is Christ who brought them to Sahaja Yoga.

290
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,834
Without Him it would not have been possible.

291
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,999
Here Shri Ganesha is just a symbol, sort of a thing.

292
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,542
He resides in the stones.

293
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:33,250
But there He incarnated and He told people what is dharma is,

294
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:37,834
which they are supposed to follow, but they never follow.

295
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:43,208
They never follow. They are extremely money oriented people.

296
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Is very surprising what things they have done in the name of God.

297
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,041
The most symbolic thing is His birth.

298
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:58,250
He was born in a manger,

299
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,125
just imagine, in a manger,

300
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:05,834
full of straws assembled together

301
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,166
this child was born,

302
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:12,875
where there were other animals used to be.

303
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:16,999
See the way

304
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,959
this great incarnation took birth.

305
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:26,041
He was not king, he was not a big rich man,

306
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,750
He was born as a very poor person

307
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:36,917
and in a place which is something very much

308
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:40,750
below the human standard.

309
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:44,999
This message is, that you don't need palaces,

310
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,875
you don't need huge places to be born,

311
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:52,291
you can be born anywhere, if you are a pure Spirit,

312
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,917
if you are Christ.

313
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:57,875
Such a great personality was born like that.

314
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,792
Now the other way round people go.

315
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:05,166
They are extremely money oriented, very materialistic.

316
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,333
I mean to such a limit

317
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:11,125
that you can't understand what  are they up to.

318
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,792
They are destroying themselves with whatever money they have made,

319
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:17,291
they have no sense, they have no proportion.

320
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,999
This is what is happening in the West,

321
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:23,000
and we are trying to follow them also.

322
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,250
We are trying to follow their destructive methods

323
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,542
and we are trying to think that we are very advanced.

324
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,166
Advanced towards doom, that's what they are.

325
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:37,333
We have to be very careful with our children,

326
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:40,999
with our relations, that we don't go to their dirty things

327
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:44,417
and take to their dirty ways,

328
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:50,208
which they have created in the name of God, in the name of God.

329
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:57,500
Now this group that we have here, is quite a large group,

330
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,709
and we are Sahaja Yogis

331
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:02,750
we are all blessed people,

332
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:05,458
we know what is Divinity is

333
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:08,250
and we know what Christ is.

334
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:14,375
Whether you are born Hindu or anything, makes no difference,

335
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:16,625
because Christ is universal.

336
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:18,250
He's the support of universe,

337
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:21,083
that's what is written in Devi Mahatmyam

338
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:24,875
ki ("that" in Hindi) He will be the support of the universe.

339
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:27,667
So one has to understand

340
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:32,625
that we should never ridicule anybody, if he is following Christ

341
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:37,500
and that we should worship Him with the same affection,

342
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:41,750
with the same devotion, with the same surrendering,

343
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:45,208
as we worship Shri Ganesh.

344
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:47,792
Because I don't think Christians

345
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:52,375
have any faith about Christ, no faith.

346
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,375
They are, "We believe in Christ, we believe in Christ.

347
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:59,667
You cure my father, do this, do that".

348
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:04,166
But as Sahaja Yogis' faith works.

349
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:07,792
Your faith is an enlightened faith and it works.

350
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:11,625
But you must have faith in yourself, in Sahaja Yoga,

351
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:14,125
and in the life you are leading.

352
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,250
Unless and until this happens to you

353
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,041
you shouldn't call yourself a Sahaja Yogi.

354
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,750
I see, still there are people on the periphery.

355
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:25,208
Then you don't know what to do about it,

356
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:28,959
you don't understand in a mental way,

357
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:34,041
but you just float into the immense love of God

358
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,792
and you want to give this love to others.

359
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:42,583
But still, materialism becomes subtler with some people.

360
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:44,792
They are still materialistic.

361
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:46,750
They are materialistic in the sense,

362
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:51,999
they still think of earning in a bad way some money or something.

363
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,458
Maybe, but that is not so common.

364
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,583
But I feel they are now

365
00:24:56,792 --> 00:25:00,000
suddenly started getting attached to their children.

366
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,834
This attachment is very wrong.

367
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,959
You see, children belong to Sahaja Yoga. You have no right on them.

368
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:14,542
Because they straight away wanted children to come back home

369
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,792
and not to come to Ganapatipule.

370
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:22,583
Means they are children of Sahaja Yoga.

371
00:25:22,792 --> 00:25:26,166
They have to come to Ganapatipule, no question.

372
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:29,625
But they wanted to take over their children directly.

373
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:32,542
Everything is there, directly done.

374
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,999
Is not, children are not here for that.

375
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:38,166
They are here to grow in Sahaja Yoga. If you don't want

376
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,917
your children to grow in Sahaja Yoga, better take them away.

377
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,792
But this is not the way to behave arbitrarily,

378
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:46,083
to take the children away from the school,

379
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:48,208
when everybody is coming to Ganapatipule.

380
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:50,625
And I'm sure children don't like it.

381
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:53,041
They would love to be here.

382
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,000
So the materialism in the sense of children,

383
00:25:56,208 --> 00:26:01,667
also saving money part is working out.

384
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,959
And this is, something shows the materialism,

385
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:10,375
which Christ never, never clung to.

386
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:13,750
He never wanted it.

387
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:18,667
This one we have to understand.

388
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:22,083
To pay respect to Christ the best thing

389
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,959
is to get out of this materialistic ideas.

390
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,000
All right, you have materialistic ideas

391
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:32,041
as far as I don't say that you don't go to Himalayas,

392
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:36,999
I don't say that you go to, you,

393
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:38,834
you practice asceticism,

394
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,125
I don't say take away, give up your children, like Buddha did.

395
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:43,917
Nothing of the kind.

396
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:48,625
But your detachment should work.

397
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:55,041
There's a, say a bird is there, flying over the ocean of water.

398
00:26:55,250 --> 00:27:00,125
It will never drink the water of the ocean, because it is saltish.

399
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:03,500
You are there, you are in this world,

400
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,583
but you must develop your detachment.

401
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,999
In the beginning it was all right, "my father is sick",

402
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:10,999
"my mother is sick", "my child is like this",

403
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:14,333
all this nonsense was all right. But not now.

404
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:17,500
Now the speed of Sahaja Yoga is very fast

405
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:21,959
and those will be left behind, will be left behind. So be careful.

406
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:27,625
Do not get entangled into these materialistic ideas.

407
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:33,625
And for Indians especially, they don't like to stay in ashrams.

408
00:27:33,834 --> 00:27:37,208
Indians want to have their homes, so they can dominate their wives,

409
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:41,999
have their special type of food, this, that, and

410
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:48,125
work out all their ugly tastes all the time.

411
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,250
I would say that's must be the reason people must have said

412
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:57,458
that Indians must fast, to get rid of their tongues, desires.

413
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:04,291
They will, even when fast, think about food, what's the use?

414
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,625
Christ fasted for forty days

415
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:10,375
and Satan asked Him that, "You should give up Your fast

416
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:15,041
and do this and do that". He never listened.

417
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:21,583
So materialism works out in two types.

418
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:26,208
First of all in the West now is the materialism is "my house",

419
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:31,083
"my wife", "my children", this that.

420
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:35,542
And in the East is, "what sort of a food I eat",

421
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,625
"what sort of a house I should have",

422
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:44,083
"what sort of a family I should have?"

423
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:48,500
All these things are still lingering.

424
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:52,417
As your ascent has become subtler

425
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:55,583
they are also becoming subtler and subtler.

426
00:28:55,792 --> 00:28:57,792
And they are holding you back.

427
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:01,792
There are all kinds of things. For example I know of Sahaja Yogis,

428
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:06,875
who want to make business out of Sahaja Yoga, there are.

429
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:08,875
Like these people here, outside,

430
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:11,834
they want to sell their things to us

431
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,041
and to make money out of this.

432
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,458
There was a demand that there were no saris.

433
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:21,542
I said, "All right, take saris. But you are not to buy from outside".

434
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,709
Also they will go to some shop here,

435
00:29:23,917 --> 00:29:26,917
and have something to drink, or something to eat,

436
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:30,125
and then suffer from something.

437
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:35,125
What is the need? Can you not control your thirst?

438
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:40,125
Can you not control your appetite?

439
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,166
It's very easy. Did He not do it? Christ did it.

440
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:47,417
You have come here to worship Him.

441
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:50,583
Try to control these things are very important,

442
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:53,583
and once it happens,

443
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,834
it doesn't matter if you get food, doesn't matter,

444
00:29:56,999 --> 00:30:00,125
if you don't get some good place to live in.

445
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:03,834
You can live anywhere, anywhere.

446
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,417
As far as I am concerned, you know that very well.

447
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:12,542
I have no demands. I have, I mean My body doesn't demand anything.

448
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,917
Is such a good body. Never demands.

449
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:22,709
And that's why I have seen, that I never feel tired.

450
00:30:22,917 --> 00:30:28,375
I am here with you and in the same way I am anywhere.

451
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:31,458
If you make Me sleep here I can sleep the whole night.

452
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:34,999
My body never says anything.

453
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,917
On the contrary I've seen the experience is very different.

454
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,166
Once I travelled by train,

455
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:44,709
I think from Pune to Hyderabad or something,

456
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:46,999
and the train - I was on the wheel -

457
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:50,250
and the thing was jumping, jumping, jumping all the time.

458
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:52,999
I slept off and what I was feeling,

459
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:56,583
that I am going from one star to another star,

460
00:30:56,792 --> 00:30:58,375
moving from the whole universe.

461
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:01,500
I never felt the jump, I felt the other way round,

462
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,208
that the whole thing is going, the body is moving

463
00:31:04,417 --> 00:31:06,667
from this star to that star, from there to there.

464
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:12,166
I mean somebody would be absolutely angry for a thing like that.

465
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:15,208
On the contrary, I was enjoying, nice jumping from here to there

466
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:17,500
to go into this star and to that star and

467
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:21,917
moving from one place to another. It was very interesting.

468
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,583
So the reaction is very different.

469
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:27,959
Reaction is different. If there is a crisis,

470
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:31,625
suddenly I become thoughtless, completely thoughtless.

471
00:31:31,834 --> 00:31:37,625
And a kind of a tremendous peace starts pouring out of it.

472
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:40,625
If there is a crisis.

473
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:44,041
And this is what you all can achieve very simply,

474
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,834
if you get detached.

475
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:49,917
See, I have children, I have grandchildren.

476
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,625
I never telephone to them.

477
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:54,999
I'm not bothered. If they telephone, well and good.

478
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:57,583
I never telephone to my husband also.

479
00:31:57,792 --> 00:32:02,041
I always think that it's a waste of time.

480
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,208
of telephoning here and telephoning...

481
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:06,333
I've got all telephones within Myself.

482
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:10,250
I know everybody is all right so why to telephone to them.

483
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:14,583
But unless and until you develop that kind of status it won't [work].

484
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:17,709
Then another thing I've noticed about Sahaja Yogis

485
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:19,709
that they become suddenly very violent

486
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:23,291
and there are reports that some people were hit.

487
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,709
That's not being a Sahaja Yogi at all.

488
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:30,875
I've never raise My hand against even My own children.

489
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:34,667
It's not allowed. Nobody has to raise the hand

490
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:37,333
or touch somebody's body to be violent.

491
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:41,500
It's absolutely, such a person will fall very deep down,

492
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,834
into Sahaja Yoga, without doing anything.

493
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,999
You are not to get angry, you are not to shout.

494
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:51,542
Nothing of the kind is going to help you.

495
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:55,291
You have to be absolutely peaceful, calm, compassionate.

496
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,999
If there is a wrong type of a man, just tell Me, I'll manage.

497
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:04,041
You don't have to handle such situations and misbehave,

498
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:08,792
because you are still attached,

499
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:11,583
and that attachment will pull you down.

500
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:14,792
So be careful, not to be angry.

501
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:16,917
Look at Christ!

502
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:19,750
He was angry with the people who were selling things

503
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:23,083
near the church - you know, that time it was not the church,

504
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:25,166
but they called it a tabernacle.

505
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:29,166
And He was very angry, that in the temple of God,

506
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,750
these people are selling things outside,

507
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:35,583
and He took a big hunter and hit them hard. But He was Christ.

508
00:33:35,792 --> 00:33:38,917
But at the same time, when He was crucified,

509
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,583
He said, "Oh God, My Father, please forgive them,

510
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:46,792
because they don't know what they are doing".

511
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:51,333
This is what is, one has to understand from Him.

512
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:55,166
His character, how forgiving, how loving He was.

513
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:57,542
How He looked after the people,

514
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,333
how He helped people for their emancipation.

515
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:05,000
In those days of complete chaos

516
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:08,542
and anarchy,

517
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:14,709
He stood up and talked about truth and about

518
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:20,667
such things like Spirit, like ascent.

519
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:22,959
I mean, they were all blind people.

520
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:25,959
They didn't know what it was He was talking about.

521
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:28,667
And He talked about it.

522
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:33,375
There is lot of myths that exist in the Bible,

523
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:38,917
and one of them is that when the Resurrection time will come

524
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:42,041
your bodies will come out of your graves.

525
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:47,083
It is not only with Christianity, but also with the Muslims

526
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:50,458
and also for the Jews.

527
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:56,000
Now think of it, after so many years, what remains in the,

528
00:34:56,208 --> 00:35:00,625
in the graves? Few bones.

529
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:02,917
And these few bones if they come out,

530
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:05,792
how can you give them Realization?

531
00:35:05,999 --> 00:35:08,458
Think of it. It's a big myth.

532
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:11,083
One should understand, logically is not proper.

533
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:13,792
So what is the thing is, I must say,

534
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:15,959
in Nal-Damyanti Akhiyan

535
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:19,000
in Indian philosophy they have given a clear-cut idea,

536
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:21,458
that when this Kali Yuga will come,

537
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:24,999
so many great seekers who are seeking God

538
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:31,166
in the hills and dales, mountains,

539
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:33,291
will be born again

540
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,458
and they will be given their Self Realization.

541
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,542
Their Kundalini will be awaken.

542
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,333
This is what is said and that seems to be

543
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:44,500
a very logical thing, because we are doing that.

544
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,792
And today's population growth is also because

545
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:48,750
so many have taken birth.

546
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:51,792
I don't know how many will get their Self Realization,

547
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:53,792
how many they are going to get it.

548
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:55,500
But those who have got it

549
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:59,542
have to establish themselves, establish themselves.

550
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:03,500
And there also I find there's some sort of a very

551
00:36:03,709 --> 00:36:07,959
subtle type of attachment with people.

552
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:12,041
So for the time being I feel

553
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:16,625
that you should all surrender yourself to the qualities of Christ,

554
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:18,709
which are immense qualities.

555
00:36:18,917 --> 00:36:21,250
And the greatest is that He cannot tolerate

556
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:23,750
anything against the Holy Ghost.

557
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:27,375
That is the only time He is going to come out and work it.

558
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:31,500
I tell you, if you are a Sahaja Yogi and if you misbehave,

559
00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:33,875
He allows you to some extent.

560
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:36,375
But there's one fellow in America

561
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:40,417
wanted to talk to Me on the telephone and discuss about Sahaja Yoga,

562
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:43,125
but he found Me a bit too much for him, perhaps,

563
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:46,166
and he started talking to Sahaja Yogis and he wouldn't,

564
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:48,000
he didn't talk to Me.

565
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:51,041
And everybody was very angry. I said, "Forget it".

566
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,959
The other day I received a message

567
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:55,999
that he was doing a program same type

568
00:36:56,166 --> 00:37:01,250
and he collapsed, because he got paralysis.

569
00:37:01,834 --> 00:37:05,417
So he is not a Sahaja Yogi. I am not responsible.

570
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:09,625
But if somebody calls Me a Mother then

571
00:37:09,834 --> 00:37:11,834
the Paramchaitanya respects that way.

572
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:14,417
And you have no business to hit anybody

573
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:17,542
or to talk to anyone rudely, in any manner,

574
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,250
those who are Sahaja Yogis.

575
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:21,625
Of course if you want to tell somebody off

576
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:24,625
there are ways how this should be done, like a Sahaja Yoga way

577
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:27,250
and not like the violent things.

578
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:30,959
It's very, very wrong and I'm very upset to hear that people

579
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:35,458
suddenly become violent, even now in Sahaja Yoga.

580
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:38,999
This comes from liver, I know.

581
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:42,583
You can go in for your liver treatment, improve yourself,

582
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:48,208
but don't think that you can get away with it. You cannot.

583
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:51,667
Is better such people fast for two days

584
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:54,125
and punish themselves.

585
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:56,375
Temper is the worst thing

586
00:37:56,583 --> 00:38:00,792
and Shri Krishna has told that temper is the worst

587
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:03,000
from where everything starts.

588
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:07,583
So we must control our temper and understand

589
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:13,625
that Christ was the embodiment of forgiveness, embodiment.

590
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,999
We are worshiping Him today.

591
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:19,166
How He forgave people?

592
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:22,458
Those who crucified were not the Jews actually.

593
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:26,458
They were the Romans. The Roman authorities crucified Him.

594
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:30,166
But Paul decided that we should try to condemn the Jews,

595
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:34,709
"So the Jews have done it". Jews have not done it.

596
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:38,583
And they condemned Jews forever.

597
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:44,667
With this kind of an attitude people hated Jews,

598
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:47,834
and they troubled them and they were tortured.

599
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,917
Then Jews also had a reaction. They are equally the same.

600
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:56,000
So is not the Jews, because is never done

601
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:59,709
that you ask a multitude, a magistrate asks the multitude,

602
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:04,208
whether you should crucify a thief or this man.

603
00:39:04,417 --> 00:39:07,041
It's never done. They have to take their own decisions.

604
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,291
This is never done.

605
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:13,250
So this is just to bring a curse on the Jews.

606
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:16,125
This Paul has done the greatest harm.

607
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:19,709
But now, thank God, may we have many Jews and we have

608
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:24,375
also a center in Israel, is working out all over.

609
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:28,917
We have lots of people from Iran who have come to America,

610
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:33,834
who are also Jews and who are also Muslims,

611
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,750
they all have taken to Sahaja Yoga.

612
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:39,917
So it is something that's happening

613
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:46,041
and also the Sufi people from Turkey I hear, are joining us

614
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:51,583
and also Sufi people from India, we'll be able to get them.

615
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:56,792
So thus it will work out and it will work out for everybody's good.

616
00:39:56,999 --> 00:40:01,500
But first of all we should understand how Christ was

617
00:40:01,709 --> 00:40:05,875
and how His life was and how He loved the world.

618
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:10,041
He came on this earth to be crucified.

619
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:15,041
He knew He was to be crucified and He did it.

620
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:21,542
The way they have given His picture is not correct.

621
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:25,999
He was a very healthy, hefty, tall person.

622
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:30,041
He had to carry that cross. Those people who paint Him,

623
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:33,583
like a Tb patient, should know that they

624
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:37,834
if they have to carry the cross, can they do it?

625
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:41,208
So all sorts of things they have done

626
00:40:41,417 --> 00:40:45,083
to harm His personality, to assassinate His character.

627
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:47,999
But you being Sahaja Yogis should know about Him,

628
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:51,625
and must have full respect, full faith in Him.

629
00:40:51,834 --> 00:40:53,750
And He is your eldest brother.

630
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:58,125
As Shri Ganesha is, He incarnates as your elder brother.

631
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:02,500
He's there to look after you in every trouble, in every kind

632
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:05,083
of a turmoil.

633
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:10,625
He is going to help us in every way, all the time,

634
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:16,166
and only way is to surrender, to forgive.

635
00:41:16,417 --> 00:41:21,333
That is the quality of Christ we have to imbibe.

636
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:24,542
May God bless you all!
