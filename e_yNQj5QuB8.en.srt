1
00:00:02,484 --> 00:00:08,158
It's a great day today for the whole world

2
00:00:08,505 --> 00:00:18,616
that we are celebrating this Diwali Puja in America.

3
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,140
It's very important.

4
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:37,187
Here where people have been able to earn money,
to have lots of money sometimes,

5
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:45,220
and are also people who are ruined completely because of money.

6
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:55,410
When we talk of Diwali we should understand

7
00:00:55,468 --> 00:01:01,299
that why on a Diwali day we have all these lights.

8
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:15,037
What is the combination of lights and the
Lakshmi who was born in the water,

9
00:01:15,354 --> 00:01:17,805
who stands in the water?

10
00:01:18,698 --> 00:01:21,674
Why this combination is there?

11
00:01:22,386 --> 00:01:33,898
She was standing in the water, as we know,
a symbol of prosperity;

12
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:43,622
 that is built in the human awareness that it can, he can prosper.

13
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,227
Animals don't prosper.

14
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:55,573
They all have their maryadas, trees have their
maryadas, only the human being can prosper.

15
00:01:55,598 --> 00:02:01,225
But if they have no sense of their own maryadas

16
00:02:01,298 --> 00:02:07,754
then there's very ruinous, are ruinous for the whole world.

17
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:21,035
So the lights are there that all the people
who have Lakshmi's blessings must enlighten themselves,

18
00:02:21,713 --> 00:02:27,210
 must have lights, and they should enlighten others also.

19
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:36,483
But actually, as soon as they get the Lakshmi
- so-called - they become absolutely blind,

20
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:46,258
and they forget what is behind
the blessings of the Lakshmi.

21
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:54,982
First of all, as we see, how this symbol of Lakshmi represents -
I have told you before also -

22
00:02:55,329 --> 00:03:06,520
 that a person who has Lakshmi should
be very generous.

23
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:14,327
One hand she's giving to others.

24
00:03:14,686 --> 00:03:24,674
A person who is miserly with Lakshmi is absolutely
against the principle of Lakshmi.

25
00:03:25,097 --> 00:03:30,424
And such a miserly person never can enjoy the blessings;

26
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:37,696
 and gradually he starts becoming poorer and poorer.

27
00:03:37,902 --> 00:03:43,854
When you start giving with the left hand,
that means

28
00:03:44,012 --> 00:03:49,452
you have opened the door for your Lakshmi to come in.

29
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:58,707
Then comes the grace of Lakshmi on you.

30
00:03:58,994 --> 00:04:12,318
And this grace of Lakshmi also has another
aspect, that you must give protection.

31
00:04:13,595 --> 00:04:25,341
Those who are people with money should protect
like this - protect who?

32
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:36,645
Protect the people who are in trouble, people
who are having lots of cruelty on them,

33
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,241
orphan children who need your help.

34
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:50,808
All these should be looked into, and the protection
to the people who are dependent on you.

35
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,100
So this has to be done with the right hand.

36
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,657
That's the symbol of Lakshmi.

37
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:09,360
And there are two hands up there, which you
have seen, with the pink color lotus.

38
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:17,240
Pink color lotus suggests that you must have
love in your heart.

39
00:05:17,424 --> 00:05:22,230
Pink is the symbol of love and compassion.

40
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:32,048
As I've told you before also, a person who
has Lakshmi should have

41
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:38,357
a house where everybody's invited.

42
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:47,734
Like the lotus invites all the insects, even
the beetles who have got lots of thorns,

43
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:56,299
and the beetle comes and sleeps the whole night
very comfortably, and the lotus closes its petals

44
00:05:56,521 --> 00:06:01,782
 so that the beetle has no trouble to
be comfortable.

45
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:13,238
So these houses must accept guests, any kind
they are, and they should be treated

46
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:23,550
very well, just like as if the Gods have come into your house.

47
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:31,542
I've seen people who are poor are much more
hospitable than the people who are rich.

48
00:06:31,636 --> 00:06:34,320
Same way about the countries.

49
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:43,218
Countries which are poor are much more hospitable
than the countries which are rich.

50
00:06:43,308 --> 00:06:49,177
It's very surprising that rich countries have
their immigrations,

51
00:06:49,204 --> 00:06:57,489
 they have all problems of avoiding people,
 guests in their own countries.

52
00:06:57,581 --> 00:07:03,521
So they are going really in the wrong way as far as

53
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:06,556
 the Lakshmi symbols are concerned.

54
00:07:06,783 --> 00:07:12,688
The another very important symbol is that
she stands on a lotus.

55
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:21,848
It's all glorified, all beautiful lotuses
carrying her: but lotus suggests that she

56
00:07:22,235 --> 00:07:34,071
throws no pressures, no imbalances, no power around.

57
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:41,939
But in these countries where people have money,
they try to throw power all around.

58
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:46,710
And one who has money becomes the more powerful person.

59
00:07:46,818 --> 00:07:50,448
Everything becomes power.

60
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:54,997
Money is power, love is power.

61
00:07:55,568 --> 00:08:07,238
This power has no divinity in it, but a power
of oppression and aggression and self-importance.

62
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:13,375
All these symbols of the Lakshmi are very

63
00:08:13,518 --> 00:08:17,890
convincing, that today when we say that somebody has got money,

64
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:23,605
or some country or nation, they are just
the opposite of what they should have been.

65
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,340
The reason is they are not enlightened.

66
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:37,253
They have to have lights in their heart, as
we see that in Diwali, there has to be the light;

67
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:50,809
 and without enlightenment these rich
people, so-called Lakshmipathis, become nonsensical.

68
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:54,526
That's why there has to be the light.

69
00:08:54,642 --> 00:09:02,571
Because with Lakshmi one can become absolutely
blind - so-called Lakshmi, doesn't give you

70
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:09,851
proper understanding as to what it means that
you have got money, that you are rich.

71
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:11,532
What does that mean?

72
00:09:11,874 --> 00:09:15,088
That's why one has to have the lights.

73
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:22,947
Unless and until you have light of divinity
within you, you won't understand

74
00:09:23,365 --> 00:09:26,426
 the great symbol of Lakshmi.

75
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:34,754
But in Sahaja Yoga we believe that the Lakshmi
must become Mahalakshmi.

76
00:09:36,563 --> 00:09:42,723
Man has to become greater, [SOUNDS LIKE MAHAMANAVA].

77
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,693
What does that mean?

78
00:09:44,795 --> 00:09:48,706
That she has to become the Mahalakshmi.

79
00:09:48,828 --> 00:10:04,798
Mahalakshmi is a Deity which makes you absolutely
satisfied with whatever you have.

80
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:07,235
Complete satisfaction.

81
00:10:07,378 --> 00:10:17,899
Not only that, but you start thinking that
"Whatever I have is not sufficient -

82
00:10:18,026 --> 00:10:20,699
 I have to have something else!

83
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:27,809
Not money, not more cars, not more televisions
and things,

84
00:10:27,903 --> 00:10:34,570
but I have to have something else
that will give me real satisfaction."

85
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:42,387
You know the law of economics is that you
are never satisfied.

86
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:50,388
Nothing is satiable, so you go on buying from
one to another to another to another, another.

87
00:10:50,745 --> 00:10:56,983
But when the Mahalakshmi principle shines in you,

88
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:02,224
then you do not want any more.

89
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:09,924
You want to give it to others and you want
to enjoy your generosity.

90
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:16,664
That is the first sign that you are moving
now from Lakshmi to Mahalakshmi.

91
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:24,839
Till the Lakshmi principle, you were blind;
and whatever it was,

92
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:31,204
you were more asking for more things
and more things, and more things.

93
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:41,120
After this is over, then you have the light
enlightenment.

94
00:11:41,438 --> 00:11:54,960
When you have done all the four things properly
- that is generosity, protection and hospitality and compassion -

95
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:05,882
 then you get into another mood of movement

96
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:13,675
because you know nothing is satisfying, nothing is satiable.

97
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:20,823
Running from one thing to another, then that
to another, that to another.

98
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:31,721
And when such people get collective, they
start ways and methods of attracting people

99
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,807
how they could extract money.

100
00:12:35,016 --> 00:12:36,656
There's so many ways.

101
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:42,513
Like in our Italy when I was there, I wanted to buy shoes.

102
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:48,014
We went to the shop and they had only one type of shoe.

103
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:52,434
That kind I don't wear, so said, "No."

104
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:55,969
Now, "Only this year this kind."

105
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,020
"Only this kind?"

106
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,410
"Every shop will have this."

107
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:06,847
I said, "People have no sense, they have no life within them.

108
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,810
So next year, you'll have another style."

109
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,271
Whatever is produced is always new, and these
shoes that were made last year

110
00:13:18,326 --> 00:13:23,921
 or before that are put into some sort of a junk.

111
00:13:24,725 --> 00:13:27,475
It's a very big business.

112
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:38,266
So it is the big business that starts in this
manner, and many people become bankrupt,

113
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:46,845
many people completely lose their dignity, and
fall into the trap of immorality.

114
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:51,741
So this Lakshmi principle if you forget,

115
00:13:51,796 --> 00:13:56,515
 in a proper way you cannot go to the Mahalakshmi principle.

116
00:13:56,926 --> 00:14:09,407
And in the Mahalakshmi way you can find another
kind of personalities,

117
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:14,323
because if you have the light in your heart,

118
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:21,294
then you start seeing that this money business is of no satisfaction.

119
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:25,946
You go on changing from one to another.

120
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,361
So then you think, "What should we do?"

121
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:34,893
With this light in your heart, you find out that you have to follow

122
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:41,115
now the principle of Mahalakshmi otherwise you'll be lost.

123
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:49,358
So when you think of Mahalakshmi you start
seeking, seeking the way by which

124
00:14:49,413 --> 00:14:55,536
 you can really have a real satisfaction of life.

125
00:14:57,638 --> 00:15:02,728
I mean a country like America where people
have so much money and everything,

126
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:09,398
 they have also the maximum number of seekers - maximum.

127
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:17,366
When I first came to America I was shocked
that though there was Mahalakshmi principle,

128
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:24,135
they did not know what to seek and they all
followed all kinds of false gurus.

129
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:32,221
They had become mad, I think, because they
couldn't understand what is to befall be followed.

130
00:15:32,435 --> 00:15:39,845
For that they started following all kinds of false gurus,

131
00:15:40,614 --> 00:15:48,534
who were themselves slaves of Lakshmi - Lakshmitattwa - slaves in the
sense 'who were against' Lakshmitattwa.

132
00:15:48,685 --> 00:15:55,596
And that's how they all were lost, so many
of were lost in this country, and I was shocked

133
00:15:55,675 --> 00:15:59,961
the way they were following wrong type of
people I just thought that

134
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:04,703
there's something really needed to be done to this country.

135
00:16:04,894 --> 00:16:08,818
And for nine years I never came to America.

136
00:16:09,064 --> 00:16:15,550
I am sorry for that, because the seekers were
moving in the opposite direction.

137
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:23,823
They were not in the understanding as to what
the seeking is for.

138
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:27,048
What are you seeking?

139
00:16:27,434 --> 00:16:38,606
Somebody came saying that "You are, I am a
sixteen-year-old and I can make you all realized souls."

140
00:16:38,712 --> 00:16:48,074
And I'm told that he put some vermilion
kumkum in a gun and blasted it,

141
00:16:48,146 --> 00:16:52,318
and people felt they were all, already have gone to heavens.

142
00:16:52,517 --> 00:16:58,457
Such idiotic behavior; how it came into their heads, I don't know.

143
00:16:58,712 --> 00:17:02,291
How did they become so idiotic, I can't understand.

144
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:09,577
So I went back and I said: "I can't help these people much."

145
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:16,804
Then a kind of another fashion started.

146
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:24,368
Like if you went to any party or anything
they would say, "Now see, another guru has come.

147
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,868
He's much cheaper.

148
00:17:27,115 --> 00:17:30,488
And But also there's a sale on."

149
00:17:31,053 --> 00:17:35,013
And I would say "Look at these women and men

150
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:43,023
who are supposed to be the leaders of the world,
 and how can they talk like this?"

151
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:50,182
It was a very common thing among the rich people to talk like that.

152
00:17:51,539 --> 00:18:00,242
This country has been blessed with very, very
great people, as you know, very great.

153
00:18:00,984 --> 00:18:05,176
Abraham Lincoln - what sort of a man he was.

154
00:18:05,206 --> 00:18:08,115
Or even say George Washington.

155
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:13,637
All these people showed the quality of Mahalakshmi.

156
00:18:13,662 --> 00:18:24,231
But they didn't much think of them, and they started working out
 a new method of capturing the whole world,

157
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:32,994
 because, then the idea of power came into their heads;
 that with money we can purchase everything.

158
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:38,802
We can make everybody dance to our tune if we have money.

159
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:51,319
All this attitude towards money
and human beings was absolutely satanic -

160
00:18:51,466 --> 00:18:57,532
to such an extent that their own country started getting ruined.

161
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,841
What happened to the family system?

162
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,754
What has happened?

163
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:04,514
Why the family got ruined?

164
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:09,740
Because of the wrong ideas about Lakshmi principle.

165
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:14,401
The women got lots of money out of divorce.

166
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:20,831
So I've met one lady, she had divorced
her husband eight times, from this country,

167
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:25,185
now I'm told she has divorced the nintandh one.

168
00:19:25,303 --> 00:19:27,746
And she has become very rich.

169
00:19:27,891 --> 00:19:30,040
But she has no shame.

170
00:19:30,217 --> 00:19:38,156
And she is telling everybody that "Get a divorce,
 that's the best way, that's the advantage of coming to America."

171
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:45,751
So what is the problem that human beings don't have enlightenment.

172
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:53,279
And if they get money, and if they are hankering after things,

173
00:19:53,424 --> 00:19:55,755
they have to go to hell, no doubt about it -

174
00:19:56,082 --> 00:20:03,423
and do all kinds of things which was never done
 in the history of this world.

175
00:20:03,726 --> 00:20:08,177
I need not tell you all the absurd nonsensical things they do.

176
00:20:08,404 --> 00:20:19,793
Then started a negatives force of drug,
drinking and all kinds of things.

177
00:20:20,163 --> 00:20:28,772
I mean such blindness, such stupidity, that you can't understand.

178
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:38,065
As if their brains were completely curtailed
 by the activity of moneymaking.

179
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:47,252
I've seen people choosing their suits
and clothes that when they will die,

180
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,593
what they are going to wear.

181
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,950
It sounds funny.

182
00:20:53,065 --> 00:21:00,109
Even their dog dies they make such elaborate arrangements.

183
00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:09,517
They choose even their coffin -
which one they would like to use for burying.

184
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:16,347
So with the money a new problem started, was the choice.

185
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:18,696
What choice you have.

186
00:21:18,855 --> 00:21:24,223
And people played with that choice.

187
00:21:25,142 --> 00:21:33,070
They can befool you and tell you what is the best.

188
00:21:33,195 --> 00:21:39,256
I don't know why, but moneyed people are mostly idiotic,

189
00:21:39,651 --> 00:21:45,357
 if not very immoral. Idiotic, absolutely idiotic.

190
00:21:45,553 --> 00:21:47,864
Anybody can [INAUDIBLE] befool them.

191
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:56,945
So, God knows what is the speciality that the people
 who are very rich can be very cunning,

192
00:21:57,068 --> 00:22:06,039
can be very immoral, can be self-destroying;
but mostly they are idiotic people.

193
00:22:06,173 --> 00:22:15,987
Because the way they talk, you don't know where to look;
what they say about things you don't understand.

194
00:22:16,246 --> 00:22:21,733
So then it's become the country of idiots and stupid people,

195
00:22:21,821 --> 00:22:24,225
and you don't know how to deal with them

196
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:31,808
and how to talk to them about, about the higher life.

197
00:22:31,953 --> 00:22:39,712
This Lakshmitattwa has to become a much bigger principle,

198
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:57,711
which we call as the 'emancipated personality'.

199
00:22:58,373 --> 00:23:04,573
Or we can say 'person endowed with Mahalakshmi principle'.

200
00:23:07,581 --> 00:23:13,771
Such a person may be cheated by others, may be troubled by others,

201
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:21,958
but such a person has its own inner power
 to overcome all such hurdles.

202
00:23:22,465 --> 00:23:31,471
So this Mahalakshmi principle should be established:
but one would say "Why?

203
00:23:32,248 --> 00:23:38,182
What is the advantage of having Mahalakshmi principle?"

204
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:56,308
When the Mahalakshmi principle comes,
 then there are nine Lakshmis which are described,

205
00:23:56,333 --> 00:24:04,204
navadha, nine, which get completely manifested in a human being.

206
00:24:04,696 --> 00:24:08,657
One of them as we call as Gruhalakshmi.

207
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,129
Gruhalakshmi means the family.

208
00:24:13,003 --> 00:24:19,446
The wife becomes a very wonderful person.

209
00:24:19,618 --> 00:24:24,791
She doesn't object to things, she doesn't react,

210
00:24:24,935 --> 00:24:33,554
 but she is very sensible and she builds  up
all her children in a beautiful manner.

211
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:40,559
On the contrary, where she is not a Gruhalakshmi

212
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:47,760
she takes pride in working out something like men.

213
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:56,571
Means to her, her job is important, her bank balance is important.

214
00:24:56,805 --> 00:25:06,128
But the real bank balance of a Gruhalakshmi
is her family and her children.

215
00:25:06,637 --> 00:25:12,392
If she doesn't have that, she will be just

216
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:18,661
thinking that she is very great,
she can complete with this man or that man.

217
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:27,029
Women don't understand that their greatest capacity is to love.

218
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:35,323
How is it that Lakshmi is a woman and all the Goddesses are women?

219
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:41,193
And what is the quality of these Goddesses

220
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:49,737
 is to bestow blessings on people of their own nature,
of their own qualities.

221
00:25:51,900 --> 00:26:00,629
So to think that we are better off than men
because we have more money is the greatest idiocity.

222
00:26:01,586 --> 00:26:08,645
You may have money, but your children will be ruined,
your family will be ruined.

223
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:18,928
When you make a good family, then you create a beautiful,
very beautiful, universe around;

224
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:27,796
and universes after universes like this can create
a beautiful universe in the whole world.

225
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:32,856
There's nothing to sacrifice, but to enjoy everything.

226
00:26:32,975 --> 00:26:41,406
As I said, you enjoy your hospitality,

227
00:26:41,671 --> 00:26:53,131
 you enjoy your generosity - which you do not
 feel is a misery or a trouble to you -

228
00:26:53,455 --> 00:26:56,407
but you just enjoy.

229
00:26:56,554 --> 00:26:59,293
At least I enjoy.

230
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:04,925
If I can give something to someone, that's the greatest blessing.

231
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:13,578
So the idiotic people, they believe that generosity is stupidity,

232
00:27:13,714 --> 00:27:17,589
while they are the real stupidity.

233
00:27:17,738 --> 00:27:27,346
So to create a proper home for your children is a very great work today,

234
00:27:27,472 --> 00:27:30,048
 and it has to be done.

235
00:27:30,935 --> 00:27:35,432
Again there, selfishness comes.

236
00:27:35,992 --> 00:27:42,782
Human beings have so many, such hurdles in life because,

237
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:48,404
I don't know why, he doesn't enjoy everything.

238
00:27:49,342 --> 00:27:56,821
So the selfishness comes in and they will only love their own children,

239
00:27:56,935 --> 00:27:59,902
 they will only love their own husbands,

240
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:04,350
 or they will love only their own wives.

241
00:28:04,488 --> 00:28:07,046
This doesn't create a good family.

242
00:28:07,141 --> 00:28:11,019
I am talking about the global family.

243
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:20,660
For us everybody is a realized soul
and their family and our family is one.

244
00:28:20,898 --> 00:28:25,722
But then they will create problems, talk ill, gossip.

245
00:28:25,826 --> 00:28:33,433
I am surprised even in Sahaja Yoga
we have many women who just go on gossiping,

246
00:28:33,647 --> 00:28:35,957
 their style was gossiping.

247
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:43,395
Because I am talking about Lakshmi and Mahalakshmi
I have to warn the women

248
00:28:43,442 --> 00:28:54,741
because they are the ones who will create the great principles,
the great symbols of Lakshmi and Mahalakshmi.

249
00:28:55,172 --> 00:29:01,646
So gossiping is a very common disease even today in Sahaja Yoga.

250
00:29:02,056 --> 00:29:07,196
I've seen then [SOUNDS LIKE while inside],
 five or six Sahaja Yoginis meet,

251
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,636
they go on talking, talking, talking -

252
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:13,707
I don't know what do they talk - never about Sahaja Yoga, never.

253
00:29:13,745 --> 00:29:20,341
What they talk is 'what's wrong with another person',
 'who is a wrong type of a person'

254
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:22,599
- that we call 'gossip'.

255
00:29:22,624 --> 00:29:28,637
And this gossip has created big problems for us in the collective.

256
00:29:29,473 --> 00:29:32,273
So best thing I would advise to keep quiet.

257
00:29:32,298 --> 00:29:35,442
Even when they come to my house they talk.

258
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:39,895
They have no sense that they should keep quiet.

259
00:29:40,282 --> 00:29:46,783
Without quietude you cannot enjoy the cool vibrations of the Divine.

260
00:29:47,534 --> 00:29:58,587
Just go on gossiping and talking is not a sign
of very developed people in Sahaja Yoga.

261
00:29:58,836 --> 00:30:06,054
That's why the first thing is that women
 should become much more compassionate,

262
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:10,985
much more tolerant and enjoyable.

263
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:15,054
Because you meet somebody, they will start immediately telling you,

264
00:30:15,103 --> 00:30:18,985
 "That is wrong with this person, this is wrong with that person..."

265
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,120
But there's no need.

266
00:30:21,275 --> 00:30:25,119
But they will only come and give you bad news - all kinds.

267
00:30:25,162 --> 00:30:31,281
But they enjoy, giving the bad news,
that they think they are very important.

268
00:30:31,741 --> 00:30:39,934
And when they think they are important,
they can be very dangerous people, very dangerous.

269
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:49,726
 Because I think it's the women who have to work
 it out much more than men,

270
00:30:50,408 --> 00:30:53,810
 to understand the value of Sahaja Yoga.

271
00:30:54,265 --> 00:30:58,108
Because their own children are concerned,

272
00:30:58,253 --> 00:31:02,940
their family is one of the units of Sahaja Yoga.

273
00:31:03,073 --> 00:31:07,374
I am saying this because now I have been noticing it very common,

274
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:17,126
 that the women in Sahaja Yoga are not up to the point
 as they should have been.

275
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,805
They gossip too much.

276
00:31:19,994 --> 00:31:25,810
So they should take to mauna I think,
take to complete silence, not talk.

277
00:31:26,191 --> 00:31:36,331
Those who are really very much effective,
who are doing the great work, are always quiet.

278
00:31:36,481 --> 00:31:37,994
They don't talk.

279
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:43,232
I have seen they don't even come and see me, just recede back,

280
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:51,876
while the women who think they are something special -
 they are the most dangerous.

281
00:31:51,908 --> 00:32:04,714
So the power of Lakshmi that actually first falls
on the shoulder of women should be Mahalakshmi's.

282
00:32:04,993 --> 00:32:20,355
And this one is, is a challenge to all the Sahaja Yoginis
to behave themselves,

283
00:32:20,718 --> 00:32:27,021
and to become greater women than all the
 rest of the women of the world.

284
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:32,326
We have some very, very good, very great Sahaja Yoginis, no doubt.

285
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:39,745
But their style is different,
and they are working out things in such a manner

286
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:42,913
 that it's absolutely adorable.

287
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:46,143
They are just working for Sahaja Yoga.

288
00:32:46,237 --> 00:32:52,872
They do not bother about their personal relationships,
or their personal eminence,

289
00:32:52,983 --> 00:32:57,863
they just want to help Sahaja Yoga in every way.

290
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:03,501
Then there is another Lakshmi called as Gajalakshmi.

291
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:07,052
Actually it means Gaja means elephant.

292
00:33:07,428 --> 00:33:14,081
What is the quality of an elephant is that
the elephant walks with a certain gait,

293
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,898
which is the movement on both the sides.

294
00:33:18,103 --> 00:33:27,165
As I've said you, I've seen people, especially women,
who walk like horses, really -

295
00:33:27,498 --> 00:33:29,581
they just walk like horses.

296
00:33:29,606 --> 00:33:40,425
So once a dance teacher told me,
"Should I start, Mother, a dance school?"

297
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:44,041
I said, "Better start a dance school, doesn't matter.

298
00:33:44,143 --> 00:33:50,003
But are you sure you can teach them to dance
 or they will be just galloping?"

299
00:33:50,145 --> 00:33:51,502
"Why?"

300
00:33:51,588 --> 00:33:57,447
"Because what I've seen of women here that
they walk like horses, I must say.

301
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:04,812
How can these women who walk like horses can
[laughs] can do dance, Indian dance specially.

302
00:34:04,837 --> 00:34:06,439
It's very difficult."

303
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:12,776
So, now we have to see what is the gait, how you walk.

304
00:34:13,681 --> 00:34:19,615
Do you walk like an elephant, or you walk like a horse?

305
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:25,896
Especially for men, men should not walk like elephant
but should walk like horses, all right.

306
00:34:30,252 --> 00:34:35,573
But the worst thing that has happened is that men dress up like women

307
00:34:35,598 --> 00:34:37,711
and women dress up like man.

308
00:34:37,736 --> 00:34:39,370
Now what to do?

309
00:34:39,395 --> 00:34:46,742
Why this kind of a mad transformation taking place?

310
00:34:46,773 --> 00:34:50,493
Why do they take to such things?

311
00:34:50,535 --> 00:35:03,419
For, what is the advantage of becoming a woman
when he is a man, and a woman becoming a man?

312
00:35:03,455 --> 00:35:09,515
That is the reason, it which shows, that they
want to have some change -

313
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,445
 some change is important.

314
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:15,825
You'd like to change your dress,
you'd like to change your houses,

315
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:18,660
even your sexes you want to change.

316
00:35:18,685 --> 00:35:27,682
But why not change your complete being through self-realization.

317
00:35:28,402 --> 00:35:33,532
That is very important, to understand that
we are transformed,

318
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:39,317
and we must have our own dignity of Sahaja Yoga -

319
00:35:39,706 --> 00:35:47,867
 the way we behave, the way we move about and work.

320
00:35:49,101 --> 00:35:56,489
My experience is that once they come to Sahaja Yoga, mostly,

321
00:35:56,514 --> 00:36:03,757
they become very, very beautiful people;

322
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:13,567
and that gradually start growing like
flowers, fragrant with their compassion and love.

323
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:20,371
But also there are people who do not understand how to grow.

324
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:26,846
They have their own small circle into which they move,

325
00:36:27,096 --> 00:36:32,248
and they get just stagnated, they become dwarfed.

326
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:37,411
And then such Sahaja Yogis have to leave Sahaja
Yoga.

327
00:36:37,871 --> 00:36:47,805
So it is the responsibility of all the Sahaja
Yogis to watch and see how far their mind is working.

328
00:36:48,661 --> 00:36:50,716
Where are they going?

329
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,795
What are they doing?

330
00:36:52,836 --> 00:37:02,038
How are they achieving their status as Sahaja Yogis?

331
00:37:03,232 --> 00:37:16,390
So these Lakshmi and, Lakshmis I would say,
and also the Lakshmipatis in Sahaja Yoga have

332
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:22,275
to be very different than the other people
who have money.

333
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:36,019
Mahalakshmi principle should give you a very sober,
 balanced, affectionate and loving temperament.

334
00:37:36,793 --> 00:37:42,015
If it doesn't give you, then you should know
there's something missing.

335
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:48,770
After all, you have come to Sahaja Yoga
not for anything else but for your growth.

336
00:37:49,072 --> 00:37:59,698
And to keep that growth on, you have to acquire
a sense of understanding what should be your,

337
00:37:59,771 --> 00:38:10,076
your personality - relative to others, relative
to other people who are still seeking,

338
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:18,194
who are still blind, we have to achieve a global emancipation.

339
00:38:18,403 --> 00:38:23,569
I know that's my vision is, and the other day we were counting

340
00:38:23,617 --> 00:38:26,568
 how many projects have started.

341
00:38:26,593 --> 00:38:29,325
So, we had to stop at 35.

342
00:38:29,421 --> 00:38:38,416
Already 35 projects have started in India, also in other countries,

343
00:38:38,886 --> 00:38:46,305
and they are only for emancipating human beings.

344
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:56,076
But firstly, as I told you, to do work in
Sahaja Yoga you have to be a detached person.

345
00:38:56,307 --> 00:39:03,575
That is the quality of a Mahalakshmi principle,
that such a person is detached.

346
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:08,758
He is not attached to things which are worthless.

347
00:39:08,903 --> 00:39:14,432
But that doesn't mean that you take a sanyasa
and run away from the family,

348
00:39:14,457 --> 00:39:18,516
run away from your household, run away from ...

349
00:39:18,636 --> 00:39:22,119
 that's not detachment, that's running away.

350
00:39:22,411 --> 00:39:29,592
But detachment is that when you have everything,
still you are detached:

351
00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:38,446
 in the sense you do not feel concerned
 about your own gain out of this.

352
00:39:39,626 --> 00:39:48,721
Such things can happen, very easily, if you really introspect.

353
00:39:49,094 --> 00:39:54,089
And introspection is the best way of meditation.

354
00:39:54,332 --> 00:40:00,335
First introspect and then meditate, then you will grow.

355
00:40:00,371 --> 00:40:09,791
And the real joy of yourself, of your Spirit,
will really give you such enjoyment

356
00:40:09,896 --> 00:40:15,219
that you will not take to stupid, insignificant things.

357
00:40:15,244 --> 00:40:23,153
But you will become very significant people
in Sahaja Yoga who will do such wonderful work

358
00:40:23,315 --> 00:40:29,792
 that everybody will be amazed that an
ordinary human being,

359
00:40:29,817 --> 00:40:34,895
 how can he achieve such things, how can he work it out?

360
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:41,064
As I've told you before, that after realization
you become extremely creative -

361
00:40:41,195 --> 00:40:47,025
 creative in everything, specially in giving realization
to others,

362
00:40:47,168 --> 00:40:55,248
and also creating creative in your life of art,

363
00:40:55,273 --> 00:41:01,412
 music, poetry, drama, writing - all kinds of things you do.

364
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:05,436
We have seen now so many cases who have never been

365
00:41:05,461 --> 00:41:12,847
 on the stage, even, have given very great, inspiring lectures.

366
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:17,871
So the creativity comes like an inspiration for others.

367
00:41:17,992 --> 00:41:20,463
They see you and they feel inspired.

368
00:41:20,751 --> 00:41:25,042
You are not the one who goes into the shadow and sits back.

369
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,184
But openly you come out.

370
00:41:27,209 --> 00:41:36,574
With no pride or no sort of aggression, but
complete humility;

371
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,844
 and you give such beautiful feelings to others,

372
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:45,874
such understanding about yourself and about the other

373
00:41:45,899 --> 00:41:48,548
through yourcollective consciousness.

374
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:55,049
See about collective consciousness and other
things, so many people have talked.

375
00:41:55,074 --> 00:41:59,808
The other day you saw it, there were so many people like Jung

376
00:41:59,913 --> 00:42:08,522
and also there were other scientists and also other philosophers who
have talked about it.

377
00:42:08,547 --> 00:42:13,957
But you have got it, you have the experience
of collective consciousness.

378
00:42:14,095 --> 00:42:20,218
Despite that, if you are lagging behind

379
00:42:20,243 --> 00:42:24,994
in your progress of Sahaja Yoga, in Sahaja Yoga,
that means there is something wrong.

380
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:28,962
Some sort of a load you are carrying on your head.

381
00:42:29,105 --> 00:42:34,296
But through our attachments, there could be loads on your head.

382
00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:40,785
In Sahaja Yoga you are involved with everything and you are detached.

383
00:42:40,972 --> 00:42:46,549
And such a miracle happens to you which
you know very well, I don't have to describe it.

384
00:42:46,989 --> 00:42:52,919
So a new personality with a Mahalakshmi principle comes in.

385
00:42:53,033 --> 00:42:58,148
Mahalakshmi principle is the one which takes you to your seeking

386
00:42:58,196 --> 00:43:01,836
and when you have found out the reality,  the truth,

387
00:43:02,157 --> 00:43:04,173
 then you progress.

388
00:43:04,198 --> 00:43:09,342
With Mahalakshmi principle only, you get your
realization.

389
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:15,063
You know that very well, that through the
Mahalakshmi channel only you rise,

390
00:43:15,088 --> 00:43:17,750
and you get your realization.

391
00:43:17,893 --> 00:43:28,693
So to become a great Sahaja Yogi,
 you have to look after your Mahalakshmi principle.

392
00:43:28,718 --> 00:43:34,308
Now there are people I have seen who care for cheap popularity.

393
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:39,297
I have known people who will do everything
for others,

394
00:43:39,322 --> 00:43:42,720
do this, do that, but only for popularity.

395
00:43:42,783 --> 00:43:50,662
There's no - essentially understood - they
have not essentially understood that

396
00:43:50,687 --> 00:43:54,680
 whatever you are doing, is it for cheap popularity?

397
00:43:55,155 --> 00:43:58,784
You don't have to fight an election in Sahaja Yoga,

398
00:43:58,882 --> 00:44:01,959
you don't have to cast your votes in an election.

399
00:44:01,984 --> 00:44:08,951
But what happens daily, the person who has
that dynamism of Sahaja Yoga

400
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:12,341
 just comes up. Everybody knows.

401
00:44:12,513 --> 00:44:22,751
Not talking, not impressing, not showing off,
not going after cheap popularity,

402
00:44:22,776 --> 00:44:29,301
 but growing within - for that I cannot say what you have to do.

403
00:44:29,326 --> 00:44:32,493
How does a tree grow? By itself.

404
00:44:32,592 --> 00:44:36,305
You are living examples of Sahaja Yoga.

405
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:39,591
So how will you grow by yourself?

406
00:44:39,775 --> 00:44:46,238
By yourself you'll grow - is a promise that
is given to you by the Divine.

407
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:53,697
But allow it to grow, through introspection and meditation,

408
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:00,141
 and what we call complete dedication and devotion.

409
00:45:00,207 --> 00:45:08,600
The other day I told you about the word shraddha
- it's not just praying, it's not just having faith,

410
00:45:08,731 --> 00:45:14,568
but shraddha is that you have it in your heart -

411
00:45:14,664 --> 00:45:22,118
the enjoyment of achievement through your devotion and dedication,

412
00:45:22,215 --> 00:45:25,344
 that should be called as shraddha.

413
00:45:25,413 --> 00:45:28,858
With that thing only it will work out.

414
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:34,035
But you have to have faith in yourself and
faith in Sahaja Yoga.

415
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:39,303
You know you have got it, those people were
talking about it, but you have got it -

416
00:45:39,308 --> 00:45:41,819
 you know what is collective consciousness.

417
00:45:41,902 --> 00:45:44,758
You know that you are in the collective consciousness.

418
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:48,981
But how far you have grown into it is to be seen.

419
00:45:49,006 --> 00:45:50,567
It's very important.

420
00:45:50,591 --> 00:45:57,344
For that, I need not in this short time describe
to you all the qualities of the Lakshmi but

421
00:45:57,368 --> 00:46:07,155
try to understand that a person who has Lakshmi
principle has to have all these special qualities

422
00:46:07,179 --> 00:46:11,721
otherwise he is not the worshiper of Lakshmi.

423
00:46:12,649 --> 00:46:18,121
And that's how I would today bless you all with the proper wisdom

424
00:46:18,146 --> 00:46:21,980
and the proper understanding of the Lakshmi principle

425
00:46:22,047 --> 00:46:25,771
 through the lights which are enlightened within your heart.

426
00:46:25,795 --> 00:46:27,375
May God Bless You.

427
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:38,687
May God Bless You.
