1
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:24,208
You see, actually in subtle form it’s this.

2
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:34,166
That thing which is Kailash, part of His domain.

3
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:42,417
Kailash is a very big space, you see. Peak of …. Kailash.

4
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:47,875
You must see the pictures of Kailash.

5
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,959
It looks like a human face, absolutely – so wonderful.

6
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,333
And three little heads, can you see?

7
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,917
Absolutely clearly you can see this.

8
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:02,000
And the vibrations are tremendous.

9
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:21,875
And what about the day we had Shiva Puja?

10
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,999
That day it was frozen completely.

11
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,333
Heroine.

12
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,750
Nayika is the commander, that’s correct. Shri Chakra:

13
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,999
it’s the chakra with which the whole world is created,

14
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:18,625
everything; creative chakra is Shri.

15
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:44,000
Chintamani is the jewels which is,

16
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,750
which emits the fulfilment of your desires.

17
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:58,542
Whatever you desire, your worries, your desires are fulfilled

18
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:03,000
by that jewel, called Chintamani.

19
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:16,208
She is the one who fulfils all your desires. You must desire.

20
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:37,625
Brahmas, five Brahmas. Five elements.

21
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:48,500
Loudly.

22
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,417
Vaibhava.

23
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,792
Vaibhava, is the glory.

24
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,542
… combines.

25
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,000
Manatma.

26
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,083
What is translated, read it.

27
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,125
You see, this is because of samasas;

28
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,959
Vigraha is not correct, that’s why.

29
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,834
Now you read the …

30
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:27,917
Atmanas.

31
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:30,375
Manatmanas:

32
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:33,041
the ones whose minds have become atmas.

33
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,333
Manatmanas.

34
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:52,834
See, they are Her dignity – that’s the point.

35
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:57,083
That’s Her vaibhav. Vaibhav means, we can say,

36
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,792
the majestic pulsation She emitted.

37
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:07,917
Something – vaibhava can be, bangles can be My vaibhav,

38
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:12,000
means they’re ornaments which add to Her majesty.

39
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:14,500
Vaibhav, you see.

40
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,625
Rishis are My vaibhavas, see;

41
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:24,667
now what I’ve told you is true. You’re My vaibhavas.

42
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,709
This Bandhasur, this what’s-his-name is –

43
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,417
was yesterday that lady was entangled by him …

44
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,917
Muktananda – is Bandhasur.

45
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,083
Yogi: The asura who ties you up.

46
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,917
Very difficult to get rid of these people.

47
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:53,417
Muktananda, see is the one who makes you absolutely

48
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:56,792
bound to him – and he says, “Have muktananda.”

49
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,041
This lady is down with tuberculosis,

50
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,417
but she can’t give him up, you see.

51
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:10,000
She has both the hearts catching very badly,

52
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,959
she’s going down, and she can’t give up

53
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,041
because he’s tied him – he’s Bandhasura.

54
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,250
But Bandhasura has this quality:

55
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,250
you have to tie up people, you see,

56
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:22,291
and even if they are dying they cannot leave.

57
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,083
Sampatkari.

58
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:10,875
Sampati means “property” and is represented by elephant.

59
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,625
This is the main point.

60
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:32,542
See, ashwakoti – crores of ashwas.

61
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:39,917
Ashwa means horses; so, white horses – crores of them.

62
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,667
Do you know that?

63
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57,917
Ashwarudha.

64
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,709
The ones who are on the horses, white horses,

65
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,041
are representative of the Shakti, of the Power,

66
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:10,709
and they are the ones who are part of the Kalaki.

67
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:18,792
Crores of them, crores. “Crores” means ten million – one.

68
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:06,291
She’s the action; action chakra is Shri Chakra,

69
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,166
through which one acts.

70
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:11,000
It’s the right side, Shri Chakra.

71
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,917
Geya chakra. “Geya” means “by which you know.”

72
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:22,166
Geya is the, by which you know.

73
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:26,542
She is the one who is in possession of that center

74
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:28,999
by which you know.

75
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:34,000
Knowledge is that chakra only.

76
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:48,041
Those who are served are the mantrinis.

77
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,875
You have – your mantras are enlightened mantras.

78
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,166
Whatever you say is mantra.

79
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:23,709
Kiri? Kri, kri. Yes, that becomes “Sa”.

80
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,959
Kri is Karochita, is Shri Chakra only.

81
00:12:56,917 --> 00:13:00,041
So Sahaja yogis must be careful, you see, also.

82
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,291
A little bit frightening.

83
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:17,709
Madhyaga.

84
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:38,875
Blazing garland – Jwalamalini.

85
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,166
Jwalamalini is...

86
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,792
Horrible Bandhasur.

87
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,208
What is the valor of Nitya?

88
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,375
Is crucifixion of Christ.

89
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,166
It’s the valor of Nitya, because He’s eternal Being,

90
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,542
so you can see Him crucified; otherwise

91
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:59,583
for a Mother to see Her Child crucified is horrific.

92
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,875
But because He’s the valor of Nitya,

93
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:06,917
that’s the valor of Nitya – the valor of eternity.

94
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,999
You see the valor of eternity,

95
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,750
how He is killed actually, and He resurrected.

96
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,208
But when you see that valor, it is so beautiful.

97
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,667
Yogi: We must know that the same thing is in us.

98
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,625
Yes, of course.

99
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:48,125
Bala is Kartikeya. It’s Kartikeya.

100
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:51,500
And He kills, because at this point the Kartikeya

101
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:54,834
works out, you see – at this point.

102
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:59,208
And this is one, this horrible fellow Bandhasur, creates your

103
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,500
Was terrible lady, that night!

104
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:20,250
Is there not going to be … now.

105
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:26,500
Now it’s done or not? It’s done now.

106
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,999
I gave it to Pamela.

107
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:55,125
Pamela, where are those ornaments I gave you?

108
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:36,500
Where is that? … Yes, where is it?

109
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,250
Both things are there.

110
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:31,750
Karanguli.

111
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,959
From Her …

112
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
...fingernails. Karanguli.

113
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,375
Anguli is “fingers.”

114
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,333
Pashupati’s Shiva, and She’s Mahapashupati.

115
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:05,417
Burning the cities, is just like Rajneesh’s city was burnt.

116
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:07,291
Madhyakuta. Middle part.

117
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:45,000
Kula is, you can say, it’s a dynasty, dynasty; house, house.

118
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:54,583
Yogi: Mataji’s kula is all the Sahaja yogis.

119
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,083
Of course …

120
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:13,375
See, it’s very delicate.

121
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:20,875
See, what are the symbols of, say -

122
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:27,291
now, Gavin has given Me a little crown

123
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:32,583
as a symbol of England, you see,

124
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:34,999
which I really look after very much, you see –

125
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,917
kept it very carefully.

126
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,041
Also Kulangana is a word used for a lady

127
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:02,417
who cares for the kula, means for the house,

128
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:05,458
for the dignity of the house, dignity of the family,

129
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,458
of all the dignity.

130
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,208
She cares for the dignity of all the members of her family.

131
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:14,417
To her, the dignity of her family

132
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:15,750
is the most important thing.

133
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,250
She enjoys that.

134
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:47,417
There’s another word is kaul.

135
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:52,792
Kaul is this thing where they ask whether it is correct

136
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:55,917
or not for the kula, that is;

137
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:58,750
and if the flower falls on this side or that side,

138
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,999
they say, “Yes, kaul, yes, yes.

139
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:03,125
The Goddess has said yes to me.”

140
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:07,125
So Kaulini: She’s the one who is the,

141
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:11,250
of course the mistress of the kula;

142
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,709
but She’s the one who gives you yes and no,

143
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:19,500
the indications which way to go.

144
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:48,000
Akula. Akula means “the one who is beyond any disturbance.”

145
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,917
Kula also mean “banks of the river” – kula,

146
00:27:56,166 --> 00:28:00,583
so also can mean “the one who has no banks.”

147
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,750
Samaya means “time.”

148
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:16,875
She’s the one who knows the time when to start puja,

149
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,208
when to do what, She knows, She knows the timing,

150
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:24,083
because She is inside the time.

151
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,125
This is very important.

152
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:36,041
What is it?

153
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,583
Samayachaara, samayachaar means whatever is to be done

154
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:43,583
in a particular time.

155
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:48,709
For example now in modern times, see, that particular,

156
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:51,625
that whatever is to be done,

157
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:55,208
auspicious thing for modern times, one should do.

158
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:59,875
For example, learning English is important for us.

159
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:04,917
But apart from that, samayachaar means mannerism

160
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:08,667
of a particular time, you see, certain mannerism

161
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,792
of a particular time which is good,

162
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,083
auspicious, must be done:

163
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:16,458
like putting the belt, see, while sitting in the car

164
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:20,125
you must put the belt – samayachaar, whatever it is.

165
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:23,125
You see, for Devi it is not necessary.

166
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:26,166
For example, if you give Me some money,

167
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:28,291
I need not put it in the bank.

168
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:31,000
I can lose all that up and say that I’ve finished –

169
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,709
there’s no sin for Me.

170
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,834
I can take away all your properties,

171
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:37,000
everything, there’s no sin.

172
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:39,959
But I must do according to the time,

173
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:42,041
to prove what is good for you,

174
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:46,166
how you should behave towards money,

175
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:49,875
towards collectivity; and accordingly I behave.

176
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,500
And there is no need for Me,

177
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,375
because I am beyond it, isn’t it?

178
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,875
But samaya, whatever is necessary for

179
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:59,625
according to the time, I have to do.

180
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:03,166
And that’s what you should understand.

181
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:05,500
Not to be abnormal people, you see,

182
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,625
behaving in an abnormal way.

183
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:11,417
Even I tell you that you need not put on this red thing,

184
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,208
because it may not be samaya kul at this time,

185
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:16,000
you see – people won’t understand,

186
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:19,125
so you need not put.

187
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:26,250
It is wisdom to behave in a way that you lead normal,

188
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,458
you behave in a normal way, do something that is normal.

189
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:35,875
But God need not.

190
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:38,999
For God it is not necessary because He’s beyond,

191
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:45,750
but when you have disciples who have to come up,

192
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:47,917
who have to deal with other people,

193
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:51,875
they must know how to behave.

194
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:55,917
Like to say thank you is not necessary for Me to you, at all.

195
00:30:55,917 --> 00:30:57,542
If you give Me a glass of water

196
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,375
it’s a privilege to you, all right?

197
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:01,125
But I say thank you ten times,

198
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,625
because you must also say thank you.

199
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:10,166
Samaya kul, samaya kul.

200
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:15,500
Yogi: Salutations to Her as the only one

201
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,625
who lives in the Mooladhara.

202
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:25,291
Nobody can enter in.

203
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:29,333
Brahma granthi.

204
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:52,291
See, you can’t enter inside the center unless

205
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:54,625
and until your Kundalini rises,

206
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:58,458
and the Kundalini is the representation of Holy Ghost.

207
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:01,709
And She’s the only one which can enter into it.

208
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:05,083
And also She resides, the Devi resides there

209
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:09,583
as Mahalakshmi or as Lakshmi, in Manipura.

210
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:30,834
Now see, without coming to Sahaja Yoga

211
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,041
you would not understand all these things, isn’t it?

212
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:36,041
Because it’s not known to you that

213
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,792
there are granthis within us,

214
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:39,875
there are centers within us, that these centers

215
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,917
are to be broken, then there’s granthis are formed

216
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:46,291
between the centers – all this knowledge is impossible.

217
00:32:46,542 --> 00:32:48,583
If you are not realized what’s the use of talking

218
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:51,208
about it to you, because you cannot see that.

219
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:53,375
But in a person you can see it,

220
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,834
that at a certain point you find it is between

221
00:32:55,834 --> 00:32:59,000
two centers this Kundalini stops, you see.

222
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,583
There is the center, say, of Manipura and Swadhisthana,

223
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:05,166
in between the two the Kundalini stops.

224
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:06,417
Now what is that?

225
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,458
That is the granthi of Vishnu,

226
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:10,709
so that’s the Vishnugranthi vibhedini.

227
00:33:10,709 --> 00:33:13,333
If you say the mantra of “Vishnugranthi vibhedini”,

228
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:15,375
then only the Kundalini will rise.

229
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:17,125
But before Realization,

230
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:19,500
before the movement of the Kundalini, it is what?

231
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:23,250
It is just talk, it has no sense at all.

232
00:33:35,792 --> 00:33:38,125
Here, at the Agnya Chakra.

233
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:44,625
Antaral. Antaral means the innermost core.

234
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:48,125
Antaral – in the innermost core of Agnya Chakra

235
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:52,291
She resides. Rudra.

236
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:10,208
“Sahasraram bhuja” means in the lotus of the Sahasrara,

237
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:14,959
aarudh – She is bestowed upon that.

238
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,959
Ascend – aarudh. All right.

239
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:22,375
Actually when you go onto a throne or

240
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:27,041
onto a horse is what you call mounted:

241
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:31,375
She is mounted upon, She is mounted upon – aarudh.

242
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:45,500
Yogi: Salutations to Her who is slender as a lotus stalk.

243
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:50,166
That mean you should not be harsh with Me.

244
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:07,834
Bhavani. “Bhava” means “to manifest.”

245
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:11,375
Whatever is manifested. Known.

246
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:24,041
You must have feeling.

247
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:27,041
If you don’t have feelings for Me, you won’t know Me.

248
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:28,709
Rationally you will not know.

249
00:36:28,709 --> 00:36:29,709
Those people who tried to know Me rationally

250
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:31,291
can never know Me.

251
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:33,083
You have to have feelings.

252
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:46,375
Forest of …?

253
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:54,750
You see, if you have to become,

254
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:57,959
there’s a big mesh on, and She’s the one

255
00:36:57,959 --> 00:37:02,542
who cuts that and makes you the spirit.

256
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:09,166
See, whatever is manifested is created,

257
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,458
is nothing but a forest, isn’t it,

258
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,917
and She takes you beyond that.

259
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:24,500
“Bhadra” means actually “gentlemanly”, see?

260
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,250
She likes people who are gentlemanly.

261
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,250
She doesn’t like arrogant people,

262
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:32,583
people who have no sense how to behave,

263
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:38,542
ill-mannered sort of people She doesn’t like, you see –

264
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:45,125
except for Shiva, who is His own style, you see.

265
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:52,000
He’s very kind, but He’s so innocent, He’s so sweet.

266
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:59,583
Imagine, He comes on a bull – He’s not very bhadra!

267
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:06,583
Not very gentlemanly to come on a bull, isn’t it!

268
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:21,917
I mean, She’s a lady. She’s ladylike, you can say.

269
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:30,999
Yogi: Salutations to Her who gives

270
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,500
all good things to Her bhaktas.

271
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:35,792
All good things, not bad things –

272
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:38,583
supposing you ask for a whisky, I will not!

273
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,166
Yogi: Salutations to Her who loves Her devotees.

274
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:55,291
Definitely. You must know this in your hearts,

275
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:58,291
that I love all of you very much, all right?

276
00:38:58,542 --> 00:39:00,458
So you won’t be diffident at all.

277
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:02,333
I love you, every one of you,

278
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:05,417
much more than you love Me.

279
00:39:06,417 --> 00:39:08,667
So that you love yourself and each other.

280
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:14,250
Yogi: Salutations to Her who can be approached

281
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,375
only through devotion.

282
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:18,834
Through devotion.

283
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,417
You can only control Me through bhakti.

284
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:14,834
Sharada is Saraswati.

285
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,625
Shatodari doesn’t mean that.

286
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:36,792
Shatodari. Shat means hundred.

287
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:42,583
She has hundred, hundred – udara means stomachs,

288
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,333
see, udara means the wombs.

289
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:47,125
She has hundreds of wombs.

290
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:50,000
Otherwise how will I do the work?

291
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:50,250
… is going to make Me red!

292
00:43:00,959 --> 00:43:02,875
Should be also unruffled type.

293
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,041
There’s nothing to be ruffled,

294
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,291
it’s all a joke going on.

295
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:18,792
That means completely integrated personality.

296
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:31,500
Yogi: Salutations to Her who is beyond desire.

297
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,834
That’s why I say you must desire.

298
00:44:14,542 --> 00:44:17,208
She’s purposeless, you see, purposeless.

299
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:19,875
This Prapancha means “purposeless”, you see.

300
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:22,834
All the elements are the ones which create the purpose.

301
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:25,959
If the elements are not there, there’s no purpose.

302
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:39,291
I mean, if you become abode of everyone,

303
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:41,999
how can you have abode?

304
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:44,166
If you become the support of everyone,

305
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:47,375
how can you have any support?

306
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:49,917
Imagine the situation!

307
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:45,250
Nirupadhi.… upadhi means there’s no upadhi.

308
00:45:47,834 --> 00:45:52,291
Means, see, additions, an addition, you see.

309
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,999
A upadhi is, you see, like they say

310
00:45:56,999 --> 00:46:01,333
“Sir this and this”, “Lady this and this” – you see,

311
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:03,500
these are all upadhis.

312
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,542
This is additions; which, if you are complete,

313
00:46:05,792 --> 00:46:09,542
you don’t need this thing – attributes.

314
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:39,500
I mean, if you have passions, how can you destroy passions?

315
00:46:42,291 --> 00:46:44,041
But it’s so natural, you know.

316
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:46,291
There’s nothing special.

317
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:50,166
Nothing special about a person

318
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:53,458
who didn’t take to these passions.

319
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,917
Naturally.

320
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,792
These are called as dual names, you see:

321
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:54,625
that the first they give the quality,

322
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:58,041
and then what does that quality do.

323
00:47:58,291 --> 00:48:00,959
Say, if they say “Nirmama” it’s a person

324
00:48:00,959 --> 00:48:03,291
who doesn’t say “this is mine,” who doesn’t feel

325
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:05,291
“this is mine, this is mine.”

326
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:08,166
Such is the person only –that’s the quality.

327
00:48:08,417 --> 00:48:12,166
Nirmama quality itself destroys this attachment in you

328
00:48:12,417 --> 00:48:15,875
when you say “this is mine, this is mine, this is mine.”

329
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:21,792
You see, like a soap has the quality to cleanse,

330
00:48:21,792 --> 00:48:22,583
all right?

331
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:25,999
The soap has to cleanse, now nobody cleanses the soap.

332
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,417
That’s how it is.

333
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:13,083
Yogi: Salutations to Her who has no doubt.

334
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,333
About anything.

335
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:27,625
See, this is what it is.

336
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:30,625
If I had doubt then you would be doubtful also.

337
00:49:30,999 --> 00:49:33,417
But you know Mother has no doubts about things,

338
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,417
so when you come near Me your doubts also vanish,

339
00:49:36,667 --> 00:49:38,792
automatically.

340
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:55,500
That’s it … Very good …

341
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:08,500
“Bhava” means whatever is manifested.

342
00:50:08,959 --> 00:50:13,041
You see, whatever is manifested is bhava;

343
00:50:13,959 --> 00:50:16,083
and whatever is manifested is this flesh,

344
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:18,083
this body, this everything, see.

345
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:23,333
So you just get above it, that you deny it –

346
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:27,583
the denial of the flesh, as Christ has said.

347
00:50:27,999 --> 00:50:31,000
So Bhavanashini means the one who takes you away

348
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:34,500
from this world of illusions, the world of manifestation,

349
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:38,125
in which you think “Now this house is mine, that is mine.”

350
00:50:38,375 --> 00:50:40,125
All these ideas go away,

351
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:42,166
and you become one with the Reality.

352
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,792
Yogi: Salutations to Her who has no plans,

353
00:50:55,792 --> 00:50:57,417
no mental acitivities.

354
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:02,875
Not at all. But what to do?

355
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:05,875
The mental activity I don’t understand.

356
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:09,208
I sometimes say “I think” because of samayacha,

357
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:11,875
you see; but to be very frank, I never think.

358
00:51:12,166 --> 00:51:14,583
I don’t know how to think.

359
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:18,083
It’s impossible.

360
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:20,750
It’s a funny machine, you know.

361
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:26,041
That’s why for you I have more respect and concern,

362
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,208
because whatever I have I have,

363
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:30,125
it’s nothing so special, you see?

364
00:51:30,125 --> 00:51:31,875
But you are achieving it,

365
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:34,250
so it’s something special about you.

366
00:51:34,542 --> 00:51:36,834
If you have everything, what is so great?

367
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:39,000
If somebody is achieving it, it’s a greater thing,

368
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:41,583
much, much greater.

369
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:49,291
That’s all right.

370
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:51,166
But for that I cannot take any credit,

371
00:51:51,417 --> 00:51:53,166
because it’s automatic people take it.

372
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:55,417
I don’t know how to take the credit, you see.

373
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,625
That capacity is also not there, you see,

374
00:51:58,625 --> 00:52:02,041
to take the credit. I’ve tried, but I can’t!

375
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:07,333
I never feel, you see,

376
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:10,709
that a very credible about it that

377
00:52:10,709 --> 00:52:12,166
I should take a credit,

378
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:14,625
and come and “this is My doing.”

379
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:15,959
I just don’t feel it that way,

380
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:17,709
I don’t know how to feel – I mean,

381
00:52:17,999 --> 00:52:21,083
there’s something’s missing in the personality.

382
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:26,166
The ignorance is missing. All right?

383
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:46,500
Now this is the integration,

384
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:48,166
and non-integrated, you see.

385
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,875
When you are integrated there’s no problem, about it:

386
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:54,542
you are integrated.

387
00:52:54,542 --> 00:52:58,667
So whatever your body is – it will eat what is good,

388
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:01,500
everything is integrated; no problem,

389
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,500
there’s no quarrel about it.

390
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,667
Within yourself you are at peace.

391
00:53:05,917 --> 00:53:07,083
Let others do what they like,

392
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:09,667
whatever they think about themselves doesn’t matter.

393
00:53:09,667 --> 00:53:11,542
But as far as you are concerned,

394
00:53:11,542 --> 00:53:14,166
you have no problem because you are so integrated

395
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:16,750
and supported: there’s no left Vishuddhi

396
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,542
feeling-guilty business.

397
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:20,917
I don’t feel guilty for anything at all, you see.

398
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:23,375
If I scold somebody – all right,

399
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:25,834
I had to scold, I’ve scolded, finished.

400
00:53:26,208 --> 00:53:29,500
I don’t sit down and start feeling my left Vishuddhi.

401
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,250
I am completely integrated.

402
00:53:33,999 --> 00:53:36,834
Whether I am in peace or in turmoil,

403
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:38,500
or in anger turmoil I’m never –

404
00:53:38,959 --> 00:53:41,375
but I deliberately take anger upon Myself.

405
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:43,125
Because it is deliberate, what is there

406
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:45,500
to feel bad about it?

407
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,792
Because you get, you see, blown into it:

408
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,291
that’s why you feel bad, “Oh, why I did it?”

409
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:54,542
But this I do it deliberately.

410
00:53:54,792 --> 00:53:57,667
Then what is there to feel bad?

411
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:02,125
Yes, yes, of course. I do.

412
00:54:16,959 --> 00:54:19,542
Yogi: Salutations to Her who destroys death.

413
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:24,750
The other day I used the mantra of Mrutunjaya.

414
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,417
Did you hear that?

415
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,875
That is should be used for people who are possessed

416
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:34,542
by sort of a cemetery business, see.

417
00:54:34,999 --> 00:54:38,250
So imagine a complete cemetery possesses a man;

418
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:41,333
then what to say?

419
00:54:41,709 --> 00:54:43,917
It’s Mrutunjaya:

420
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:49,375
that “You are victorious over the death.”

421
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:01,166
That’s what I said.

422
00:55:02,291 --> 00:55:05,458
I don’t do anything, I am lazy person.

423
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:14,792
Yogi: Salutations to Her who takes nothing.

424
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,000
Yes, who takes nothing.

425
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:20,375
Really, to be very frank I cannot take, you see –

426
00:55:20,375 --> 00:55:22,125
that doesn’t work out.

427
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:24,917
You see, whatever comes to Me goes with a double speed.

428
00:56:32,875 --> 00:56:35,500
You know who is Durga?

429
00:56:35,999 --> 00:56:42,083
Durga is the one who is that fellow who did anand marg.

430
00:56:55,959 --> 00:56:58,750
All right, now give some rice on top.

431
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:02,500
This is what it is.

432
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:06,625
Now if I take this, it will blossom into thousands.

433
00:57:06,917 --> 00:57:08,834
Take where?

434
00:57:16,542 --> 00:57:18,041
And you see, what is this ritual?

435
00:57:18,041 --> 00:57:21,625
What does that mean – (that’s all) – what does that mean?

436
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,208
Now this is the expression when you do like that,

437
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:35,792
is that now we have, making this auspicious,

438
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:44,999
with this rice

439
00:57:47,834 --> 00:57:51,999
and what you’re calling, turmeric.

440
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:55,500
Now the turmeric is a very special thing

441
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:59,041
which is very auspicious, created by Mother Earth.

442
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:00,208
Is a very auspicious thing.

443
00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:03,750
You cannot say why – it is.

444
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:11,500
So mix it up with rice – rice is also a favorite

445
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:16,417
of Mother – and make it auspicious with your hands.

446
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:19,417
You have put it there, by which you say that

447
00:58:19,417 --> 00:58:22,792
“Mother, this we give it to You.”

448
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,999
But actually, to put this akshatas – akshata;

449
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:29,542
akshata means “this cannot be destroyed.”

450
00:58:30,792 --> 00:58:33,333
So while doing this what you are suggesting,

451
00:58:33,583 --> 00:58:37,333
that “Let us detach ourselves from these fruits,

452
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:39,959
which we are giving to our Mother.”

453
00:58:39,959 --> 00:58:42,291
All right? The detachment.

454
00:58:42,583 --> 00:58:44,834
By that detachment, you develop a detachment

455
00:58:45,166 --> 00:58:45,959
within yourself.

456
00:58:45,959 --> 00:58:48,792
It’s a simple thing. That is, to give something

457
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,709
to Mother is something not needed;

458
00:58:53,667 --> 00:58:55,250
but when you give it,

459
00:58:55,542 --> 00:58:58,333
by that you develop a detachment.

460
00:58:59,959 --> 00:59:01,834
That’s why you have to give:

461
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:04,750
you develop a detachment from that.

462
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:08,041
Of course you get it back, hundred times more back,

463
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:13,375
but that detachment is developed within your heart;

464
00:59:13,959 --> 00:59:16,834
and even if you get thousandfold more,

465
00:59:16,834 --> 00:59:19,542
you are not attached to it. See?

466
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:23,333
Then you become generous, you start giving to others.

467
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:26,291
And when you are blessed by the same type of fruits,

468
00:59:26,291 --> 00:59:30,917
you don’t enjoy it alone, you only enjoyed it with others.

469
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:34,667
You see, human beings have a capacity to enjoy everything

470
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:37,250
all alone.

471
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,917
They can sit down in a room,

472
00:59:38,917 --> 00:59:42,458
close the door and peel out a fruit and eat, themselves.

473
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:45,709
I mean, they can do it, quite capable.

474
00:59:45,959 --> 00:59:48,625
Even the crows cannot do it, the animals can’t do it,

475
00:59:48,625 --> 00:59:51,875
but human beings have a capacity: they can do it.

476
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:54,875
I don’t know how – it’s an impossible situation for Me,

477
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:56,875
impossible.

478
00:59:56,875 --> 01:00:00,166
Even to eat food sitting alone is an impossible situation.

479
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:05,083
But to sit down and enjoy yourself alone is possible.

480
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:07,458
But by doing this, what you are saying:

481
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:10,083
that we make it auspicious, give it to Mother.

482
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:16,583
By that, you develop a detachment that

483
01:00:16,834 --> 01:00:18,709
whenever you will eat these fruits,

484
01:00:18,959 --> 01:00:20,291
always shared with others,

485
01:00:20,625 --> 01:00:22,999
and they’ll be bountiful, bountiful:

486
01:00:22,999 --> 01:00:26,417
meaning when you have more, give it to others.

487
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:29,875
All right? So I’ll just touch it, all right?

488
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:31,417
That means I have accepted.

489
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:34,417
May God bless you.

490
01:00:36,875 --> 01:00:38,458
And when you eat these fruits now,

491
01:00:38,875 --> 01:00:42,583
you will develop that detachment in your Nabhi Chakra,

492
01:00:42,917 --> 01:00:48,375
that you will not hanker after fruits of the season,

493
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:52,709
but you’ll be satisfied.

494
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,959
That is auspiciousness, that you feel satisfied.

495
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:01,250
And what satisfies you more is giving:

496
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:06,959
that’s the sign of a realized soul, you see.

497
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:09,500
When you understand the joy of giving,

498
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,542
then you are a realized soul – otherwise you are not.

499
01:01:14,542 --> 01:01:17,208
May God bless you.

500
01:01:17,959 --> 01:01:21,750
Whichever you think I should eat it, I’ll touch them …

501
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:31,875
Strawberries? Strawberries I like. It’s the easiest to eat.

502
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:48,917
You must eat strawberries always

503
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:52,709
with a little bit of salt for the throat.

504
01:02:02,959 --> 01:02:03,542
Thank you.

505
01:02:03,792 --> 01:02:06,959
Now what else? This puja is done now…

506
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:30,999
See your scholarship! Absolutely is true.

507
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:37,792
Now as you have done the job of the unmarried girls,

508
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:43,709
let the unmarried girls do this. Come along.

509
01:02:46,709 --> 01:02:49,709
Unmarried girls from Brighton.

510
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,291
Brighton is a nice place, very few unmarried girls!

511
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:18,542
Unmarried men, all right.

512
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:21,875
Let unmarried men and unmarried girls! Come along.

513
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:33,208
Unmarried men of Brighton. Only two? Three?

514
01:03:40,542 --> 01:03:43,375
Mike, you are supposed to be Brighton fellow.

515
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,500
All right, come along. You become one.

516
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:52,458
You can include Anand if you want.

517
01:03:54,417 --> 01:03:56,667
He’s from Shicarpur.

518
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:59,375
And Sonu. Sonu, you can join us, all right? Open the sari.

519
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:10,583
Gavin, that’s too much.

520
01:04:10,834 --> 01:04:13,917
Who has done – this is too much!

521
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:24,542
See, these are very expensive in England,

522
01:04:24,834 --> 01:04:29,542
you should not buy them. Bought in India?

523
01:04:51,834 --> 01:04:54,583
Open it out. It’s beautiful, isn’t it?

524
01:04:54,917 --> 01:04:57,375
It has got fans, I think, and what else?

525
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:01,375
Real Bengali sari.

526
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:07,500
That’s the blouse-piece.

527
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:13,000
It’s complete with the blouse-piece.

528
01:05:15,834 --> 01:05:22,458
Now, the bachelors must know which side is right side.

529
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:31,125
Is correct, you’re right.

530
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:32,125
This side is right side.

531
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:34,417
Now bring the sari round.

532
01:05:37,375 --> 01:05:39,792
It’s a training!

533
01:05:51,709 --> 01:05:53,834
Ah, how nice!

534
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:58,834
So can you take the photograph of all

535
01:05:59,083 --> 01:06:01,875
the bachelors and the spinsters?

536
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:15,792
All girls.

537
01:06:18,542 --> 01:06:21,917
In India they are called as kanya, kanya.

538
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:48,166
Are you not a bachelor? A bachelor ….

539
01:07:20,291 --> 01:07:22,625
Done now?

540
01:07:32,999 --> 01:07:36,792
This is from London. All right.

541
01:08:22,834 --> 01:08:25,625
It’s very beautiful.

542
01:08:29,959 --> 01:08:31,917
This one is from Brighton.

543
01:08:33,208 --> 01:08:39,875
Let Jeremy put it, the Brighton, all right? Jeremy.

544
01:09:11,417 --> 01:09:13,458
The sari.

545
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:16,000
Get this out, it’s too much.

546
01:09:17,125 --> 01:09:20,333
Let’s put the sari on both the sides.

547
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,166
Is that for the arms? Now come along, come along now.

548
01:09:34,583 --> 01:09:37,417
Bachelors have a special – they’re blessed today.

549
01:09:40,375 --> 01:09:44,083
They are called as kumaras, kumar.

550
01:09:44,999 --> 01:09:50,083
And the, I suppose what they call spinsters are called as –

551
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:54,000
but what do you say in English?

552
01:09:57,667 --> 01:10:00,125
This is the word, but you use for old women!

553
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:14,375
Then it is the marriage is announced?

554
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:20,875
I see.

555
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:22,999
So, they are called as kumaris,

556
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:27,333
and the boys are called as kumars.

557
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:33,208
I think Sanskrit has more decent names, isn’t it?

558
01:10:35,834 --> 01:10:38,625
That’s because they respect the unmarried men

559
01:10:38,917 --> 01:10:43,583
and unmarried women very much – they’re very much respected.

560
01:10:55,208 --> 01:10:59,625
This for arm? Arm, here. And here,

561
01:11:00,291 --> 01:11:03,999
it’s too small – too loose, too loose.

562
01:11:06,792 --> 01:11:12,458
Better make it tight. Tie it up.

563
01:11:14,458 --> 01:11:17,583
Must tie it tight, otherwise it doesn’t stay, you see.

564
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,000
This is for Shri Chakra,

565
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:28,583
or you can say the right Nabhi and Shri.

566
01:11:37,291 --> 01:11:40,458
Why his hands are shaking – with vibrations!

567
01:11:45,208 --> 01:11:49,083
Ah, great – it’s a great task you have done.

568
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:51,959
Yes, it is.

569
01:11:57,625 --> 01:11:59,375
Just pull it, pull it out.

570
01:12:02,417 --> 01:12:04,083
First tie it that way.

571
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:06,750
Give him a hand.

572
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:36,083
Come along, tie it up properly.

573
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:43,375
Come along, come along. Tie up …right.

574
01:13:10,999 --> 01:13:14,333
No, when you have done it with these daisies,

575
01:13:14,917 --> 01:13:16,625
you have done it.

576
01:13:26,333 --> 01:13:27,917
All right now.

577
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:30,583
It’s all right, done; it’s a great job, no?

578
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,000
It’s not easy.

579
01:13:42,291 --> 01:13:44,999
It’s only because you are Sahaja yogis you can do it.

580
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,083
No, no, it’s not easy. Ask anyone.

581
01:13:59,583 --> 01:14:01,208
These flowers in front.

582
01:14:04,917 --> 01:14:09,834
These are all Vishnu’s powers.

583
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,208
Such fragrant!

584
01:14:37,542 --> 01:14:40,125
Look at this one, has such a Sahasrara open.

585
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:42,083
See these daisies,

586
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:44,834
see what a beautiful Sahasrara they have!

587
01:14:45,083 --> 01:14:49,917
See these, look at this one. Just see it, all of you.

588
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:52,458
Only the daisy flower have this kind of … in them,

589
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:54,166
have you noticed?

590
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,750
And now you will know why My name is Daisy.

591
01:15:02,625 --> 01:15:07,709
See, one better than the other – see?

592
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:13,792
Yes, really!

593
01:15:14,458 --> 01:15:16,333
Yes, that’s it!

594
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:17,542
And the fragrance,

595
01:15:17,792 --> 01:15:20,750
you should see the fragrance of the daisies.

596
01:16:51,125 --> 01:16:57,583
All right, I think the boys put the sari in such a way.

597
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:03,542
May God bless you.

598
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:07,417
May God bless you.

599
01:25:21,291 --> 01:25:25,250
I would suggest that all these

600
01:25:25,709 --> 01:25:28,125
should be given to the sea here.

601
01:25:37,125 --> 01:25:39,959
These flowers can be thrown into the sea.

602
01:25:57,625 --> 01:26:00,166
Yogi: Mother, may I read a prayer?

603
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:04,000
This is a prayer for collectivity.

604
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:09,375
All right. Read it loud. Stand up.

605
01:28:46,583 --> 01:28:49,333
Very good.

606
01:28:51,542 --> 01:28:54,542
Vishuddhi is a very big fight, I must say,

607
01:28:55,792 --> 01:28:59,583
to work it out as Shri Krishna.

608
01:29:00,375 --> 01:29:04,834
This left Vishuddhi is a big problem, very sly.

609
01:29:08,166 --> 01:29:10,291
Right Vishuddhi is another problem.

610
01:29:13,709 --> 01:29:16,792
We have to fight it out.

611
01:29:26,583 --> 01:29:30,375
May God bless you all.

612
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:39,208
So havan we’ll do, after lunch –

613
01:29:51,667 --> 01:29:54,250
would you do with Ganesha’s names?

614
01:31:05,166 --> 01:31:07,417
Unfolding is easier than to fold it.

615
01:31:12,999 --> 01:31:15,667
Give it to the bachelors to do!
