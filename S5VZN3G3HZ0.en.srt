1
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:36,069
Today we are going to celebrate the

2
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:41,099
birthday of Mahavira.

3
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:50,969
Mahavira is the incarnation of Bhairavanath,

4
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,929
or you call Him as Saint Michael.

5
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:00,899
Now these two saints as you know

6
00:03:01,029 --> 00:03:03,969
one as the Gabriel, Hanumana,

7
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:08,959
and another is Saint Michael.

8
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:14,099
One is placed on the Pingala Nadi

9
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:18,939
and another one, Saint Michael, on the Ida Nadi.

10
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:23,089
So,

11
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:28,009
Mahavira

12
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,919
had to go through

13
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:38,969
lots of search.

14
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:43,089
Of course He was a

15
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,929
angel, but came as human being

16
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:54,949
and He had to find out

17
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:03,049
the thing of the left side,

18
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,909
and how the left side acts.

19
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:15,019
It's a very complicated thing, left side,

20
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:18,969
is much more complicated than right side.

21
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:24,929
On the left side we have also seven nadis,

22
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:34,919
and these seven nadis are placed one after another.

23
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:39,939
They are described in books and given different names to them.

24
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,029
Now these seven nadis that are on the left side,

25
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:49,109
as you know, they cater to our past.

26
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:54,049
Say for example, every moment becomes a past.

27
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,999
Every present becomes a past.

28
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:03,909
Then we have past of this lifetime,

29
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,099
and also we have past of our previous lives.

30
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:12,099
Then all the past is built in within us

31
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:14,919
since our creation.

32
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:18,929
So all the psychosomatic diseases, as you know,

33
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,949
are only triggered by

34
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:25,879
the entities that appear

35
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:27,889
from the left side.

36
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:32,039
For a person, supposing he is suffering, say, from liver trouble

37
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:37,879
and suddenly he's attacked from the left side,

38
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:40,099
specially Mooladhara,

39
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:45,939
or any left side, left Nabhi,

40
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:50,899
because Mooladhara is the only one that is connected

41
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:53,939
with the left side, Ida Nadi,

42
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,009
and the right side PingalaNadi

43
00:05:57,109 --> 00:05:59,949
is connected with Swadisthana.

44
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:05,929
So the problems of Mooladhara

45
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:11,909
are really beyond the reach of human beings,

46
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,079
and when it is attacked,

47
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:17,949
any one of these chakras on the left-hand side,

48
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:23,079
then psychosomatic diseases

49
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,939
occur into human beings.

50
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:29,119
As I have told you many-a-times, now this is the center,

51
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:31,989
this is the another center, left and right,

52
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,049
they are on top of each other.

53
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:36,099
And using the right side too much,

54
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,919
goes up to a point and suddenly something happens

55
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:40,949
on the left, triggers.

56
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:45,069
So all diseases, say even diabetes,

57
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,959
is due to the psychosomatic efect.

58
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:54,119
A person who is very hard-working, thinks too much,

59
00:06:54,929 --> 00:06:55,939
very right-sided,

60
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:57,959
suddenly something happens,

61
00:06:58,049 --> 00:07:00,949
maybe also he might inherit that diabetes

62
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:03,899
because of the past, and it triggers

63
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:06,939
and you get this psychosomatic problem.

64
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:09,109
Now this psychosomatic problem

65
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,939
is only cured if you know

66
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:16,119
what's the problem of the left side is.

67
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:23,959
So Mahavira went quite deep on to the left side.

68
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:27,949
Why I said it's difficult the left side is, because

69
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:30,889
when you start moving on the left side

70
00:07:31,989 --> 00:07:34,949
the movement becomes linear of course,

71
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:37,099
but it moves downward,

72
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:42,099
while the movement on the right side moves upward.

73
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:45,889
So the movement goes down like that,

74
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,889
and then it coils up,

75
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:55,889
forms coils,

76
00:07:56,889 --> 00:07:58,909
and you go on moving with it

77
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,919
so you are lost in the coil.

78
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,889
But the other one moves upward

79
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:08,969
and the coils are not so many,

80
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:12,019
and because it is upward it's easy to get out of it.

81
00:08:15,049 --> 00:08:17,939
So those people who go to the left,

82
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,939
by any chance, by thinking too much about their past,

83
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:25,999
crying about themselves and always complaining,

84
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:30,089
are more difficult than the people on the right side.

85
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,909
But the right side people are troublesome to others,

86
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:38,929
while the left side people are troublesome to themselves.

87
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:41,109
That's how this left side

88
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,899
was to be found out properly, was done by Mahavira.

89
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:49,959
Of course He knew also, I think, all about it.

90
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:56,889
So He has mentioned practically, in details,

91
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,929
lots of things that can happen to a person

92
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:01,929
who goes to the left side.

93
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:04,009
He gave the idea of hell.

94
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:08,939
He also described seven types of hell.

95
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,989
I mean it's so horrible that I don't want to tell you

96
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:15,069
what is hell is,

97
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:17,999
horrifyingly cruel,

98
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:20,109
horrifyingly joyless

99
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:22,979
and horrifyingly

100
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,099
so repulsive that

101
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:30,069
you hate yourself when you understand

102
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,119
you have committed this mistake,

103
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:35,099
you have committed this pap,  this

104
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:39,979
sin;

105
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:43,049
and then what is the result,

106
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:45,959
what you get - the punishment part.

107
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:48,059
Mahavira worked it out everything,

108
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,089
He has given in all details what sort of punishment

109
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,949
is due to a human being who tries to be left-sided.

110
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:02,019
Also He has given about the person who is right-sided,

111
00:10:02,109 --> 00:10:04,059
but not to that extent

112
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:06,929
because He had to deal with the combination,

113
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:08,979
but mostly with the left side.

114
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:13,889
As I have told many people before and here also I perhaps maybe,

115
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:18,939
that there is a soul that is

116
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:23,059
made out of the causal bodies

117
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:27,959
of all the five elements.

118
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,099
The causal, say for example, of the earth is fragrance.

119
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:35,089
So this

120
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:41,999
soul which is made of the five causal bodies

121
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:43,919
and your centers,

122
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:48,999
plus we can say, also

123
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:56,959
it has got the control over the parasympathetic,

124
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:06,069
it sits on the spinal cord from outside

125
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:11,039
and activates the parasympathetic nervous system.

126
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:15,939
So it has a connection with every center.

127
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:21,079
Now this is the soul when we die,

128
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:31,019
with the Kundalini and our Spirit goes into the sky

129
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:34,999
and it is the soul that guides now

130
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:39,069
the movement of our being, whatever is left now

131
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,939
into a new being and that's how it works out.

132
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:46,059
So everything that we have done so far

133
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:48,079
is recorded in that soul.

134
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:52,979
When you were asking Me, "Mother, we see some sort of

135
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,109
round, round things, you see, lying together.

136
00:11:56,939 --> 00:11:57,999
What is that?"

137
00:11:58,109 --> 00:12:01,019
I told you this is our, this is a dead soul.

138
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:06,099
And now they have found out what I have told them.

139
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:11,979
Because, you see, when a person dies

140
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,059
his soul shows you - like even now you can see,

141
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,059
round, round things:

142
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,029
there could be many, there could be one, a string -

143
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:30,959
and they saw it under a microscope when I told them,

144
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:39,039
that the soul within us is reflected on the cell,

145
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:44,039
which is the reflector of every cell.

146
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:48,049
So the part of the cell which is the reflector,

147
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:56,069
which is placed on one side of the cell

148
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:04,989
also has this soul reflected,

149
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:09,989
and the main soul which is on the back

150
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,119
controls that

151
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:21,939
reflected soul which looks after every cell.

152
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:26,939
Now they have found out that there is in that reflector

153
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:30,989
this kind of seven loops,

154
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:34,879
seven loops because it sits on the eight –

155
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:38,919
seven chakras and the Mooladhara.

156
00:13:40,989 --> 00:13:43,029
Now what He found out that,

157
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:45,059
when people die

158
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,099
then some of the souls

159
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:56,919
are born again just after few days,

160
00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:01,919
and these people are just very ordinary type of people,

161
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:05,969
that's how He brought in a kind of category.

162
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:09,099
So they are - the people who have died -

163
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:13,949
they are of a category, one category,

164
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:20,079
where they exist for a very short time

165
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:23,119
in the collective subconscious

166
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:25,099
and then they take their rebirth.

167
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:34,939
They are very ordinary people,

168
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:37,099
aimless, useless people.

169
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:41,049
But there are some souls when they die,

170
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:43,119
they just hang in the air

171
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:46,099
and they are just waiting to find out somebody

172
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:50,059
who will fulfill their desires

173
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,989
which are not yet fulfilled.

174
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:57,089
Like there's a drunkard and a drunkard,

175
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:02,889
can join another human being who's living,

176
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:04,089
who would like to drink.

177
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,889
So once he starts getting this...

178
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,039
So once it starts

179
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:51,069
getting into the habit of drinking,

180
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:55,879
some of these souls can just jump on that person,

181
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:58,049
and when they jump on that person

182
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:02,069
they can make him a real drunkard.

183
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:06,939
I remember of a lady who was a very short, petite person,

184
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:07,999
came from Cuba,

185
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:10,109
in America when I went first,

186
00:16:10,109 --> 00:16:14,049
and she told Me that she's very sick of herself.

187
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:16,939
And her husband told Me that she can take

188
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:21,949
one whisky bottle, full, neat sometimes.

189
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:25,939
Looked at her, such a little thing. I said "How can she do it?"

190
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:34,929
So, I put a bandhan on her and I saw a huge big Negro

191
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:36,109
standing behind her.

192
00:16:36,969 --> 00:16:38,919
So I said, "Do you know some Negro?"

193
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,949
Immediately she jumped on Me. She said,

194
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:42,069
"Mother, You see that one?

195
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,889
You see that one, that's the one drinks, not me."

196
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:49,099
Of course I cured her

197
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,959
and after that she gave up drinking completely.

198
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:58,909
So whenever you start getting into a habit in a bad way,

199
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:02,979
you lose complete control of yourself

200
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:08,029
and a spirit sits on you, and it controls you.

201
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:12,029
And when it controls you,

202
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:16,909
you do not know how to get rid of any habit.

203
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:19,899
That's why it's difficult to get rid of habits.

204
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:22,949
Now in Sahaja Yoga when the Kundalini rises what happens

205
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:27,959
that these spirits, these dead spirits

206
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:31,039
leave you and you become all right and you give up.

207
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:32,939
That's how it works.

208
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:40,019
I would say that all this Mahavira did not tell,

209
00:17:40,979 --> 00:17:42,989
nor did He find out all these things,

210
00:17:43,989 --> 00:17:46,919
because He was not a scientist, I think, or I don't know why.

211
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,929
But what He has talked about is the hell.

212
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:54,929
And He has said that if you do this kind of thing

213
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:59,069
in your lifetime, then what kind of a hell you'll get,

214
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:02,899
and He has described the hell in a very,

215
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:10,889
I should say, openly and in a very detailed manner.

216
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:13,039
And it's really horrible to know

217
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:16,049
that a human being who thinks no end of himself

218
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,099
ultimately will get to that kind of a hell

219
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:22,059
and some are permanently doomed to be there.

220
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:26,879
But as incarnations take birth,

221
00:18:26,949 --> 00:18:28,909
also these devils, some of them

222
00:18:28,989 --> 00:18:32,039
who are completely doomed to live in hell,

223
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:34,039
also take their birth.

224
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:39,919
And when they take their birth, they try to trouble us,

225
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,039
and they can take birth as, as you know, as our gurus

226
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:45,939
and things. And everything is happening now,

227
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:49,919
you find it how these people are taking their birth

228
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:51,989
and how they are misleading us.

229
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:55,939
How they are using the left Swadisthana

230
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:59,059
or we can call it the left side

231
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:04,109
just to immobilize us completely.

232
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:07,959
So when a person is possessed, as you must have seen,

233
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:11,919
a person gets possessed he cannot feel vibrations -

234
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,939
there are all kinds of symptoms about such a person.

235
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,889
But in Sahaja Yoga what do we do

236
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,919
is to take the name of Mahavira,

237
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:26,059
because Mahavira runs all the way, all the way on the Ida Nadi

238
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:31,049
and comes and stays here onto the -

239
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:36,999
we can say the point which is for our superego.

240
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:41,059
And it sees, controls, works out, cleanses

241
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,899
and does all that is required

242
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:46,109
to put a person right after Sahaja Yoga.

243
00:19:46,939 --> 00:19:49,959
So we have to be really very thankful to Him

244
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:54,939
for doing this kind of work which is very filthy and dirty;

245
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:57,109
because these people don't mind even

246
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,909
sitting in the bathroom, like that you can say,

247
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:03,979
or sitting with everything and meditating.

248
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:06,059
They can do anything, they are very dirty people,

249
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,969
absolutely dirty.

250
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:11,059
When they become tantrikas they try all kinds of dirty things,

251
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,939
and with that they actually create a problem

252
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:18,019
between themselves and the God.

253
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:22,049
Say they'll go to a temple of a Goddess

254
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:24,119
and start misbehaving with a woman there,

255
00:20:24,949 --> 00:20:26,939
so the Goddess will disappear;

256
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:29,039
and once the Goddess disappears in that area,

257
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:32,889
they call all these bhoots from the left side.

258
00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:37,019
So now we have all these souls which are lying, hanging in the air,

259
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:39,119
trying to come back

260
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:46,079
to a conscious thing and to possess someone.

261
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,099
Plus these, we have these masters of the left side

262
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:53,909
who know how to catch hold of these people

263
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:56,029
and put them on somebody,

264
00:20:56,099 --> 00:21:00,019
or to remove from them someone and to put somebody else.

265
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:02,059
So it's a continuous process,

266
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:06,949
and this makes a person absolutely mad and good for nothing.

267
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:10,089
Now when we know all this,

268
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:13,889
still we get caught up on the left side.

269
00:21:13,969 --> 00:21:15,989
Sahaja Yogis do get caught up.

270
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:19,919
That's why I think this Mahavira Jayanti

271
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:23,929
is a very, very great day for us to observe.

272
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:26,059
Now why was He called Mahavira?

273
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:32,899
Because only a person like Him - Vir means a person who is brave,

274
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:36,979
who is chivalrous - because only He could do this.

275
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:41,119
So only He could enter into the being fully

276
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:46,119
and could kill or you can say destroy

277
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:50,019
those horrible rakshasas, devils,

278
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:53,019
all these negative things that come to us.

279
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:56,949
Now as you know we use left side very much

280
00:21:57,009 --> 00:22:00,009
for so many negativity that is torturing us;

281
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:02,989
but if there is no help,

282
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:06,019
say, from Mahavira we cannot do it.

283
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:07,949
We  call the name of Mahavira -

284
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:10,949
you could call Him Saint Michael, you can call Him by any name,

285
00:22:10,949 --> 00:22:13,089
but Mahavira because He was a human being.

286
00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:17,929
All this works out because of Him

287
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:19,979
and He is such a great identity.

288
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:22,959
He, Himself took a birth as a human being.

289
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:26,909
Difficult for saints to take birth as human being.

290
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:30,119
Moreover, you see, the

291
00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:35,019
whole concept

292
00:22:37,949 --> 00:22:40,969
of hell and all that is described

293
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:45,019
 in any scripture is a fact: it exists.

294
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:48,929
And if you try to go in there, you see,

295
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:51,919
when I try to go there and to find out,

296
00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:55,939
I just go off to sleep sort of thing. In My sleep I find out

297
00:22:56,019 --> 00:22:58,029
 all the things that are happening about a person,

298
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:00,909
how much he's caught up, what he's done.

299
00:23:00,969 --> 00:23:04,939
It's a - not a easy thing to do with the conscious mind.

300
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,049
You have to take to the subconscious

301
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,989
and you have to go into sushupti, in a deeper sleep

302
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:12,909
to see what's happening in the left side.

303
00:23:12,969 --> 00:23:16,899
It's a very funny situation, I think,

304
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:20,979
and for Sahaja Yogis also to enter in it, I would not advise it.

305
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:24,059
But one should get rid of the problems of the left side

306
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:26,069
with the help of Mahavira.

307
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:29,939
When this chakra is caught up what you find is a big

308
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:34,099
lump of bone coming out on the right side.

309
00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:38,069
So you have to take the name of Mahavira

310
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:42,909
just to remove that pressure from the left side.

311
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:45,909
Now many people do not even know why they suffer:

312
00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:48,119
Why should they suffer when they have done nothing wrong?

313
00:23:48,939 --> 00:23:51,879
Because they are possessed.

314
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,979
Now even the viruses and all these things

315
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:59,089
like psychosomatic troubles, like cancer -

316
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:02,119
all, I would say the incurable diseases

317
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:07,069
are there because we are triggered into the left side,

318
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:10,979
and that's why we are suffering from these diseases

319
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:12,939
which are not curable.

320
00:24:13,979 --> 00:24:16,899
So we have to thank really very much Mahavira

321
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:19,069
who has given us this power

322
00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:21,999
to remove our left-sided problems,

323
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:27,959
who has given us this light in our hand,

324
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:31,079
which He Himself vibrates

325
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:35,919
and He, Himself tries to throw some light

326
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:39,119
on the obscure things - about Me also.

327
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:44,079
Because of Him only

328
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:48,909
we can get cured

329
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:53,089
of so many physical and mental troubles.

330
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:57,119
You know that the left side can be easily cured

331
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,119
if you use three-candle treatment.

332
00:25:00,939 --> 00:25:04,069
That shows Mahavira is only fond of light,

333
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,979
He doesn't like darkness.

334
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:10,969
And His idea is, I think that way,

335
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:16,089
is to now fully go all the way

336
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:19,909
to clear the left side as far as possible,

337
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:23,879
to help Sahaja Yoga to be established

338
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:29,929
in countries where I find still lot of this negativity is there,

339
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:31,879
lot of it.

340
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,939
So He is working it out, everywhere,

341
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:37,019
and the psychosomatic diseases and all these diseases

342
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:40,119
also we can work it out with candle light and all that,

343
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,079
with three-candle we can do this treatment.

344
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:47,939
So we have to be very thankful to Him

345
00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:51,909
that He has achieved this kind of entry

346
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:54,079
into the left side and has found out for us

347
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:59,999
what sort of problems exist on the left side.

348
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:05,909
It's such a nice thing that we have got today the chance

349
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:08,959
to celebrate His birthday here

350
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:12,919
in a place which is really very much loved by Him.

351
00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:16,069
Now we may say that Mahavira is sometimes seen

352
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:19,049
as a person who is naked.

353
00:26:19,109 --> 00:26:23,919
So it happened that He had gone in a jungle to meditate

354
00:26:23,979 --> 00:26:26,109
and to find out about the left side

355
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,959
and when He got up, you see,

356
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:32,979
He got caught up in one of the bushes

357
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:40,899
and He had to torn off half part of that.

358
00:26:41,889 --> 00:26:45,099
When that half part was torn off,

359
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:50,959
then He came out of those bushes and He was all right,

360
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:55,019
but at the same time Shri Krishna appeared there on the scene

361
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:57,119
as a little boy from a village

362
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:00,949
and He said that "I'm a poor man,"

363
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:04,899
this little boy said, "I am a poor person, I have nothing with Me.

364
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:07,029
You are a king. You can always get your clothes.

365
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:12,899
Why don't you give Me Your, this half cloth that You have?"

366
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:20,089
And, they say so that it was given to this boy

367
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:22,089
and who ran away.

368
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:24,079
He was nobody else but Shri Vishnu.

369
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:32,019
And this, you see, Vishnu took away that cloth

370
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:35,949
and of hardly for about two seconds or three seconds

371
00:27:35,949 --> 00:27:37,959
because He was a king you see,

372
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:40,009
and He hid Himself with leaves

373
00:27:40,069 --> 00:27:42,929
and He went to His palace and got dressed.

374
00:27:42,989 --> 00:27:45,889
But imagine, the people, how negative they are.

375
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:49,119
They just walk without clothes - Jainies.

376
00:27:49,939 --> 00:27:54,009
They have, you see, all kinds of taboos

377
00:27:54,069 --> 00:27:57,059
against all the worms, everything.

378
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:00,929
It's said, these people have started,

379
00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:03,979
that if you do not respect these little, little animals,

380
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:08,969
like you can a, even serpent

381
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:14,909
or any animal which is troublesome and bad,

382
00:28:14,979 --> 00:28:21,949
but is a living thing, so it's to be preserved.

383
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:24,059
Now these Jains are mad.

384
00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:27,909
I told you that they have gone to such a limit of vegetarianism

385
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:30,059
that they try to save even the bugs,

386
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:32,019
put the bugs in a hut,

387
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:36,919
and the hut has got a brahmin there.

388
00:28:36,989 --> 00:28:41,069
Now these bugs suck the blood of this brahmin

389
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:44,029
and once the brahmin is

390
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:47,999
completely, I mean I should say, sucked in

391
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,089
by these bugs, they fall on the ground.

392
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:53,109
Then they allow the brahmin to come out

393
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:55,959
and they give him a lot of dakshina, means

394
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:58,009
they give him money as a reward

395
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,029
for helping the bugs to suck his blood.

396
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:04,079
This kind of vegetarianism is there.

397
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,949
Beware of vegetarians. You see even Hitler was a vegetarian

398
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:10,959
so you can imagine what sort of a vegetarianism it is.

399
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:13,939
All these fads of vegetarianism and all that

400
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:15,969
are not at all required,

401
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:20,959
and that's what Mahavira showed in His life,

402
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:25,979
that it is not at all important to bother about food,

403
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:27,989
what they should eat.

404
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:34,059
See, the whole theory of this vegetarianism has gone

405
00:29:34,889 --> 00:29:39,909
to such a nonsensical limits that I have told people

406
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:42,119
that we should give up vegetarianism, completely.

407
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:48,009
Now also see the juxtaposition of what He wanted to do.

408
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:52,899
If you do not eat proteins you cannot fight bhoots.

409
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:56,879
A person who has bhoots in him must eat a lot of proteins,

410
00:29:56,939 --> 00:29:59,079
not carbohydrates but proteins, so that

411
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:03,109
it can fight those left-sided enemies.

412
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:06,929
But here it is they have to be vegetarians.

413
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:10,029
Now imagine they have left-sided enemies within them

414
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,029
and they want to be vegetarians.

415
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:14,879
Finished. How will they fight it?

416
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:18,919
So all this is all we should say is pre-planned

417
00:30:18,979 --> 00:30:23,969
by the person who tries to, sort of say is -

418
00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:27,009
we can say like that, you see, a person

419
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:28,879
who tries to remove the -

420
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:38,999
or we can say that the person who tries to make the,

421
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:43,899
these lower animals live,

422
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:46,029
rather than human beings, you see they're oppressors.

423
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:48,949
This is the stupid thing they do.

424
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:53,109
Must know that I cannot give Realization to these worms

425
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:58,969
and to these fishes, or even to chickens.

426
00:30:59,979 --> 00:31:01,939
We require human beings.

427
00:31:02,979 --> 00:31:10,099
So all this has happened because of human beings

428
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,879
going in juxtaposition of whatever is said.

429
00:31:14,969 --> 00:31:18,999
Like Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,"

430
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:22,069
and I've yet to come across a Christian

431
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:26,879
who is not a Sahaja Yogi, without adulterous eyes,

432
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:28,909
whether it's a woman or a man.

433
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:34,979
So we go just the opposite of what we have been taught.

434
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:38,909
In the case of same thing happened that Mahavira,

435
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:43,909
what He tried to do was absolutely killed

436
00:31:43,979 --> 00:31:47,889
by these people who are trying

437
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:51,979
to make this vegetarianism as a big religion.

438
00:31:52,949 --> 00:31:57,929
Also another thing was that this vegetarianism

439
00:31:57,989 --> 00:32:01,899
came into Jainism through one fellow called Neminath

440
00:32:01,969 --> 00:32:06,949
who was a tirthankar at the time of Shri Krishna.

441
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:10,089
He was to be married. In those days they were married,

442
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:13,109
not only but they were eating all kinds of meats

443
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:18,059
and so many lambs and goats came for the wedding of this man

444
00:32:18,889 --> 00:32:22,889
so he felt that - uparati we call it, this:

445
00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:26,109
he didn't like it, he was disgusted, he was frustrated with that.

446
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:28,929
With that frustration what did he do?

447
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:32,949
He said, "I will not eat meat."

448
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:36,889
And that's how vegetarianism started among Jainies.

449
00:32:36,969 --> 00:32:39,079
And that's how it's still going on,

450
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:42,109
 and these Jainies I find are the joyless people,

451
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,079
absolutely joyless.

452
00:32:44,979 --> 00:32:48,019
They're so much fond of money, they run after the money

453
00:32:48,089 --> 00:32:52,009
and they go on behaving in such a peculiar way

454
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:54,019
that you can't understand, I mean they are

455
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,069
human beings but the way they behave you can't

456
00:32:57,899 --> 00:32:58,979
understand them, they're not normal people.

457
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:02,039
So we realize

458
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:05,019
that despite all that Mahavira worked out,

459
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:12,939
still the people are supposed to be His disciples,

460
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:15,099
they are Jains, and they are like this.

461
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,899
So what we have to do now is to understand

462
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:23,009
that in Sahaja Yoga we'd better not do something of that kind.

463
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:27,919
Whatever you are told, you have to understand why it is so,

464
00:33:27,979 --> 00:33:29,109
you know the modus operandi,

465
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:31,879
you know each and everything about Sahaja Yoga.

466
00:33:31,949 --> 00:33:33,079
You know the whole subject

467
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,039
so it's not proper for you to in any way,

468
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:39,929
to succumb to any such arguments

469
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:42,099
or any such big, big talks or big, big

470
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:46,929
advertisement and take to something that is wrong.

471
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:48,889
It's very important.

472
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:54,009
We are Sahaja Yogis and we understand the balance.

473
00:33:54,089 --> 00:33:58,029
Of course I always say that Westerners for example,

474
00:33:58,089 --> 00:33:59,939
maybe Australians also,

475
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:03,019
should take more to carbohydrates because they eat a lot of meat.

476
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:05,909
So they can take to carbohydrates,

477
00:34:05,969 --> 00:34:08,119
but that doesn't mean vegetarianism by any chance.

478
00:34:08,939 --> 00:34:10,119
I mean, to compensate.

479
00:34:10,939 --> 00:34:13,969
And in India I always say they must take to more meats,

480
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:16,059
as will do, do them good.

481
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,899
But then by no means I say that you just eat meat and nothing else.

482
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:23,079
But a balance has to be found out,

483
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:25,019
and once you strike it

484
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:29,929
then you'll be surprised that you'll feel so relaxed, so much better,

485
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,079
so much enlightened

486
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:36,019
and the vibrations will flow much better than normally.

487
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,939
So for food, you have to be careful.

488
00:34:38,999 --> 00:34:40,109
Same about with clothes

489
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:44,089
that you shouldn't go mad after a suit all the time

490
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:47,069
whether it's hot or cold or indifferent.

491
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:51,059
What you have to do is to wear something that will suit you.

492
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,119
Now for example, in a climate like this

493
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:57,029
you may require a suit or something to cover yourself,

494
00:34:57,089 --> 00:34:59,899
but supposing you are in Ganapatipule

495
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:03,089
or some place like that where it's not so cold

496
00:35:03,909 --> 00:35:06,099
or so hot, maybe it's dry.

497
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:09,929
So what sort of a dress you should wear which is comfortable,

498
00:35:09,999 --> 00:35:11,019
that should be found out.

499
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:12,939
And whatever you find out

500
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:15,039
that this is such a comfortable dress for us,

501
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:16,999
you'd better do it.

502
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:22,889
Because what I have seen in many - you see, it's a thing that

503
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:24,929
whenever I tell you something,

504
00:35:25,009 --> 00:35:27,009
don't take it to the extremes

505
00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:29,009
and don't take a little bit of it.

506
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:32,119
But when I tell you this thing, you must understand

507
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:35,949
that whatever is good for you,

508
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:40,899
whatever is your temperament, whatever is aptitude,

509
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:44,059
you have to take something that will nourish that,

510
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:47,119
that will improve you and give you a balance.

511
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:50,999
So to balance yourself, if you think of Mahavira

512
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:54,969
you must think also of Shri Hanumana,

513
00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:57,119
both these things are important.

514
00:35:57,939 --> 00:36:00,099
It's not easy to tell all about Mahavira in this short lecture,

515
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:05,999
but I think I have quite connected Him now with Sahaj,

516
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:09,939
and you must have seen to it that how important He is

517
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:11,989
and what an important role He plays.

518
00:36:13,009 --> 00:36:14,969
So May God bless you.

519
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:18,999
Just start thinking about Mahavira I just,

520
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:21,999
it's impossible to keep into the conscious mind,

521
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:24,099
it's just going into the left all the time.

522
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:27,979
Because I just in the car thought I'd better think about Mahavira

523
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:31,909
and since then it's all going towards the left, it's so difficult.

524
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:33,929
But it will work out.

525
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:56,109
May God bless you!

526
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,999
Terrible thing this left side is.

527
00:37:08,899 --> 00:37:11,979
I think if you have any problems you must ask Me also,

528
00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:14,879
because this is the only time

529
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,919
when we can talk about things.

530
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:20,009
If you have any problems you can ask Me, about left side:

531
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:25,069
how to correct it,

532
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:28,949
how to work it out, anything. Please ask Me.

533
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:33,919
Because you always get this problem.

534
00:37:49,949 --> 00:37:53,099
What's it? Can't hear.

535
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,079
A yogi asks about the feeling

536
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:05,979
of pins and needles and the left heart

537
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:19,999
Now heart as I told you is the reflection of God Almighty,

538
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:21,999
which is the Spirit.

539
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:27,899
So we have two types of heart troubles as I told you before also.

540
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:33,049
One is, is when you have a overactive life, right-sided,

541
00:38:33,899 --> 00:38:36,039
and the left-sided is the lethargic heart

542
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:38,019
when you get angina and all that.

543
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:40,899
Now in your case, your case where you feel

544
00:38:40,899 --> 00:38:44,919
there is something pricking you,  that means it's a possession.

545
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:49,909
If the hands are, sort of pins and needles

546
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:51,949
then it's kind of possession.

547
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,019
But it can be cleared out.

548
00:39:03,029 --> 00:39:04,959
Any other question?

549
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:07,979
Can You say something about left Nabhi, Mother?

550
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:11,019
That's a different area, though

551
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:16,899
left Nabhi comes from the relationship

552
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:19,009
between a wife and a husband mostly.

553
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:24,939
But a wife who is a complaining type, is very sort of a,

554
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:29,909
all the time grudging,

555
00:39:29,979 --> 00:39:32,069
very nervous and bothers the husband,

556
00:39:32,879 --> 00:39:35,949
frightened and all sorts of things that they do.

557
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:39,119
You see just sometimes they do it just to trouble the husband,

558
00:39:39,939 --> 00:39:41,039
but sometimes basically

559
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:43,989
they are very left-sided, possessed women.

560
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:54,109
And these possessed women give you this left Nabhi.

561
00:39:54,949 --> 00:39:56,929
Any woman who feels the left Nabhi,

562
00:39:56,999 --> 00:40:00,109
she must immediately understand that there's some sort of

563
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:05,019
a horrible thing in her being which has to go out.

564
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:09,079
So for left Nabhi you must take to three candle treatment

565
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:14,899
and try to respect your husband, try to be kind to him.

566
00:40:14,969 --> 00:40:17,889
Because these spirits can also dominate,

567
00:40:17,969 --> 00:40:21,029
you know, not that, they can make you very sly,

568
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:24,059
they can also dominate, they have a way of dominating.

569
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:27,909
So in any case it looks as if a woman

570
00:40:27,989 --> 00:40:29,889
might look to be right-sided,

571
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:31,999
but actually she's suffering from left Nabhi

572
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:34,059
and she's extremely dominating.

573
00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:37,119
In the same way, if the husband is not a good man

574
00:40:37,949 --> 00:40:40,969
and he tortures the wife and she feels unhappy about it

575
00:40:41,029 --> 00:40:42,929
and she's sorry about it,

576
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:45,059
then also she catches the left Nahbi.

577
00:40:45,889 --> 00:40:47,999
So in both cases one has to understand

578
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:50,999
that you get your joy,

579
00:40:51,069 --> 00:40:54,089
 the source of joy is your Self, your own spirit.

580
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,989
It doesn't depend on your husband or anyone,

581
00:40:57,049 --> 00:40:58,949
you are single that way.

582
00:40:59,029 --> 00:41:02,009
So you shouldn't worry about your husband,

583
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,079
you shouldn't think how he treats you,

584
00:41:04,889 --> 00:41:06,979
you shouldn't bother at all about him.

585
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:09,969
But what you have to think is that "After all, I'm his wife,

586
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:12,089
I should support him, I should help him.

587
00:41:12,909 --> 00:41:14,049
Whatever way he is,

588
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:16,929
let him be as he is,

589
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:19,909
because he won't get corrected even if I tell him.

590
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:22,349
So the best thing is I'd better not tell him anything.

591
00:41:22,374 --> 00:41:24,069
Let him do whatever he likes."

592
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:30,029
And you clear out your left Nahbi with the candle.

593
00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:32,069
That's the way.

594
00:41:39,939 --> 00:41:42,989
All right, we'll get the children to wash My feet now.

595
00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:48,929
It's so very difficult, left side is still there. I'm just...

596
00:41:50,009 --> 00:41:51,069
Hello.

597
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:56,969
You all get to come here to wash My feet – all right?

598
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:58,969
So beautiful!

599
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:08,909
Mantras

600
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:21,899
Ganesha Sthuthi

601
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:31,959
Who knows all the Ganesha Sthuthi to be sung?

602
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:34,909
Or you know Atharva Sheersh?

603
00:42:53,879 --> 00:42:55,899
Because Ganesha is the One, you see,

604
00:42:55,899 --> 00:42:57,879
who is sitting on Mooladhara,

605
00:42:57,879 --> 00:43:01,919
and it is He who is the One who puts you onto the left side.

606
00:43:01,919 --> 00:43:03,919
He throws you all the time.

607
00:43:04,909 --> 00:43:08,959
And it is Mahavira who tries to save you and to correct you.

608
00:43:09,959 --> 00:43:12,909
So there are two forces working.

609
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:27,009
Take this.

610
00:50:13,989 --> 00:50:16,899
He says he has got the names of Bhairavanath,

611
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:18,039
so it’s very good.

612
00:50:18,889 --> 00:50:20,059
So you can come and wash My hands,

613
00:50:20,899 --> 00:50:22,109
those who are leaders here.

614
00:50:22,959 --> 00:50:26,109
Leaders! Big joke about them!

615
00:50:33,999 --> 00:50:37,899
Somebody should come here to put all the things.

616
00:50:39,099 --> 00:50:40,979
Who can do it?

617
00:51:26,529 --> 00:51:28,529
Now what – somebody?

618
00:51:28,554 --> 00:51:30,534
One by one you can come and put the water in.

619
00:51:34,029 --> 00:51:35,939
Just put the water.

620
00:51:54,099 --> 00:51:56,979
No, no, not the … You have to do it.

621
00:51:59,979 --> 00:52:01,939
Now, one by one, come along.

622
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:12,069
First of all is the honey. Call him.

623
00:53:40,989 --> 00:53:42,979
Take that one. This other one. …

624
00:53:47,999 --> 00:53:49,099
We need you again. …

625
00:53:53,159 --> 00:53:56,452
Be careful. It should not touch your fingers …

626
00:53:56,969 --> 00:53:58,119
What is, this is clean?…

627
00:54:00,919 --> 00:54:02,069
I thought it was …

628
00:54:53,049 --> 00:54:55,019
From Melbourne, somebody can come …

629
00:55:01,909 --> 00:55:03,021
What is that?

630
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:23,889
These are the Ida Nadi names.

631
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:40,879
Unmarried girls.

632
01:06:43,909 --> 01:06:45,959
With this finger you do like that, on both the sides.

633
01:06:48,889 --> 01:06:49,989
Debbie, come and do it.

634
01:06:57,969 --> 01:07:00,969
Yes, it’s all right.

635
01:07:03,879 --> 01:07:07,049
Just beyond that. Just put the line like that.

636
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:03,979
This side. It’s to be done like this.

637
01:10:06,949 --> 01:10:09,019
And on the back.

638
01:10:11,919 --> 01:10:14,949
You then have to put it under My, on the sole.

639
01:10:16,989 --> 01:10:19,079
You can move all the things.

640
01:10:21,009 --> 01:10:23,919
Are you doing on this side as well?

641
01:10:26,909 --> 01:10:30,019
Also down there. You have to complete as well.

642
01:10:33,009 --> 01:10:34,959
That’s all done.

643
01:10:51,099 --> 01:10:55,039
To the line, up to the line you have to do the same thing.

644
01:10:57,959 --> 01:11:01,889
Whole thing up there. Yes. All right. And more.

645
01:11:18,929 --> 01:11:22,099
Just to the line, you just do that.

646
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,979
That’s good.

647
01:11:32,939 --> 01:11:34,899
Still complete it.

648
01:11:38,009 --> 01:11:40,879
Yes, correct. Yes, that’s it.

649
01:11:48,919 --> 01:11:51,949
I mean, whatever you’ve put, more of that.

650
01:11:54,039 --> 01:11:57,979
That’s it. That’s correct.

651
01:12:06,939 --> 01:12:09,949
Now, I mean, extra that you have on My fingers –

652
01:12:09,949 --> 01:12:11,069
on My toes, just take it out.

653
01:12:28,999 --> 01:12:31,909
Now, can you get some married ladies also?

654
01:12:47,929 --> 01:12:50,049
Too much. With your hands, take it out.

655
01:12:51,099 --> 01:12:54,949
That’s better. Take this also.

656
01:12:56,009 --> 01:13:00,059
Be careful. Don’t spoil the line. Don’t spoil the line.

657
01:13:01,989 --> 01:13:06,899
This line you should not spoil.

658
01:13:11,079 --> 01:13:14,949
Yes, be careful. It’s all right.

659
01:13:48,919 --> 01:13:50,929
There’s so much to be done.

660
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:55,939
There’s a sari here. Just wipe your hand on this ….

661
01:14:08,009 --> 01:14:10,069
Now, what you can do is to get the sari.

662
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:25,979
Brought the sari?

663
01:16:05,879 --> 01:16:07,959
Take it down there. All right.

664
01:16:13,059 --> 01:16:15,959
Call one of them, who are other assisting, in front.

665
01:16:17,019 --> 01:16:18,109
The girls have to sit here.

666
01:16:31,939 --> 01:16:34,889
Yes, this one … Give it to her, with a …

667
01:16:40,059 --> 01:16:43,039
You can take that coconut.

668
01:18:19,979 --> 01:18:21,089
Bangles.

669
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:17,919
You see, there are small and big.

670
01:19:20,909 --> 01:19:22,919
because it’s two-and-a-half …

671
01:20:52,009 --> 01:20:53,919
Better let them come now.

672
01:20:56,949 --> 01:20:58,039
They have to come.

673
01:21:05,939 --> 01:21:07,999
You have to do the sari.

674
01:31:59,019 --> 01:32:01,089
Now you have to organise these flowers, under My feet,

675
01:32:02,099 --> 01:32:04,099
but all the white under My feet,

676
01:32:04,979 --> 01:32:06,089
ones on the side …

677
01:32:16,949 --> 01:32:20,089
So you put all the white, and I’ll put My feet afterwards.

678
01:32:43,109 --> 01:32:45,019
Now the light colors, like pink.

679
01:40:09,049 --> 01:40:10,929
Leaders …

680
01:47:31,879 --> 01:47:33,979
Namaskar …

681
01:47:49,009 --> 01:47:52,979
May God bless you all. May God bless you.

682
01:48:03,899 --> 01:48:06,029
See how everything is quiet.

683
01:48:07,889 --> 01:48:09,899
Just before Aarti it started raining,

684
01:48:10,029 --> 01:48:13,879
and now see … beautiful. All right.

685
01:48:28,019 --> 01:48:34,019
You take a photograph of My feet? Just leave this …
