1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:09,120
I told you yesterday how you feel your\h
seeking, why you feel your seeking,\h\h

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,400
what is in us that works out this seeking.

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,480
And this yoga is spontaneous.

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,680
There is no other way you\h
can get your Realisation.

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,080
Because if you have to germinate\h
a seed it has to have germination!\h\h

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,640
In the same way, if you are to be\h
germinated into your new awareness,\h\h

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:48,080
it has to be through your awakening of\h
Kundalini, because that is what it is there for.

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,280
If you have to plug in this one (microphone)\h
to the mains, you have to use the chord,\h\h

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,840
there’s no other way about it.

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,960
As I told you yesterday that this beautiful\h
instrument is made, all the effort has been put.

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,000
You have passed through — how much, much\h
we calculated for thirty-five crores?

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,600
Yogi: Three hundred and fifty million.

13
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,360
Shri Mataji: Three hundred and\h
fifty-million types of lives.

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,480
And now you have become a human being.

15
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,840
So, after all, there must be some meaning\h
to this beautiful human structure,\h\h

16
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,840
this instrument [and] why it was created.

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,840
There must be some reason for it.

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:50,320
And, as you have got your human Realisation,\h
as you have got your human body,\h\h

19
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:00,880
if you have to get to a more evolved personality\h
it has to be spontaneous, you cannot work it out.

20
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,360
Should be a simple logic.

21
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:14,720
You have done nothing to be a human being\h
and you are not to do anything to be higher.

22
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,800
But maybe you have harmed yourself a little\h
bit, perhaps, by doing something wrong.

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,200
And whatever wrong you have done to yourself also\h
can be corrected if the seed has to germinate.

24
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,880
You are made like that, God has\h
made you specially for this purpose.

25
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,760
He has made you from an\h
amoeba, from a carbon atom.

26
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,720
Whether you believe in Him or not doesn’t matter.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,960
But if you see yourself, whosoever\h\h

28
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:03,840
achieved this human body and human\h
mind must have been a fantastic artist.

29
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,600
And it has been said that, if you\h
had left it to the Law of Chance,\h\h

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,760
you could not have even produced a\h
small, little uni-cellular amoeba.

31
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,640
So, in such a short time as that,\h\h

32
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,720
if such a complex thing like Human Being\h
is created, there is a General behind it.

33
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:32,160
Whether you believe it or not, that’s not\h
important, the thing is, it exists, and it works.

34
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,560
Now within us we have this instrument placed.

35
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,280
This very, very subtle\h
instrument is placed with us.

36
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:59,920
Now I will tell you about the Kundalini – how\h
it works and what the different chakras are.

37
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,040
These are all very subtle\h
centres as I told you yesterday.

38
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,640
We cannot see them with your naked eyes,\h
but when the Kundalini starts rising,\h\h

39
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,000
when it starts ascending, then you can see with\h
your naked eyes the pulsation of the Kundalini,\h\h

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,400
and the pulsation at these chakras.

41
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,040
Till it reaches here, you\h
can feel the pulsation here\h\h

42
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,680
and till it is pulsating you\h
do not get your Realisation.

43
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,480
Once the pulsation stops then you must know that\h
it has ended into that All-pervading Divine power.

44
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,960
When that happens then you start\h
feeling that cool breeze in your hand.

45
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,520
You start feeling a cool\h
radiation passing through you.

46
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,800
That is the radiation of the\h
Holy Spirit within yourself.

47
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:59,200
That is the radiation you are feeling from\h
your Spirit that resides in your heart.You\h\h

48
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,120
can also feel your centres on your\h
fingers because now they are enlightened.

49
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,160
Now all this, whatever I am telling\h
you, you can feel and verify.

50
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,200
The time has come for you to\h
verify everything that I say.

51
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:23,360
It has been said before, thousands of years\h
back, that within us lies the Kundalini.

52
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:32,080
Adi Shankaracharya, sixth century, he said it\h
very, very clearly, openly, that there is this\h\h

53
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,080
residual power which is awaiting in the triangular\h
bone as you see there, in three and a half coils,\h\h

54
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,120
which ultimately awakens and gives you\h
your Realisation, your second birth.

55
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,000
He had described it very clearly,\h
all the other centres also.

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,040
But even much before, much, much\h
before that, thousands of years back,\h\h

57
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,080
people have been working on the Kundalini\h
awakening, but it was kept a secret.

58
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:12,480
They started working on few people as we\h
also, in our scientific research, first use it\h\h

59
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:19,120
in a very guarded secret, try to find out\h
the different ways and methods and then,\h\h

60
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:29,200
when it becomes absolutely perfect, then we make\h
it public and make it known to all of the people.

61
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:36,480
Because unless and until any discovery is\h
useful to the masses it has no meaning.

62
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,880
Today the time has come for you to know all\h
about it and that’s why now, here in Brighton,\h\h

63
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,120
we are discussing it so openly\h
and trying to understand it.

64
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,920
Now here, as you have seen,\h
in the triangular bone,\h\h

65
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,160
is the Kundalini – three and a half coiled energy.

66
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,040
This energy is pure energy of desire of God.

67
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,200
It is His desire which is\h
within you, lying dormant.

68
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,920
His desire has been throughout in His\h
whole Creation that He should create\h\h

69
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,080
His own children who will understand\h
Him [and] when they understand Him,\h\h

70
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,440
to give them all His powers for them to manifest.

71
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,200
For them to enter into His Kingdom and to\h
reside in complete bliss and happiness.

72
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,720
That He is the Collective Being, He is\h
the macrocosm and you are the microcosm.

73
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,840
That you are cells in the big body, and\h
these cells are to be awakened and have to\h\h

74
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:52,880
become one with the Whole, by which you get\h
your understanding of the Collective Being.

75
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,840
The Collective Being is conscious of\h
you but you are not conscious of That.

76
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,200
And that’s how the whole device was\h
made within you — how you are going\h\h

77
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,600
to get it and how you are going to achieve it.

78
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,640
You can see there are three lines which\h
are placed parallel to each other.

79
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,800
The first blue line depicts the power to\h
desire — is the emotional side it looks after.

80
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,840
This is manifested outside as\h
left sympathetic nervous system.

81
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,480
Now the doctors do not know that the left\h
and right sympathetic nervous systems\h\h

82
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,560
are there for doing two different types of work.

83
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,040
So the Left Side is the power by which you desire,\h\h

84
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:53,840
is the energy by which you get yourself\h
conditioned, by which you live in the past.

85
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,840
This channel is called in the\h
Sanskrit language as ‘Ida Nadi’.

86
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,200
The Right Side channel which you\h
see there, yellow coloured channel,\h\h

87
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:13,680
is the power by which you create, by which\h
you can go to future, you think of the future.

88
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,840
This is the one by which you plan for the future.

89
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,720
This is the one with which you do your physical\h
things, which you want to do for future also.

90
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,880
All sorts of future planning for your physical,\h
mental and your financial, or any such lives,\h\h

91
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,960
is done through this energy of yours,\h
which is on the right hand side,\h\h

92
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,880
which is called, this channel is\h
called, as the Pingala Channel.

93
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,800
Now the colours are of the left side is the\h\h

94
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,280
deep blue colour, as you see\h
there, actually amounting to black.

95
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,120
And the one which is on the right\h
hand side is the yellow colour.

96
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:04,240
Now when these two energies start working within\h
us, means one is of desiring another is of action.

97
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,960
First we desire something\h
and then we go into action.

98
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,080
When these two energies start working\h\h

99
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,080
we produce a bi-product in our\h
head like the fumes in a factory.

100
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,280
The fumes are called as ego and\h
super-ego, as you see them crossed over.

101
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:28,880
When you use the blue side, which is the\h
desire, or iccha shakti as they call it,\h\h

102
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:36,400
then you develop a super-ego and when you\h
work on the right side, you develop the ego.

103
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,560
To understand ego and super-ego\h
in a very simple way, is this way,\h\h

104
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,680
that, say when a child is nursed by the\h
mother, he is in complete bliss and joy.

105
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,880
So the mother changes the sides for the\h
boy, the child, and he feels very much hurt.

106
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,320
When he feels hurt his ego rises, he\h
thinks, “Why should she do it?” you see,\h\h

107
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,520
in a very subtle way, and the ego starts rising.

108
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,480
This is the ego, which you see there,\h
starts rising on the right hand side.

109
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,920
I mean there is nothing wrong in\h
having ego, you have to have it.

110
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,200
It works out that way.

111
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,440
As every factory has to have a chimney,\h\h

112
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,000
you don’t have a chimney so it\h
accumulates there in the head.

113
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,960
On the left hand side, when\h
the child wants something,\h\h

114
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,800
or he’s told not to do this, the mother says,\h
“Don’t do like that!” So you are conditioned.

115
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,560
By that conditioning your super-ego is developed.

116
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,080
When your ego is hurt I\h
would say, your ego develops.

117
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,080
When your desire is hurt\h
then your super-ego develops.

118
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,840
Gradually we start identifying\h
ourselves with our ego\h\h

119
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,040
or super-ego depending on what\h
sort of a personality you are.

120
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,880
Some people think that, “I do\h
this!” “I am this!” you see.

121
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,000
Some of them are frightened,\h
“No, it’s too aggressive."

122
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,640
But whatever it may be, either\h
you have ego or super-ego.

123
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,920
Both of them develop just like\h
this as you see in the thing,\h\h

124
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,280
and if one becomes more heavy\h
then it pushes down the other one.

125
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,320
If this becomes more heavy\h
it pushes down this way.

126
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,840
Now for Kundalini to pass in between\h
you have to have a space like that.

127
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:31,040
If a person is of an imbalanced personality, then\h
Kundalini takes time to rise, She takes time.

128
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,640
Now you can see the centre below\h
the Kundalini, which is a very,\h\h

129
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:44,000
very important centre, we must know,\h
about which I have to tell you, in short.

130
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,320
This is the centre which is\h
lying below the Kundalini.

131
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,840
It’s not above.

132
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,680
That means when the Kundalini pierces through\h
other centres it is not pierced through.

133
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,160
But why is he there?

134
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,120
Why is it there?

135
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,840
It is there to give information to the Kundalini.

136
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,480
It is the instrument which receives all the\h
information as to what you are doing, what\h\h

137
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,000
are you up to, what are your desires, what you\h
are doing, what sort of people you are meeting,\h\h

138
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,920
where you are going, what mistakes you are\h
committing, what good things you are committing.

139
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,680
Everything is recorded in that Kundalini,\h
not only of this lifetime, but of many lives.

140
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,320
Its collection of all that you have had\h
with you is inside the Kundalini, recorded.

141
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,840
Kundalini knows what you have been.

142
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:43,200
So this little thing that you see there is the\h
centre which lies very near the prostate gland\h\h

143
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,680
and is the one who generates innocence within us.

144
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,080
If you are innocent, you are like a child,\h
your Kundalini shoots off just like that,\h\h

145
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,200
no problem! But if you are complicated\h
then it takes time because the\h\h

146
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,640
gentleman sitting there on that\h
centre, informs the Kundalini that,\h\h

147
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,480
“No, still he has to take time, he’s not all\h
right, there’s something wrong with him."

148
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,080
That’s why this innocence is to be preserved\h\h

149
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,200
and those who have not been able to preserve\h
their innocence find it rather difficult.

150
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,080
But, after Realisation, you’ll be surprised,\h
those who have lost their innocence get it back.

151
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,360
That’s the only way you can\h
get back your innocence.

152
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,480
It’s most surprising that after Realisation\h
you get the same innocence that you had before,\h\h

153
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,280
and you start enjoying that\h
innocence within yourself.

154
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,960
So this is the centre of innocence within us.

155
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,440
Now we have innocence, but who can tell?

156
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,320
Which doctor can say, or psychologist can say\h
where is this innocence that is coming to us?

157
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,720
It exists in that part.

158
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,000
Now, we’ll take the third centre,\h
which is very important, within us,\h\h

159
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,680
is called as the Nabhi Chakra, which is\h
the navel point, about the navel point.

160
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,240
You cannot definitely say where\h
anybody’s chakras lie because that’s\h\h

161
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,320
not a definite thing, it’s an energy\h
which moves up and down a little bit.

162
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,960
But about at the back of the navel point.

163
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,160
And it manifests outside, what we\h
call the solar plexus, in the gross.

164
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:31,440
This centre, the centre that is in the Nabhi, is\h
the navel, is responsible for all our seeking.

165
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:40,000
We started when we were just amoebas you can call.

166
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,160
That time our seeking was only for food.

167
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,400
Then it grew up within us as we grew up.

168
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:52,880
At human level we have seeking for food, of\h
course, we have got seeking for possessions,\h\h

169
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:01,840
money, we have got seeking for power, political\h
or any way, and also we have got seeking for God.

170
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,160
This starts manifesting in a human being alone.

171
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:17,600
This seeking of God starts when a person\h
starts realising, or seeing, that there must be\h\h

172
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:25,280
something beyond, there must be something which is\h
fulfilling, something that is really satisfying.

173
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,360
And he starts finding that\h
absolute point, from where there is\h\h

174
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:44,800
no need to return, where there is no disgust,\h
where there is no frustration, disappointment.

175
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,640
And such a point resides within\h
us in our heart as the Spirit.

176
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,840
We call it Atma in Sanskrit language.

177
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:03,840
This Spirit in the heart is the witness:\h
which witnesses us, which looks after us.

178
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,440
But we are not we are not conscious of it.

179
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,640
That means the Spirit is not flowing in our,\h\h

180
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,320
is not radiating in our, central nervous\h
system, that we are not conscious of it.

181
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:23,120
We know there is someone, we know someone\h
inside is there, we’re aware of it, in a way,\h\h

182
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,920
but it is not flowing through our conscious\h
mind, through our central nervous system.

183
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,080
And this is what is the seeking for.

184
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,680
We are seeking our Spirit.

185
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,240
As I have told you yesterday, that\h
you need not take me for granted.

186
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,240
You should treat it as a hypothesis and sit\h
here with an open mind, as a scientist would\h\h

187
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,960
listen to something that is new.

188
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,920
Now the central, centre\h
point, which we call as Nabhi,\h\h

189
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:05,520
is connected to another point down below, which\h
you see there, is the centre of creativity.

190
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,240
This is the centre that creates.

191
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:17,360
And this has got six sub-plexuses,\h
which are manifested outside\h\h

192
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,920
and the plexus which is gross, is called as aortic\h
plexus and it also has got six sub-plexuses.

193
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:32,720
In the spiritual language we do not say that\h
these are sub-plexuses but we say these are the\h\h

194
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,680
six petals of the lotus of Swadishthana chakra.

195
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,480
This works out the Right Side creative\h\h

196
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,800
power, as you can see it, that\h
through it is connected to the brain.

197
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,720
Now the centre one is the\h
one which is very important,\h\h

198
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,120
which gives you the idea that there\h
is a gap between you and the Absolute.

199
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,440
And that gap is shown here as that\h
green coloured Void, all that.

200
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:16,880
Above that is the channel which is\h
responsible for what we have achieved so far\h\h

201
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,800
up to the human level.

202
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,760
Whatever has come into our conscious\h
mind, up to the human level,\h\h

203
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,480
is expressed by that channel which is\h
broken, and that gap we have to cover.

204
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,200
Once we cover that gap we have finished with our\h
evolution and we are there where we have to be.

205
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,760
We have found out our use, we\h
have found out our meaning.

206
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,720
We become that.

207
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,120
This higher one, the one that is within us,\h\h

208
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:54,080
is manifested, and is called as parasympathetic\h
nervous system in the medical terminology.

209
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,440
And also the broken, these\h\h

210
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,560
parts, though these centres are there and\h
that is also a part of the parasympathetic.

211
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,280
So we have these three energies shown here.

212
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:19,840
The one which is for our desire, the another for\h
our action, and the central one for our evolution.

213
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,160
That means in our awareness we\h
have reached a certain point.

214
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,080
For example there is a big difference between\h
animals and human beings in their awareness.

215
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,560
We sometimes condemn ourselves very much\h
and think animals are better than us,\h\h

216
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:40,400
because they are not that much messed up maybe;\h
or they may not be in such a problems as we are.

217
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,760
Because we are free, we can\h
think, we can understand,\h\h

218
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,840
we are much more sensitive than they are.

219
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,800
But if you ask any animal how does\h
he feel about the smell of a part,\h\h

220
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,560
he’s moving in the dirtiest lane, he\h
doesn’t feel disturbed at all, but we are.

221
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,720
He’s not bothered about what kind\h
of colours and forms you have.

222
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,640
He can live with any colour combination,\h\h

223
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:12,160
with any kind of horrid aesthetic mistakes\h
people must have made in that stable of his.

224
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:17,040
He can live in there very happily, as long as\h
he gets his food, he’s perfectly all right!

225
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,160
So our evolution has brought us to a\h
point where we have become much subtler,\h\h

226
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,840
much more sensitive and understanding.

227
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,920
And when we are more understanding\h
and there is a gap, you become\h\h

228
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,440
tensed up, “Oh, this must be covered!” You\h
are also aware that your energy is exhausted.

229
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,840
You are spending your energy through\h
your sympathetic nervous system.

230
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,040
Both of them they play, by your\h
desiring and by your action.

231
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,560
When it is exhausted it is like the petrol in a\h
car, if it gets exhausted, you also get tensed up.

232
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,200
In the same way, you get tensed up and you\h
don’t understand what to do with your tension.

233
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,440
Then to release it you take to tranquillisers,\h
you take to other things, escapes in life.

234
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,680
All these escapes work out\h
because you are so tensed up.

235
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,760
That tension comes to you because of\h
the ego and super-ego in your head.

236
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,280
It can be so strongly tensed up [that] you\h
can get both the things overlapping each other\h\h

237
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,160
and it can be extremely\h
painful also for some people.

238
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:32,160
And when such things happen you go for\h
your relaxation, you try all these things.

239
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,360
But still it’s not opened out as yet.

240
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,480
It has to open out.

241
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,920
This gap has to be covered.

242
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,440
And this gap only can be covered\h
through the Kundalini awakening.

243
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,160
Now once people come to know that, “Yes, Kundalini\h
awakening is the only way one has to do."

244
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,960
All right, so they bring out a circus for you.

245
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,720
“We’ll do the Kundalini awakening for you!”\h\h

246
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,480
“We’ll give you Self-realisation, we’ll\h
give you this, we’ll give you that."

247
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,600
They promise you things.

248
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,840
But it is the happening that is important.

249
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,840
This they do for making money maybe,\h
because they want to have power,\h\h

250
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,040
because they are sadistic, maybe they are\h
satanic, because they want that you should\h\h

251
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,000
not get your Realisation, that they want\h
to kill all your chances of Realisation.

252
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,600
I don’t know what their purpose is.

253
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,640
But you have got this Kundalini\h
within you, which must be awakened,\h\h

254
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,840
and it can be awakened in thousands of people.

255
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,720
I have done that.

256
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,640
You can do it.

257
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:46,720
There is one gentleman who has given Realisation\h
to ten thousand people! Who is just very young,\h\h

258
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,880
and he has been moving from villages to villages.

259
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:58,000
But you know as villagers are very simple people\h
and they cannot be enticed by any such things\h\h

260
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,880
which we call as elaborate\h
circusing (sic) about religion.

261
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,800
They know what it is.

262
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,880
They are too simple to believe\h
all this nonsense of complication.

263
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,520
So they know who is real and who is not.

264
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,840
Their sensitivity is very great\h
because they live with the nature.

265
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,320
And they can make out a person\h
who is real and who is unreal.

266
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:31,840
This third centre that you see here, or we can\h
say the fourth centre, is the centre of heart.

267
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,840
This centre of heart is the centre that\h\h

268
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,200
is responsible for giving you\h
security, is the centre of the Mother.

269
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,920
This gives you the sense of security.

270
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:52,400
When you feel insecure you must have seen that you\h
start breathing very fast, the breathing starts.

271
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,200
When you are a child till the age of twelve years,\h\h

272
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,440
all the anti-bodies are built-in, in the sternum\h
bone, which is here — you know the sternum bone?

273
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,120
Which is here — and these\h
anti-bodies are spread out\h\h

274
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:13,840
throughout, in the body, to fight any\h
invasion or attack on the personality.

275
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:20,800
These anti-bodies are actually as we would\h
say in Sahaj Yoga terminology, are the\h\h

276
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,600
armies of the Mother.

277
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,720
They are built up there, and this is the\h
centre of the Mother of the Universe.

278
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,840
Now the Deities we have on these centres\h
also I will tell you, one by one.

279
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:42,240
Here is the another centre which is called\h
as the Vishuddhi Chakra: is very important.

280
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,000
At this point man has raised\h
his head upward like that.

281
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:54,880
He has raised his head with new\h
aspirations, with new ideas.

282
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,320
When he raised his head only, he started\h
developing this ego and super-ego.

283
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,040
When the head was down below,\h
towards the Mother Earth,\h\h

284
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,960
this could not be developed because the\h
energy would pass into the Mother Earth.

285
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,160
But when you raised your head, like this,\h\h

286
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:20,320
then the ego and super-ego started developing very\h
fast, by which you developed your own personality.

287
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:30,800
The meeting of ego and super-ego cuts\h
you out from the All-pervading Power.

288
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,440
When you are a child, if you remember,\h\h

289
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,080
you had a very soft bone in the\h
fontanelle bone area, and suddenly\h\h

290
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:50,720
it becomes thick and thick and thick; ultimately\h
it becomes thick like a stone in some people.

291
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,640
Now this is the closing of the\h
door to the All-pervading Power.

292
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,480
Why it is done, why are you closed away from that:\h\h

293
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,840
because you are given your own\h
freedom, your own individuality.

294
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,280
You become Mr.

295
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,240
X, you become Mr.

296
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,360
Y, you become Mr.

297
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:18,320
Z, because you find out what is right and what\h
is wrong through your own experimentation.

298
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,440
You become independent.

299
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,120
Supposing I am making this instrument\h
(microphone): first I’ll have to test\h\h

300
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,680
this separately, then I’ll put it here, isn’t it?

301
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
In the same way you are separated.

302
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,800
And you start experimenting with good and bad.

303
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,960
You start understanding what\h
is good and what is bad.

304
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,440
Once you start discovering it, you\h
start taking to the right path.

305
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,520
But, as you have seen, human beings have\h
not been able to use their freedom properly.

306
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,160
Their sense of freedom has been very much changed.

307
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,800
And this changed attitude, or this\h
changed behaviour towards freedom,\h\h

308
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,200
is also due to freedom itself, because you are\h
free to choose whether you want good or bad.

309
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,640
And when this happens to you, that\h
you become independent and you start\h\h

310
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,200
choosing wrong things, then this becomes\h
even stronger and stronger and stronger.

311
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,880
So, now you have seen the\h
centres up to this point (Agnya).

312
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,840
This is the centre where, in the centre\h
of the brain, is the centre of Christ.

313
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:38,000
Is the centre where our pineal body\h
and our pituitary body, both are placed\h\h

314
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,560
in the optic chiasma, it is placed in such\h\h

315
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:47,360
a manner — it is very subtle — that it\h
controls your ego and super-ego, both.

316
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,000
And this centre is called as Agnya chakra.

317
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,920
And it has only two petals by which\h
you control your ego and super-ego.

318
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,800
On top of that, the centre you see\h
is the Sahasrar, is the last centre,\h\h

319
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,640
is of thousand petals and is\h
called as Sahasrar, meaning,\h\h

320
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:16,000
flow of the seven waterfalls, you can put\h
it like that, not seven [but] thousand.

321
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,600
Thousand is ‘sahast’ and ‘Sahasrar’\h
means: You can say, one thousand,\h\h

322
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,400
the flow of one thousand,\h
the flow of one thousand.

323
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,160
These are one thousand petals there.

324
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,520
You can see them.

325
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,880
Some people have seen them and you\h
can also see them within yourself.

326
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,053
They are placed in the brain and they cover\h
the limbic area which is the vacant area there,\h\h

327
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:51,120
is the limbic area which\h
is very important nowadays\h\h

328
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,320
because people have started\h
experimenting with limbic area.

329
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,760
When the Kundalini crosses that and\h
pierces this portion, this is the baptism.

330
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:07,680
Then you find this place becomes soft, and\h
suddenly you find the flow of Kundalini,\h\h

331
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,560
the flow of the Grace, coming into you,\h
when she pierces into the subtle thing.

332
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:19,360
Now there is this energy around us,\h
it exists, but we have to feel it.

333
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:19,999
We have not yet felt it that’s why we are lost,\h
that’s why we are confused, we have problems.

334
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:20,145
All our political problems are because\h
we are dealing with something relative.

335
00:30:20,146 --> 00:30:20,274
Same with our economics, same with\h
all our problems is that we are…

336
00:30:20,273 --> 00:30:20,310
(break in recording)

337
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:20,464
Now you are connected to the Absolute you\h
can ask any question to the Absolute and\h\h

338
00:30:20,464 --> 00:30:20,595
you get the answer on your fingers,\h
when your fingers are enlightened.

339
00:30:20,596 --> 00:30:20,692
And that’s how you know that you are enlightened.

340
00:30:20,692 --> 00:30:25,600
Then you start feeling yourself, and you feel you\h
have expanded very much, you have become alive\h\h

341
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,120
to yourself and to others, because you can start\h
feeling others also! Sitting down here you can\h\h

342
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,360
tell what’s happening in America to a particular\h
person if you just put your attention to it.

343
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:42,880
Because now your attention is\h
enlightened and that’s how you feel it.

344
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,200
The problem is it is too fantastic\h
to believe, really it is.

345
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,360
But supposing I make this place\h\h

346
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,840
extremely fantastic, and there is darkness,\h
you can’t see anything, and I tell you,\h\h

347
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,040
“Now it’s a fantastic place, you just come and\h
see for yourself how things start working there.

348
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,880
Every instrument is so nicely placed.

349
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,000
It starts working.

350
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,440
And you’ll get great results.

351
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,720
And you just come in and you switch on the light."

352
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,880
It works! Because it is built-in! And the whole\h\h

353
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,800
fantastic thing starts coming in\h
to you and you start seeing it.

354
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,760
Because it is inside it,\h
only the light has to come,\h\h

355
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,840
and once the light comes in you start seeing it.

356
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,480
So why should you blame anyone for\h
that or why should you be angry?

357
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,280
After all it is all done\h
for your joy and happiness.

358
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,840
It’s just a surprise I should say,\h\h

359
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,400
like a Father Christmas coming in\h
and delivering all the goods to you.

360
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,600
It’s all done before.

361
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,800
It’s all managed before.

362
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:49,200
Like we can say, first time I saw a\h
television, for example, a colour television.

363
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,320
And suddenly my husband, when he\h
brought it to me he said, “Oh,\h\h

364
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,160
you are going to see something very fantastic."

365
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,040
I said, “What?” I had never seen it before.

366
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,800
He said, “You can see the film show.

367
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,440
You can see everybody moving\h
in it!” I said, “Really?

368
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,280
In the room?” he said, “Yes, you can."

369
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,440
“Well how can that be?” “You\h
just wait and see! You just wait.

370
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,520
A minute is needed."

371
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,240
And he prepared me very nicely\h
to give me a big surprise.

372
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,160
He said, “You can see people\h
here, talking and everything."

373
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,040
And he just opened it, and to\h
my amazement it was working.

374
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,840
It was not connected to anything as\h
such, except for the electricity,\h\h

375
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,360
and the whole thing started working, and I\h
could see everything happening as he had said.

376
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,520
It was really fantastic, one could not believe it!\h
You start feeling it, “Really, it is true or not?”

377
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,640
First time I saw the telephone, in\h
India, absolutely when I was very young,\h\h

378
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,400
and I think, in our house it was\h
remarkable that we got the phone,\h\h

379
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,600
and were of the few, first people who\h
had the telephone, very few people.

380
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,920
And that was, when we got it you see.

381
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,800
We just couldn’t believe, “How can it be you\h
can talk to someone on the phone like that?

382
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,520
You can dial to someone and\h
talk?” Immediately we knew one\h\h

383
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,160
girl who had a telephone so we telephoned to her.

384
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,880
She was not allowed to touch the\h
phone and we telephoned to her.

385
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,760
The father said, “What?

386
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,720
You’ve got the telephone?

387
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,160
Now we’ve had it! And now you are\h
going to telephone to her!” She said,\h\h

388
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,960
“I had told you once, if you remember, that there\h
is an instrument like that on which you can speak.

389
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,440
But you never believed me.

390
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,720
Now see, there is a telephone, isn’t it?” Then we\h
had to believe it, because it was all done for us.

391
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,960
It was just to be connected\h
and we started seeing it.

392
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,920
That is the main thing is, that it is all done.

393
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,320
I have told you that three hundred and\h
fifty-million lives you have passed\h\h

394
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,760
through to get all this thing done\h
and fixed into it; this is built-in.

395
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,040
Now if it fantastic why not have it?

396
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,240
We don’t have to pay for it.

397
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,840
You cannot! What can you pay?

398
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,440
Can you pay for three hundred and fifty-million\h
times you have passed through various lives?

399
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,240
Can you pay for that?

400
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:05,840
Can you pay for that love\h
which made you a human being?

401
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,040
It is too fantastic the whole thing is.

402
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,800
And now what can we pay for it?

403
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,120
Only thing is to accept it and\h
take it and enjoy it, that’s all.

404
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,520
We can’t think, in modern times, that there could\h
be someone who just invites you for nothing,\h\h

405
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,520
gives you everything for nothing and\h
enjoys only the giving part of it.

406
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,680
We just can’t think of such a beautiful person.

407
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,440
That’s why people are frightened.

408
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,120
You invite them, they are frightened, “Why,\h\h

409
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,400
what is it?” “Because I am dealing with\h
some and something — must be that."

410
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,000
We never trust.

411
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,080
It is true, because we have\h
had very bad experiences.

412
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,840
But we have [also] had people\h
like Christ who gave his life.

413
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:56,640
Today is very important — because we have started\h
the week where he gave his life — to think of him.

414
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:04,160
Will there be anyone like that who would sacrifice\h
his life to say something that is the Truth?

415
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,480
He gave his life for Truth.

416
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,400
For what?

417
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:08,960
Why did he?

418
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:19,920
Because the giving has much more joy,\h
much more bliss than anything else.

419
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,320
If you reach that state of giving,\h
you will also enjoy giving.

420
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,880
That has to happen.

421
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:34,800
We have to discover that beauty within us\h
which enjoys giving, which enjoys generosity,\h\h

422
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,400
which enjoys fearlessness, which enjoys all\h
the virtues of the world that reside within us.

423
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,680
We have to just go deep down into ourselves.

424
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,000
And it’s all done for you, it’s all done.

425
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,560
It is there.

426
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,160
So I think we should go in for\h
the experience, that’s the best.

427
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,440
Because what’s the use of\h
talking about it all the time.

428
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:02,240
You see, the cake, if I have made\h
it, better have it hot and enjoy it.

429
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,920
So many of them have enjoyed, and I\h
want all the new people should enjoy.

430
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,520
Because as I told you yesterday,\h
you cannot give me anything.

431
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,040
I don’t need anything.

432
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,120
I’ve not come here to do Sahaj Yoga.

433
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:21,120
I’ve come in London because my husband\h
got posted here and that’s how I am here.

434
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,320
I should say it’s your own calling that I am here.

435
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,520
So you are not to give anything\h
to me, nothing is needed.

436
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,640
Only thing is: accept it and just enjoy it.

437
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,200
It’s a gift.

438
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,240
It’s a gift that you deserve, it’s your own right.

439
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,200
You are the son of God and\h
you have to become that.

440
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,600
May God bless you all.

441
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:53,840
Let’s have the experience.

442
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,320
Now, if you have any questions\h
you can ask questions.

443
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,680
No harm in asking questions.

444
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,800
But I would say that first have the experience\h
and then ask the question, would be a better idea.

445
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,720
Now you put your hands just like this towards me.

446
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,080
I would request you to clear out your\h
forehead, is important for me, because,\h\h

447
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,210
you see, sometimes there are problems\h
on the forehead — mostly they are.

448
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,280
So can you clear out your forehead for me?

449
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,080
Just clear out.

450
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,520
I mean, open it out.

451
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,080
Remove your hair I mean, all the hair.

452
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,720
Can you also remove your hair a little bit?

453
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,440
Ya, it’s good.

454
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,840
Just put your hands towards me like this.

455
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,600
This cures your ailments, your physical ailments,\h
it cures cancer, it cures many diseases.

456
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,640
We have cured.

457
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,320
Cancer can only be cured by this.

458
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,240
There’s no other way out.

459
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,200
But what’s the use of coming to me after you have\h
got cancer or you have got some serious disease?

460
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,960
Better get rid of it beforehand.

461
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,840
It’s working out.

462
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,200
Now close your eyes all of\h
you, just close your eyes.

463
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,760
Can you remove your red scarf a little?

464
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,000
Yes, will be a good idea.

465
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,040
You see the Kundalini has to pierce\h
through and I would like to see here also.

466
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,120
First of all watch your mind: is there\h
any thought coming into your mind.

467
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,920
First of all watch your mind.

468
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,000
Just ask your mind, “What are you thinking?”\h
Don’t put your attention anywhere fixed,\h\h

469
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,240
into concentrated form, but just\h
leave it loose, absolutely loose.

470
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,920
Do not concentrate anywhere.

471
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,480
Now, just see if you are feeling the cool\h
breeze in your fingers, because these fingers,\h\h

472
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:20,080
as I told you, at the end of it, are the\h
sympathetic nervous systems which get enlightened.

473
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:27,840
So you just start feeling on the tip of your\h
fingers, if you are feeling the cool breeze.

474
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,760
If you cannot keep your attention steady you\h
can put your attention to the top of your head\h\h

475
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:41,840
where you have a soft bone in your childhood.

476
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,505
Thik hai?

477
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:42,874
(ok?)

478
00:39:42,874 --> 00:39:45,978
It’s all right I think, it’s working.

479
00:39:45,978 --> 00:39:48,786
Most of the chakras have cleared out.

480
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:51,520
I think you are getting cool breeze.

481
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,760
Now you can see, when you are\h
getting cool breeze in your\h\h

482
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,040
hand also there will be cool breeze\h
from your head here, you can see it.

483
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:03,440
Put your left hand on your head and\h
see for yourself, if it is hot or cool.

484
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,080
Could be cool, could be hot also.

485
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,920
If it is cool it’s all right, it’s good.

486
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,400
Got it?

487
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,600
You got the cool breeze too?

488
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,280
Not yet?

489
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,040
In the head in the hand?

490
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,000
Not yet?

491
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,280
It will work out don’t you worry.

492
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,200
Now those who haven’t got\h
it please raise your hands.

493
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,240
All right.

494
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,960
If you don’t mind I’ll ask them to look after you\h
and I’ll also come down to see them, all right?

495
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,680
Please raise your hands those who\h
haven’t got the cool breeze as yet.

496
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,880
Just attend to them! Keep it like\h
that so that somebody comes to you.

497
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,840
Will you please?

498
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:54,720
I think best is the, if people\h
from Brighton do it, it’s better.

499
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,040
You also should, also you should\h
also you should all come and help.

500
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,520
But what I’m saying [is] basically\h
because they will know who they are,\h\h

501
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,720
what is their name and all that.

502
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,080
It would be better for\h
Brighton people to work it out.

503
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,840
And also others.

504
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,520
Just see for yourself.

505
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,400
And others should join them\h
just to help them out, you see.

506
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,520
What’s the problem, let’s see!

507
00:41:17,093 --> 00:41:18,320
Is also left to the right.

508
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,200
Most of them need sort of a\h
balance from left to the right.

509
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,000
Raise it from left to the right,\h
with your left hand towards me,\h\h

510
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,760
you just raise it from left to the right.

511
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,400
It will work out.

512
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:33,920
John, you see, he’s also same thing\h
is, left to the right, you see.

513
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,560
Now this gentleman has got it?

514
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,160
You’ve got the cool breeze?

515
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:38,400
Good.

516
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,000
You can join, you can join\h
John and see what it is.

517
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,640
Just now you can see the whole fantasy of it.

518
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,040
Come along.

519
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,400
What’s your name?

520
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,000
Yogi: Ross.

521
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,400
Shri Mataji: All right, you\h
join John and let’s see.

522
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:55,440
John?

523
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,560
You can see yourself, your vibrations will know.

524
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,600
Now come along! Call him!

525
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,120
Those who got Realisation yesterday\h
also must work it out for themselves.

526
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:05,920
Come along!

527
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,720
Just see.

528
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,480
Is it cool breeze coming now?

529
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,880
Are you feeling the cool breeze in the hand?

530
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,080
You are not feeling in the hand?

531
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,600
It’s coming out of your head all right.

532
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,360
Are you feeling now?

533
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:27,680
It’s Vishuddhi.

534
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,200
He’s got a Vishuddhi, that’s why.

535
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,440
You put your hand on his Vishuddhi.

536
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:31,680
John?

537
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,280
Come along you also work it out,\h
all of you who have got Realisation.

538
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,880

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,040
