1
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:10,027
The fourth dimension that they mentioned about,

2
00:00:10,674 --> 00:00:13,574
what do they mean by that? That is the thing.

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,868
Warren: They call that transcendental state.

4
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:17,958
But what?

5
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:20,819
Warren: They can’t describe it.
(Here Mother says again “What?” while Warren is saying the word “describe”)

6
00:00:20,898 --> 00:00:24,034
They can’t describe it, you see. Supposing somebody has a low

7
00:00:24,168 --> 00:00:27,159
heartbeat, low pulse rate or

8
00:00:27,305 --> 00:00:30,205
has a low consumption of oxygen or anything.

9
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:32,259
Warren: That’s not transcendental state.

10
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:36,233
That is not transcendental state because you are still in the state

11
00:00:36,322 --> 00:00:41,876
where your attention is on your body.

12
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:46,098
So it is not a transcendental, you will have to transcend.

13
00:00:46,196 --> 00:00:50,292
Transcendental means you have to jump onto the parasympathetic.

14
00:00:50,637 --> 00:00:53,370
See, we have four dimensions we can say.

15
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:56,427
One is the dimension of the left sympathetic,

16
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,186
another is of the right sympathetic,

17
00:00:59,398 --> 00:01:03,226
then we have got the central nervous system,

18
00:01:03,353 --> 00:01:04,908
which is our conscious mind

19
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:07,409
and the fourth one is the parasympathetic.

20
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:09,921
Does he jump on the parasympathetic?

21
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:11,285
Warren: We do.

22
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:16,563
Yes. In Sahaja Yoga you jump onto the parasympathetic;

23
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,385
means your attention starts controlling

24
00:01:19,476 --> 00:01:21,585
the parasympathetic nervous system.

25
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:25,591
Then how do we prove it that we become the fourth dimension?

26
00:01:25,748 --> 00:01:30,123
First thing is, that the person, who becomes

27
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:38,068
the controller of the parasympathetic,

28
00:01:38,202 --> 00:01:41,394
becomes the “Auto”. He can do things.

29
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:47,040
He can do things, like she can tell that

30
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,342
another person is suffering on these centers

31
00:01:52,777 --> 00:01:56,233
without going to any laboratory, without going to any

32
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:59,942
medical check-up, on the fingertips.

33
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:06,761
So the person, who becomes the fourth dimension,

34
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,972
he becomes the “Auto”, which is the autonomous nervous system,

35
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,181
you see, the “auto” part of it.

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,600
He controls the parasympathetic.

37
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:19,474
Now, when he controls the parasympathetic,

38
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:26,284
he controls this supply to all the centers

39
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:32,322
through certain movements, through certain kind of technique.

40
00:02:33,874 --> 00:02:39,263
For example a person is suffering from some disease of the heart.

41
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,981
Now, a normal person, who doesn’t have this fourth dimension,

42
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,922
will not know that she is suffering from any heart trouble.

43
00:02:50,617 --> 00:02:54,345
He will have no idea, he’ll never feel his heart or anything,

44
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:57,796
till he suddenly gets the attack, and then he dies.

45
00:02:58,073 --> 00:03:01,492
But at the very onset of it the person,

46
00:03:01,793 --> 00:03:05,505
who is in the fourth dimension that is the realized soul,

47
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:12,813
can feel that something is going wrong with his heart.

48
00:03:13,884 --> 00:03:17,556
Also he knows how to cure himself,

49
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,997
the technique of curing himself, also he knows

50
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:25,847
that he is the source of the medicines that he has to give,

51
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,480
is the vital force.

52
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:37,956
So this is the fourth dimension, is a great potential,

53
00:03:38,146 --> 00:03:40,523
becoming a kinetic force,

54
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,114
like an egg becoming a bird.

55
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:53,725
So the egg we can see egg has no way of flying out,

56
00:03:53,937 --> 00:03:55,203
but the bird can.

57
00:03:55,281 --> 00:03:58,696
It is a tremendous difference between an egg and a bird.

58
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:00,259
So such a person,

59
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:03,393
who gets Realization and gets establishes,

60
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,346
is no more a person,

61
00:04:07,344 --> 00:04:10,544
who can be tested by these machines and all that,

62
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:13,955
because these machines deal only with the physical side,

63
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:15,856
but it is he who can test.

64
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:22,112
Even a child, who is a realized-soul can test another person.

65
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:24,832
You don’t need any machines with that.

66
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:28,939
He becomes the one, who diagnoses; he becomes the one,

67
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:34,988
who cures; he becomes the person, who can soothe you.

68
00:04:35,424 --> 00:04:37,624
Not only that on physical level,

69
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,871
but supposing somebody is emotionally disturbed,

70
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:47,467
then such a person knows that

71
00:04:47,757 --> 00:04:50,491
another person is emotionally disturbed.

72
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:57,943
He also knows precisely which center is disturbed;

73
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:03,088
he also knows how to put that center right.

74
00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:06,960
You don’t have to go to lunatic asylum to get cured,

75
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,766
but a person, who has fourth dimension,

76
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:13,382
can cure that person of that sickness,

77
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:18,325
because he precisely knows where the trouble is and how to cure it.

78
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:28,798
So all the diseases, which are only physical, can be cured;

79
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:32,392
which are the psychosomatic can be cured;

80
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,053
the combination of both can be cured.

81
00:05:35,384 --> 00:05:40,652
Any combination of these things can be cured by a person,

82
00:05:40,764 --> 00:05:42,649
who is an established Sahaja Yogi.

83
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:50,432
But in case a disease has gone so far that it is irreparable

84
00:05:52,777 --> 00:05:58,144
or something artificial has been introduced in the body,

85
00:05:58,748 --> 00:06:02,181
as they put sticks, steel-sticks and all that,

86
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,478
then, Sahaja Yoga doesn’t work on dead things.

87
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:08,279
It works on living.

88
00:06:08,554 --> 00:06:13,526
If the organ is still living, it can work out,

89
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:17,906
but if it is not living, then it does not work out.

90
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:22,743
It works out on eighty per cent of people,

91
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:27,711
but the twenty per cent of people on whom it cannot not work out,

92
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:31,256
are the people, who do not have

93
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:35,039
a basic foundation to be a human being.

94
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:40,847
They are like animals; their attitudes towards are animals,

95
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:43,264
even worse than animals.

96
00:06:43,381 --> 00:06:49,968
So a state that could be a so-called fourth dimension

97
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:56,307
could be where a person is no more a human being;

98
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:03,629
he becomes either a devil or a satanic person.

99
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:07,522
This has to be accepted by medical science

100
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:11,843
that there are people, who can be very devilish

101
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:17,290
and they cannot ascend any further into the fourth dimension.

102
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:22,668
The fourth dimension is not a mechanical process,

103
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:25,525
but is a living process of the evolution

104
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,499
by which you evolve to a higher being.

105
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,514
But for that you have to have some basic foundations.

106
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:39,493
A person, who is an alcoholic, can be cured of alcohol,

107
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:45,612
but a person, who is cheating himself,

108
00:07:46,282 --> 00:07:51,493
cheating other people, is cruel to others,

109
00:07:51,851 --> 00:07:55,416
or say, a person like Hitler, he cannot ascend.

110
00:07:56,109 --> 00:08:00,226
He’s gone beyond that stage, where we cannot cure him.

111
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:05,170
We can cure animals, we can cure human beings,

112
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:10,181
but not people, who are abnormal

113
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:16,564
or we can, there is no word for some the …, but satanic people,

114
00:08:17,825 --> 00:08:21,089
and that’s how it doesn’t work out in some people.

115
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:33,750
Also the cases which have gone very down onto the state,

116
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:40,473
where we can say now, absolutely out of order,

117
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:47,705
then Sahaja Yoga allows such a body to take another birth and try.

118
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:50,708
So because it’s a fourth dimension,

119
00:08:50,953 --> 00:08:56,002
we cannot take medical science as a vehicle

120
00:08:56,594 --> 00:09:00,242
to express everything, because this is higher than that.

121
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:07,709
But in many ways we can medically show that

122
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:13,635
people have been cured of anginas, of cancer, of leukemia,

123
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:19,677
of everything through the vehicle of parasympathetic nervous system

124
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:22,427
which doctors cannot handle.

125
00:09:24,861 --> 00:09:27,527
Because they have their own limitation,

126
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:31,329
they cannot jump onto the parasympathetic nervous system,

127
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:37,349
and that is why they cannot cure a person,

128
00:09:37,795 --> 00:09:40,462
who has problems of the parasympathetic.

129
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,696
All problems can be solved through parasympathetic in case

130
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:49,999
there are basic conditions; if they are fulfilled.

131
00:09:50,513 --> 00:09:56,047
In the medical science people will even treat Hitler

132
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,458
– there is no discrimination.

133
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:02,636
But as you grow

134
00:10:02,748 --> 00:10:06,652
higher and higher even in evolution you become more discreet,

135
00:10:06,984 --> 00:10:10,493
and at this stage you cannot treat a person,

136
00:10:10,873 --> 00:10:21,678
who is a hypocrite or who is a cruel man or who is aggressive

137
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:29,340
to others or who is practicing methods to subvert people.

138
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,338
And we have many gurus, who take money

139
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:41,499
and destroy many people just for money’s sake.

140
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,119
Such people can never go to the fourth dimension,

141
00:10:44,203 --> 00:10:46,445
why should they talk about fourth dimension?

142
00:10:47,051 --> 00:10:53,437
Such people have to be something so extraordinary

143
00:10:54,395 --> 00:11:00,443
that they become righteous, virtuous, compassionate

144
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:06,850
and very dynamic people.

145
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:13,158
They have the greatest quality, is of compassion,

146
00:11:13,352 --> 00:11:16,252
which though we accept in our ordinary life,

147
00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:18,334
in medical science we do not accept.

148
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:24,487
But on what basis is the medical science? Is compassion.

149
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:28,623
So you become the compassion.

150
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:31,982
This is the fire point is to be seen.

151
00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:36,688
When we talk of the fourth dimension, we talk of the beyond.

152
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:41,152
And when we talk of the beyond, we have to project our mind to see

153
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:43,545
what do we expect ourselves to be,

154
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:46,329
when we become something of the beyond.

155
00:11:46,729 --> 00:11:50,975
Are we going to be the same mean, aggressive,

156
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:57,088
complicated human being or are we going to be something

157
00:11:58,398 --> 00:11:59,518
like a saint?

158
00:12:03,437 --> 00:12:07,534
So this projection has to be brought in the minds of the doctors.

159
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:10,151
Unless and until they project their minds to

160
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:13,139
that extent to see that,

161
00:12:13,503 --> 00:12:17,534
“If we have to be at a higher position,

162
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,514
we have to accept that we have to be better people.”

163
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:26,629
Now Sahaja Yoga is the synthesis

164
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,300
of all the three powers that are within us.

165
00:12:31,408 --> 00:12:33,608
The first is the physical power,

166
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,608
the second is the emotional power

167
00:12:35,745 --> 00:12:38,212
and third is the evolutionary power.

168
00:12:38,812 --> 00:12:42,140
You become the synthesis of all these three powers.

169
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:46,245
It’s not the analysis, but medical science is the analysis.

170
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,939
So it just analyses physical side,

171
00:12:50,096 --> 00:12:52,963
goes on analyzing so that you have one

172
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,639
doctor for one eye and another doctor for another eye.

173
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,306
But a doctor has to understand

174
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,439
that there is no solution for many problems that we have.

175
00:13:06,631 --> 00:13:10,342
So they have to raise their eyes higher

176
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:13,949
to see that, “There must be something missing

177
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:15,556
that we have to know.”

178
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:18,028
Of course medical science is very important.

179
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:22,109
Because once you get your Realization,

180
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,930
even you may not be a doctor,

181
00:13:25,235 --> 00:13:29,139
and you become established Sahaja Yogi, you can cure people.

182
00:13:29,395 --> 00:13:34,844
But with medical science you can prove that it has been cured.

183
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:38,526
So medical science also has its own purpose.

184
00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:43,850
And the basics of medical science that is compassion,

185
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:47,814
is now expressed through the human being,

186
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:50,334
who becomes the embodiment of compassion.

187
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:55,940
It’s not poetry, it’s not some sort of a abstract thing,

188
00:13:56,077 --> 00:14:02,274
but is a happening of evolution that has to take place

189
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:07,801
and this is the last breakthrough about which many people,

190
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:12,938
scientists and also doctors,

191
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:16,561
we can say psychologists have talked about,

192
00:14:16,786 --> 00:14:19,253
though they are not taken seriously.

193
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:23,026
So now there is time for us to think seriously about it

194
00:14:23,641 --> 00:14:30,855
and to know that we are not only this body, mind

195
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:35,456
and ego, but we are something beyond that is the fourth dimension.

196
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:37,301
And what are we there?

197
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:46,437
We are the “Auto” and the “Auto” is called as “Self”.

198
00:14:49,036 --> 00:14:53,859
Unless and until you project your mind higher

199
00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:59,052
and do not get contented with what discoveries you have made

200
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:01,750
on a physical gross level,

201
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:06,547
you cannot see the point of view of Sahaja Yoga.

202
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:11,410
And what is there to argue about? When Sahaja Yoga is curing people

203
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:15,577
why do you argue? Why don’t you see how it is curing?

204
00:15:17,276 --> 00:15:21,123
Supposing a doctor is practicing,

205
00:15:21,451 --> 00:15:24,326
and people go and argue with him: “How do you cure?”

206
00:15:24,497 --> 00:15:25,530
You will tell him:

207
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:27,995
“What do you mean? I’m not supposed to tell you all that,

208
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:29,234
but I do cure”.

209
00:15:30,757 --> 00:15:35,045
Now you have a certificate, say from a medical college or somewhere

210
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,124
so you think you are a doctor,

211
00:15:37,262 --> 00:15:39,995
but supposing somebody has a certificate

212
00:15:41,676 --> 00:15:46,570
from the Divine Itself, then why not see,

213
00:15:46,765 --> 00:15:50,007
why not keep your eyes open like a scientist,

214
00:15:50,222 --> 00:15:54,538
why close them by whatever you have known so far.

215
00:15:54,675 --> 00:15:58,659
Why make a barrier out of the scientific research you have done,

216
00:15:58,777 --> 00:16:01,977
why not be a research student in Sahaja Yoga also

217
00:16:02,155 --> 00:16:05,803
and see for yourself that you really achieve that state.

218
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,999
You have to become that state.

219
00:16:08,275 --> 00:16:11,859
While those who talk of the fourth dimension otherwise,

220
00:16:11,948 --> 00:16:14,748
make people mad, they make them lunatics.

221
00:16:15,346 --> 00:16:19,955
They end up as lost races.

222
00:16:20,912 --> 00:16:23,512
So how can that be a fourth dimension?

223
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:26,380
There are so many cases of these people,

224
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:31,867
one can show that doing those horrible courses and things

225
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:33,918
they have become really mad.

226
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:36,672
And they are good for nothing, they are cheats.

227
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,738
They are doing all the bad things that one can do.

228
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:43,996
So how can you say that this meditation helps anyone

229
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,336
to be a better person or better person in health?

230
00:16:48,195 --> 00:16:53,235
Moreover, to be only all right in health is not sufficient.

231
00:16:53,508 --> 00:16:55,508
One must also see that point.

232
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:59,704
One should not be so much attached to the body,

233
00:16:59,861 --> 00:17:02,223
because supposing if you have all the wrestlers

234
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,427
or boxers in this country, now take a position like that,

235
00:17:05,544 --> 00:17:09,320
then what will happen? As it is, we have too many of them.

236
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:16,495
Now what we need, are the saints.

237
00:17:17,707 --> 00:17:22,042
Not physically over-healthy people,

238
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:29,816
who will try to boss over others, but people, who are saints,

239
00:17:30,402 --> 00:17:41,603
who can help without charging any money, without any aggression,

240
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:48,810
out of compassion, effortlessly those who are suffering physically.

241
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,255
But there is another barrier,

242
00:17:55,392 --> 00:17:57,592
which must be told very frankly,

243
00:17:58,224 --> 00:18:03,048
that when you become a Sahaja Yogi

244
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:14,611
the vital forces of new dimension start flowing effortlessly

245
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:19,568
and you do not charge any money for that.

246
00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:21,869
You enjoy your own compassion.

247
00:18:23,865 --> 00:18:27,065
Compassion, that is the basis of medical science.

248
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:37,581
So that state maybe doctors may not try to have.

249
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:41,171
But there are many, many people,

250
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:43,778
who cannot be cured by Sahaja Yoga

251
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:46,831
and they can come to doctors,

252
00:18:46,949 --> 00:18:49,749
so doctors should not have fears about it.

253
00:18:50,644 --> 00:18:54,839
How many people can be helped by Sahaja Yoga,

254
00:18:55,445 --> 00:18:56,725
cannot be said,

255
00:18:57,925 --> 00:19:02,046
but those who come to Sahaja Yoga can be helped.

256
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:08,569
So it should be at least accepted as a

257
00:19:09,742 --> 00:19:18,498
higher type of redemption or a curing power,

258
00:19:20,216 --> 00:19:24,123
which must be accepted and those who can be cured by that,

259
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,999
must be given a chance

260
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:28,919
and there should be no barrier about it.

261
00:19:31,311 --> 00:19:38,905
Warren: What is this parasympathetic in fact,

262
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,754
if it is described in medical science as the thing that balances,

263
00:19:44,003 --> 00:19:45,995
brings everything in back into balance.

264
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:49,198
It depends on, it depends on.

265
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:52,655
It is actually the evolutionary process.

266
00:19:52,753 --> 00:19:56,132
You see, parasympathetic works

267
00:19:57,421 --> 00:20:00,752
at different levels of our evolution.

268
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:05,323
Say, at the stage when you are matter, it organizes you

269
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:07,648
in the periodic tables.

270
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:14,580
Who does that organization? Is parasympathetic.

271
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:21,136
Then, when you rise higher as an animal,

272
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:29,339
then it gives you the understanding of eating food,

273
00:20:29,848 --> 00:20:34,417
seeking food by which animals seek food.

274
00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:45,142
Then as it rises higher it gives you another feeling of protection,

275
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:49,321
you seek protection. Animals also seek protections.

276
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:54,067
That’s how the evolution goes on – by giving these

277
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,672
feelings within us or we can say

278
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:00,693
as the parasympathetic starts manifesting higher and higher,

279
00:21:01,438 --> 00:21:05,734
the seeking starts becoming higher and higher.

280
00:21:06,711 --> 00:21:09,933
Then comes up to the human state,

281
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,816
where people seek food, protection.

282
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:22,658
Then when they achieve that, they seek power,

283
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,740
they seek money, they seek possessions,

284
00:21:27,268 --> 00:21:30,880
they seek possession of other people,

285
00:21:31,096 --> 00:21:33,429
which is sometimes called as love.

286
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:36,875
They seek all kinds of such things,

287
00:21:37,522 --> 00:21:43,296
but still their seeking is not finished, still they are seeking.

288
00:21:43,727 --> 00:21:48,082
Then the same parasympathetic creates an urge within us

289
00:21:48,316 --> 00:21:50,916
that we have to seek something higher.

290
00:21:52,125 --> 00:22:02,855
This last feeling after human stage is to be manifested,

291
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:06,585
and for that there is a residual force

292
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:09,448
placed within us called as ‘Kundalini’,

293
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,175
which is actually the power of desire within us,

294
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,618
which has manifested everything.

295
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,748
But still it is residual, because it is not yet manifested itself.

296
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:25,858
Because this is the power of desire to be one

297
00:22:26,723 --> 00:22:29,817
with the Divine vital force.

298
00:22:30,853 --> 00:22:34,368
And that’s why it rests in the sacrum bone

299
00:22:34,525 --> 00:22:37,981
– ‘sacrum’ meaning ‘sacred’, so people knew about it.

300
00:22:38,704 --> 00:22:41,341
And then when this force rises

301
00:22:42,766 --> 00:22:45,022
through the various centers

302
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,913
and pierces through the fontanel bone area,

303
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:54,593
you actually get the cool-breeze coming out of your head.

304
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,840
For that you don’t need any medical science,

305
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,126
any laboratory, just put your hand on top of such a person

306
00:23:02,263 --> 00:23:05,232
and you get the cool-breeze coming out of such a person.

307
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:06,845
Not only that, but

308
00:23:06,943 --> 00:23:09,954
that person himself feels the cool-breeze coming out of his head.

309
00:23:10,092 --> 00:23:14,990
And after some time he feels it coming out of his own hands.

310
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:23,212
Then he tries to use it. When he uses that, he finds that,

311
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:29,403
this is the power that works out all the cures.

312
00:23:30,068 --> 00:23:32,626
So one has to realize and accept

313
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:38,620
that at the stage of the human level you cannot

314
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:43,737
achieve the fourth dimension.

315
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:46,442
You have to become something more.

316
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:51,936
And this is the thing where the

317
00:23:52,132 --> 00:23:56,526
people who want to cheat you for money have used,

318
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:01,155
that what you become, is a possessed person.

319
00:24:02,894 --> 00:24:06,158
They brainwash you; you become a different person.

320
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:10,125
They put some possessions in you, you become possessed

321
00:24:10,257 --> 00:24:15,485
and you think that you have already being something different.

322
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:20,544
But to be different is not the point, to be higher is to be seen.

323
00:24:22,242 --> 00:24:27,414
And higher means the one, who has full control over himself;

324
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,203
who is completely relaxed,

325
00:24:31,985 --> 00:24:37,472
who is at peace, who is compassionate

326
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,920
and who is a higher personality.

327
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,043
Anybody, who is physically fit,

328
00:24:48,157 --> 00:24:51,183
by no chance is a very evolved person

329
00:24:51,418 --> 00:24:53,885
or who has got the fourth dimension.

330
00:24:54,464 --> 00:24:57,273
On the contrary, they also come to Me and ask Me,

331
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,090
“Mother, give us peace”.

332
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:22,477
Warren: If sympathetic is a case of living in extremes

333
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:26,912
and parasympathetic is a case of living in balance.

334
00:25:27,048 --> 00:25:32,024
But you see what I said is that it is parasympathetic in totality,

335
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:35,442
say in one word, see you must make it clear cut

336
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:39,074
that it does give balance at a point, you see.

337
00:25:39,446 --> 00:25:47,961
Balance is a result of trial and error, is a result.

338
00:25:48,352 --> 00:25:50,486
How do you get on to a bicycle?

339
00:25:50,637 --> 00:25:53,879
First you make mistakes, you wobble,

340
00:25:54,016 --> 00:25:56,616
then you fall down, then you’ll learn.

341
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:09,619
You can talk to them.

342
00:26:10,673 --> 00:26:16,200
If you have to say that physical wellbeing is not the end of it.

343
00:26:16,454 --> 00:26:17,454
Hello,

344
00:26:18,876 --> 00:26:24,462
Shridevi! Shridevi, how are you?

345
00:26:25,653 --> 00:26:28,837
Shridevi, are you all right?

346
00:26:32,568 --> 00:26:34,368
How are you feeling today?

347
00:26:35,634 --> 00:26:38,524
Today you are not crying at all.

348
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:43,573
(Trying to lift her up.)

349
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,840
This is the cool breeze coming out.

350
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:53,851
Much better?

351
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:57,542
I worked on her last night. Aah!

352
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,479
Hello Shridevi!

353
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:05,219
(A child is crying)

354
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:09,402
No! No! Not to cry.
