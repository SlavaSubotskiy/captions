1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,909
So lever should be treated.

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:10,490
And next time when you come to India we are
going to get you all the medicines of liver.

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,339
If they are very fat then they are left sided.

4
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:21,170
Try to bring them to the center with the three
candle treatment.

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,449
But first of all test it what is the situation.

6
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:26,880
Sometime they developed the puffy fat that
is alright.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,680
They will become alright.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,980
That is how you should look after their health.

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,170
Then also look after their behavior.

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,940
Tell them how to behave.

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,930
So I have seen in west the children are not
properly brought up because parents neglect

12
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:46,930
them.

13
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,180
I want blame the children.

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,930
Parents neglect them it should be loving,
kind and at the same time you should must

15
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,740
tell them what is discipline is.

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,969
It is very important.

17
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,460
Then Keep a watch on them.

18
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,760
How they are?

19
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,060
What they are doing?

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,510
Of course we have school but it has limited
seats there.

21
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:17,900
Whatever it is, they are going to adjust as
a many as possible.

22
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:24,200
Even then supposing you have any problem,
do not go arbitrarily in to it.

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:33,390
You many ask your leader or you may write
to me and inform me.

24
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:40,130
Among you somebody might become very ego oriented,
may start his own organization, I will do

25
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,130
this.

26
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,600
Let him say you get out and he will suffer.

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,030
You do not have to worry.

28
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,840
Alright you get out.

29
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,030
Anybody who is arbitrary will not work out.

30
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,610
Suppose one finger start working more than
other means it is cancer that is malignancy.

31
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,400
We can not have malignancy.

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:06,460
All of you should work together with understanding,
before others as well among yourselves.

33
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,010
It is very important to understand.

34
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:14,180
Now, Sahajayoga has worked out in so many
countries.

35
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,500
In such a big way in some and in such a small
way in some.

36
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:27,200
But wherever, Sahajayogi have to be something
special.

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,420
Even the Children have to be something special.

38
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,531
You have any other problems which do not want
to discuss, you say with your leader and then

39
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:41,920
you can write to me directly, no harm.

40
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,420
Either If I answer well and good and if I
do not answer also well and good, it will

41
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,110
work out.

42
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:55,200
But attention should not be all the time about
yourself.

43
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,220
Me, my family, my children, my house, my job,
No.

44
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,980
As soon as your attention on another people
it works fast.

45
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,130
It helps, very much.

46
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:12,650
But on your self, I am sick; I have this problem
that problem, nothing.

47
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:21,370
You are now at the stage when you can absolutely
solve all the problem but first and foremost

48
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,310
thing is if your attention on yourself it
want work out.

49
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,910
Attention should be on others.

50
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:37,570
And if it has to be on yourself, attention
then just find what is wrong with me.

51
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,660
But some people in that also go too far.

52
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:46,430
Mother my Agyna is caching, Mother my this
is caching, it is nonsense.

53
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:52,190
May be you are caching from other people,
possible.

54
00:03:52,190 --> 00:04:00,480
There are some nice books, now already in
Sahajayoga translated in Chinese luckily and

55
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,020
also my tapes could be translated also.

56
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,720
But you have to keep my voice as I told you
because that is mantra, isn't it?

57
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,109
And you can have subtitle would be better
if you could do it.

58
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:21,760
That is a very good idea that you can have
subtitles, really.

59
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:28,380
Specially, for Russian if they could do in
Russia.

60
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:53,950
Now if you have any question you can ask me.

61
00:04:53,950 --> 00:05:00,220
So it should be always like, if you are Chinese,
then you should not only deal with Chinese.

62
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,760
They should all come to the collective.

63
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,650
Supposing you are Indians, you should not
only deal with the Indians, but they should

64
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,590
come to the collective.

65
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,840
Because unless and until they come to the
collective they will not know what the problem

66
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
is?

67
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,730
It is not that you can organize separately
a group, another group separately.

68
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,430
It has to be one group.

69
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:27,760
Of course you could have two ashrams or three
ashrams, makes no difference.

70
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,669
Any other question?

71
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:33,010
Sahajayogi: is the Camphor treatment is for
left side?

72
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,010
Shri Mataji: What?

73
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,010
Sahajayogi: camphor treatment?

74
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,010
The Camphor treatment?

75
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,010
Shri Mataji: What?

76
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:43,640
Sahajayogi: he is asking if the camphor treatment
is good for left side.

77
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,910
Shri Mataji: what?

78
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,520
Shri Mataji: No no no no.

79
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
No need.

80
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,420
Camphor, only once in a while.

81
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,960
Do not do camphor.

82
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,840
But you have done all mixed up thing, you
see.

83
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,260
Just do left side treatment and you will be
alright, just mixed up.

84
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:06,270
And you can not earn money on the name of
GOD or divine work that is one thing.

85
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,370
You can not organize like that.

86
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,990
No Never.

87
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,030
Because once you start getting like this left
sided Bhoot will come into it.

88
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,250
That is the part of Sahajayog.

89
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,610
We can not.

90
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:29,110
Also if you have any guru's photograph and
all that it is better to put them in the sea.

91
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:35,520
Because this keeping any photograph, any book
about them creates problems.

92
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,960
So religiously search out and put them in
the sea.

93
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,851
[Shri Mataji looked at something]
"No no no no no no no"."

94
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:48,920
No no no" Don't do all that.

95
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,580
They will work on the photograph.

96
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:57,200
If you want to help somebody, you see some
other people who have come, who want to raise,

97
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,500
do not touch them.

98
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:05,180
Take a bandhan yourself and give them a bandhan.

99
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,010
Put them before the photograph and you just
raise the Kundalini.

100
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,030
But be careful.

101
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:19,620
Because you are still, you see, not that sort
of thing that you cannot catch.

102
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,020
You Might catch.

103
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,770
So Among yourselves also you should not do
that.

104
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,800
Do not touch.

105
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,639
If somebody says I have this problem alright.

106
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,930
Put him on the photograph.

107
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,000
Take a bandhan yourself.

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,199
Ask them to take a bandhan.

109
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,580
You also give a bandhan and then raise the
Kundalini.

110
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,780
Be careful.

111
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:52,080
Even if there is somebody who has came now,
who is sick man.

112
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,669
So you can give them a photograph, it is alright
if they are willing to do it.

113
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:06,330
But somebody in his family is willing to take
Sahajayoga, who is a healthy person he should

114
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,600
bring.

115
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,800
Otherwise don't get after sick person.

116
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,210
You will have many sick, in thousand, to begin
with.

117
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:18,680
Do not worry about sick.

118
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:25,389
If they are sick tell them to take the photograph
and work it out if they are left sided or

119
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:27,500
right sided.

120
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,070
Then the faith grows it improves.

121
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,050
But you do not touch the sick.

122
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,050
No no.

123
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,050
Not at all.

124
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,019
You are not here to cure sick.

125
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:40,129
But we are here to give realisation.

126
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:43,819
May God bless you.

127
00:08:43,819 --> 00:08:56,040
Sahajayogi: For technique, if you have a problem
on one side, you have balance in left side

128
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:06,139
is weak [Not clear], Do you raise Kundalini
on this side and give bandhan to the other

129
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:07,139
side.

130
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:18,910
Shri Mataji: Supposing you are right sided
then you have to put down the right side,

131
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,180
remember that way it is much much better.

132
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:29,480
Then you raise your left side and put on right
side if you have right side problem.

133
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,589
If you have left side problem so you have
to put down the left side.

134
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:40,089
It is easier to remember this way.

135
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:48,790
So there is no confusion.

136
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:54,139
But tying of Kundalini you should be done
after you have moved out left to right or

137
00:09:54,139 --> 00:10:00,839
right to left, which ever way and then raise
your Kundalini and tie up and take a bandhan,

138
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:12,860
it is the best way.

139
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:20,369
I would request you all of you to take photograph
of yours and make an album, write it down

140
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:30,199
below that what is your name, date of birth
and of self realisation.

141
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:34,459
Send it over to me because I go on seeing
that sometimes.

142
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:41,751
So, I know you better and also I will allow
my attention on you, of children and as well

143
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:50,269
as of bigger people.

144
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:55,699
So I will talk to you and talk to him because
you have little individual problem, both of

145
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:56,699
you.

146
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:57,980
So what about you?

147
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,699
Are you reconcile?

148
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:02,939
Ha?

149
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:06,310
..I am going to get her.

150
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:13,449
[Not clear] He came here to do Sahajayoga
and not to disturb a family.

151
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:15,220
He is been very wrong.

152
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,769
I am going to be very angry with him.

153
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:26,100
He is an old Sahajayogi, he should have behaved
himself.

154
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:32,519
[Not clear] You have such sweet beautiful
children.

155
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,269
I will never support you in nonsense, i must
tell you.

156
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:42,889
And your husband is very good man and if you
behave alright he will come round to Sahajayoga.

157
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:45,790
I am sure.

158
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:50,920
You can not be a Sahajayogi if you have no
dharma [Not clear].

159
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
"Shield".

160
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
As Buddha has called.

161
00:11:52,920 --> 00:12:07,999
As we called As the Your character, your morality
is the most important in Sahajayoga.

162
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:14,209
If you are not moral it has no meaning at
all.

163
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:15,879
What you need is morality.

164
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:19,750
This is happening everywhere, nonsense.

165
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:27,680
We have to imbibe it in ourselves and we have
to generate it for others also.

166
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,019
Whole world is full of immoral people.

167
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:36,089
Very very few who are standing for morality?

168
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:50,259
It was the greatest ornament we have, Alright?

169
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:51,610
Don't go after.

170
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,149
This will never help you?

171
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:01,569
It was very wrong of you and also for your
children.

172
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:15,079
Now go back and behave yourself properly otherwise
you cannot be in Sahajayoga.

173
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:23,240
Ha, If there is something wrong then it is
alright.

174
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,529
We have divorce in Sahajayoga.

175
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:27,119
We allow divorce in Sahajayoga.

176
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:35,950
But there should be substantial reason for
that.

177
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:41,459
"Or to sub thik hai".

178
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:44,009
What we do?

179
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:48,269
May God Bless you all.

180
00:13:48,269 --> 00:17:35,010
I am sorry you had to come so late in 

181
00:17:35,010 --> 00:18:12,740
the night.
