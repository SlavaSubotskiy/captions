00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:08,750
Shri Adi Shakti Puja
Cabella Ligure

2
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:15,709
June 24th, 2007

3
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:46,709
It is very nice to see you all again here.

4
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:53,500
I think this is the first puja we are having in this place,

5
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,875
and I hope you are all comfortable

6
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,875
and convenient for you to come here.

7
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:14,166
Today is really a very great day.

8
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:20,458
It's an Adi Shakti, to celebrate Adi Shakti

9
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:24,834
and what is the origin of this Adi Shakti.

10
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,959
I've never talked about it.

11
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,041
This is the first time I'll tell you

12
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:42,417
that Adi Shakti is the Primordial Mother,

13
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:50,625
is the power, power of God,

14
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:53,709
that wanted to create this world.

15
00:01:56,834 --> 00:02:04,417
And She Herself managed

16
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,333
to create this great world.

17
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,208
Can't you all sit down?

18
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,291
There's no space for them or what?

19
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,083
Please be seated.

20
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,166
Why are they standing?

21
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,875
There are chairs behind you.

22
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,875
It's all right you can sit on chairs.

23
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,542
This is all falling down [microphone].

24
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:24,125
As far as possible, be comfortable.

25
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,792
Don't strain yourself unnecessarily.

26
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,625
I hope you all find

27
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,250
some place to be seated comfortably.

28
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:58,417
So today I'm going to tell you about Adi Shakti

29
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,125
which is a very, very ancient subject.

30
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,542
Adi Shakti is the power of God Himself,

31
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,667
and She created this world

32
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,959
to bring His kingdom on this Earth.

33
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,750
You can imagine, there was nothing but darkness.

34
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,750
And out of this darkness

35
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:49,750
She had to create all these beautiful,

36
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:55,500
pictures, trees

37
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:00,959
and all kinds of vegetation.

38
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,875
That She did create.

39
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,792
But what is the use

40
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,792
having all these

41
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:18,959
things which do not speak, do not understand?

42
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,750
There's no manifestation with them.

43
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:36,583
Of course some of the trees and some of the flowers

44
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:46,667
do receive beautiful vibrations

45
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,250
and they grow very well,

46
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:59,458
but not all, some of them.

47
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:07,250
For example I must tell you that here

48
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:09,250
flowers have no fragrance,

49
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,542
all the flowers they have no fragrance.

50
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,875
I've been going round to see

51
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:27,500
if there were flowers of fragrance.

52
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:34,375
But what they do is to grow them big.

53
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:40,875
They are very big, much bigger than you can find them anywhere.

54
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,583
But there is no fragrance.

55
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:50,583
While in a poor country like India,

56
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:54,667
the flowers have tremendous fragrance.

57
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,458
Even small flowers

58
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,834
have tremendous fragrance.

59
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,458
Now what is the speciality

60
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:10,041
of the fragrance in India

61
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,625
and nowhere else?

62
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:14,333
Nowhere.

63
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:19,125
Some flowers may be having little fragrance,

64
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:26,875
but if there is no fragrance in the flowers

65
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:33,875
that are grown so beautifully, full of love

66
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:42,000
and care but lots of wild flowers also India

67
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,041
have more fragrance.

68
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,542
What is the reason?

69
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:55,417
They say that the soil of India has fragrance.

70
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:00,000
How can you have fragrance in the soil?

71
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,417
But it is a fact.

72
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:11,291
What I'm saying is not just
a story, but it's a fact

73
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:15,417
that in India any flower that you grow mostly,

74
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,083
has mostly, has fragrance.

75
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,875
While here that's not the case.

76
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:30,667
Neither it is in any other country,

77
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,041
you go to Norway or you go to Germany,

78
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,333
any other country you go

79
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:44,458
you won't find any fragrance in the flowers.

80
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:55,250
It is very shocking why there is no fragrance in flowers.

81
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,458
When this world was created

82
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,250
there was no fragrance

83
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:19,417
but in some areas there was,

84
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,417
specially areas

85
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:33,125
which we call as India and otherwise.

86
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:40,417
It is unbelievable

87
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:46,083
that here  or anywhere abroad

88
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:49,792
there are no flowers with fragrance.

89
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,875
So now you are born here.

90
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:02,583
You have brought the fragrance,

91
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,583
you are the people who are realized souls

92
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:11,917
and you have got the fragrance to spread.

93
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:16,417
So your responsibility double, I think,

94
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:21,291
that you must spread fragrance.

95
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:27,417
Fragrance is something very innate.

96
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:34,417
Even this soil which we should say is without fragrance,

97
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:42,208
the people have fragrance in their character,

98
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,959
in their behavior, in their understanding

99
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:52,166
and there is peace which they are aspiring.

100
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't say they are peaceful

101
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,333
but they are aspiring to have peace.

102
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,709
This aspiration only suggests

103
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,417
they are fragrant people,

104
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:06,709
that they are very fragrant.

105
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,542
What is a fragrance in a human being is

106
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,542
his nature, his temperament,

107
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:22,375
how he is and how he behaves towards others.

108
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,709
All the countries all over

109
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,291
still not aware that you have to become fragrant.

110
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:43,500
If they were to be aware

111
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:48,417
then all wars will end, everything will finish off

112
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,625
and they will know we are all one.

113
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,208
We do not belong to different countries

114
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,583
or anything which we have made.

115
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,667
God has not made France.

116
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:04,583
We have made that this is your country, this is their country

117
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,458
and country-wise we fight.

118
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,959
This country belongs to no one.

119
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,041
This belongs to God.

120
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,750
But people stupidly fight

121
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,166
on the countries that,
"This is our country, this is our country."

122
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:30,083
Now I have traveled all over the world,

123
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:35,333
I wouldn't say any, any, any country as their own,

124
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:41,250
because if you own a country

125
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,834
you should have fragrance,

126
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,542
you should have temperament

127
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:53,041
which will make other people

128
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:59,083
feel that you come from countries of fragrance.

129
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,583
Won't have to argue.

130
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:06,792
But one country fighting with another country,

131
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,875
everywhere it goes on.

132
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:15,583
You read in the newspaper all the time you see this nonsense,

133
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:18,834
that countries are fighting

134
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:23,500
and the more they are developed, better they are.

135
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:27,834
In this development of theirs I hope they

136
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,500
rise and become spiritual

137
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:35,542
and they develop fragrance.

138
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,959
But this fighting spirit

139
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,333
of human beings has come from satan I think,

140
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,959
that they are killing themselves, killing others,

141
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,875
destroying the whole world.

142
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,709
You read newspaper you feel so ashamed

143
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,458
how human beings are going on.

144
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,375
So all the Sahaja yogis should not support any kind of fight.

145
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:15,500
Theirs not, they are here to bring fragrance to people,

146
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:21,083
to bring happiness, to joy and not to fight.

147
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:25,583
That is one of the first duties of Sahaja yogis,

148
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:29,625
not to join anything which hates,

149
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:33,125
which fights, which creates problems.

150
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:39,333
These fighting spirits have destroyed the fragrance of the soil.

151
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:49,792
If people become loving and affectionate,

152
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:57,208
this soil itself will become fragrant.

153
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:03,291
First thing we must learn is to love each other

154
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:07,083
and not to hate anyone.

155
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,583
There are so many ways of hating,

156
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,458
this also human quality.

157
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:19,792
Animals do hate because they are animals.

158
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:25,625
Human beings can't be animals.

159
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,041
We are human beings and as human beings

160
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,375
what we should have is love,

161
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:38,875
affection and no hatred of any kind.

162
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,500
Now as you are Sahaja yogis

163
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:46,709
I would say that you should try

164
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,417
to develop your loving capacity

165
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:56,709
instead of fighting capacity or criticizing others.

166
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,625
Very easy to criticize.

167
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:06,250
But try to understand that our soil itself has no fragrance.

168
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,000
How are we to bring fragrance to this soil?

169
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,291
This is only if people live here,

170
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:20,000
have affection and love for each other.

171
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,542
This is the most important thing.

172
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:30,458
When creation took place it was only through affection.

173
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:35,333
Otherwise, what was the need for nature

174
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,417
to create all these things?

175
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:39,792
All this is for what?

176
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,375
To make you feel beautiful,

177
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:47,375
all these trees are beautiful

178
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,875
to make you feel good,

179
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:54,792
to feel one with the nature.

180
00:16:56,083 --> 00:17:02,875
In that way we human beings have not contributed.

181
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,709
Now I'm not saying Sahaja yogis,

182
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:09,792
they are rare and they are wonderful

183
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,125
and they have done a good job

184
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:15,709
because they consider love is the highest.

185
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,709
But you have to show others also

186
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:28,500
that you want to love them because
they should love each other.

187
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,542
The whole world is created because

188
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:34,917
there was love,

189
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,625
otherwise what was the need to waste energy

190
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:43,333
on these continents and all these different countries?

191
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:51,125
Was not to fight, was not to hate each other

192
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,834
or to think no end of yourself;

193
00:17:54,125 --> 00:18:00,041
but to love each other, to have more brothers and sisters.

194
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,875
As in Sahaja Yoga you feel that way,

195
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,375
you have brothers and sisters all over.

196
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,458
Today when I was coming

197
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:15,667
I was so happy to see there were people from all over Europe

198
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,542
and also from India.

199
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:20,041
How is it possible?

200
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:25,041
Because you have developed that love,

201
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:30,750
because you have that love, that innate love,

202
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,417
so wherever you go,

203
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:36,208
wherever you meet people

204
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,000
they should say that we have seen Sahaja yogis

205
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,291
who are nothing but love.

206
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,709
They are not bothered as to

207
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,583
what you are, what your position is

208
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:54,083
or anything, they only know that you are a Sahaja yogi

209
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,959
and a Sahaja yogi loves other Sahaja
yogis.

210
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,083
This is a very big achievement.

211
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:05,375
It was never there as there is no fragrance in the soil,

212
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,250
no fragrance in the human beings.

213
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,750
Now that has come.

214
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:18,333
Now you have got the capacity to love each other

215
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:23,083
and to help each other and to understand each other.

216
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:31,166
Not to criticise and not to insult or in any way defame them.

217
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,542
This I am saying

218
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:38,166
because you are all rare people who are Sahaja yogis.

219
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,709
How many people there are Sahaja yogis you see?

220
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:50,125
Very few. We have to have more Sahaja yogis

221
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:52,500
that they understand

222
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:56,709
that we are all part and parcel of one country

223
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,750
and that country is of love.

224
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,750
This, when it happens

225
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,750
then we'll say that Sahaja Yoga has worked out.

226
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,834
Helping each other,
understanding each other,

227
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,125
that should be there,

228
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:16,542
and I think Sahaja yogis do understand each other

229
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:18,458
and they love each other,

230
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:24,000
but still it should go more than their limits.

231
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,667
Many people don't understand

232
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:31,667
that Sahaja Yoga is not for them only;

233
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,667
it is for the whole world.

234
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:36,542
You have to give it to others

235
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:42,959
and you have to bring forth what you call unity of love.

236
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:48,542
In love you don't see wrong things.

237
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,750
You just enjoy love

238
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:59,834
and that is what is to be seen in today's puja,

239
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:06,583
is that do we bear any hatred for anyone?

240
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:14,500
Do we have ill feeling for anyone or for any country?

241
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,041
We should try to examine yourself.

242
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,041
If you are a real Sahaja yogi

243
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:27,917
you'll hate no one, you'll hate no one,

244
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:34,625
but you will love and love as your own.

245
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:39,959
Love is the biggest thing that God has given human beings

246
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:46,458
and that is what one has to try to develop it.

247
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:54,250
I'm so happy here, now you have come all the way

248
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:58,959
to celebrate this first day,

249
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:11,625
first day of your growth as Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja yogis.

250
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:15,125
Now if the Sahaja yogis

251
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:19,542
spread out and become Sahaja yogis and Sahaja yogis,

252
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:24,875
then your job is finished

253
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:30,667
because then you are enjoying the joy of oneness.

254
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So one has to do it in a way that we all become one.

255
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:43,333
There is nothing to criticize or to hate anyone

256
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:47,709
but to love each other is the point

257
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:52,750
and there I find there are so many Sahaja yogis

258
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:56,750
who have achieved that loving level

259
00:22:57,083 --> 00:23:03,583
and there are some still who are struggling,

260
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:10,875
they haven't come up to that level, some, not many.

261
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,917
Sahaja Yoga means we are one,

262
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:21,542
we are all Sahaja yogis, but not separately, together.

263
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:26,750
If one understands this fact,

264
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:32,333
you have celebrated today's great day of Adi Shakti.

265
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:36,208
Why did Adi Shakti create this world?

266
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,208
Why did all this happen?

267
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:49,083
Why don't we think why so much of love,

268
00:23:49,417 --> 00:23:54,500
so much of prosperity has been given to us?

269
00:23:55,792 --> 00:24:01,500
We never realize where are we and how much we have got.

270
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:05,834
It's not the money but the love

271
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:10,041
and when you will understand we'll really love each other

272
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,291
and there is no hatred,

273
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:16,500
there is no revenge, nothing

274
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:20,291
but just love and love and love.

275
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:24,125
This is what is the message of today.

276
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:28,417
We all have to be loving each other.

277
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:36,625
We have to have all kinds of rituals

278
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:42,333
but it is only expression of our love.

279
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:49,667
It's not just a ritual, it is love.

280
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:55,750
When you have love of the Mother how do you express?

281
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:58,583
In the same way

282
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:02,834
we have to know that today we have to promise

283
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:06,458
that for us love is the most important.

284
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:10,083
We should love.

285
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:13,291
People don't even love in their own families.

286
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:17,583
I'm not talking to such people,  I know.

287
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:22,000
They love their own families, their own village,

288
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,041
their all surroundings, everywhere.

289
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:28,959
But still the world is going on with wars,

290
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:31,875
fighting and all kinds of troubles.

291
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,625
The whole world has to come up

292
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:38,834
to love each other.

293
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:42,834
There is no other solution

294
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:48,166
but to love and in that love there is no selfishness

295
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:55,959
but enjoyment, and that enjoyment you should feel

296
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,625
and give it to others.

297
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:03,125
I'm sure you all Sahaja yogis are doing that

298
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:07,125
and you are seeing the mistakes

299
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:15,542
of the others and not to get anybody into trouble.

300
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:22,250
Love is the message of Adi Shakti.

301
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,333
Now you think about it,

302
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,417
one Adi Shakti created the whole world.

303
00:26:28,709 --> 00:26:31,709
How She must have done it,

304
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:35,667
what She must have planned,

305
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:39,959
how She must have organised it.

306
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:45,458
It's not easy thing. Only because She loved.

307
00:26:45,792 --> 00:26:50,792
Her love is the expression that you are all there

308
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:56,959
and that is why to be one with Her, one should learn to love.

309
00:26:57,291 --> 00:27:00,417
Of course in that you have to know

310
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:03,417
that you should forgive.

311
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,458
If you don't know how to forgive

312
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:11,959
and find mistakes of other people, you won't help.

313
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:15,583
What is your now job is,

314
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:18,709
is to see that you are loving,

315
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:21,709
that there is no hatred for anyone,

316
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:26,250
you don't think of hating someone or hitting somebody.

317
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:28,959
This has to work out.

318
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:32,542
I'm sure this will work out.

319
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:42,250
In all the European countries and Indian continent,

320
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:49,542
those who are developed are fighting;

321
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:53,542
those who are not developed are fighting,

322
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:57,125
they have their own style of fighting.

323
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:59,750
That's the only difference.

324
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:02,250
But there is no love.

325
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:09,250
If you want to have love, then you feel sorry.

326
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:14,709
Supposing I see some country hates country,

327
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,709
then it is very easy for Me to criticize

328
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:22,959
that this country is very bad, the people are bad,

329
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,250
this is bad,  that is ...

330
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:31,125
but I think potentially they are all fine and

331
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:36,917
very good people. Somehow or other I should be able

332
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:40,083
to make them understand that.

333
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:46,500
If they understand what is love and enjoy love,

334
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:50,000
there will be no problems of any kind.

335
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:54,291
Only human beings know how to love.

336
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,583
Nobody else.

337
00:28:56,917 --> 00:29:01,500
Animals also love but their love is so limited.

338
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:06,625
But human beings, their love is so beautiful.

339
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:10,625
They look beautiful only when they love.

340
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:15,250
So I have to tell you not to make cheap love,

341
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:20,250
but a love that you will enjoy

342
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:23,792
and that another person will also enjoy.

343
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,792
It's something to be understood.

344
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:33,458
The way people understand love is sometimes very ridiculous.

345
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:39,041
So one has to first understand what is love,

346
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:45,125
also to understand whether you love or not.

347
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:49,500
If you really love the world,

348
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:54,125
if you really love this creation of God,

349
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,917
then there should be no hatred,

350
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,750
there should be no fights,

351
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:04,834
but just to see the good points.

352
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:08,458
As a mother would see her child,

353
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,458
you should see the whole world

354
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:17,000
as a beautiful peace that God has created for you.

355
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:23,625
This subject is so lengthy that I can talk to you for hours

356
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:26,500
but I have to just say that

357
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:31,834
if you can understand little bit of it is this:

358
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:35,041
you all should have love for each other

359
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:39,750
and we should have understanding.

360
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:43,834
Look at the small children. They love each other.

361
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:49,291
They haven't learned yet how to hate.

362
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,166
But if the children are not brought up well

363
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,792
they can hate each other.

364
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:04,500
They can be very ridiculously funny,

365
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:08,792
and so many countries today are like that.

366
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:14,667
They are just fighting because they do not love.

367
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:20,709
Now so Sahaja yogis have a much greater job,

368
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:27,333
much greater life that they have to show

369
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:30,375
that love is a very great thing.

370
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:32,458
It doesn't matter

371
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:39,875
whether you are Hindu, Christian, this, that nonsense,

372
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:44,709
you are all human beings

373
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:47,583
and we have a right to love

374
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:48,583
and if you manage somehow to love people,

375
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:58,959
I tell you Sahaja Yoga will settle down.

376
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,875
Sahaja Yoga is like a tree

377
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:09,166
which requires love as the water.

378
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:16,208
Try this, try around your life,

379
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,583
and you'll find that how love pays itself.

380
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:26,959
Not to be seen by how much you spend

381
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,834
or what you do.

382
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:31,667
It's not that you count all those things,

383
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:39,959
it's just like a ocean floats everything around,

384
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:46,458
you become like that, a typical personality of Sahaja Yoga.

385
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:50,792
So all the Sahaja yogis must decide today

386
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:55,000
that we are going to forgive all the people we hate

387
00:32:55,291 --> 00:32:58,500
and we are going to love all of them.

388
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:01,500
Let us see if it works out.

389
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:04,291
I'm sure it will work out

390
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:07,417
because first of all you are all realized souls

391
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:14,458
and secondly love is the biggest, biggest boon on human beings,

392
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,166
which, if you utilize,

393
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:21,041
there will be no problem of any kind.

394
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:29,458
So thank you very much.
