00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,880
Guru Puja
Cabella Ligure (Italy), 23 July 2000.

2
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:14,724
Today we are here to know about guru principle.

3
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:24,146
What does a guru do.

4
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:49,180
Whatever you have, all the precious things
within you, he discovers them for your knowledge.

5
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:58,620
Actually it is all there - everything.

6
00:06:59,565 --> 00:07:11,281
All the knowledge, all the spirituality, all
the joy, is there.

7
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:23,366
(little laughter as a dog walks on stage)
Right time! (more laughter).

8
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:30,774
It's all contained within you.

9
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:51,361
Only thing the Guru does (is) makes you knowledgeable
about your knowledge, about your own spirit.

10
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:58,705
Everyone has the Spirit within himself.

11
00:07:58,776 --> 00:08:05,006
Everyone has the spirituality within himself.

12
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:10,976
There is nothing that you get from outside.

13
00:08:10,976 --> 00:08:24,418
But before getting this knowledge, you are
dealing, or you are living in ignorance.

14
00:08:24,443 --> 00:08:35,440
In that ignorance you do not know what treasure
you have got within yourself.

15
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:49,692
So the guru's job is to make you know what
you are.

16
00:08:49,914 --> 00:08:53,975
That is the first step.

17
00:08:54,182 --> 00:09:08,126
That it starts, that awakening within you
by which you know that you are not this outside

18
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:11,458
world, this is all an illusion.

19
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:20,616
And you start getting enlightened within yourself.

20
00:09:20,862 --> 00:09:28,247
Some people get full light and some people
get it gradually.

21
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:34,656
Essence of all the religions is that you should
know yourself.

22
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:44,099
Those people who are fighting in the name
of religion, you have to go and ask them,

23
00:09:44,313 --> 00:09:53,859
you have to enquire from them, "Did your religion
make you know yourself?"

24
00:09:54,010 --> 00:10:00,116
If all the religions have said one thing [it's
that], you have to do all these things just

25
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:03,522
to know yourself.

26
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:09,356
But people get into rituals.

27
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:16,116
They think that [by] doing all these rituals
they are near God.

28
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:28,407
They live in ignorance absolutely about themselves,
and day in and day out they work out something,

29
00:10:28,432 --> 00:10:33,636
which is nothing to do with yourself'.

30
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:42,026
Lots of acrobats, prayers, pujas, these things
go on.

31
00:10:42,152 --> 00:10:45,681
Because it is all ignorance.

32
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:56,868
People go on paying them money and they become
very rich and their interest is only money.

33
00:10:57,096 --> 00:11:08,172
They want to take all your money, absolutely,
and make a fool out of you.

34
00:11:08,212 --> 00:11:11,126
They pamper your ego.

35
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:24,066
With pampering of that ego you just start
drifting into the ocean of illusion and you

36
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:32,766
are drowned into that illusion, thinking that
you are very religious and you are just in

37
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:35,886
connection with God, which you are not.

38
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:41,292
To know God you should know your Self first.

39
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:46,417
Without knowing that, you cannot know God.

40
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:53,106
That's essential, that you should know your
Self.

41
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:58,646
But when you know yourself, you know partly.

42
00:11:58,646 --> 00:12:03,766
The experience is not sufficient.

43
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:07,551
The knowledge has to come.

44
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:14,652
And the guru gives the knowledge about your
Self.

45
00:12:14,803 --> 00:12:18,852
Now you have to tally it.

46
00:12:18,963 --> 00:12:23,235
You should find out whatever your guru has
told you.

47
00:12:23,298 --> 00:12:25,513
Is it true or not?

48
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:28,038
Is it correct or not?

49
00:12:28,244 --> 00:12:33,016
Or is it just another illusion?

50
00:12:33,016 --> 00:12:40,744
Now in this ascent people get into lots of
problems.

51
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:46,016
First and foremost is the ego problem, especially
in the west.

52
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:54,277
Ego stands up and you start thinking you are
great, you are better than others, and there

53
00:12:54,277 --> 00:12:57,606
is something special about you.

54
00:12:57,662 --> 00:13:07,015
This ignorance is more dangerous than the
worldly ignorance, I think, because in the

55
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:19,762
worldly ignorance, you do feel the consequences
of wrong things.

56
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:32,860
But when you are half way, when your ignorance
is that about yourself, when you are going

57
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:42,196
to a higher realm, then one should always
understand that you cannot have ego.

58
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:56,061
Then what starts is introspection.

59
00:13:56,355 --> 00:14:05,272
You start looking at yourself, what's wrong
with you.

60
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,466
When you understand that you have ego, you
start looking at yourself.

61
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:24,666
Or when you find there is something missing
or something wrong, then also, you start introspecting.

62
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:33,331
This should be a very, very honest, very honest
effort.

63
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:38,912
Some people in Sahaja Yoga, at a very early
stage start thinking they that they are very

64
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:44,242
great and they don't need any introspection.

65
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:55,685
And they rise again into the clouds of ignorance
without achieving Selfhood, or I can call

66
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:58,593
it Self realisation.

67
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:07,049
So you have to introspect and see for yourself
what have you been doing, what are you,

68
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:11,515
how far you have come.

69
00:15:11,594 --> 00:15:16,905
How much -- please don't translate just now
all right?

70
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:22,216
You can do it later on.

71
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:26,786
You must hear with full concentration.

72
00:15:26,786 --> 00:15:34,679
Even if you don't understand it will work
-- now the style of such a person changes

73
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:35,719
gradually.

74
00:15:35,744 --> 00:15:36,976
How?

75
00:15:36,976 --> 00:15:50,055
First of all a person who is extremely aggressive,
hot-tempered, and full of ego, starts becoming

76
00:15:50,055 --> 00:15:54,126
very gentle and mild.

77
00:15:54,206 --> 00:16:07,789
Another type which is frightened and afraid
and very cautious starts becoming fearless.

78
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:13,516
At that stage you have no fears.

79
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:23,935
You are sure that you are on the right path
and you are moving on the right lines.

80
00:16:24,102 --> 00:16:27,316
You are not easily disturbed there.

81
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:38,365
But still you have to rise higher and higher;
where, when you meditate, you understand there

82
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:42,790
is something wrong within yourself.

83
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:49,296
You have achieved your Self realisation; you
have got the blessings of Self realisation.

84
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:58,236
Your health is good, you have got all kinds
of blessings which you cannot count.

85
00:16:58,236 --> 00:17:09,270
All that is there but...still you have to
go further.

86
00:17:09,357 --> 00:17:23,966
And that is to understand all the knowledge
about Sahaja Yoga.

87
00:17:24,149 --> 00:17:32,156
You have to understand through your mental
capacity, first, to begin with, then you have

88
00:17:32,156 --> 00:17:37,967
to verify how far it is correct.

89
00:17:38,086 --> 00:17:52,316
How far you have understood it, how far you
have worked on it, how far you know.

90
00:17:52,459 --> 00:18:08,331
And when you start seeing yourself, you start
entering into the realm of Bhakti.

91
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:18,200
You become a mild person, become a sweet person,
you don't talk too much, you don't harass

92
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:30,016
anyone; you are a very pleasant person, very
gentle, very understanding.

93
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:41,156
This person has to verify how he is behaving
towards others.

94
00:18:41,156 --> 00:18:54,643
Now the attention starts moving from oneself
to another and you start seeing how you behave.

95
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:59,230
How you love.

96
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:04,121
What is the quality of your compassion?

97
00:19:07,498 --> 00:19:20,536
When you love somebody without any expectations,
just love, then you are absolutely dedicated

98
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:28,198
to that person, absolutely; you just obey.

99
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:31,990
You will do anything for that person.

100
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:39,445
If there is this love which you call as surrender.

101
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:43,146
This is just the love.

102
00:19:43,146 --> 00:19:52,016
Surrender is nothing but the love, and that
love which is extremely joy-giving.

103
00:19:52,016 --> 00:20:07,081
this bhakti starts, this dedication starts,
and you are cleansed by that bhakti.

104
00:20:07,144 --> 00:20:20,505
All the bad qualities you have, you can call
them, all the deficiencies you have, all the

105
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:29,692
problems you have, you understand and you
get over it.

106
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:43,776
Now if you see somebody with the same qualities,
with the same troubles, you in the love of

107
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:49,577
that person you try to tolerate.

108
00:20:49,602 --> 00:20:57,535
Such a person just tolerates.

109
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:13,061
There is no aggression, and these people forgive.

110
00:21:13,196 --> 00:21:19,255
Realised Souls go on forgiving; their capacity
to forgive is tremendous.

111
00:21:19,255 --> 00:21:25,892
They do not bear any malice against anyone.

112
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:29,575
They don't have any anger about anyone.

113
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:36,210
They just go on tolerating and forgiving and
forgiving.

114
00:21:36,313 --> 00:21:47,261
This forgiveness is just a music, I should
say, of your bhakti.

115
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:55,065
The amount of forgiveness these masters could
have can be seen from [the] life of Christ.

116
00:21:55,065 --> 00:22:01,700
They are tortured, crucified - most of the
saints were tortured.

117
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:04,272
People never liked them.

118
00:22:04,297 --> 00:22:18,485
And they were crucified, but as you know that
they never resented, they never take a revenge,

119
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:24,995
they never did anything which was not compassionate.

120
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:30,429
They had compassion, and compassion for such
people

121
00:22:30,623 --> 00:22:37,084
they felt that 'Oh God, please forgive them.

122
00:22:38,615 --> 00:22:43,491
What they are doing they don't know'.

123
00:22:43,516 --> 00:22:46,357
Extremely compassionate.

124
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:50,336
And they are that, that becomes their nature.

125
00:22:50,336 --> 00:23:01,785
When it becomes their nature they become people
with complete peace.

126
00:23:01,785 --> 00:23:05,498
They are not disturbed.

127
00:23:05,523 --> 00:23:15,029
They are never disturbed with whatever is
happening and they think it's God's will.

128
00:23:15,054 --> 00:23:23,020
Because nothing can disturb them, nothing
can upset them.

129
00:23:23,045 --> 00:23:30,471
They just enjoy their devotion.

130
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:36,060
Devotion to their guru, maybe.

131
00:23:36,108 --> 00:23:41,291
Devotion to God.

132
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:53,046
In that devotion they may write beautiful
poetry, they may go on dancing, they may go

133
00:23:53,046 --> 00:24:01,796
on singing, because the peace is within and
they are enjoying themselves.

134
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:13,468
When they are alone, they are never alone,
they enjoy themselves.

135
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:27,562
They know that - "We are one with the Divine"
- and the blessing of the Divine they enjoy.

136
00:24:27,587 --> 00:24:33,058
Another thing is they never take to artificiality.

137
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:43,976
They are never worried, never upset, they
are neither futuristic nor think of the past,

138
00:24:43,976 --> 00:24:46,696
but they are in the present.

139
00:24:49,327 --> 00:24:55,896
When they are in the present, they are absolutely
silent.

140
00:24:55,896 --> 00:25:02,749
If there is any problem, or anything happens
to them,

141
00:25:02,888 --> 00:25:07,460
they immediately go into thoughtless awareness.

142
00:25:08,761 --> 00:25:14,445
That is what their capacity is.

143
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:22,426
To become a guru you have to develop that
personality; not to be bound by anything.

144
00:25:22,426 --> 00:25:26,402
Now I'll tell you my own example.

145
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:33,242
I never hurry, I'm never bothered about time.

146
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:41,776
Once I was going to America - because if you
are sure the Divine has plans for you, you

147
00:25:41,776 --> 00:25:48,574
are not bothered, the Divine is looking after
you so why to bother -- I was going to America

148
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:50,506
and one child fell down.

149
00:25:50,506 --> 00:25:57,794
I was just about to get up and go and broke
her arm.

150
00:25:57,819 --> 00:26:02,936
And when I saw the child I said "All right,
I'll put that child right".

151
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,344
"But," they said, "You are going to America!"

152
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:08,429
I said, "I'll go in any case!

153
00:26:08,454 --> 00:26:14,506
"So I cured the child, it took about half
an hour, and then I came out "All right, let's

154
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,078
go to the airport".

155
00:26:16,103 --> 00:26:20,606
They said "Mother you are very late" I said,
"I'm never late.

156
00:26:20,606 --> 00:26:22,790
Let's go!".

157
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:31,210
We went there, to the airport, and the plane
by which I was going was out of order, so

158
00:26:31,235 --> 00:26:35,027
there was another plane going to Washington
not to New York,

159
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:38,871
and I wanted to go to Washington only!

160
00:26:39,085 --> 00:26:46,796
So just imagine how things work out, and we
call them 'Sahaja'.

161
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:54,430
It has worked out 'Sahaja'.

162
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,939
That means it's a effortless.

163
00:27:03,971 --> 00:27:22,646
But first of all your personality should be
such that your devotion is so great that Divine

164
00:27:22,646 --> 00:27:34,128
is compelled to look after you...compelled
to look after you!

165
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:47,469
You have to understand that Divine force is
around you, and this Divine force is absolute

166
00:27:47,494 --> 00:27:51,436
guarantee for your safety.

167
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:56,640
For everything that you want to do.

168
00:27:58,005 --> 00:28:03,056
You can say that "Mother you are very powerful".

169
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,765
You can become also very powerful!

170
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:16,266
If you get completely dedicated to the Divine
work, you will also have all the powers and

171
00:28:16,266 --> 00:28:26,049
the Divine will provide all the necessary
work that you want to do, necessary time that

172
00:28:26,074 --> 00:28:27,565
you have to have.

173
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:33,563
Everything is provided by the Divine.

174
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:44,835
But the compassion, when it extends from other
people to God, or to Divine person, or to

175
00:28:44,869 --> 00:29:00,757
your guru, then it becomes very easy to live,
very simple to live, no complications, everything

176
00:29:00,757 --> 00:29:06,746
is sorted out, and you are not bothered about
anything.

177
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:13,569
You just close your eyes and things work out.

178
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:23,576
Everything works out as if that's your will,
but you don't have to will it, don't have

179
00:29:23,576 --> 00:29:28,876
to think about it, it just works out, but
Divine looks after everything.

180
00:29:28,876 --> 00:29:38,016
It looks after your comfort, looks after your
health, everything.

181
00:29:38,016 --> 00:29:51,866
And this Divine help, you do not seek, you
do not ask for, but you are a personality

182
00:29:51,866 --> 00:29:56,035
for which the Divine is responsible.

183
00:29:56,122 --> 00:30:02,029
You are a special responsibility of the Divine.

184
00:30:02,054 --> 00:30:07,941
And it knows what is good for you and what
is not.

185
00:30:07,966 --> 00:30:16,866
It's an example, I can give many where I,
supposing, I thought somebody is coming to

186
00:30:16,866 --> 00:30:24,108
meet me, and people told me "Mother, he's
very negative", He will never come,

187
00:30:24,133 --> 00:30:26,674
 he'll never come.

188
00:30:26,881 --> 00:30:33,497
All positive things will happen, and if a
negative things take place, then you will

189
00:30:33,522 --> 00:30:36,164
use your compassion.

190
00:30:36,189 --> 00:30:42,067
If it is negative you'll use your compassion
and you'll solve the problem.

191
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:52,117
You can solve the problems of your own, of
your surroundings, of your community.

192
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:56,265
So now you have got your Self realisation.

193
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:00,001
How far you have gone in that I don't know.

194
00:31:00,081 --> 00:31:08,102
I have a complaint about women, so many ladies,
that they don't meditate.

195
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:15,956
That they are not looking after themselves,
they are not realised souls, and that's why

196
00:31:15,956 --> 00:31:24,173
many men want to divorce them because they
think these women are good for nothing.

197
00:31:24,261 --> 00:31:31,411
And some men also are like that.

198
00:31:31,451 --> 00:31:41,926
To solve this problem you have to have compassion,
and you have to, somehow or other, with compassion,

199
00:31:41,926 --> 00:31:48,716
you should win over the partner of your life.

200
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:54,216
After all men are much more busy than women
are.

201
00:31:54,216 --> 00:31:59,266
But women indulge into so many other things.

202
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:05,280
They have to look after their family, their
children, their everything.

203
00:32:05,795 --> 00:32:15,516
And their mind is involved into all such mundane
things that they have no time to meditate.

204
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:19,073
Without meditation you cannot rise.

205
00:32:19,098 --> 00:32:22,786
You have to meditate.

206
00:32:22,786 --> 00:32:25,029
People think that: "Now we have got realisation,
so it's all right".

207
00:32:25,054 --> 00:32:26,218
No!

208
00:32:26,243 --> 00:32:32,775
Every day you must meditate because that's
the cleansing that takes place.

209
00:32:33,276 --> 00:32:38,103
With the cleansing you understand.

210
00:32:38,128 --> 00:32:47,254
You understand what is needed and what is
not needed, you are cleansed out.

211
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,726
That is done by Divine.

212
00:32:49,726 --> 00:32:58,486
But you must religiously meditate.

213
00:32:58,486 --> 00:33:07,485
Gradually you will find your meditation will
become very deep.

214
00:33:07,516 --> 00:33:19,256
You will become very, very deep and your powers
will start showing.

215
00:33:19,256 --> 00:33:25,776
When you are anywhere, negativity will run
away.

216
00:33:25,776 --> 00:33:32,418
All sorts of problems can be solved.

217
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:37,053
Whatever you want to do is available to you.

218
00:33:37,078 --> 00:33:46,936
Whatever is your desire to help others or
give to someone, you just get it.

219
00:33:46,936 --> 00:33:52,046
Is my own experience I'm telling you.

220
00:33:52,046 --> 00:34:02,137
You have to meditate at least 10 minutes every
evening, and morning about 5 minutes.

221
00:34:02,162 --> 00:34:07,756
With complete devotion, with complete admiration.

222
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:18,546
I have seen some people here, such bhakti,
such devotion, which is shraddha - is higher

223
00:34:18,546 --> 00:34:24,446
than bhakti - that it becomes part and parcel
of your being.

224
00:34:24,446 --> 00:34:29,576
It just envelops you completely.

225
00:34:29,576 --> 00:34:35,583
When you have that shraddha, it is very miraculous.

226
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:39,139
It works so many miracles.

227
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:46,891
It's true some people were cured only thinking
of me, is a fact.

228
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:54,536
But that doesn't mean that they had the shraddha
of that level, but that means that they have

229
00:34:54,536 --> 00:34:57,145
to develop shraddha.

230
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:06,195
Now how to develop a shraddha, which is a
natural light of the Spirit.

231
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:19,026
Because people are trying very hard to develop
shraddha, but shraddha cannot be developed

232
00:35:19,026 --> 00:35:26,576
by mental activity, by any activity, but meditation
of silence.

233
00:35:26,576 --> 00:35:33,556
If you do the meditation .... I have always
told you to do meditation.

234
00:35:33,556 --> 00:35:38,940
I immediately know a person who has been meditating
and who has not been.

235
00:35:39,225 --> 00:35:47,776
They'll come to my puja, all right; and they'll
talk about Sahaja Yoga, they'll go out and

236
00:35:47,776 --> 00:35:50,968
do it for popularity.

237
00:35:50,993 --> 00:35:53,466
Many people are like that.

238
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:58,136
They go out, and for popularity they work
it out.

239
00:35:58,136 --> 00:36:04,701
But inside they have not yet traced their
own Self.

240
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:12,928
So at this development stage you should be
encouraged, and [should be] understood that

241
00:36:12,968 --> 00:36:22,396
you can reach that state very easily through
meditation and introspection.

242
00:36:22,396 --> 00:36:33,386
With introspection you will develop a new
quality of understanding that, you will find

243
00:36:33,386 --> 00:36:36,646
solutions to things.

244
00:36:36,671 --> 00:36:42,326
That is another quality a person who is a
realised soul has.

245
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:50,020
It can find solutions to all your problems.

246
00:36:50,115 --> 00:37:00,461
It can, he can suggest what is the way you
can be helped.

247
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:05,899
Then a kind of a brotherhood out of the shraddha
develops.

248
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:12,446
You may be giving big lectures on Sahaja Yoga,
you may be doing all kinds of things, but

249
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:19,573
unless and until you have shraddha, you cannot
rise.

250
00:37:19,598 --> 00:37:29,115
And this shraddha is a kind of a love within
you, I should say, which spreads like gentle

251
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:41,946
fire which doesn't burn, which doesn't give
heat, but cold, beautiful breeze-like feeling

252
00:37:41,946 --> 00:37:45,636
within, which makes you understand.

253
00:37:45,636 --> 00:37:53,264
You will never talk ill about a sahaja yogi,
never.

254
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:59,166
I never listen to anybody who tells me something
against sahaja yogi.

255
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:08,105
Up to a point, when it is a collective complaint,
then I am little bit bothered and I talk about

256
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,296
it to the leader.

257
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:16,976
But otherwise if one person comes and tells
me this and this, I just tell that person

258
00:38:16,976 --> 00:38:20,945
"You introspect yourself , it's not so".

259
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:33,906
Finding faults with others is a common game
all human beings play.

260
00:38:33,906 --> 00:38:36,445
They never see their own faults.

261
00:38:36,477 --> 00:38:40,545
What's the use of finding faults of others?

262
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:46,369
By finding faults with others you're not going
to be helped.

263
00:38:46,394 --> 00:38:52,512
Try to find faults within you, which you can
cure, which you can help,

264
00:38:52,687 --> 00:38:57,347
which you can work it out.

265
00:38:57,372 --> 00:39:05,882
It's a responsibility you have, you must know,
to yourself that you better find out your

266
00:39:05,907 --> 00:39:10,256
defects and get them corrected.

267
00:39:10,256 --> 00:39:17,842
But some people are very proud of their fondness
-- they talk like this,

268
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:20,546
"I like this, I like that".

269
00:39:20,546 --> 00:39:24,465
But what about the Spirit?

270
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:29,236
You like this, you like that, then what about
your Spirit?

271
00:39:29,236 --> 00:39:31,026
Does it like?

272
00:39:31,026 --> 00:39:36,036
Does it enjoy?

273
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:40,196
They'll go on saying "I like this, I don't
like this, I don't like that!"

274
00:39:40,196 --> 00:39:44,726
It's very common in the West.

275
00:39:44,726 --> 00:39:48,956
Now see, some ladies have made this beautiful
carpets for me.

276
00:39:48,956 --> 00:39:57,026
They are so thick that when I walk on them
I little bit lose balance, but the love with

277
00:39:57,026 --> 00:40:06,641
which they are made, makes me so joyous, so
happy, that you can't imagine

278
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:10,184
 what I feel about them.

279
00:40:10,184 --> 00:40:15,822
This joy, this ocean of joy, is within you.

280
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:27,504
And when it starts stirring up, it doesn't
torment you, it gives you beautiful -- I don't

281
00:40:27,505 --> 00:40:36,593
know how to use words to express that -- it's
like a drizzle on your being, it's like a

282
00:40:36,618 --> 00:40:39,305
grace on your being.

283
00:40:39,305 --> 00:40:43,902
The love of other people enthrals you.

284
00:40:44,822 --> 00:40:57,515
You don't ask for it, but if you see a person
who is very loving and kind, there is real

285
00:40:57,515 --> 00:41:00,755
friendship in that kind of relationship.

286
00:41:00,755 --> 00:41:06,887
But talking ill about sahaja yogis, it's very
wrong.

287
00:41:06,912 --> 00:41:13,381
And then talking to everyone that "this is
wrong with this person, he had done this,

288
00:41:13,406 --> 00:41:22,944
he had done that", is very, very wrong and
creating a collective feeling against the

289
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:26,716
person -- instead of helping that person.

290
00:41:26,716 --> 00:41:30,218
Always people are in trouble.

291
00:41:30,243 --> 00:41:33,649
Then collectively you must help that person.

292
00:41:33,674 --> 00:41:35,197
Not talk ill of that person.

293
00:41:35,222 --> 00:41:44,806
May be some mistakes, but if you start talking
against that person and saying that 'This

294
00:41:44,806 --> 00:41:51,254
is wrong with him, that is wrong with him',
then you are not a sahaja yogi.

295
00:41:51,279 --> 00:42:00,737
You are a sahaja yogi as long as you can see
your own defects through introspection.

296
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:07,318
Now many of you, I should say most of you,
have got your realisation.

297
00:42:07,421 --> 00:42:10,413
You had the experience.

298
00:42:10,438 --> 00:42:16,638
But some of you don't have the knowledge.

299
00:42:16,663 --> 00:42:22,919
That knowledge you should acquire, and verify
whether that knowledge

300
00:42:22,944 --> 00:42:25,975
 is really there or not.

301
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:40,626
Like in America, in the N.I.H., which is an
Institute for Health, they wanted to test

302
00:42:40,626 --> 00:42:45,015
a sahaja yogi, and there were doctors.

303
00:42:45,015 --> 00:42:49,197
And one doctor came forward and said "All
right, tell me on your vibration

304
00:42:49,222 --> 00:42:51,515
 what's wrong with me".

305
00:42:51,515 --> 00:43:00,275
So the girl said, "Sir, something wrong with
your heart" and he said, "It's correct" because

306
00:43:00,275 --> 00:43:10,089
he has had a bypass only one month back and
he was out of hospital.

307
00:43:10,114 --> 00:43:13,835
Absolutely correct, and this surprised them.

308
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:19,205
That diagnosis, you see, kills the patient
half way.

309
00:43:19,205 --> 00:43:26,233
So this is the very easy way to diagnose a
person, just by feeling the vibration.

310
00:43:26,258 --> 00:43:31,226
And they have given us such a good attention,

311
00:43:31,251 --> 00:43:37,856
they want to develop Sahaja Yoga in their hospitals.

312
00:43:41,713 --> 00:43:50,741
So you should also testify yourself, examine
yourself and find out about yourself,

313
00:43:50,766 --> 00:43:54,906
 what are you?

314
00:43:55,683 --> 00:44:06,906
Say husband and wife -- now the wife meditates,
she knows everything, she knows about her

315
00:44:06,906 --> 00:44:27,024
husband, what's wrong with him and she doesn't
tell him.

316
00:44:27,175 --> 00:44:36,123
She tolerates, she doesn't complain, she doesn't
ask for anything, she just tolerates.

317
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:46,435
And this tolerance convinces the husband that
she's a higher personality than himself.

318
00:44:46,482 --> 00:44:53,930
He may be anything, but he then understands
that this is what she has achieved,

319
00:44:53,955 --> 00:44:57,077
 a great personality.

320
00:44:57,102 --> 00:45:03,856
We have so many imperfections, especially
morally, in the West, people are really, I

321
00:45:03,856 --> 00:45:07,093
tell you, like one snake has bitten them.

322
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:17,856
The things that people do here never come
into the minds of people who are not developed.

323
00:45:17,856 --> 00:45:29,663
So development has meant all kinds of abandonment,
all kinds of vagabond temperament, and they

324
00:45:29,806 --> 00:45:35,948
think they are very free and they can go about
and enjoy.

325
00:45:35,973 --> 00:45:45,716
This style is very common, but you just judge
yourself.

326
00:45:45,741 --> 00:45:48,695
Are you one of these type?

327
00:45:48,695 --> 00:45:55,336
Or are you one of the people who are higher
than you in their ascent.

328
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:58,655
It's a process, I must confess.

329
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:04,125
It is not just [that] you get to that point.

330
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:13,596
Sometimes even very new sahaja yogis are better
than very old sahaja yogis, but because they

331
00:46:13,596 --> 00:46:16,876
had a very strong desire.

332
00:46:16,901 --> 00:46:19,136
What are we seeking?

333
00:46:19,136 --> 00:46:26,686
We should understand why we were seeking -- because
we wanted to know ourselves.

334
00:46:26,686 --> 00:46:32,562
Somehow, we knew that we have to know ourselves,
and we did not know.

335
00:46:32,601 --> 00:46:33,958
So we seek.

336
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,038
We seek.

337
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:40,911
We do all kinds of things, I mean all wrong
things also in the name of seeking.

338
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:49,797
But it is this seeking brings you to Sahaja
Yoga.

339
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:57,175
Then you have to get your Self realisation,
which is very easy through Kundalini.

340
00:46:57,175 --> 00:47:01,394
Kundalini works out most of the things, most
of the things.

341
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:09,861
Like somebody told me that overnight she gave
up drinking and smoking -- overnight.

342
00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:15,946
I mean I don't tell that, I never say that.

343
00:47:15,977 --> 00:47:22,446
But just overnight she gave up, and she said
"I was very particular about my hair dress

344
00:47:22,557 --> 00:47:29,165
and I used to make my hair dress in a different
manner, going to the hairdressers, spending

345
00:47:29,165 --> 00:47:32,386
so much time with the beautician, this, that".

346
00:47:32,386 --> 00:47:34,730
She said, "I gave it up".

347
00:47:34,755 --> 00:47:43,886
Also she said "I used to wear dresses which
were not very moral, then I started respecting

348
00:47:43,886 --> 00:47:47,876
my body and I started wearing proper dress".

349
00:47:47,876 --> 00:47:57,445
All this knowledge comes to you, spontaneously
it is within you, because it is all your own.

350
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:01,966
Also if your guru tells you, you are guided.

351
00:48:01,991 --> 00:48:05,611
Guru's job is to guide people.

352
00:48:05,802 --> 00:48:10,196
So at this juncture, what is lacking?

353
00:48:10,196 --> 00:48:14,418
What is lacking in Sahaja Yoga?

354
00:48:14,443 --> 00:48:16,918
That I have to tell you.

355
00:48:16,973 --> 00:48:23,621
There are so many collective disasters we
have - all kinds of.

356
00:48:23,646 --> 00:48:33,435
We had many earthquakes, we had many floods,
rain, then the muds - mud came down like a

357
00:48:33,435 --> 00:48:41,035
river; and so many disasters in the world
and sahaja yogis are saved from that.

358
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:46,891
All the sahaja yogis are saved from that,
no doubt, but after being saved,

359
00:48:46,916 --> 00:48:50,043
 what is your understanding?

360
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,767
What do you know?

361
00:48:52,792 --> 00:48:56,513
Why these disasters are coming?

362
00:48:56,538 --> 00:49:01,254
Because Sahaja Yoga is not very collective.

363
00:49:01,279 --> 00:49:04,035
It has to become very collective.

364
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:08,142
It has to spread much more, all over.

365
00:49:08,221 --> 00:49:12,366
It has to go to many people, which we don't
do.

366
00:49:12,391 --> 00:49:16,858
We are at a standstill, or little bit we do
it.

367
00:49:16,937 --> 00:49:18,954
But go all out!

368
00:49:18,979 --> 00:49:21,989
Look at Christ's twelve disciples!

369
00:49:22,014 --> 00:49:26,714
Of course the people went into wrong things.

370
00:49:26,793 --> 00:49:34,279
But how they worked and how intensively they
did it.

371
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:44,046
That intensity if you don't have, and if you
do not completely dedicate to the spreading

372
00:49:44,046 --> 00:49:52,396
of Sahaja Yoga, then collective problems cannot
be solved.

373
00:49:52,421 --> 00:49:58,126
You are busy with your daily mundane things,
and your other jobs and everything; it's all

374
00:49:58,151 --> 00:50:01,880
right, in Sahaja Yoga no objection.

375
00:50:01,905 --> 00:50:14,371
But you should have your attention more on
to this side of life that - 'What are we doing

376
00:50:14,396 --> 00:50:16,201
for the collective?

377
00:50:16,226 --> 00:50:18,177
Are we talking about it?

378
00:50:18,202 --> 00:50:20,107
Are we spreading Sahaja Yoga?

379
00:50:20,132 --> 00:50:24,686
Are we making people know about it?'

380
00:50:24,686 --> 00:50:28,786
I was surprised, once I was coming by plane

381
00:50:28,811 --> 00:50:36,803
and a lady sat next to me and had very bad vibrations.

382
00:50:40,138 --> 00:50:49,893
I put myself into bandhan, and I asked her
what is she doing for her spirituality, and

383
00:50:49,918 --> 00:50:53,445
she gave the name of 'Bahai' people.

384
00:50:53,445 --> 00:50:56,505
"My God" I said.

385
00:50:56,505 --> 00:51:01,995
If these people spread out, they are so spread
out, they are so many!

386
00:51:01,995 --> 00:51:03,986
So, what will happen?

387
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:06,186
Disasters!

388
00:51:06,186 --> 00:51:14,235
They are such negative people, impossible
that they can do any good to the world.

389
00:51:14,235 --> 00:51:23,716
And like that you see, anybody, false guru,
how people are driven to them, how they take

390
00:51:23,716 --> 00:51:26,306
to them, and how they spread their message.

391
00:51:26,306 --> 00:51:35,186
I have seen people singing on the road, singing
the praise of their guru, and also wearing

392
00:51:35,186 --> 00:51:39,966
funny dresses -- we don't want that kind of
a thing.

393
00:51:39,991 --> 00:51:46,608
But of course you have got the knowledge,
of course you are realised souls.

394
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:50,859
But what have you done for Sahaja Yoga is
the point.

395
00:51:50,914 --> 00:51:57,468
You have to spread Sahaja Yoga...everywhere.

396
00:51:57,753 --> 00:52:07,285
For example, you wear a badge, then they will
ask you "What is this supposed to be?"

397
00:52:07,285 --> 00:52:11,430
Then you have to tell them what is it, something.

398
00:52:11,455 --> 00:52:14,155
You start talking about Sahaja Yoga only!

399
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:17,296
Talk nothing else but Sahaja Yoga.

400
00:52:17,321 --> 00:52:24,076
You have to go on talking about Sahaja Yoga,
spreading Sahaja Yoga: unless and until you

401
00:52:24,076 --> 00:52:29,856
do it, it won't become collective, and all
the disasters, which are due to collective

402
00:52:29,856 --> 00:52:34,430
nonsense, you get it.

403
00:52:35,391 --> 00:52:38,817
You are saved from so many things.

404
00:52:38,842 --> 00:52:44,063
Say even if there's pollution, for a sahaja
yogi it won't matter.

405
00:52:44,088 --> 00:52:51,494
Even if there is a disaster of an earthquake
the sahaja yogi will be saved.

406
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:55,046
But why not save the whole world?

407
00:52:55,071 --> 00:53:03,086
Calamities after calamities are coming, and
if you have compassion you must think of the

408
00:53:03,086 --> 00:53:08,954
people who can get into any calamity or into
any trouble.

409
00:53:08,979 --> 00:53:13,966
Of course I can cure many people, no doubt.

410
00:53:13,966 --> 00:53:18,435
But I don't know how to make Sahaja Yoga very
collective.

411
00:53:18,435 --> 00:53:27,285
Now you are so many people here, you all can
start giving realisation to at least 100 people.

412
00:53:27,285 --> 00:53:29,096
Go everywhere.

413
00:53:29,096 --> 00:53:32,433
Talk about Sahaja Yoga.

414
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:40,405
Sing the praise of the Divine, and you will
save the whole world.

415
00:53:40,405 --> 00:53:49,496
It is not by saving some few people you can
have the great Satya Yuga, but you have also

416
00:53:49,496 --> 00:53:52,076
to save this Mother Earth.

417
00:53:52,076 --> 00:53:54,655
You have to save the people who are in it.

418
00:53:54,655 --> 00:54:01,311
I mean, the way these people are, I have seen
so many of them on the television.

419
00:54:01,336 --> 00:54:06,277
They, shamelessly they are talking about something
which they don't know.

420
00:54:06,302 --> 00:54:10,035
And they have thousands and thousands of people
behind them.

421
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:13,608
Not that the people are stupid.

422
00:54:13,633 --> 00:54:23,715
Not that they want to go on a wrong path,
but these people who are false, or who are

423
00:54:23,715 --> 00:54:29,508
wrong, know how to entice them, how to capture
them, how to talk to them.

424
00:54:29,564 --> 00:54:39,475
But a sahaja yogi, you see, if he sees somebody
with a negative vibrations will run away.

425
00:54:39,704 --> 00:54:46,473
He will escape such a society, will not go
near them, and will say "Oh, very bad vibrations,

426
00:54:46,515 --> 00:54:48,328
we don't want!".

427
00:54:48,353 --> 00:54:56,488
So you have to be courageous and get into
these places, talk to people and make it collective.

428
00:54:56,513 --> 00:55:02,005
Otherwise you cannot save this world from
the wrath of God.

429
00:55:02,005 --> 00:55:04,930
God is wrathful, no doubt.

430
00:55:05,462 --> 00:55:09,195
For you, he'll save you, but what's the use?

431
00:55:09,195 --> 00:55:13,093
We have to save this Mother Earth.

432
00:55:13,118 --> 00:55:20,906
And for that you have to be prepared, you
have to work it out, and whenever you get

433
00:55:20,906 --> 00:55:24,040
a chance you must spread Sahaja Yoga.

434
00:55:24,065 --> 00:55:28,566
Some people told me "Mother, if you come then
it will be All right" Why?

435
00:55:28,566 --> 00:55:34,106
What's so much? .... you can be also like
me.

436
00:55:34,106 --> 00:55:36,539
You can talk about it to people.

437
00:55:36,564 --> 00:55:43,562
I started Sahaja Yoga with one person and,
that time, it was complete darkness everywhere.

438
00:55:43,587 --> 00:55:50,340
No seekers, nothing, and horrible people,
but it worked and it cleared.

439
00:55:50,365 --> 00:55:55,680
So one person can get so many sahaja yogis,
why not you people do the same

440
00:55:55,705 --> 00:55:57,624
and talk about it.

441
00:55:57,649 --> 00:56:06,594
Your behaviour, your style, everything will
definitely impress them.

442
00:56:06,619 --> 00:56:17,312
One has to work it out in such a manner that
you achieve our goal of collective consciousness.

443
00:56:17,494 --> 00:56:21,158
It is not only for sahaja yogis, it's for
everyone.

444
00:56:21,191 --> 00:56:27,886
So that all these calamities that are happening,
horrible things that are happening, will stop.

445
00:56:27,886 --> 00:56:31,829
Completely stop, I assure you, it can be stopped.

446
00:56:31,932 --> 00:56:34,364
Because you are always saved.

447
00:56:34,389 --> 00:56:38,955
So all people who will be getting realisation
will be saved.

448
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:46,015
Why not talk openly about it telling people
that if we do wrong, if we are immoral, if

449
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:58,206
we are cheats, if we try to oppress others
and we become so much a power of destruction

450
00:56:58,231 --> 00:57:10,038
then this collective disasters will be there
and I think we'll be responsible for that.

451
00:57:10,307 --> 00:57:15,366
Everything you take up, any subject you take
up, you don't have to start an organisation

452
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:17,176
to fight it.

453
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:23,764
But only your power of convincing people and
bringing them to Sahaja Yoga will make such

454
00:57:23,789 --> 00:57:25,435
a difference.

455
00:57:25,435 --> 00:57:30,066
I hope you will understand as a guru what
you have to do.

456
00:57:30,066 --> 00:57:39,785
As a guru there are so many things and as
your character, yesterday, as they showed

457
00:57:39,785 --> 00:57:48,856
how Lao Tse has written about the masters,
how they were above all of it, above turmoil,

458
00:57:48,881 --> 00:57:55,213
above jealousies, above talking loose.

459
00:57:55,269 --> 00:58:02,100
They are so great, they are the masters and
they will be the masters and you will be the

460
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:05,725
gurus if you try to do that.

461
00:58:05,725 --> 00:58:08,332
This is what you have to achieve.

462
00:58:08,357 --> 00:58:15,409
I know some have achieved it, but most of
you have to achieve, with compassion and love.

463
00:58:15,436 --> 00:58:18,436
May God Bless You All
