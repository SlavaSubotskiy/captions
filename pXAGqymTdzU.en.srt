1
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:15,690
I am very fortunate and I am very happy that 
I could come to Santa Cruz.

2
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:27,570
I can see what I am facing is the ocean of 
Love, the seekers of Love, the people who

3
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,860
are seeking the Truth.

4
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,460
Gregoire has told you all these things because 
he is very earnest, he is very concerned,

5
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:42,860
he knows you are seekers and that’s why 
he has told you in these words, so don’t

6
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,860
be frightened.

7
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,320
There is nothing to be frightened about anything.

8
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:55,110
You are seekers and you are a special category.

9
00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:00,820
In the eyes of God, seekers are the highest 
creation that He has created.

10
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,830
You are the highest of all.

11
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:19,240
To Him it does not matter who are rich, who 
are in power, who are leading a life of so-called

12
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
success.

13
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,930
It does not matter to Him at all, He does 
not understand that, He does not know that.

14
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:29,100
Christ has said that these people if they 
want gold, let them have.

15
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:34,380
They’ll have bars of gold and live with 
it.

16
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:48,740
But “if they seek Me, if they love Me,” 
then these people who are seekers today are

17
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,920
going to enter into the Kingdom of God and 
He will eat with them.

18
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,720
They will sit at the same table.

19
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,280
You are respected because you are seekers.

20
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,500
You are loved because you are seekers.

21
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:14,650
And you have survived despite all the attacks 
on you.

22
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,260
These are all attacks.

23
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:22,120
You are naîve, you are simple, you were innocent 
at that time when attacks came in.

24
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,840
Now gradually you are discovering that it 
was an attack.

25
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,980
Everything that you did was just to put you 
down.

26
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:41,540
And one person who was negative of that kind 
would come forward and assert and use all

27
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:47,200
the negative forces to push you down.

28
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,060
To me you are my children.

29
00:22:52,060 --> 00:23:01,060
To me I don’t think what you have done because 
you didn’t meet me that time.

30
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,480
I take the load upon myself.

31
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,980
I did come to San Jose last time.

32
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:16,760
They said that there are lots of seekers settling 
down in Santa Cruz.

33
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:29,150
I wanted to come and see you here that time 
only, but the experience I had of the people

34
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:33,910
who were there, I thought, “They are not 
just now seeking God, but they are sort of

35
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:43,010
seeking ego or superego, they are seeking 
into a new style of life and a new style of

36
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:47,070
understanding, because they have found out 
that material life is of no value, it’s

37
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,840
not going to give them joy."

38
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:56,230
At that time, when I said that, and you are 
thinking of these things, how can you pay

39
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,230
for it?

40
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,070
Nobody could understand these things.

41
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,740
It was very difficult to talk to them – that 
it is spontaneous, it is your own right, that

42
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,730
you have to get it.

43
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:09,180
You have been seeking for ages now, not only 
in this life time.

44
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:15,540
You have been saints in many lives and now 
you are born here to seek it.

45
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,400
It’s so simple as that.

46
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,040
It has to happen, that’s your nature, that’s 
what you are.

47
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:29,770
You try anything else, you won’t be satisfied 
‘till you have found out the Truth.

48
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,580
But that time nobody would listen to me.

49
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:39,180
It was a very funny situation and I ultimately 
decided that let them find out for themselves

50
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,660
to begin with.

51
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,470
When they will find it out, they have to reach 
the right conclusion.

52
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:53,500
Because there is one problem in the seeking, 
that you have to seek in your own freedom,

53
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:59,220
in your own glory of your own choice.

54
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:03,870
Because if you are to be liberated, it has 
to be a free choice.

55
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:09,620
If a person is not free, say, he is enticed 
or he is hypnotised or he is overpowered by

56
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,750
others, he has no freedom at all of any kind.

57
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,580
Such a person is useless to enter into the 
Kingdom of God.

58
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:24,780
If you have to become the King, then you have 
to have that basic freedom in yourself intact.

59
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:31,430
But freedom doesn’t mean ego by any chance.

60
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:38,120
If you think: “I like it, I love it, I do 
it,” that’s not the Spirit.

61
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,190
You are not seekers of ego, I must tell you 
very frankly, you are not.

62
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:48,090
You are seekers of Truth, of Love, of Joy.

63
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,130
For ages you’ve been seeking that.

64
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:58,290
Joy is the result when you get to that position 
where you become your Spirit, your Atma.

65
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:03,440
You should be in Joy, not talking about it, 
but enjoying it.

66
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,310
And that has to happen to you.

67
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:11,120
It’s a happening for which you have built 
in for ages.

68
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:20,280
Today, in general, I will tell you what you 
are really and what you have to expect.

69
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,720
Nobody has told you about it.

70
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,940
They said, “All right, you’ll come to 
us into a new age."

71
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,960
“All right,” people said.

72
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:36,310
“Let’s go and join!” Somebody says that 
you’ll get this.

73
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,310
You joined.

74
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:42,880
William Blake is one of the greatest prophets 
of the modern times.

75
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:50,500
For you Western people, he said that “The 
men of God,” that means you people.

76
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,400
You are people of God.

77
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,250
You are not of this gross level.

78
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,310
If people don’t understand you that does 
not mean that I don’t understand.

79
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,720
I know you, what you are.

80
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,000
I know what it is, I can feel it.

81
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:13,840
He said, “Men of God will become prophets, 
and these prophets will have powers to make

82
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,400
others prophets."

83
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:27,680
This is what we have to expect within ourselves.

84
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:42,190
So you have to become the prophet and you 
have to make others prophet.

85
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:50,940
Now this is the point you should judge: Have 
you become the prophet?

86
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,490
What is a prophet?

87
00:27:54,490 --> 00:28:04,770
Prophet is a person who can feel the all-pervading 
power around.

88
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,310
Now I said there is all-pervading power of 
Love.

89
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:14,270
Oh you also sing the song, they say, “Yes, 
there is all-pervading power."

90
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:19,210
Many people also feel that they are feeling 
it, but it’s not true.

91
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:23,870
We have to be honest to ourselves because 
we are seekers, we should not cheat ourselves

92
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:30,360
because this is ego that makes you cheat.

93
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,280
This intelligence is the worst thing.

94
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:38,550
Gregoire himself told me one day, “I find 
my intelligence is trying to cheat me."

95
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,050
Very intelligently.

96
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:48,690
So one has to be very careful to understand 
that you have to become that.

97
00:28:48,690 --> 00:29:00,260
If you play around with your ego, your superego, 
your conditionings or mesmerism or hypnosis,

98
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,780
and your ideas about having a kind of life, 
you are the loser.

99
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:10,260
All that could be a great barrier to be the 
Spirit, which is a different thing altogether,

100
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,060
is beyond this.

101
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:20,540
So when you become the Spirit, what happens 
to you, what should you expect?

102
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:26,670
Of course it’s true that this all-pervading 
power is there.

103
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:34,730
If I say there are lots of plays going on 
here, there is a music going on here, you

104
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,730
won’t believe.

105
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:41,650
If I bring the television and say, “Now, 
this is the one which is going to show you."

106
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,650
You will say, “Oh."

107
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,650
I mean, you know it.

108
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,820
But in India, if I take it to a village who 
has never seen a television, they’ll say,

109
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,200
“This box?

110
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,220
How can it do it?” But you put it to the 
mains and fantastic things can happen.

111
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,000
It catches all that.

112
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:05,100
In the same way, when you become that, when 
you get a little breakthrough, it’s just

113
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,610
the plugging to the mains.

114
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,760
You are all ready for that.

115
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,440
And the fantastic thing happens.

116
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,320
First you start feeling it all around.

117
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,040
Now don’t jump into ego.

118
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,000
That’s not the end of it.

119
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,480
You first start feeling it.

120
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:33,740
Then you start understanding that your centres 
are on your fingertips.

121
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:42,700
It means that you are the master of that.

122
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:51,160
Then I’m here just to decode it, to tell 
you, that this is what this finger means.

123
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,320
You verify it.

124
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,880
It is so much surprising when people verify 
it.

125
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,720
There was a gentleman in London.

126
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:10,810
I had seven hippies in London and I worked 
on them for four years, English people are

127
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,690
a little difficult to crack.

128
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:22,390
But after four years they really got their 
realization in a proper way and after that

129
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:28,470
now we have thousands of people who are realized 
in England.

130
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:33,870
Because once they find something, then they 
get to it.

131
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:37,040
They’re not the people who are shifty.

132
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,930
Somehow they have that much wisdom, that balance 
in them.

133
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:49,230
They understand that if you have found a little 
water in a place, then go on digging there

134
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,640
alone to have the well.

135
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,920
They don’t leave that and go to another 
place and dig well and dig well and dig well.

136
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,850
They can know where to stop.

137
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:04,800
So these people were very skeptical in the 
beginning.

138
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:13,910
One of them got Realization and he said, “Mother, 
it is all pervading, it has got telecommunication

139
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,290
and everything.

140
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:22,120
What about my Father who has not telephoned 
to me and who always writes to me and has

141
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,300
not written to me?

142
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,620
He’s in Scotland."

143
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:28,160
I said, “You trunk call him just now."

144
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,770
I said, “You feel it.

145
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,450
Just put your hands like that."

146
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,310
And he said,”I am getting a burning here."

147
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:40,000
I said:”That means he must be down with 
very bad bronchitis.

148
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,950
These are the centers of your father and this 
is the finger which denotes this center.

149
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,120
You telephone to him and find out."

150
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:57,500
He telephoned to him and the mother said exactly 
the same centers, that he’s down with very

151
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,810
bad bronchitis.

152
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,870
This could be a cock and bull story.

153
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:11,740
The way Gregoire was telling you, he was trying 
to establish my credibility to you, because

154
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,300
it is such an apologetic condition in which 
I have come.

155
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,190
It‘s a very funny situation, I know that.

156
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:25,370
The other day I went to see a very influential 
Indian man.

157
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:29,370
Of course, he knows me, because of my husband 
maybe.

158
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:36,060
He knows that a person of that status may 
not come to this level of cheating others,

159
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,060
whatever it is.

160
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:47,450
But still he told me that he can’t understand 
how people are taking to these horrible gurus

161
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:53,770
and how these gurus came and cheated me also 
and I helped them.

162
00:33:53,770 --> 00:34:06,890
In Sahaja Yoga, it’s a spontaneous happening, 
a living happening.

163
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:12,910
You are a living being and the force of God 
is also living.

164
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:27,290
Just like a fruit comes out of a flower, just 
like this living process takes place, you

165
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,970
become your Spirit.

166
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:36,550
We never think this thing is around us, every 
day we see.

167
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,820
This is worked out by this all pervading Power.

168
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:43,060
We can’t do even with one flower.

169
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:47,560
We cannot transform even one flower into a 
fruit.

170
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,590
We take it for granted.

171
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:52,760
We never know that all such living things 
are done.

172
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,760
Now look at it.

173
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,560
There is a little bird, which lays the egg.

174
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,630
For what?

175
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,250
The eggs are kept in the nest.

176
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:10,270
The all pervading Power works it out in such 
a way that the eggs grow and the bird hatches

177
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:17,020
them and from these eggs comes out a bird.

178
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,870
We have seen caterpillars turning into butterflies.

179
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,250
We never think how it happens.

180
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,620
We just take it for granted.

181
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,200
We enjoy their colors.

182
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:34,940
We never see how this transformation has taken 
place and this transmutation has taken place.

183
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:41,870
In Sanskrit language a realized soul is called 
as dwijaha, is the one who is born twice.

184
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:44,000
Of course, this is also another problem.

185
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,110
Last time I said you are to be born actually 
again.

186
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,660
It is a living process.

187
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:57,200
The Kundalini has to move throughout the centers 
and you have to feel the actualization of

188
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,380
your Realization, meaning that you must feel 
the cool breeze coming out of your fontanelle

189
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,760
bone area.

190
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,670
Realization you have to feel.

191
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:10,620
It’s an actualization, not a vague belief, 
I told them hundred times.

192
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,620
And they were taping me.

193
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,050
Some people told me, ”Mother, don’t allow 
them to tape."

194
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,630
I said, “Let them tape! What’s the matter?

195
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,570
I am not running any enterprise."

196
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:26,120
They said, “No, they will use it for some 
purpose."

197
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,500
I said, “Let them use it.

198
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,190
For what purpose they are going to use I don’t 
understand."

199
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,160
I don’t understand these human laws.

200
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,540
I am very bad at it.

201
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:38,370
And human beings I am also worse.

202
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:43,920
These people met me the other day in Sydney 
after so many years.

203
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,490
They have branded themselves as born again.

204
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:52,290
And they just self-certificated that we are 
born again.

205
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,300
I said, ”But how?”

206
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,810
“But we are born again."

207
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:02,470
“But what is the proof that you are born 
again, my children?

208
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,180
How do you believe you are born again?

209
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,710
There must be some proof of it.

210
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,800
“Oh, we are born again.

211
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
Finished."

212
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,820
Now, you cannot self-certify yourself.

213
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,100
If you do that, it is Ego.

214
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,240
Understand that.

215
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:23,970
If you are born again, you should be able 
to feel the centers of other people, you should

216
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:31,650
be able to feel your own centers, you should 
be able to judge yourself and cure yourself

217
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,480
and you could cure others.

218
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:39,120
Not only that, but you can raise their Kundalini 
and give them Realization.

219
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:46,460
This is the minimum of minimums to them.

220
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,350
I mean an egg, if it is chanting, “I am 
a bird,” does it become?

221
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:53,480
It’s an egg and an egg is an egg.

222
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:03,840
If it says, “Oh, I am 
a bird."

223
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,610
It can’t fly.

224
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:08,560
It has to really fly.

225
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,660
Some of the nursery rhymes are Humpty Dumpty 
sat on the wall.

226
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,170
That’s what they are.

227
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:17,030
They believe that they are great people.

228
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:23,040
They sat on the wall and when they fell down, 
all the King’s horses and all the King’s

229
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,220
men could not put them together again.

230
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:31,280
This is a make believe, that we are born again.

231
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,380
But it’s of no use to you.

232
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,140
You are Seekers.

233
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,380
You are nothing but Seekers of Spirit.

234
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,300
Accept that situation, first of all.

235
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,090
Accept your Self.

236
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:51,700
These false certificates are not going to 
help you, by any chance.

237
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:56,910
Again I go away, you find another Guru, get 
after him, get after another, get after another

238
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:57,910
one.

239
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,140
Some of them just end up into a lunatic Asylum.

240
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,910
I don’t know what to do with them.

241
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:11,100
When this happens to you, physically you feel 
all right.

242
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,540
I mean cancers can only be cured through your 
Kundalini awakening.

243
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,470
I’ve been saying this for the last ten years.

244
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:21,790
I’ve also cured cancer automatically of 
people as a by product.

245
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:26,540
All diseases get cured.-That is the minimum 
of minimum that should happen to you.

246
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:33,100
After all, Realization is not some sort of 
a cheap thing you can buy in the market like

247
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,390
a take away food.

248
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:43,590
It is your Spirit, which is an eternal Being, 
which you achieve.

249
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,020
You achieve your absolute value.

250
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:49,280
You become that though it happens so spontaneously, 
so easily that you can’t believe.

251
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,460
Now you have no self esteem.

252
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:56,010
You can’t believe it that you have really 
got it in the beginning.

253
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,030
People just don’t believe it.

254
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,530
It is impossible.

255
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:06,580
And when they don’t believe it, they don’t 
want to practice it any further.

256
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,940
It’s so surprising.

257
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:17,630
First you have to get the sprouting of Kundalini 
and then you have to allow it to grow and

258
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:23,560
once you grow into it, then you are like a 
tree.

259
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,850
As Gregoire says it’s true.

260
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:35,370
He was here in Santa Cruz, went to Berkeley, 
there he met a very good Sahaja Yogi from

261
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:39,160
India and just came down to London.

262
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,940
That time I saw him and I said, “Look at 
this Seeker coming down."

263
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:48,700
I went to receive him at the station and I 
was surprised – he was so frantic, he was

264
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:54,310
so upset and I was surprised that the centers… 
I know what he was.

265
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,090
He is a Seeker, I know that.

266
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:59,670
That had such love, and such feeling.

267
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,210
I said, “ Look at this my child.

268
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,210
Where is he lost?

269
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:06,510
What has happened to you?”

270
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:11,910
Now, we have to know what we are, what we 
have to achieve and where we are to go.

271
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:12,910
That’s an important thing.

272
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:20,350
As I have told you, you must know what you 
have to achieve, what you get.

273
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,820
In a very gross way I’ve told you.

274
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:26,890
Actually, it’s so dynamic, it is so fantastic 
that if I tell you any more stories of it,

275
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:31,340
you’d say it’s really a cock and bull 
story.

276
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,340
But there is God.

277
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:40,720
He’s there, no doubt and He is dynamic and 
He is all powerful and that He is all Love

278
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,500
and that He loves you so much that he wants 
you to enjoy His Kingdom.

279
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,140
It’s true, no doubt about it.

280
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:53,200
I am here to prove everything to you, not 
to talk and give sermons and all that, but

281
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,330
to prove it to you.

282
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:08,050
And his Powers are so fantastic, at every 
level how they work out is amazing.

283
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:10,400
You have to just become.

284
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,160
Becoming is the main thing.

285
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:19,540
Now, as far as I am concerned, I am Your Mother.

286
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:24,670
You have every right on me.

287
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:29,250
I shouldn’t say I am your guru because I 
am only here to connect you to your Self and

288
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:34,040
you become your own guru.

289
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,790
Once you are connected to the mains you become 
your own guru.

290
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:39,170
You know this Warren Reeves, Dr.

291
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,170
Warren Reeves.

292
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:48,290
He came to me and I had to stick on to him 
because he was all the time running away.

293
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:54,170
He has been to so many gurus who pampered 
his ego –-”Oh, you are a great seeker,”

294
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,470
“You are already a realized soul."

295
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:03,550
All these things are sticking onto his head 
and it was very difficult to get him together.

296
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:06,330
And also I do not work in the city.

297
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:10,960
I actually work in the villages of India where 
really thousands of people have got realization.

298
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,980
We have seen six thousand people get their 
Self realization at a time.

299
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:23,630
But Indians are wise people and they are the 
people who do not indulge into extremes.

300
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:27,530
In their seeking also they are wise and they 
know what to expect.

301
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:30,790
So, it’s easy for me to work out.

302
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:36,410
They are innocent people still not exposed 
to the material things that you have.

303
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:39,810
Though you’ve denied it, but you can’t 
help it.

304
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:42,240
Your brain is modern.

305
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,570
You may try to look like primitive people.

306
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:45,590
The brain is modern.

307
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,730
What can you do?

308
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,950
Think, think, think, think, think.

309
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:52,710
Just by changing your brain, you do not become 
that.

310
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,500
This is the point we should know.

311
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:59,250
So, it’s easy there to work it out and in 
the Indian villages you don’t even get sometimes

312
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,760
a car to move out.

313
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:07,190
You have to go in a bullock cart and there 
is no bathroom, you have to go to the river.

314
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,820
It’s all right for a change or holiday, 
but when you have to be with me three months

315
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,070
like that, it was too much for him.

316
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:20,850
But still he managed and now you will be amazed, 
he has established seven centers in seven

317
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,900
cities in Australia.

318
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:28,900
If you ask him how many people he has given 
realization, he will say, “I don’t remember."

319
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,240
So, one light which has been enlightened, 
can enlighten another light.

320
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,930
But the first light has to be an enlightened 
light.

321
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:42,300
Once you say that you are enlightened, everybody’s 
ego starts coming up.

322
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,740
It’s very common with the Western people.

323
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:50,280
Every time I went to some place they said, 
“Why you of all the things, Mother?”

324
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,760
I said, “It’s all right.

325
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,070
You come along, It’s a good idea.

326
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:55,760
I would like to retire."

327
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,440
I said, “My husband would pay a man who 
can do my job.

328
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:06,720
It’s a thankless job to work for days and 
nights together and he will be very happy

329
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:27,410
to do that for you."

330
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:36,560
This problem of becoming is not yours, is 
mine for the time being.

331
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,400
When you become that, then it is yours.

332
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,730
Once I know how to swim I can save you.

333
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:48,480
If I do not know how to swim how can I make 
you swim?

334
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,000
When you learn how to swim you can also save 
other people.

335
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It’s very simple.

336
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,860
But even if you say it is saving, people get 
frightened.

337
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:59,810
No, it’s becoming.

338
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:01,720
It’s what you are.

339
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,640
To get to that is the point.

340
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:12,510
I would like to tell you what we are and what 
is going to happen to us when we become realized

341
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:13,510
souls.

342
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:16,280
It’s a gross manifestation of the powers 
I told you.

343
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:22,720
When you became human beings you got your 
awareness in a different way than the animals

344
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,130
have, because for the animals, for example, 
they do not understand the beauty of this

345
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,130
room.

346
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:28,130
They won’t.

347
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:31,650
They don’t understand anything that is filthy 
or dirty, they have no smell power.

348
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:32,650
Somehow they’ve managed.

349
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:37,920
They can live under any circumstances without 
smelling anything.

350
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,060
We don’t have to learn anything from animals.

351
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:49,210
We are on top of all the creation and we have 
to assume our position.

352
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:57,250
Once you have assumed your position, you become 
that and once you become that, then you will

353
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:00,610
be surprised to see how fantastic you are.

354
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,170
That is the discovery you have to have.

355
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:08,920
Within ourselves I think all of you got this 
unique discovery so it’s easy for you to

356
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,980
see what I’m about to say.

357
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:16,420
You will be amazed this lecture which I gave 
about ten years back in India to begin with

358
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,870
after there have been many lectures.

359
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:22,660
But if you have this is a good idea.

360
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,570
You can go home and see for yourself.

361
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:26,730
But you also have a little pamphlet.

362
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:31,640
On the back side is the complete picture of 
the Kundalini.

363
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:56,480
Now, this is the God, the Primordial Being, 
who has made you in His own image.

364
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:01,940
But still there’s the reflector, the human 
being, which is not complete.

365
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:13,470
Within us lies this subtle mechanism, which 
is called the tantra.

366
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:22,520
This is the real tantra, holy tantra, is an 
auspicious thing, which gives us righteousness.

367
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:28,250
You see, when we think of the tantrikas, they 
are the worst of all.

368
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:32,980
They do all kinds of violence, they teach 
all kinds of nonsensical things.

369
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:36,190
I mean they indulge into any kind of sex.

370
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:44,110
They use your women, they use your money, 
they do all kinds of things.

371
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:52,760
This is the holy mechanism, this is the pure 
mechanism, is the purity, is completely pure

372
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,340
Love, is not biased.

373
00:48:55,340 --> 00:49:09,440
This mechanism exists within you and expresses 
itself outside in the gross also to a great

374
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,440
extent.

375
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:30,030
It expresses itself, on the left-hand side, 
as the power of your Desire (iccha shakti).

376
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:35,590
This expresses itself within us as our emotions, 
as our psyche.

377
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:40,630
Gregoire has rightly said that Freud was quite 
half-baked because he knew only one part of

378
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:45,160
the human being and that, too, was very little 
of the psyche.

379
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,220
Because all the scientists see things from 
outside in.

380
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:53,240
If you see a tree from outside, if there is 
something wrong with the leaf, you try to

381
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,470
treat the leaf.

382
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:58,980
But how to treat the whole tree is through 
the roots.

383
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:07,270
So you go to the roots of your being and these 
are the roots.

384
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:16,060
One side of it is the Power of Desire and 
it works out after the first center.

385
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:21,370
I’ll be telling you tomorrow morning about 
these centers.

386
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:29,590
The another power is the power of action, 
this yellow color.

387
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:32,740
It enacts your Desire.

388
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:37,820
This gives you your future.

389
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:43,140
You enter into your future by your planning, 
by your thinking, for working out.

390
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,720
The left side gives you your past.

391
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:55,060
It goes on accumulating on the left-hand side 
and the deeper you move on the left-hand side

392
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,340
there is the collective subconscious.

393
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:01,140
First the subconscious and then the collective 
subconscious.

394
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:10,240
Now this is very important to know that when 
we indulge too much into the left subconscious,

395
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:16,450
that is a very dangerous situation, as well 
as if you move into your right-hand side is

396
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:24,600
the supra conscious and then to the collective 
supraconscious, is also a very dangerous situation.

397
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:32,040
Moving into the left and the right is the 
easy thing for human beings to do because

398
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:39,900
if you want to do something, if you try to 
do something about it and if you are not spontaneous,

399
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,740
what happens?

400
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:49,620
Your sympathetic nervous system, which is 
governed by this subtle energy, goes into

401
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:54,720
action and you either move into the left side 
or into the right side.

402
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:01,730
For example, if you want to run, as these 
days many people are just running, (You can

403
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:04,900
run once in a while, but all the time running 
– what is the need?

404
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,090
Human beings are delicate things.

405
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:13,670
The way we go headlong into everything like 
a bull in a china shop is not necessary.

406
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:19,360
The way you ruin yourself also, because you 
think this body is your own, do what you like.

407
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,290
You must respect your body.

408
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:28,190
This is the Temple of God.) So, when you start 
overdoing something on the left or the right

409
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:33,750
side, say some people are crying, weeping, 
singing praise of death and all that, so have

410
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:34,750
it.

411
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,970
Some people say we must suffer.

412
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:40,090
Alright, then you suffer, have Hitler on top 
of your head.

413
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:45,040
If you want more, you can have them, any number.

414
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:54,270
There are already so many coming to make you 
suffer.

415
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:56,040
There is no need for you to suffer.

416
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,610
Somebody has suffered for you, once and for 
all.

417
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:01,680
You are just ready to enter into the Kingdom 
of God.

418
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:07,450
If you try to go too much on the left-hand 
side or too much on the right-hand side, you

419
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,690
feel that you have gone into a new world.

420
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:12,150
You have not.

421
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:21,240
For example, take a simple thing like LSD.

422
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:25,310
When you take LSD, you move to the right side.

423
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:28,040
You start seeing the eyes and all that.

424
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:35,360
Actually, you put your Ego to the right-hand 
side and you start seeing that and once you

425
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,350
see that you do not become anything, you just 
see it.

426
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:43,760
Seeing it is not becoming, you have to become.

427
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,030
And once you start seeing it, you think you 
have become a higher personality.

428
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,030
It’s absolutely wrong.

429
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:57,340
You are under the control of something else.

430
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:00,140
You are not yourself.

431
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:09,300
The last word on the collective supraconscious 
was Hitler.

432
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:13,730
He got lost completely.

433
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:22,660
He was using tantrikas, these horrible people, 
and he was using all that knowledge, so called,

434
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,880
how to use these forces.

435
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:30,870
The forces come to you through dead spirits 
who are very powerful in their lifetime, and

436
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:39,300
those who are not, give up that idea of domination 
and they are on this earth still all around.

437
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:44,210
The left-sided people are the people who indulge 
into other kind of things like-alcohols and

438
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:51,860
ganjas and all these things, by which you 
become sort of all the time crying, weeping,

439
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:52,860
this, that.

440
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:57,480
In that you see your past.

441
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:02,550
Is a good idea in a way, but a bad idea also 
in a way, because you are in the present,

442
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,210
not in your past.

443
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:08,680
Past does not exist any more, it’s finished 
now.

444
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,160
What exists is the present.

445
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:16,570
Either you are in the future or in the past 
and when you go too much into it you get identified

446
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:19,860
and you think this is what is the Truth, which 
is not.

447
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:24,160
I have to tell you that it is not.

448
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:29,530
What is the Truth is your Spirit.

449
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:36,480
Your evolutionary process has to trigger it 
and that’s how you become.

450
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,390
By becoming that what happens to you?

451
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,320
You don’t start jumping like mad.

452
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,420
No, it’s not.

453
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:42,420
Anybody can jump.

454
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:45,180
Is it difficult to jump?

455
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,010
Some people who said that we went for a flying 
course.

456
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:51,140
They paid 3000 Pounds to fly.

457
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,140
What is the need?

458
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,670
You don’t want to become birds or frogs, 
do you?

459
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:59,220
And they were nothing but frogs jumping.

460
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,850
In my presence they were jumping like that.

461
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:03,210
I didn’t know how to control.

462
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:09,210
And they paid 3000 pounds for this.

463
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:13,180
The other day in a plane I had somebody from 
that kind of a thing was sitting and he was

464
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:15,310
all the time doing like this because I was 
sitting behind him.

465
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:19,440
I said, ”I think I better get out from there 
and go out the back."

466
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,150
You are not in your own control.

467
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:23,050
You have to be your own master.

468
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:29,950
Now you must know this, that you should be 
able to control yourself is the main point.

469
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,750
Like in a car, there are these two powers.

470
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:39,630
One is the brake and the other is the accelerator.

471
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,860
First, you don’t know how to drive.

472
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:48,390
You are sitting and first you are going into 
a ditch, then sometimes you are getting out

473
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:52,270
trying to balance it, then you know how to 
drive.

474
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:54,770
When do you know?

475
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:56,570
When you know.

476
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:59,640
If you ask me, “Mother, when do we know 
how to drive?” When we know.

477
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,630
It is an amazingly simple thing.

478
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:04,130
So, now you have managed both these.

479
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:08,270
First, you’ve made accident and have done 
all mistakes, doesn’t matter.

480
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:11,750
As long as you learn how to drive, finished.

481
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:19,720
First you have a driving license, then you 
start arranging these two things to keep yourself

482
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,720
into balance.

483
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:26,690
You come into balance, still you are not the 
master of the car, but you are master as far

484
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:28,690
as the mechanism is concerned.

485
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:36,160
So, there is a master who is sitting, of the 
car and of you.

486
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,980
In the beginning you should be master of your 
body, master of everything.

487
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:49,590
Then, what happens, that you become the master 
of the car as well.

488
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:54,210
First you balance yourself in such a way that 
you know how to master your body, your mind

489
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:55,700
and everything.

490
00:57:55,700 --> 00:58:00,530
And then you become that by which you can 
master other people also.

491
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:02,450
But mastery does not mean domination.

492
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:03,980
It’s Love.

493
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:08,260
It’s a wrong idea that a master is a person 
who dominates.

494
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:10,440
It comes from where I don’t know.

495
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,210
Master is the one who loves, who really does.

496
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:20,800
He may just sometimes tell you don’t do 
this because it’s wrong, the whole bad things

497
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,170
happening, he may tell you.

498
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:26,220
But he is a comforter.

499
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:29,460
Comforter, because you have felt no Love in 
your life.

500
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:32,050
The real Love you have not felt.

501
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,230
You want some place where you can get that 
Love.

502
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:37,520
He is a comforter, is the left side.

503
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:43,180
In our Sahaja Yoga language we call the Comforter 
as Mahakali.

504
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:46,280
She is the Holy Ghost.

505
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:50,490
From that Comforter other aspects come up.

506
00:58:50,490 --> 00:59:00,310
The second aspect is what you call the Councelor, 
The one who tells you what is what, decodes

507
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:03,610
everything, tells you how to manage, how to 
go ahead.

508
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:07,830
Like an instructor and you verify that.

509
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:17,500
The second one in our Sahaja Yoga is called 
Mahasaraswati and the third one is the Redeemer,

510
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:31,180
the one who who gives you moksha, through 
the Sushumna nadi, is called as Mahalaxmi.

511
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:34,340
These are the three powers which exist within 
us.

512
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:43,000
The first manifests the left sympathetic, 
the second one manifests the right sympathetic

513
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:53,110
and the third one gives you the parasympathetic 
which controls these two centers, which coordinates,

514
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:55,540
cooperates and refills.

515
00:59:55,540 --> 01:00:01,360
But it is still a limited amount of energy.

516
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,280
Some people tell me that they went to a person 
and felt the energy.

517
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,780
What sort of an energy were you feeling?

518
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:09,560
Very much like shaking and all that.

519
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,280
No, that’s not good.

520
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,240
If you are not possessed you should not shake 
before a person.

521
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:26,220
On the contrary you start feeling the cool 
breeze in the hands.You feel completely relaxed.

522
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,990
How do you know?

523
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:31,450
What happens through Sahaja Yoga is the way, 
is very good.

524
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:33,100
You should see for yourself.

525
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:44,310
Get three people – one from a lunatic asylum, 
certified mad; get another one who is not

526
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:49,950
realized; get the third one who is realized.

527
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:51,160
They sit down.

528
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:55,320
Now you ask them to put their hands towards 
you.

529
01:00:55,320 --> 01:01:00,410
Now the person who is lunatic will be doing 
like this.

530
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:08,710
Now if there a cancer patient, he will be 
emitting tremendous heat, so much so that

531
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:17,840
you don’t need a heater, even in London 
in December or January.

532
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:23,690
But supposing that person is just a normal, 
balanced person, is in the center.

533
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:30,210
He starts feeling the cool breeze and the 
realized soul starts feeling the whole thing

534
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:31,770
coming on.

535
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:39,100
This is what you have to judge with people 
when they come.

536
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:43,050
You should know what happens to them.

537
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:50,330
If you are seeking reality, you must know 
that you have to face yourself as you are

538
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:51,330
today.

539
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:59,670
You need not try to hide anything, because 
there is nothing to be hidden from your mother.

540
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:01,140
I don’t care whatever you have done.

541
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:02,950
I just don’t bother.

542
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:04,500
It’s not necessary.

543
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:10,850
The first mantra in Sahaja Yoga to be said 
is that Mother, I am not guilty.

544
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:14,430
You have to say that 16 times in your heart.

545
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:26,300
This is the first mantra of Sahaja Yoga, because 
in yourself whole things have crawled up into

546
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,900
a diffidence in life.

547
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:32,000
Even the Ego sometimes gets hurt.

548
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:38,250
When you do mistakes or anything, it gets 
hurt and when it gets hurt you get diffident,

549
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:40,980
and it gets built up within you.

550
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:46,830
When you say, “Mother, I am not guilty,” 
your self-esteem is established.

551
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:52,910
First day you’d better establish your self-esteem.

552
01:02:52,910 --> 01:03:01,570
Within you lies this power of Kundalini.

553
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:06,380
I was very happy to know that people have 
reached the conclusion that it is the Kundalini

554
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:10,010
awakening which is going to do the job.

555
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:13,110
It is a very good conclusion you have reached.

556
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:19,390
But any Dick, Tom and Harry cannot do it, 
one should know that.

557
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:24,830
Saying it is a sprouting, it’s a living 
process.

558
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:28,190
Now, logically you should approach the subject.

559
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:31,980
You are all very intelligent people, I can 
see that.

560
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,390
Living things, like sprouting the seed.

561
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:39,240
If you want to sprout a seed, can you pull 
it out?

562
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:45,360
Or if you stand on your head, will it happen?

563
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:48,230
They are such sweet things.

564
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:49,230
“Hello.

565
01:03:49,230 --> 01:04:03,110
Alright now, sit down for a while."

566
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:04,330
They are realized souls.

567
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:06,430
They are born realized.

568
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:10,400
So many children are born realized and if 
you are not realized [UNCLEAR parents] you

569
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,220
are going to harm them.

570
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:18,060
You have to know what are they.

571
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:24,000
They know me better than you people do and 
they are going to come up.

572
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,530
Wait for ten years before.

573
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:32,940
They are going to create that great, beautiful 
mansion of Love for you.

574
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:39,860
So, this Kundalini is the power within us.

575
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:45,850
What power is this?

576
01:04:45,850 --> 01:04:55,770
This is the power of Primordial Desire within 
us to be one with the Divine, to be united

577
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:57,850
with the Divine and this is the Yoga.

578
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:00,360
All the rest of it is not.

579
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:08,040
As you are, you are to be connected with the 
Divine, is the Yoga.

580
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:13,850
If that is so, this desire is not yet manifested.

581
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:20,310
So, it is called as a sleeping Kundalini and 
only the person who has that warmth of the

582
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:25,830
Mother Earth can do it, as simple as that.

583
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:36,720
Everyone who thinks that Kundalini is to be 
awakened must know it is a spontaneous, living

584
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,600
happening, just like a sprouting of a seed.

585
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:43,240
You cannot just pull it out.

586
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,240
It cannot be done by any effort.

587
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,410
It’s spontaneous.

588
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:53,700
If it is evolutionary, logically we can find 
out that we did nothing to become human beings

589
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,300
from amoeba stage.

590
01:05:55,300 --> 01:06:02,080
We didn’t cut our tails to become human 
beings, did we?

591
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,040
We didn’t do anything.

592
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,590
It has happened so spontaneously.

593
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:13,330
But where is the change in us, let’s see 
again logically.

594
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:15,430
Not rationally, but logically.

595
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:16,990
Rationality could be quite mad.

596
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:26,200
Logically you should understand, what is the 
difference we have got is in our awareness.

597
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:31,400
Something has to happen in awareness, not 
in a way that you just start jumping or taking

598
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:35,480
out your clothes and doing nonsensical things.

599
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:38,690
It’s very easy.

600
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:41,220
In the bathroom everybody does it.

601
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:43,280
What’s so great?

602
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,350
But just understand.

603
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:53,340
You can see with your naked eye the pulsation 
of the Kundalini.

604
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:57,350
If you are a first class instrument, it just 
happens.

605
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:59,540
Like a jet it goes.

606
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:03,490
It’s a jet Kundalini in the jet age.

607
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:09,750
It has to happen to all of you.

608
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:14,890
Why some people said you have to do so much 
and you have to do like this and you have

609
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:20,790
to do that and you have to cleanse yourself 
and then only you’ll get realization.

610
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:22,590
Why is it so simple today?

611
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:27,820
The reason is the time has come.

612
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:34,660
In the beginning of a tree’s life one or 
two flowers come in, but now the blossom time

613
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:41,950
has come, so many seekers I see before me, 
just like flowers about to become the fruits.

614
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:44,350
There were never so much seekers before.

615
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:50,590
Whatever you can say against the modern times 
this is the outcome of that.

616
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:54,630
Without this chaos there would have been not 
so many.

617
01:07:54,630 --> 01:08:00,450
This is the time that he predicted that many 
saints will be born at this time.

618
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:02,450
[UNCLEAR] imagine thousands of years back 
it was written.

619
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:10,750
When this Kali Yuga, this modern time, the 
one who created the Kali, he was caught up

620
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:16,210
by somebody and he said, “Nala, what do 
mean by torturing me and my wife like this.

621
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:18,450
I am going to kill you.

622
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:24,820
The Kali said, “Alright, you can kill me, 
but you have to find out one thing about me.

623
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:27,600
You must know what I am and what I represent."

624
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,600
“What are you?

625
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,600
Just tell me."

626
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:35,860
He said: “When the modern times will come,” 
we call it as Kali Yuga, “at this time,

627
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:41,750
these saints who are seeking God in the hills 
and dales and in the Himalayas will be born

628
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:49,540
as ordinary householders and they are going 
to receive the blessings.

629
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:51,230
It’s already promised."

630
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:54,600
If so, that happening has to take place.

631
01:08:54,600 --> 01:09:02,770
But as soon as people came to know that people 
are seeking, the market got jammed.

632
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:06,480
and you got into the trap.

633
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:17,340
It’s a very subtle method of making money 
out of you.

634
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:24,770
Now, I think, most of them are getting a little 
worried, because all their advertising and

635
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:30,720
all that is a little bit fading and they don’t 
know how to find out new methods of advertising

636
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:33,790
to get ‘round you.

637
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:36,480
These people are not interested in Indian 
villages.

638
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:44,010
They are interested in Los Angeles or in Santa 
Cruz where they can extract money.

639
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:48,990
It is an enterprise.

640
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:52,090
You cannot sell God, can you?

641
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:54,480
You cannot organize it.

642
01:09:54,480 --> 01:10:02,840
Some lady paid $4000 very recently and I heard 
somebody told me that she went there, she

643
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:07,050
danced, she took out her clothes, became mad 
and came back.

644
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:11,480
You pay to go to lunatic asylum or what?

645
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:15,390
But it helps you to go there because there’s 
a fashion on.

646
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:23,070
Everybody is going, “Oh, I’ve been there 
to that Guru."

647
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:26,430
It’s so maddening.

648
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:30,410
You must understand, you are the new forms 
of the old ways.

649
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:38,050
In olden days, people who could donate for 
a church were regarded as very religious.

650
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:51,660
Even now, I think, some of the Jews, they 
have a diamond-jeweled bible and if they can

651
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:58,660
tithe there they show it nicely that they 
have got one.

652
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:05,320
All these false ideas of God you’d better 
give up, because you are not followers, you

653
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,320
are seekers.

654
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,930
Let them go on with that nonsense.

655
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:13,740
But you are seekers, so you take to the Truth 
and you become that.

656
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:17,070
I think today, it’s quite a lot for you.

657
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:20,990
I would like you to ask me some questions, 
but sensible questions and don’t be aggressive

658
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:21,990
with me.

659
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:22,990
I am very clever.

660
01:11:22,990 --> 01:11:26,100
As they told him, “She’s a masterpiece 
of camouflage."

661
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:29,790
It’s true, I am, so be careful.

662
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:32,760
If you have any real questions ask me.

663
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:38,350
If you are not a true seeker and you are just 
trying to show off, you are cheating yourself.

664
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:39,520
Don’t try to show off.

665
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,740
“I read this book."

666
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:41,740
“I read that book."

667
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:42,740
“This happened."

668
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:45,490
”What do you think of this Guru?” Don’t 
bring me to controversies.

669
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:46,490
It’s unnecessary.

670
01:11:46,490 --> 01:11:50,140
If they were of any value, you would have 
been a realized soul.

671
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:55,020
I can make out from you who was your Guru 
the way they have ruined your Kundalini.

672
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,900
Some of the Kundalinis are so ruined.

673
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:10,020
I see them just like wounded snakes, tossing 
their heads like this.

674
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:11,750
It is so bleedy.

675
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:14,780
You don’t know how much they’ve corrupted 
you.

676
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:17,780
Don’t ask me about these cruel people.

677
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:22,740
If I start blasting them, you’ll be amazed 
how they are.

678
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:27,180
I love you very much, but I don’t love them.

679
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:33,250
I am wrathful, very angry with them, because 
they are devils, satanic.

680
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:36,380
If they wanted money, they could have smuggled.

681
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:42,680
They could have done something like that, 
but they should not have ruined your Kundalini.

682
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,920
They had no business to do it.

683
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:52,510
They will go to hell, no doubt, but they’ll 
be carrying so many with them, they know that.

684
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:54,810
They are trying to overpower.

685
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:56,530
They are Anti-Christ.

686
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:59,760
They think they can win over God.

687
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:07,830
Let them know that God’s Powers are so powerful 
that they can all be destroyed like this in

688
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:08,830
one stroke.

689
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:14,480
The only thing why they are not destroyed 
is because today they are in your brains.

690
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:25,350
Krishna has said,”Whenever there is the 
fall of Dharma, fall of your values, your

691
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:33,910
virtues, whenever the saints suffer, I come 
on this Earth to save the Saints and kill

692
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:35,170
the devils."

693
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:38,880
But the devils have gone into the Saints now.

694
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,780
It’s a problem, a dilemma for me.

695
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:42,780
What to do.

696
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:45,320
These devils have come into your brains.

697
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,840
They are to be taken out, first of all.

698
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,630
Just wait for me to finish.

699
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:52,500
Do not stick on to one question.

700
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:55,260
If you stick on, you’ll miss the whole point.

701
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:57,220
By questioning, you will not get Realization.

702
01:13:57,220 --> 01:13:59,890
It’s not a mental activity.

703
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:03,080
It’s triggering beyond the mental activity.

704
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:07,250
This lecture is useless if you do not get 
your Realization.

705
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:11,260
In the beginning of the Vedas it was written 
that if you do not get the knowledge… Knowledge

706
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:12,570
doesn’t mean going mad.

707
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:15,180
It doesn’t mean hypnosis.

708
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:18,990
But if you do not feel the all pervading Power, 
then these Vedas are useless.

709
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:24,610
In the same way my lecture and all mental 
activities are useless if you do not get your

710
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:25,610
Realization.

711
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:27,890
That’s the main thing you must have.

712
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:34,760
May God bless you.

713
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:43,360
Now, ask me a question.

714
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:49,450
Seeker: What is the best approach we can take 
to go to Laxmi?

715
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:54,410
Shri Mataji: I will tell you tomorrow about 
Laxmi, where she is settled down.

716
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:57,540
That’s what we are going to do, all the 
Goddess, not one.

717
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:59,580
All in one bundle.

718
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:07,140
Now what do you say to that?

719
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:14,050
Alright, good idea.

720
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:24,810
Seeker: Asks about how to deal with her worries.

721
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:25,820
Alright, doesn’t matter.

722
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:30,250
We are going to work it out.

723
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:32,590
Don’t worry about your personal things.

724
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:45,740
It’s all 
going to work out en masse.

725
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:47,940
Dr.

726
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:52,830
Warren: She is asking whether you said to 
say, “Mother, I am not guilty”.

727
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:55,900
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, please, within yourself.

728
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:56,900
Very important.

729
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:57,900
What is it?

730
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:58,900
Dr.

731
01:15:58,900 --> 01:15:59,900
Warren:She is liking it!

732
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,450
Shri Mataji: Good, good.

733
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:03,150
May God bless you.

734
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:05,260
Don’t feel guilty at all.

735
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,550
Otherwise I would not come here.

736
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:14,770
The ones who have harmed you are guilty.

737
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:32,230
Seeker: What is your capacity and our capacity 
to hate the devils.

738
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:34,710
Most religions preached that we should not 
be angry.

739
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:40,300
Shri Mataji: You should not be angry, but 
with Devils?

740
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:44,930
You run away from them.

741
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:45,930
Let me handle them.

742
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:46,930
You just don’t worry about them.

743
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:47,930
It’s my job.

744
01:16:47,930 --> 01:17:07,480
First of all you love yourself, have self-esteem, 
know that you are the temple of God, Then

745
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:11,880
you love by becoming realized, you become 
collectively conscious.

746
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,790
Again the word becoming.

747
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:16,170
Then you start feeling the other within yourself.

748
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:17,170
Who is the other?

749
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:20,390
I am not helping you, you are part and parcel 
of my being.

750
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:25,130
If I am helping my finger, am I helping you?

751
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:33,140
Then we see about the rest of the thing.

752
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:50,710
You don’t worry about them.

753
01:17:50,710 --> 01:18:00,130
Seeker: Many of the people who come to my 
clinic have activated their Kundalini too

754
01:18:00,130 --> 01:18:02,780
early and I’m wondering how to help them.

755
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:12,480
Shri Mataji: They do not activate their Kundalini, 
they do not.

756
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:16,070
All these things are just to activate the 
sympathetic and it’s very dangerous.

757
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:20,660
You can get blisters, you can get all kinds 
of problems.

758
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:24,310
You can get cancer also.

759
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:26,200
I get so many people like that.

760
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,490
I’ll make you the masters.

761
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:31,740
It’s Love.

762
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:32,900
It cannot harm.

763
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,500
It’s your Mother.

764
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:39,420
That’s the only Mother you have and you 
are the only child.

765
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:41,730
How can your Kundalini trouble you?

766
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:46,150
She is just waiting for the moment to give 
you realization.

767
01:18:46,150 --> 01:18:57,320
She loves you the most of all.

768
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:05,380
And you cannot activate it, it just spontaneously 
rises.

769
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:08,780
I was myself amazed to read some books on 
Kundalini.

770
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:12,060
I said these people don’t know what Kundalini 
is.

771
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:13,360
They’re liars.

772
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:20,270
They are cheats writing such big books about 
Kundalini without knowing a word, without

773
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:21,480
having any authority.

774
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,550
You have to have Divine Authority, isn’t 
it?

775
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:27,220
You cannot get it in a Theological college 
or any place you go to.

776
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:34,960
Its a Divine Authority you must have.

777
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,310
Seeker: Should we love our enemies as well?

778
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:43,220
Shri Mataji: First of all you love yourself 
and your friends.

779
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:51,500
Then we can talk of enemies.

780
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,780
You have to know who are your enemies.

781
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:57,490
Actually, you don’t know who are your enemies.

782
01:19:57,490 --> 01:20:03,790
First, we have to develop that discretion 
power.

783
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:07,820
By your vibrations you will know who is who, 
because once you are connected with the mains,

784
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:09,680
you start feeling it.

785
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:15,680
You can ask any question whichever is an absolute 
question.

786
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,300
You can ask is there God?

787
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,440
You will start feeling a cool breeze coming 
in.

788
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:23,930
Like a computer, you become connected with 
the mains and you answer all these questions.

789
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:32,310
You develop your discretion and you will know 
who are yours and who are not yours.

790
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:39,910
Before that you don’t know, you are so mixed 
up.

791
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:49,970
Actually there are very few enemies that you 
have, very few.

792
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:52,680
Should we now have it?

793
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:57,780
You’ve got that door open there.

794
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:04,470
Just get one of the doors open for some of 
the enemies to fly out.

795
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:07,960
Dr.

796
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:16,280
Warren: If anyone has their shoes on, take 
them off and simply put your hands out towards

797
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:23,340
Mataji as if asking for it.

798
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:24,490
Be humble about it.

799
01:21:24,490 --> 01:21:25,490
Be open-minded.

800
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:28,230
If you’ve got a lot of questions…

801
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:29,900
Shri Mataji: Sit comfortably.

802
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:32,320
There is nothing to put yourself to stay.

803
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:37,130
Your neck should be bending neither forward 
nor backward.

804
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:39,430
There is no effort to be put in.

805
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:40,430
Just sit comfortably.

806
01:21:40,430 --> 01:21:43,430
Kundalini will rise by itself and you’ll 
get your Realization.

807
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:45,470
You don’t have to do anything.

808
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:48,880
Just don’t put your concentration onto one 
point.

809
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,670
Some people have a habit of concentrating 
here, concentrating there.

810
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:56,590
All those people who have done this concentration 
business or, what is that the another one,

811
01:21:56,590 --> 01:22:00,210
putting the tongue back?

812
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:03,630
(kechari mudra).

813
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:12,140
Whatever you have done, all such people should 
put their attention here (top of head).

814
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:13,690
There is the door, not here.

815
01:22:13,690 --> 01:22:14,710
That’s all.

816
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:24,000
But rest of the people just keep your attention 
absolutely loose.

817
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:31,010
Now, close your eyes.

818
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:35,360
Keep your eyes closed, because Kundalini has 
to pass through Agnya chakra and if your eyes

819
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:40,290
are not closed, she won’t rise.

820
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:43,010
Put your hands towards me just like this.

821
01:22:43,010 --> 01:22:48,490
All of you, please put your hands, because 
in the hands you have those centers.

822
01:22:48,490 --> 01:22:51,760
I would request you to take out if there is 
anything heavy in your necks.

823
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,000
Please, take off.

824
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,240
It is better.

825
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:58,580
Also, if there is anything heavy or tight 
on your waist.

826
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:09,050
You can loosen your belt a little bit.

827
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:27,600
Just put your hands towards me.

828
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:36,880
Close your eyes.

829
01:23:49,300 --> 01:24:02,160
Please, put your right hand on your heart, 
because Spirit resides in our heart.

830
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:06,840
Sit very comfortably without any strain on 
your back.

831
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,320
That is very important.

832
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:35,020
First of all, you have to ask in your heart, 
“Mother, am I the Spirit?” Not dead spirit but Atma.
