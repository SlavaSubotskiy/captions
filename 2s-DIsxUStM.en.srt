1
00:00:01,917 --> 00:00:06,583
Tonight, we are going

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,083
to worship the Lakshmi Principle within us.

3
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:24,000
Lakshmi is the Goddess of wealth,

4
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,000
prosperity and also of health.

5
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,333
Actually your country is already blessed,

6
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:44,083
because you have so many things here.

7
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Firstly, this country has got such a lot of petrol

8
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:03,333
and if discoveries are made there’s much more.

9
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,083
Then secondly, you have got beautiful timber.

10
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:21,999
Then thirdly you’ve got lot of steel, very lot of steel, very good steel.

11
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,917
Also you have diamonds.

12
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,999
So many things you have, apart from that you have so much of heart.

13
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:46,250
Also gold you have.

14
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,834
So all these things are in abundance in this country.

15
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:05,333
Only thing is you don’t yet have somebody who will manage

16
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:10,166
to get to you people.

17
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:19,500
I’m sure it will work out.

18
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:31,083
But in Sahaja Yoga,

19
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:36,417
we have to know that this Principle of Lakshmi,

20
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:41,917
gives us a great sense of satisfaction.

21
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,834
If you don’t have satisfaction

22
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:54,166
then any amount of Lakshmi cannot help you.

23
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,750
One becomes very greedy.

24
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:12,333
You have something but you want to have more and more and more;

25
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:20,917
and for that one adopts all kinds of methods and measures.

26
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,583
Thus you also have, a very bad Mafia system here,

27
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,750
who are very greedy.

28
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:41,999
For Sahaja Yogis, one has to realize

29
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:47,166
that he does not have to achieve anything – he’s already achieved.

30
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:59,166
First people try to seek food,

31
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:03,667
in the Nabhi Chakra

32
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:08,750
– then they eat – that is Swaha

33
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,667
– then it is being retained in the body.

34
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:22,333
Now supposing somebody becomes very greedy of food,

35
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:24,834
he gets sick, he has problems.

36
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,333
But he goes to the second stage

37
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,750
where he sustains it and called as Swadha,

38
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,999
because he eats thinking that it is,

39
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,667
as a human being, his duty to eat, that’s all.

40
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,999
Not for taste, not for greed, not for showing off.

41
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:10,333
In a very simple manner he eats.

42
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:16,417
Like in the west I have seen people are very particular about

43
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:19,834
where you put the spoon and where you put that.

44
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:31,333
They spend thousands to buy those cutleries.

45
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:45,834
Now the thing that is the worst for the Lakshmi Principle is drinking.

46
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,667
It is alcohol.

47
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,583
They say in India, that a bottle comes from one side

48
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:02,166
and the Lakshmi runs away from another door.

49
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:12,500
So Sahaja Yogis don’t need to drink.

50
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,583
They give up drinking,

51
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:23,583
and thus Lakshmi Principle can be established much more easily.

52
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,083
Now why should we have Lakshmi?

53
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:36,333
We should have Lakshmi

54
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:40,834
because in the symbol of Lakshmi you can see the reason.

55
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,333
First of all the Lakshmi has got

56
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:55,333
two beautiful pink colored lotuses in Her hand.

57
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:05,166
That symbolizes that a person who has money

58
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:13,417
should have a very comfortable house, which is very inviting

59
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:17,834
– pink color is for love and invitation.

60
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:30,667
Now the beetle comes to the lotus

61
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:34,999
and it has got all kinds of thorns on its body.

62
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:43,333
The beetle comes to the lotus

63
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:45,750
to collect some honey

64
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:52,166
but it has got thorns on its body but the lotus accepts.

65
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:15,333
It invites, you see the lotus is very happy to have this beetle in it.

66
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,250
Now the beetle is seeking the honey

67
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,583
and it gets tired and sleeps inside the lotus

68
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:35,333
– so the lotus gives a beautiful corona – the bed for it to sleep

69
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,083
and all the fragrance of the lotus, for that beetle,

70
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,417
till the morning.

71
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:02,834
Then when the beetle has rested well,

72
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:07,250
he gets his honey and then he flies out.

73
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,417
We can state poetically

74
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:23,333
that the beetle is respected by the lotus

75
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,750
because it is seeking the honey.

76
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:38,417
Even if it has got thorns, doesn’t matter.

77
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:49,917
Thus you people who have been seeking the truth,

78
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,834
have received it on your Sahasrara, which is just like a lotus.

79
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:09,166
Whatever you have done, whatever was the past is not important,

80
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:18,999
you get your dignity because you are seeking the truth.

81
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:27,333
Also when people get saturated with Lakshmi,

82
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
as in the West I have seen,

83
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:34,083
they take to seeking – they get fed up,

84
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,417
because material things is not Lakshmi,

85
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,250
because it doesn’t give any satisfaction.

86
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,999
So the other thing that Lakshmi has in Her hand

87
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,250
- what happens that She puts one hand like this -

88
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,333
this hand suggests that a person who has money

89
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,999
has to give and share – not to take it for oneself.

90
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:25,083
If they do not share,

91
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,417
then they cannot enjoy the Principle of Lakshmi

92
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:36,333
when giving to others is so joyful.

93
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,917
Another hand is like this -

94
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:50,417
this hand of the Goddess, suggests that those who are

95
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:54,667
under your care, your relations, your friends,

96
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:59,750
all those people, must be given complete protection by you.

97
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:13,083
Anything happens in your family,

98
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:19,083
anything happens to your relations or to your friends,

99
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,333
you must stand by that person.

100
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:35,834
Some people try to help their relations

101
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:40,583
by say – many politicians do that way - by cheating.

102
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,583
But by cheating, what you are doing

103
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:52,250
is you are spoiling the life of that relation,

104
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,250
you are not really helping.

105
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,667
So he’ll be losing his name, his dignity, everything -

106
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,999
specially his moral character.

107
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,999
So with the Lakshmi, you must have your morality intact.

108
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:28,999
In a country, like now, say America and all such people,

109
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,917
there are horrible films coming

110
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:37,500
and people are taking to the science, we call it, alakshmi.

111
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:53,166
A person who has Lakshmi should dress up in a decent manner -

112
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:59,166
women and men.

113
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:06,417
I find on the street women walking with very short clothes.

114
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,333
With that, what will happen your Nabhi chakra will be caught,

115
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:21,333
and you will have problems with money.

116
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,750
So the wealth that you have

117
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,166
should be seen in your temperament, in your nature,

118
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:33,166
in your behavior, in your living.

119
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:46,750
Moreover the person who has Lakshmi has to be a very humble man.

120
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:57,166
For example, Shri Lakshmi is standing on a lotus.

121
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,917
Lotus is the lightest flower you could think

122
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:06,667
because it floats over the water.

123
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:17,917
So Her temperament should be not of a very serious type

124
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:22,083
but of a very mirthful...

125
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:31,917
and She doesn’t show off

126
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:36,083
because it’s such a simple thing, like a lotus, to stand on that.

127
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:46,999
So for people who have money, or who have wealth

128
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:50,999
should not try to show off by very big cars and this and that.

129
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,999
That of course does not mean that you should become sanyasis.

130
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:12,083
On the contrary, you should be very well dignified personalities.

131
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,750
But there should be detachment.

132
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:24,750
As you saw Raja Janaka, He was a king

133
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:27,250
and still He was so detached,

134
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:32,417
that all the Saints used to go and touch the feet of Raja Janaka.

135
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,750
So there was this fellow called Nachiketa, he asked his master

136
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:47,083
“Why do you touch His feet? - He is a king”.

137
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:57,417
So the master said “All right – you go and meet Him now”.

138
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:09,999
So what he saw was that Janaka had all the luxuries of life.

139
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,667
He was living in the palace

140
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:21,750
and in the procession there were thousands and thousands of people

141
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,999
who were throwing pearls on him.

142
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,250
So Nachiketa thought he should get one pearl at least.

143
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:41,583
Next day, he went to Raja Janaka

144
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:44,750
and asked Him, “Give me Self-realization.”

145
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,250
So Raja Janaka said, “I can give you all My kingdom

146
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,917
but not Self-realization, very difficult,

147
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:05,500
because you are possessed by the idea of money,

148
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,999
such a person cannot get Realization."

149
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:20,999
He said, “All right, I will live here till I get Realization.

150
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:29,417
Next day Raja Janaka took him for a bath in the river

151
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:32,750
and He was enjoying the bath.

152
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:45,083
And people came and told Him that there is a fire in His palace.

153
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:51,667
But Raja Janaka was meditating,

154
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,417
He didn’t bother.

155
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:04,333
Then they said that the people who are in the palace have run away.

156
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,750
Then he says that, somebody said

157
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,250
that now the fire is coming here.

158
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:20,250
Still Raja Janaka was meditating.

159
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,999
But Nachiketa ran out

160
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,917
because his clothes were outside, so ran out to save his….

161
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,750
And still Raja Janaka was not bothered.

162
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:47,750
So when He came out He told him, "Nachiketa, this is all Mahamaya."

163
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,166
This is how you are tested,

164
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,583
if you are money-oriented you cannot get Self-realization.

165
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,917
She’s the one who is testing.

166
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,250
All the greedy people,

167
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,917
all the people, for money’s sake, do all kinds of thing,

168
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:19,417
as you have here, Mafias, - will be all punished.

169
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,333
In any case they are not happy people, satisfied people,

170
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,333
they are all the time worried.

171
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:42,166
So first thing you must have is satisfaction.

172
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,750
This is a very important thing in modern times to understand.

173
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:58,750
Because is said also in the economics,

174
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:02,917
that wants are not satiable in general.

175
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:11,917
You want today a carpet – all right, have it.

176
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,667
You work very hard, save money to buy a carpet,

177
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,667
then you have the carpet, you want to have a house –

178
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:29,583
you never enjoy the carpet,

179
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,834
for which you have worked so hard.

180
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,417
Then you have a house,

181
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:39,083
so when you get the house, you want to have a car –

182
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:47,500
then from car, you want, I think, helicopter, maybe an aeroplane.

183
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:56,917
This is how it goes on

184
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:02,500
and you work so hard and have no satisfaction.

185
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:10,500
Because of this, in these modern times, people are extremely restless.

186
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,750
There is no peace in your heart

187
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:20,417
but if you have this Lakshmi Principle in you,

188
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:23,667
you will feel extremely satisfied

189
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:26,500
with everything that is materialistic.

190
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:35,333
If you have, well and good, if you don’t have, well and good.

191
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:44,500
But after that, this Mahalakshmi Principle is awakened within you,

192
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,333
that you start seeking.

193
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:59,583
And then that is also, later on as you have seen, is granted,

194
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:01,999
because you get your Self-realization.

195
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:15,417
So nothing to copy these horrible materialistic people,

196
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,750
but we have to be satisfied with what we have

197
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:32,083
and we should express our love by giving something,

198
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,083
whatever it is, to the needy person.

199
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,250
I have seen Myself,

200
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:48,834
I find it very difficult to buy anything for Myself.

201
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:57,166
If it is expensive, I think I should not buy it.

202
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:05,834
So once I went to a shop, I wanted to buy a particular sari,

203
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,333
but I thought it was too expensive – I didn’t buy it.

204
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,333
But one Sahaja Yogi was with Me – he went and bought it

205
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,999
and gave it to Me on My birthday

206
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,500
and I just started crying, you know, it’s too much.

207
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:37,583
We have stories like this in our Ramayana also,

208
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:44,999
where Shri Rama ate the sour ber.

209
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:50,917
We call it ber, I don't know - you too call it ber - must be a story like that.

210
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,166
She told Shri Ram that,

211
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:08,583
- she was an old woman from a down-trodden society -

212
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:15,417
that “I have eaten every, I have touched every ber with my teeth,

213
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:21,667
you see, and I have found out that none of them are sour.”

214
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:45,250
In India, nobody eats anything which is touched by mouth,

215
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,834
on any food, is regarded utishta,  is something wrong.

216
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,583
But Shri Rama immediately took,

217
00:25:57,834 --> 00:26:02,917
He said, “Oh, how sweet of you to have done this tasting for Me.”

218
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,333
But His brother was very angry, he didn’t like it, Lakshmana.

219
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:24,583
Shri Rama ate, He said, “I have never eaten such beautiful bers.”

220
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:32,083
So His wife Sita said,

221
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:36,750
“Give Me also, little bit, I am your half thing you should give me.”

222
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:46,917
So when Shri Rama gave Her, She ate and She said,

223
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:50,999
“Oh my goodness what a beautiful fruit this one is.”

224
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:00,667
So Lakshmana said, “Why not give Me?”

225
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:02,166
He asked His sister-in-law,

226
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:05,333
“Give me also”, She said “No, because you were so angry.”

227
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,583
But She gave it to Lakshmana, and Lakshmana said,

228
00:27:18,834 --> 00:27:21,083
“I have never eaten such beautiful fruits.”

229
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,999
What was in that ber was nothing

230
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:37,333
but giving sense of this old lady.

231
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:47,083
She didn’t have anything to give – she was a poor lady –

232
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,417
so she did all this just to give to Shri Rama.

233
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:05,417
So the sharing of your things is an extremely joy-giving thing.

234
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:15,834
The other day we had brought some presents,

235
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:20,500
I mean nothing so great, but you all so enjoyed it, and I too enjoyed it.

236
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:32,083
That is how we all have to live,

237
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:43,333
that is how all of us have to live together - sharing things.

238
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:53,500
Don’t think about yourself, think of others.

239
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,417
Think what others like.

240
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:06,417
In India, the Gruha Lakshmis are that way very good.

241
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,417
They know what you like to eat.

242
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:19,417
So if you go to their house,

243
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:23,250
immediately they will ask, "Please come for dinner."

244
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,417
And they will make what I would like

245
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:38,250
and I would love to eat. They’ll go out of the way to make that.

246
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,999
But not only for Me, for anyone.

247
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:54,583
It’s such a joy-giving thing to cook for others.

248
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:03,417
So the principle of Lakshmi is only enjoyed

249
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:05,250
when you share it with others.

250
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:18,250
My father was a great Realized soul,

251
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:26,250
and he never used to close the doors or windows in the night.

252
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:34,417
And one day a thief came and took away the gramophone that he had.

253
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:43,500
So he felt very sad that he has taken away the gramophone now,

254
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,250
what about records – he can’t buy –

255
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:54,917
how will he play?

256
00:30:57,667 --> 00:31:01,999
So My mother joked that, better give it in the newspaper that,

257
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:05,999
“to the thief who has taken away our gramophone,

258
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,333
please come and take away the records also.”

259
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:21,750
This is a sign of Lakshmi Principle.

260
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:27,250
The one who is satisfied

261
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:30,750
and is happiest when he can give something.

262
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,999
If you give with one hand you’ll get from ten hands.

263
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:49,834
So we have to learn to share,

264
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:57,917
as it is you are giving the highest thing to others -

265
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,917
that is Self-realization.

266
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,250
What more can you give?

267
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,667
You must have seen when you give Self-realization,

268
00:32:13,917 --> 00:32:15,917
how happy you feel.

269
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:24,583
The greatest happiness and the greatest joy

270
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:26,834
is in giving Realizations to others.

271
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:34,083
I have seen people, their faces change

272
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:39,250
and people who give Realization, their faces also get full of light.

273
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:53,417
We are a new society, we are people of new age,

274
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:58,417
where we have got our satisfaction in higher things.

275
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:10,250
There are many Sahaja Yogis who have been working,

276
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,583
giving Realization, but there are many who do not.

277
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:25,166
Unless and until you share your joy with others,

278
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,500
you will not be happy.

279
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:35,500
I heard the other day,

280
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:39,583
one lady told Me that her father, mother are against Sahaja Yoga.

281
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:48,083
I said, “What is your relationship?”

282
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:54,500
She said, “I don’t talk to them, I don’t like them,

283
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,834
the way they are against Sahaja Yoga”.

284
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:04,583
I told her, “You change your attitude,

285
00:34:07,917 --> 00:34:11,333
take some flowers for them, some present for them,

286
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:18,250
talk to them in a very sweet manner.

287
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:22,834
Because you have become such a dry person,

288
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:24,999
that’s why they don’t like Sahaja Yoga."

289
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:32,999
And it worked, it worked, the parents are now in Sahaja Yoga.

290
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,999
So the attitude of a Sahaja Yogi

291
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:46,166
towards a non-Sahaja Yogi should be of helping,

292
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,834
of supporting, of sharing.

293
00:34:57,917 --> 00:35:01,083
But I must warn you there are some Sahaja Yogis

294
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,999
who will try to have their own party.

295
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:14,583
They are very power-oriented.

296
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:19,166
They will have an exclusive party.

297
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:26,500
It is a dangerous sign – it’s a cancer.

298
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:33,500
Everything should be collective.

299
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:36,999
Anybody who does that kind of thing,

300
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:39,250
you should know is a possessed person,

301
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:46,999
and you will be harmed if you follow such a person.

302
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:55,250
We are all collective, we have to know everything among each other

303
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:58,999
and we have to live like one family,

304
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:09,083
not only in Russia but all over the world.

305
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:21,083
Once you develop that kind of a love for everyone,

306
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:25,333
then you will be surprised you have become a great personality.

307
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,999
That means a drop becomes the ocean.

308
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:44,166
I can go on saying about Lakshmi Principle for hours together.

309
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,333
There are nine Lakshmis,

310
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,999
but next time I’ll tell you.

311
00:36:55,999 --> 00:36:59,250
One of them is Gruha Lakshmi, is the housewife,

312
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:08,999
and another is the Raja Lakshmi, which is the power of a king

313
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:13,417
or of a person who is administrator or who is a bureaucrat.

314
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:23,333
But I would request you

315
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,417
to understand that you have got the greatest treasure

316
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:30,834
that very few people have got in this world.

317
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,417
Nourish it with your love.

318
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:49,417
Nourish it with your compassion and peaceful existence.

319
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,583
If there is any problem, anything

320
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,417
– suddenly, you must become peaceful within.

321
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:10,417
Then immediately you’ll find solution will come before you.

322
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:18,583
This is the subtle of Lakshmi Principle.

323
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:25,750
I hope all of you will develop it and enjoy it.

324
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:32,834
Before I come next year, I will see that you all have,

325
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:36,417
each person, has given Realization at least to hundred people.

326
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:53,083
You got powers,

327
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:06,417
you’ve got powers, you have knowledge, don’t waste it,

328
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,583
we have to save the world.

329
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:16,500
So, May God Bless you all.
