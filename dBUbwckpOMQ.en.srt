1
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:39,170
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,240
If we are the real seekers of truth,

3
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,130
we have to be honest about it

4
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,180
and sincere

5
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,110
so that we are sincere to ourselves,

6
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,170
and we have justified

7
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,110
our own existence in this world.

8
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,080
There are so many sadhakas,

9
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,030
morning till evening they are working out some

10
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,150
sort of a ritual,

11
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,170
some sort of a meditation,

12
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,150
some sort of a bhakti,

13
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,180
some sort of reading.

14
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,130
But one has to understand, what have we achieved?

15
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,010
Where are we?

16
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,120
As a Mother I would say,

17
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:42,110
"My child, you have done so much in your seeking,

18
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,010
but what have you found?

19
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,080
Have you got the ultimate reality?

20
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,030
Have you got what is described in the scriptures?"

21
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,060
For this song which is sung today is in Marathi -

22
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,070
I wish they had sung something in Sanskrit,

23
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,230
they are very good at Sanskrit,

24
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,130
singing also of Adi Shankaracharya and all that.

25
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,230
Tomorrow they'll do it.

26
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,130
This song itself was written by Namadeva

27
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,030
in the twelfth century;

28
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:17,070
a poet who went later on to Punjab,

29
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,100
where Nanak Sahib respected him very much

30
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:27,100
and asked him that he should write in Punjabi language.

31
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,020
He studied Punjabi language

32
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,120
and has written such a thick book,

33
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,100
and in the "Granth Sahib" there are many verses from there.

34
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,060
He was an ordinary tailor,

35
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,020
very ordinary tailor,

36
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:46,050
and he went to meet another saint in another village,

37
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,120
called as Gora Kumbhar.

38
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,240
"Kumbhar" means a person who is a potter,  who makes pots;

39
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,160
and Gora Kumbhar was busy

40
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,000
making the clay ready for his work.

41
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,150
Namadeva just stood before him

42
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,120
and he said,

43
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:08,070
"I came here to see the Nirgun, to the formless,

44
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,110
to see the chaitanya,

45
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,170
but here it is in Saguna, it is in a form."

46
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,090
Only a realized soul,

47
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,160
only a saint can say this about the saint,

48
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,210
because he knows ultimate reality.

49
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,090
But people who are not realized

50
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:33,010
cannot understand what is beyond this life.

51
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,050
Even in Christian religion we have Thomas,

52
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,140
who came down to India

53
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,220
and he wrote a lot of treatise,

54
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,220
were kept in a cave in Egypt,

55
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,020
which were found out.

56
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,240
Now there's a book about him,

57
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,140
after forty-eight years of research.

58
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,190
It's amazing

59
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,120
how he is describing Sahaja Yoga throughout,

60
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,220
that you have to have the experience of reality.

61
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:12,240
Of course, every book, every scripture says

62
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,090
"Know thyself" - who am I,

63
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,160
I must find out what am I.

64
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:23,100
When it is said so, our effort should be to find out

65
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,030
that Self that is within us.

66
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:31,020
We say, "My body, my voice, my nose, my country, my, my" -

67
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,170
who is this "I" to whom all these things belong?

68
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,170
From where does this inspiration comes in?

69
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,070
This "I" is within us,

70
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,210
reflected in our heart.

71
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,210
For you I have to make request that

72
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,090
you shouldn't accept Me blindly.

73
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,070
Blindness is not of any help.

74
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,190
But I am offering you a hypothesis as in the science -

75
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,030
about how this happens and all that.

76
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,100
If it is proved, and if you find

77
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,050
that you have felt as

78
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,020
experienced what I am saying,

79
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,050
then as honest people you have to accept it.

80
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,110
In the West we have other problems than we have here,

81
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,210
tremendous problems.

82
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,020
First I went to England,

83
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,140
and you know English how they are, hard nuts -

84
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,030
difficult to break those nuts.

85
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,200
But once they break

86
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,080
they are full of scholarship,

87
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,080
and they are the ones who rushed to

88
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,160
the universities and to different libraries,

89
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,050
and found out everything about Kundalini.

90
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,090
So much is written already by Nath Panthis who were here,

91
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,230
who did so much work on the Kundalini awakening,

92
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,020
but it was lost.

93
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,070
And when some Germans came here and other people came here,

94
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,010
they were told by tantrikas some sort of a wrong thing

95
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,090
which they carried from here.

96
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:15,050
And such a misunderstanding and such a wrong information

97
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,180
to such an extent,

98
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,100
that the German book I read where

99
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,230
Kundalini lies in your stomach,

100
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,180
and he has given all explanation.

101
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,080
He was a very learned man no doubt,

102
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,070
but I don't know what he learned is the point,

103
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,160
and that's how he described about Kundalini.

104
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,210
This knowledge was known to us since long.

105
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:44,100
We had three types of movements towards Divine.

106
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,010
One was the Vedas.

107
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,070
Even the "vida" means "to know" -

108
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:55,130
what Thomas has called the people who know as "gnostics,"

109
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,230
as "gn."

110
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,000
I don't know in the south what do you say to "gnana"

111
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,090
or "gyana,"

112
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,140
but in Marathi we say "gn."

113
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,080
"Gnostic" word comes from the same thing as person

114
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,150
who is knowledgeable; not outward knowledge,

115
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:17,040
not by your mental efforts or by emotional feelings,

116
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,220
but something much beyond.

117
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,050
And the same path they tried,

118
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:28,230
but in the Vedas they have said,

119
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,220
in the first,

120
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,020
first sloka is said that

121
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,180
if you do not know it,

122
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,020
no use reading this book.

123
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,100
But "knowledge" means what?

124
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,110
- to know it on your central nervous system;

125
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:51,040
not on your mental

126
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,200
or physical plane,

127
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,220
but on a much higher level.

128
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,200
As we have become human beings,

129
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,090
we have to humbly say that we are not perfect beings.

130
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,140
There's something missing us; otherwise why are we fighting,

131
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,000
why are we quarreling?

132
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,150
I mean, all these problems are mostly human problems:

133
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,180
ecological problem, economic problem, political problem.

134
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,210
You come to the source, it's the human being who is

135
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,150
doing all these things.

136
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,210
So what's wrong with human beings?

137
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,220
Animals are all right, they are pashu;

138
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,050
they are under the pasha,

139
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,080
under the control of God.

140
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,110
But human beings have got the freedom,

141
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,050
they are going helter skelter,

142
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,190
and all these problems are there

143
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,090
because they haven't got the real knowledge.

144
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:54,070
So what is the real knowledge that we should seek,

145
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,060
and we should go towards it?

146
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,240
So these people in the Vedas tried to understand,

147
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,200
but they more tried to understand the nature

148
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,240
and the five elements.

149
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,240
While worshipping five elements,

150
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,220
according to us they moved to the right side,

151
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,050
and the right-side movement is very well shown in the Greek

152
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,140
mythology;

153
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,170
and after that from Greece it turned out to be some science,

154
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,090
and all those things started.

155
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,110
The left side was the bhakti.

156
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,140
People started worshipping God with blind faith

157
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,170
and going to God,

158
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,010
worshipping in the temples and churches,

159
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,130
believing in saints.

160
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,230
India specially is specially blessed because

161
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,180
whatever we have is from the saints,

162
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,160
though it's very deviated and also quite stagnated.

163
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,160
But the knowledge came from the saints,

164
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,180
from the maharishis,

165
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,190
and from great seers.

166
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:01,190
Another good point about Indians is that their religion

167
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,230
is not organized,

168
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,110
there's no organization that runs it.

169
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,030
It's a very big blessing.

170
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,150
Despite that,

171
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,240
all these ideologies in the Vedas also got

172
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,230
into some sort of a mental maya (illusion),

173
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,010
and that's how we have Arya Samaj and all these things

174
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,150
which are very difficult.

175
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,220
I mean, if you meet any Arya Samaji

176
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,020
you don't know how to deal with that person;

177
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,020
just goes on talking, talking - God knows,

178
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,170
such knowledge of his.

179
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,090
But he has not reached the point,

180
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,150
and he's satisfied with what he has read,

181
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,120
reading too much all the time.

182
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,060
That's what Kabira has said,

183
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,040
"Padi padi pandita murkh bhayo" -

184
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,070
"By reading too much, even panditas have become stupid."

185
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,130
I used to wonder, how can it be?

186
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,210
But now I meet many of them of that kind.

187
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:03,100
So what is the thing is by reading you cannot know

188
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,160
the ultimate.

189
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,020
Supposing there's a doctor

190
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,110
and he gives you a medicine for your headache,

191
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,130
and says take Anacin.

192
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,140
So you are reading the prescription,

193
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,210
"Anacin, take Anacin, take Anacin" -

194
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,190
the headache will increase or decrease?

195
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,220
You have to take the medicine.

196
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,230
And this is what is written in the Vedas,

197
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,050
is that you must find out your Self.

198
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,060
Same, part of the Vedas are Upanishadas;

199
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,120
throughout in the Upanishadas nothing but

200
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,090
"you find out your Self."

201
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,210
Even "Patanjal shastra" if you see it,

202
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,120
just in the beginning a wee bit of it is vyayama,

203
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,070
I mean,

204
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,180
ashtanga are there.

205
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,010
A very wee bit of it is

206
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,190
so-called physical problem that they have dealt.

207
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,190
In Sahaja Yoga also we use it,

208
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,060
but according to understanding where is the problem is;

209
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,080
not just like everybody is going into exercises and things,

210
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,190
getting heart attacks,

211
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,050
all kinds of problems,

212
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,050
heat, high blood pressure.

213
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,110
Sometimes it's low blood pressure,

214
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,200
sometimes high blood pressure,

215
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,030
and they come and tell Me, "Mother, we are doing yoga,

216
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,090
and see ..."

217
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,100
We are not only physical being,

218
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,180
we are not only mental being,

219
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,180
neither emotional being,

220
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,120
but we are spiritual being.

221
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,110
And the second type of movement we had in this country

222
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,190
is the bhakti.

223
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,210
Bhakti is all right,

224
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,100
going to temple,

225
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,230
but that also started deteriorating,

226
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,120
not to understand what is bhakti is.

227
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,120
Shri Krishna has said in His "Gita" -

228
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,090
you must know that Shri Krishna was a diplomat,

229
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,150
He was not a mother,

230
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,140
and He knew human beings how they are.

231
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,240
He wanted them to go round and round to find out the truth,

232
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:54,090
because nobody likes a straightforward statement.

233
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,040
At that time specially He just told it to Arjuna.

234
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,130
He said three things for them,

235
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,020
in which see His diplomacy,

236
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,000
if you can see through the lines,

237
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,240
is first one He said that you must get to gyana.

238
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,140
He was not a good salesman

239
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,150
because salesman will never tell you the best thing first,

240
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,010
but He said you should take to gyana.

241
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,060
That is what it is. "Gyana" means this knowledge

242
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,030
on your central nervous system.

243
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,030
But the second thing He said,

244
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,040
that you should do bhakti,

245
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:37,190
"Whatever fruit or flower or water you give Me,

246
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,240
I'll take it,

247
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,160
but you must do bhakti which is ananya."

248
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,180
Now if you know Sanskrit, "ananya" -

249
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,130
when you are not the other,

250
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,140
when you are a realized soul.

251
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,080
If you are not connected,

252
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,080
what is the bhakti on you?

253
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Many people complain,

254
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,160
"Mother, I have been fasting,

255
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,220
I have been doing this,

256
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,150
I did this, and see my condition.

257
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,200
I have become a nervous wreck."

258
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,030
It's not the mistake of God;

259
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,180
you are not yet connected.

260
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,230
It's a simple thing like a telephone.

261
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,160
If the telephone is not connected,

262
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,230
what's the use of telephoning?

263
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,020
You'll spoil the telephone.

264
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,150
So bhakti without the connection is wrong,

265
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,040
that's why Krishna has said it,

266
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,210
"Yoga kshema vam aham" - "First yoga, then kshema."

267
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,000
First you must achieve your yoga and then

268
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,200
your benevolence will come;

269
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,000
otherwise it won't work out.

270
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,120
Very subtly He has put yoga first.

271
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,000
Why didn't He say "kshema - yoga"?

272
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,060
So for bhakti He said like this.

273
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,230
For karma He said

274
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,180
that "Do all the work

275
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,210
and put it at the lotus feet of God Almighty."

276
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,070
That's not possible.

277
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,020
Many people say

278
00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:00,080
that "Mother, all my work I put at the lotus feet of God" -

279
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,050
even the murders, I think.

280
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,160
It's just a mental idea

281
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,190
that "I am putting it at the lotus feet of God."

282
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,030
You cannot,

283
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,140
because you are not at that state.

284
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,200
But say, a Sahaja yogi,

285
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,020
he will not tell Me that "I am raising the Kundalini"

286
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,070
he'll say, "Mother, it doesn't come up, it's not coming,

287
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,190
it's in the third person he talks.

288
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,230
He will say, "This won't go that side" -

289
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,160
in the third person,

290
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,160
because he is no more there.

291
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,160
So this is what is the karma,

292
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,070
automatically is at the lotus feet of God Almighty.

293
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,030
Well, He is doing everything.

294
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,020
We are just instruments.

295
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:49,120
Supposing this instrument says that "I am speaking"

296
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,000
you won't accept.

297
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,170
In the same way, when we say that

298
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,170
"I have put my ..." as if they take a load

299
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,230
and put it at the lotus feet of God -

300
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,010
no. It's automatic,

301
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,150
it's spontaneous.

302
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,240
That is sahaja.

303
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,220
That is born with you.

304
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:10,130
All of you have got this power within yourself.

305
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,090
Now there are books,

306
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:17,150
which describe Kundalini as a very dangerous thing.

307
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,170
It's absolute nonsense, I tell you.

308
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,060
I have been to so many nations,

309
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,190
so many people have got realization,

310
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,230
and there is no trace of any trouble to them.

311
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,080
On the contrary, they have improved in every way.

312
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:37,030
Overnight people have given up their drugs,

313
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,100
their bad habits.

314
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,030
Overnight people have been cured.

315
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,230
It's - I don't do anything as such.

316
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,070
I mean, you may think I am doing something - I don't do,

317
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,120
your own kundalini works it out.

318
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,040
It's very surprising how it works,

319
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,000
and how it helps you;

320
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,100
because she is your mother,

321
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,190
your individual mother,

322
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,110
and she knows everything about you.

323
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,170
It's all taped into her, you can say.

324
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,060
Into three-and-a-half coils she is placed -

325
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,190
it is because of some mathematical formula -

326
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,230
and when she rises,

327
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:17,060
she might leave a little heat,

328
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,110
because of the little, we can say,

329
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,220
the struggle that she has to do.

330
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,020
The heat is little bit sometimes generated in some people.

331
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,020
Supposing you are a liver patient,

332
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,020
then you might feel a little heat in your hands, that's all.

333
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,240
But this Kundalini you all have got it,

334
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,070
and it is the pure desire within you.

335
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,210
You know in economics it's a law

336
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,010
that in general, wants are not satiable.

337
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,060
We want today a house, tomorrow a car,

338
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,010
and then day after tomorrow a helicopter,

339
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,120
and like that it goes on and on.

340
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,100
When we don't have it we struggle for it,

341
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,010
and when we have it we don't enjoy it.

342
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,070
But this is a pure desire,

343
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,060
that is to be one with this all-pervading Power of God's love

344
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,020
We don't even think that there is such a power,

345
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,240
we take it for granted.

346
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,220
We see everything created,

347
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,190
we see beautiful flowers,

348
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,050
we see a big tree coming out of a small little seed.

349
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,020
Look at our eyes,

350
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,140
they are such beautiful cameras -

351
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,090
who has made them?

352
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,000
Who has evolved us to this state?

353
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:36,170
What is that power that has made us human beings?

354
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,150
We never want to find out,

355
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,240
because science cannot give explanation how:

356
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,090
how a seed sprouts,

357
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,120
how we became human beings.

358
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:52,040
And so it's all right up to that point,

359
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,130
beyond that we don't want to know.

360
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,080
So God Almighty has spread this beautiful chaitanya,

361
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,030
this Brahmachaitanya all over.

362
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,190
If I am saying so,

363
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,110
you must experience and then tell Me if it is there or not.

364
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,090
But just to say "no"

365
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,030
means you are denying yourself the chance

366
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:15,040
of getting connected to that vital power.

367
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:19,070
This vital power has evolved us, no doubt:

368
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,090
organizes everything,

369
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,060
creates everything,

370
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,230
vibrates everything.

371
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,120
It coordinates,

372
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,220
limits,

373
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,070
also above all it loves you.

374
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:38,030
So it thinks how far to go with you.

375
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:42,130
Such a beautiful power is all-pervading,

376
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:52,070
into every atom and into every living primule,

377
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,120
into every living being.

378
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,120
It acts so beautifully

379
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,180
that we don't even feel the smoothness of it.

380
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,130
We don't even see a flower flowering,

381
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:07,050
blossoming, opening, we don't see that.

382
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,150
It just blossoms and we say, "Oh, today there is a flower."

383
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,100
It just so sweetly, so beautifully,

384
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:21,190
that we do not even feel the existence of it in any way -

385
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,050
but it exists.

386
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,110
And unless and until we are connected with that power

387
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:33,180
we cannot know the ultimate reality,

388
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:38,240
because the spirit within us is not in our attention.

389
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,210
It's a witness of our attention.

390
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,050
But once this Kundalini rises,

391
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,100
she passes through the six centers,

392
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,070
pierces through this fontanel bone area,

393
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:52,050
which is the actualization of the baptism,

394
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:59,100
and then this spirit comes into our attention as a light.

395
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:01,230
And our nerves get a new dimension,

396
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:06,170
new dimension by which we become, we become -

397
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,040
again I say we become,

398
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,170
it's not just lecturing, it's not just bragging,

399
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,060
it's not some sort of a certificate -

400
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,100
you actually become collectively conscious:

401
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,080
samuhik chetana.

402
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,210
You can feel others.

403
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,080
You can feel on your fingertips,

404
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,050
on - there are five,

405
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,020
six and seven centers on the left,

406
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,050
and seven centers on the right.

407
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,200
These seven centers represent your emotional side,

408
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,060
and this, physical and mental side.

409
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,230
You can feel the centers of all the people.

410
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,070
Medically when we treat people,

411
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,010
we treat a tree from outside,

412
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,050
we treat the leaves, we can say.

413
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,190
But if you have really to treat the tree you have to go

414
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,240
to the roots,

415
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,220
and I am talking about the roots within us,

416
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,170
the Tree of Life which is within us.

417
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,080
You will be amazed that even Mohammed Sahib has described

418
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,020
Kiyama -

419
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,240
"Kiyama" means the Resurrection Time.

420
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,200
"When the Resurrection Time will come,

421
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,060
your hands will speak and will give witness against you."

422
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,120
They all have talked about this time,

423
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,100
the Last Judgment,

424
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,100
and this Kali Yuga is going to bring forth Satya Yuga.

425
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:29,160
But how many are willing to take to it is the point.

426
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,050
Thousands and thousands will go off to some sort of

427
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,210
a madding, maddening place,

428
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,180
but not after reality.

429
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,050
You require a kind of a divine intelligence,

430
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,020
I think, to understand that.

431
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,090
You'll be amazed,

432
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,170
I found Russia the most receptive country for this,

433
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,090
because they are not so materialistic.

434
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:54,110
They haven't got this kind of freedom or anything,

435
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,180
but they have freedom to go inside.

436
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,010
Very introspective people, even their writers,

437
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,070
I always read them,

438
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,180
Tolstoy and all these.

439
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,090
They all are very introspective,

440
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,130
and they are - you will be amazed that we had to

441
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,240
always arrange a big stadium,

442
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,130
and still there were so many people sitting outside.

443
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,160
At least in one place called as Togliatti there are

444
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,240
22,000 Sahaja yogis.

445
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,040
And when I was there this coup had taken place,

446
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,020
so I said, "Aren't you disturbed?"

447
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,190
So he said, "Mother, what is to be disturbed?

448
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,040
We are in the kingdom of God,

449
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,160
we don't belong to this kingdom."

450
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,070
Such nice things are happening all over the world.

451
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,140
We Indians have some other problems,

452
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,050
we are very conditioned.

453
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,110
We have such ideals before us,

454
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,140
but we never aspire.

455
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,080
We will worship Rama,

456
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,200
we'll worship a guru,

457
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,150
but what have you got within yourself?

458
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,150
You're clinging onto something;

459
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,120
what about you having something?

460
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,180
That is what is Sahaja Yoga.

461
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,160
Unless and until you know yourself,

462
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,240
you will not know Shri Ram,

463
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,010
you'll not know anyone.

464
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,180
The other day I saw one book on Sahaja Yoga some

465
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,130
crazy man has written.

466
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:15,070
He's denying the existence of Krishna,

467
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,110
he's denying the existence of Rama,

468
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:20,080
denying the existence of Jesus, everybody.

469
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,000
I said, such a crazy man,

470
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,230
it's very unscientific;

471
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,140
without finding out,

472
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,030
how can you say it?

473
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,120
you just say like that without finding it out.

474
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,110
Supposing I never come to Madras

475
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,210
and start describing Madras.

476
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,220
What you will call Me?

477
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,100
In the same way many people have written about God,

478
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,240
because there is no law prohibiting them to write,

479
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,150
any nonsense can be written.

480
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:48,190
But unless and until we get the truth,

481
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,180
we will not know who is a fake guru and who is not.

482
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,210
Like you may ask Me: "Mother, is he a fake guru,

483
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,070
is he a fake guru?"

484
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,190
I would say, why do you believe in Me?

485
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,100
Supposing I say he is not, so

486
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,230
you will start quarreling with Me.

487
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,030
If I say he is, then you will believe Me.

488
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,010
That's the kind of a thing is not necessary.

489
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,230
You'll know yourself,

490
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:11,000
and through that you will know the absolute truth,

491
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,230
because your spirit is absolute.

492
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,170
It gives absolute truth.

493
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,210
Tomorrow I'll tell you more about spirit,

494
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,020
I think for today this is sufficient.

495
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,040
We should have.

496
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,160
I think if you like,

497
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,240
we can have the session for Self-realization.

498
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,080
It takes no time.

499
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:39,080
First you should be ready and just ask for it,

500
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,170
and you'll all get it.

501
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,000
Of course you must be having questions in your heads.

502
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,230
Last time when I came to Madras

503
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,030
the whole time was spent in answering questions,

504
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,100
questions, questions, questions.

505
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,060
But now I would request you that if you have any questions,

506
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,240
keep them aside, and you can write them.

507
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,210
Tomorrow I'll answer all your questions,

508
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,080
but just now please,

509
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,000
if possible, try to get your realization.

510
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,100
Thank you very much.

511
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:48,010
I would say if you want to go out for five minutes

512
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,180
you can all go and come back,

513
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,210
it's all right - but don't talk, that's all.

514
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:35,000
I didn't tell you about

515
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,170
the third kind of movement we had in our country,

516
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:44,000
is of Nath Panthis.

517
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,240
Jains have Adi Nath,

518
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:53,170
and a deviation started from that.

519
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:01,170
One guru was supposed to give knowledge to only one person -

520
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:06,090
like Janaka had only Nachiketa -

521
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,180
till the time of Gyaneshwara,

522
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:15,190
that's in the twelfth century.

523
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,160
Gyaneshwara

524
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:32,110
was the disciple of his own brother Nivritinath,

525
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,090
and they suffered a lot.

526
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:39,220
And he asked Nivritinath for one permission,

527
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:43,240
that "Let me open the truth to the public.

528
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,040
Just I'll tell about it,

529
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,070
I'll not do anything,

530
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,210
I'll just tell about it."

531
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,120
Because,

532
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,030
thirteen, fourteen thousand years back

533
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,090
Markandeya has described about Kundalini.

534
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:02,160
Then came Adi Shankaracharya has described about Kundalini,

535
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:05,080
but all in Sanskrit language.

536
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,110
And Sanskrit self-knowledge was not available

537
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,230
to the common public,

538
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,120
and those who knew Sanskrit language

539
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:20,080
didn't want to get into self-knowledge.

540
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:27,160
Thus this knowledge was kept a secret all the time.

541
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:32,100
But he asked, and then he wrote "Gyaneshwari."

542
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:42,020
"Gyaneshwari" is nothing but a kind of a Marathi "Gita"

543
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:47,110
which he enlarged and decorated with lots of poetry.

544
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:52,090
Sixth chapter in "Gyaneshwari" he described about Kundalini

545
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,000
very clearly.

546
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:02,030
And that sixth chapter has been also mutilated,

547
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,060
but was called as "nishiddha",

548
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:09,070
is not to be read

549
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:12,030
by the people in charge of religion,

550
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,220
in charge of

551
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,200
our ascent, so-called.

552
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,240
And they said, "You are not to read this,

553
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,220
otherwise you will be in trouble."

554
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:28,110
Thus this chapter was closed and nobody

555
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,030
tried to know about it,

556
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,030
but the Nath Panthis then grew up.

557
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,120
Out of that we have Kabira,

558
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,200
we have Nanaka.

559
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,020
He talked of "khalis",

560
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,070
Nanaka talked of khalis.

561
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:51,050
"Khalis" means pure, nirmal.

562
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,160
Sahaja yogis are nirmal.

563
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:02,130
If somebody misuses anything,

564
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,110
it is shown clearly;

565
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,120
and a saint cannot be like this.

566
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,140
Khalis people cannot be like this,

567
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,090
cannot have violence.

568
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,170
It's love.

569
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:22,020
It's love which is absolutely nirvaj,

570
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,230
without any compensation.

571
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:28,010
It's love that's unlimited.

572
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,150
It's love which does not,

573
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,130
has any discrimination.

574
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,100
Like the energy in the plant rises

575
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,190
or we can say the sap rises,

576
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,200
goes to various areas:

577
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:48,010
as well as to the leaves, to the branches,

578
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,070
to the flowers, to the fruits,

579
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,100
and comes back.

580
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,180
It does not stick to one.

581
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,010
If you stick to one,

582
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:10,000
that is the death of that area

583
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,070
as well as the death of that tree.

584
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:19,050
So we have to understand that all these great incarnations,

585
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,050
seers and prophets,

586
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:25,050
all of them came on this earth on the same Tree of Life.

587
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,230
You have to believe in all of them.

588
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,060
If you start believing in them,

589
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,040
all of them,

590
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,140
then where will be the quarrel?

591
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,080
But those who believe only in one must quarrel,

592
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:39,000
and that's why they don't like us,

593
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:43,230
because we believe in all - not just a belief,

594
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,190
but it's the truth.

595
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:57,030
Now here I have to tell you that it's a living process

596
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,100
of evolution, the last breakthrough.

597
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:04,180
You didn't do anything to become human beings;

598
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,110
in the same way it is effortless,

599
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,040
it is sahaj.

600
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:14,050
Only thing I will tell you how to nourish your centers,

601
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:17,190
so that it is easier for Kundalini to rise.

602
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,140
It's very simple, all of you should do it.

603
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,200
Here now, you don't have to look at others,

604
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,220
but look at yourself.

605
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,000
You have to take out your shoes,

606
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,210
would be a good idea because - to feel the Mother Earth,

607
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,120
because she is the one who sucks in our problems

608
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,180
all the time,

609
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,080
specially this Yoga Bhoomi of ours.

610
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:47,040
We do not know how great we are to be born in this country.

611
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,110
They have made a mess out of it, doesn't matter.

612
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,020
If Ram Raja has to come it will come here,

613
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:57,020
not a political style but a spiritual style.

614
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,230
I think that's going down all the time.

615
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,100
You could push it in a little - it is going down.

616
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,090
It's all right now, I think, it's going to stay.

617
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:20,210
Now it's better. Thank you.

618
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,020
As I told you, you don't have to do anything.

619
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:31,190
You don't have to stop your thoughts,

620
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:36,110
you don't have to put any effort,

621
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,170
not to say any mantras, nothing.

622
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:42,030
Kundalini will do the job;

623
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,170
she knows you very well and she'll manage it.

624
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,180
Just have faith in yourself,

625
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:52,150
all confidence that you will get realization.

626
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:57,100
To feel guilty is something not natural,

627
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:01,020
is something I think has come through people telling us

628
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,070
that "You are sinners, you are this, you are that."

629
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,210
In My eyes nobody is a sinner.

630
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:12,080
You are lost, you are ignorant, but nobody is a sinner.

631
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,220
So we have to understand

632
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,050
that we have to have respect for ourselves,

633
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,120
because we are glorious,

634
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,070
we are fantastic.

635
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:30,070
Because we are not connected we look like that,

636
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:33,040
we despise ourselves, others may despise you.

637
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:35,110
But you are a human being,

638
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:40,200
you are the epitome of evolution.

639
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,130
And now a little breakthrough is needed,

640
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,220
just like a connection,

641
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:49,080
and I am sure you will know your Self.

642
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,170
After getting your awakening of the Kundalini

643
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,230
and piercing through your fontanel bone area,

644
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:01,180
you'll start feeling cool breeze in your hands.

645
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:04,140
This is chaitanya.

646
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:06,180
In the Bible is described as the cool breeze of

647
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,030
the Holy Ghost,

648
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,100
in the Koran is called as "Ruh".

649
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:15,190
After that you will also start feeling the cool breeze

650
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,130
coming out of your head.

651
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,230
Once the cool breeze starts coming out of your head,

652
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,060
then you'll feel very relaxed,

653
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:31,120
peaceful and joyous.

654
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,020
So many people start just laughing after that.

655
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,190
You should laugh.

656
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:39,210
This world is made for your enjoyment

657
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,240
and now you have to enter into the kingdom of God,

658
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,160
which is not only joy,

659
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:50,000
not only peace,

660
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,190
but it's blissful state.

661
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:05,130
I think if you are wearing anything tight or near the neck,

662
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,220
you'd better release a little bit if it is making you

663
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,050
uncomfortable.

664
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:12,000
Also if you can take out the spectacles...

665
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:14,110
later on when I tell you, not now;

666
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:18,000
because you are closing your eyes,

667
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,070
and then you don't open your eyes.

668
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:25,240
So first we'll show you how you are going to help yourself,

669
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,040
to begin with.

670
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,060
By this you will know your centers also.

671
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,240
On the left-hand side we'll be working.

672
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,080
First of all,

673
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:40,130
you'll have to put the left hand towards Me like this -

674
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,110
on your lap, comfortably.

675
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:44,080
Imagine, you don't have to go to Himalayas,

676
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,170
do anything of the kind,

677
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,130
just comfortably on your chair you should get

678
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:50,220
your realization - that's your right.

679
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,010
Put your left hand just like that.

680
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,200
Now with the right hand we have to nourish

681
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,210
our centers on the left-hand side.

682
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,130
First we put our hand on our heart,

683
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,100
because here is the spirit reflected.

684
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:14,070
It's the reflection of God Almighty,

685
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:18,220
is the spirit.

686
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:26,170
Then we go down onto the upper portion of our abdomen

687
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,000
on the left-hand side.

688
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:32,190
This is the center of our mastery.

689
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,170
If you are the spirit you become your own master,

690
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,110
you don't need any master,

691
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,110
your spirit guides you.

692
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,150
Then you go down into the lower portion of your abdomen

693
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,240
on the left-hand side.

694
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:55,070
This is how you know the knowledge

695
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,050
on your central nervous system.

696
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,110
This center is the one which gives you

697
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,220
pure knowledge - Shuddha Vidya,

698
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:08,230
which works on your central nervous system.

699
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,030
Then you raise your hand again on top,

700
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:17,090
on the left-hand side of your abdomen and push it,

701
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:21,120
which is the center for Guru Principle.

702
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:24,120
Supposing you have been to some wrong guru or anything,

703
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:27,160
it can correct it.

704
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:34,010
Then you have to put your right hand on your heart.

705
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:41,210
Again now you put your hand in the corner of your neck

706
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,240
and your shoulder,

707
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,230
and you have to turn your head to your right.

708
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:51,110
This is the center which catches when you feel guilty,

709
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:56,000
and when you feel guilty this center is catching.

710
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,100
It gives you many diseases - one of them is angina,

711
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:02,070
and also spondylitis;

712
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,120
and so many things happen to the organs because

713
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,020
they become lethargic.

714
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:10,210
So best thing is to put your hand here properly and

715
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:14,070
push your head to your right like this.

716
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:19,110
Then please take your right hand on top of your forehead

717
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,190
and bend your head as far as possible.

718
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,200
This is the center where you have to forgive,

719
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,030
forgive everyone without thinking whom you have to forgive.

720
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:39,100
Whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything,

721
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,020
it's our idea.

722
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,130
But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands.

723
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,130
So please put your hand like this,

724
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:50,160
this is the center for forgiveness;

725
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,020
without thinking about people whom you have to forgive,

726
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,240
or those who have harmed you.

727
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:59,230
This is a very important Agnya Chakra because

728
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:02,030
this is very constricted one,

729
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:04,120
and if you don't forgive it won't rise,

730
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,020
Kundalini cannot get through.

731
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:08,070
Just forgive.

732
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:11,240
Now push back the right hand on the back side of your head.

733
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,230
This we'll be doing later on,

734
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,210
I'm just showing you the chakras.

735
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:17,030
Now this back side here,

736
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,100
because you feel guilty all the time,

737
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:21,240
you think you have done wrong or anything,

738
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,200
so best thing is just to ask forgiveness from

739
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:28,190
the divine Power, this center is here.

740
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:34,130
Now, stretch your hand fully

741
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,100
and put the center of your palm

742
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:39,190
on top of the fontanel bone area,

743
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,130
which was a soft bone in your childhood,

744
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,020
the taloo, here - just there.

745
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,230
Push back your fingers nicely,

746
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:50,180
push back so there's a good pressure on your scalp,

747
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:53,020
good pressure on your scalp.

748
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:57,000
Now please bend your head as far as possible.

749
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:02,100
And now you have to move your scalp slowly,

750
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:05,130
seven times clockwise -

751
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,230
clockwise.

752
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,170
With a pressure: move your hands backwards,

753
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:19,100
otherwise - I mean your fingers -

754
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:22,070
otherwise it won't have a pressure.

755
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,040
Now, done!

756
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:39,000
Now,

757
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:43,090
so first of all we must have self-confidence

758
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:51,010
in ourselves, must have respect,

759
00:50:55,230 --> 00:51:00,090
and love for ourselves.

760
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:07,120
So now, we put our left hand like this,

761
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:11,070
put both the feet apart from each other,

762
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:17,070
and now close our eyes.

763
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:22,060
Put the right hand on your heart, please,

764
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:25,080
put the right hand on your heart.

765
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,040
Here

766
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:40,190
is the center of the spirit, here resides the spirit.

767
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:44,050
You can ask Me a question three times as you would ask

768
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,080
a computer, in your heart.

769
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,190
You can call Me "Shri Mataji" or "Mother,"

770
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,140
whichever way you like.

771
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:59,190
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

772
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:05,010
Ask three times, "Mother, am I the spirit?

773
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:09,010
Shri Mataji, am I the spirit?"

774
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:30,130
If you are the spirit,

775
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:34,240
you become your master.

776
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,190
So now please take your hand on the left-hand side

777
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:45,060
in the upper portion of your abdomen, and press it hard.

778
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:48,010
Now ask here a question again,

779
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:53,150
"Mother, am I my own master?"

780
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:56,070
Ask three times, please, in your heart,

781
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:59,020
with full confidence, "Mother, am I my own master?"

782
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,040
You are, but you just ask Me the question.

783
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,170
I respect your freedom,

784
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:25,140
and I cannot force on you pure knowledge,

785
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:27,230
you have to ask for it.

786
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,170
So now you have to put your right hand

787
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:35,090
in the lower portion of your abdomen, press it hard,

788
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,230
on the left-hand side.

789
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,150
Now here you have to say,

790
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:50,220
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge - Shuddha Vidya."

791
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:55,190
"Shri Mataji, give me Shuddha Vidya."

792
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:57,110
Please say it six times,

793
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:02,170
because this center has got six petals, Swadisthan center.

794
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:07,210
"Please give me Shuddha Vidya - pure knowledge."

795
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:21,210
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

796
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:26,100
the Kundalini starts rising.

797
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:32,110
But you have to facilitate its movement

798
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:38,120
by opening your higher chakras with your self-confidence.

799
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:43,030
So please now raise your right hand

800
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:46,120
in the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard,

801
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,070
on the left-hand side.

802
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:51,020
Keep your feet apart.

803
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,010
Here,

804
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,120
you have to say ten times,

805
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:06,160
with full confidence in yourself:

806
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:12,010
"Mother, I am my own master." Say that, please,

807
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,190
"Mother, I am my own master."

808
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,050
"Mother, I am my own guru."

809
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,070
Because all the great gurus, satgurus,

810
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:27,030
have created this center for your ascent.

811
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:35,180
And Mother always wants Her children,

812
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:39,010
not only what She has,

813
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:45,060
but to have much more than Her.

814
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,190
Now,

815
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,000
at the very outset I have to tell you

816
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:03,120
that you are not this body, not this mind,

817
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:06,030
not these emotions,

818
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:09,100
nor these conditionings and ego,

819
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:13,040
but you are pure spirit.

820
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:20,100
So now raise your right hand onto your heart,

821
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,160
and say with full confidence twelve times,

822
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,090
"Mother, I am the pure spirit."

823
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:39,170
Mother, I am the pure spirit" - twelve times -

824
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:46,090
"Shri Mataji, I am the Shuddha Atma."

825
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:51,020
With full confidence you have to say.

826
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:04,190
I have to tell you that this divine all-pervading Power

827
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:09,190
is the ocean of knowledge,

828
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:16,010
is the ocean of compassion and bliss.

829
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,140
You have to say with full confidence,

830
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:24,230
"Mother, I am not guilty at all" -

831
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:28,210
sixteen times, please say it.

832
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:35,150
You have to say, "Shri Mataji, I am Nirdosha,

833
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:40,240
I am Nirdosha." Please say it sixteen times.

834
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,130
Say it for My satisfaction.

835
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:11,020
Now raise your right hand on top of your forehead.

836
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:17,070
As it is, I have already told you

837
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:21,050
whether you forgive or don't forgive,

838
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,100
you don't do anything.

839
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:29,200
So now bend your head as far as possible,

840
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:36,040
and here, with all humility, forgive everyone!

841
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,070
Just forgive!

842
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,100
Don't think of people who have troubled you

843
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:44,200
and tortured you, but just forgive them.

844
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:50,080
That's the best way you can get rid of the burden,

845
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,130
because you are playing into wrong hands

846
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:55,080
if you don't forgive.

847
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,220
Now say it from your heart,

848
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:01,030
not how many times but from your heart, please say.

849
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:04,050
Many people say that it's very difficult to forgive.

850
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:06,050
What is there that's difficult? -

851
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,140
it's just to say it.

852
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:21,090
Now take back your right hand to the back side of your head,

853
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:24,230
and push back your head as far as possible,

854
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:28,050
push back, as far as possible.

855
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:32,100
Here again you have to say from your heart,

856
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:37,130
"Oh divine Power, if I have done anything wrong,

857
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:39,170
please forgive me.

858
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,240
If I have done anything wrong unknowingly,

859
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,190
please forgive me."

860
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:49,060
That also say it from your heart.

861
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,010
Now stretch your hand fully

862
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:12,190
and put the center of your palm on top of

863
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:16,220
the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone

864
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,080
in your childhood.

865
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:23,160
It is called as taloo, talavyam in Sanskrit.

866
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:29,030
Now, put down your head as far as possible,

867
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:30,220
put down.

868
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:37,230
And now, please try to move your scalp

869
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:44,010
with a pressure by pushing your fingers outward.

870
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:46,080
Please push your fingers outward,

871
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,040
put a nice pressure,

872
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:53,020
and move it seven times clockwise.

873
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:59,000
Here again, I cannot force Self-realization on you,

874
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,190
you have to ask for it.

875
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:02,190
So while moving your hand,

876
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,030
say it seven times,

877
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:08,220
"Mother, please give me my Self-realization.

878
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:12,000
Mother, please give me my Self-realization."

879
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,240
I cannot force it on anyone.

880
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:31,040
Please take down your hands.

881
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:34,030
Open your eyes very slowly.

882
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:36,130
Now,

883
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:45,150
put your right hand towards Me like this,

884
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,080
and bend your head

885
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:50,190
and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze

886
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:53,050
coming out of your head.

887
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,230
See at the fontanel bone.

888
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:03,140
Some people get it very close but not on top,

889
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,000
little away,

890
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:07,000
or some people get it like a jet,

891
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,150
quite far away.

892
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:12,020
It may be hot also possibly, it could be hot also.

893
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:16,120
If you have not forgiven, it will be definitely hot.

894
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:21,180
Now, please put your left hand towards Me.

895
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:27,130
Now, again bend your head and see for yourself

896
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:30,210
if there is a cool breeze or a hot breeze coming

897
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:32,080
out of your own head.

898
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,160
You have to certify yourself,

899
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,200
is Sahaja Yoga is becoming something;

900
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:40,150
as I told you there's no certificate.

901
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:46,200
Maybe some people are having hot breeze, doesn't matter.

902
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:56,010
Now, again please put your right hand towards Me,

903
01:03:56,100 --> 01:04:01,100
and bend your head and see for yourself again.

904
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:14,140
Now, just not to put it on top of your head,

905
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:17,140
little away, then you will feel it, little away.

906
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,090
Now please put your hands like this towards Me,

907
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:25,210
watch Me and don't think. You can do it.

908
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:40,210
All those who have felt cool breeze on their fingertips,

909
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:43,070
or hot breeze even,

910
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:50,020
and those who have felt either on the hands or out of

911
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:56,030
the fontanel bone area, or in both the areas,

912
01:04:56,190 --> 01:05:00,060
please raise both your hands.

913
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:02,150
Please raise both your hands.

914
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:16,100
Oh, my! May God bless you.

915
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:19,080
Most of you have got it.

916
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:22,050
Most of you have got it.

917
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:25,050
Now don't discuss about it,

918
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:29,030
because if you come to the mental level you'll lose it.

919
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:31,140
Just enjoy it.

920
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:37,170
I would like you tonight to sleep in peace.

921
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:42,040
Tomorrow again you telephone to your friends and people;

922
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,120
because you can't pay for it

923
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,060
and there is nothing to be done,

924
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:50,160
it's your own - like the Mother Earth doesn't know

925
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:54,160
how to charge the seeds for sprouting them.

926
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:58,180
So this is what is your purva punya also.

927
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:02,020
Those who haven't got it will get it tomorrow.

928
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:05,020
So please all of you should come,

929
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,160
and please call your friends.

930
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:11,060
This is the best thing that you can give to anyone.

931
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:13,140
This is what we were waiting for.

932
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:14,200
May God bless you.

933
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:25,120
Please come tomorrow.

934
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:29,120
I'll explain to you about the nature of spirit,

935
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:31,020
what is spirit.

936
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:58,100
See what I have done just now.

937
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:05,040
He wants you all to come and take darshan.

938
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:08,090
Now I am sitting before you, it's the darshan.

939
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:13,010
There is no need to touch My feet, no need.

940
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:21,170
Tomorrow we'll see. You are so much wanting to do it,

941
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:25,160
there is no need to do it. There are politicians for that.

942
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:31,110
Tomorrow please bring your questions.

943
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,040
Please bring your questions,

944
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:35,090
I'll be happy to answer.
