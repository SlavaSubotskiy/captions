00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,739
Sahasrara Puja – “The Ghost of Materialism”
3rd May 1987

2
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:39,970
Thredbo, Australia

3
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:46,730
Today is a very great day for all the Sahaja
yogis.

4
00:00:46,730 --> 00:01:08,460
It was a long time back that I desired Sahasrara
should be opened out, but waiting for a right

5
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,340
time.

6
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:26,470
It was important to do it at the right time.

7
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:38,869
A boy in Aurangabad, quite young, asked Me
a question, “Mother, this all-pervading

8
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:53,890
Power of Brahmachaitanya is beyond senses,
you cannot feel it through senses.

9
00:01:53,890 --> 00:02:01,959
How is it we are now feeling it through our
senses?”

10
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:08,450
This is the question he asked, and I ask you
the same question.

11
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:23,990
Before this, those people who got realization
could not talk about it in the way you can

12
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,730
tell people, that you can feel it on your
senses.

13
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:38,280
They could not explain, they could not put
it into experience.

14
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:56,129
Just what they did was to tell them in words,
words which were telling about something – like

15
00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:03,329
the taste of mango, unless and until you eat
the mango how will you know the taste?

16
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:08,239
By just knowing about “it’s wonderful,
it’s great, it’s fantastic,” still you

17
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:15,459
have not tasted the mango.

18
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:21,560
So what has happened now, was the question.

19
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,739
Another thing was that these people got so
fed up, like Gyaneshwara at the age of twenty-one,

20
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,130
he took a samadhi.

21
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:38,810
He went into a room and closed the doors and
settled down there, and he died there.

22
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,510
All of them – even Christ got Himself crucified.

23
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:55,920
Because they could tell a parable, they could
tell a simile, but what had happened to them

24
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:09,001
that they could not explain, and they felt
so sad and so frustrated.

25
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:13,840
In a way they finished their life very early.

26
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:25,400
This was the question.

27
00:04:25,400 --> 00:05:00,250
So what was the secret, can any one of you
tell Me?

28
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:17,000
The answer is simple, but it’s difficult
to digest.

29
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:31,300
The answer is that all these incarnations
who came on this Earth were part of the Sahasrara,

30
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:42,979
were part of the Brahmachaitanya, were part
of the Adi Shakti.

31
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:52,340
They came on this Earth, gave realization
to some people who were excellent, good people

32
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:59,820
who had no problems; as if they came out of
the ocean of love and took all of them to

33
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,590
the ocean of love, to enjoy that ocean.

34
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:10,240
As Kabira has said that “When a drop becomes
the ocean, what can I say?”

35
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,990
(“Jub mast hue, phir kya bole?”)

36
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,240
So many of them took to mauna, that is silence.

37
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:33,250
They disappeared, they got dissolved completely
into the ocean of love.

38
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:41,740
But you did not get dissolved.

39
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:54,159
Something special has happened to you, that
the whole of Brahmachaitanya, the whole ocean

40
00:06:54,159 --> 00:07:10,780
has taken the form of a cloud – that’s
Adi Shakti – and has come on this Earth

41
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:32,789
to shower the chaitanya on you people, enrich
you, nurture you, develop you, by manifesting

42
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:43,830
the love in such a manner that you have entered
into the body of the Adi Shakti.

43
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:49,530
So like one pitcher which is in the River
Ganges, you are like a cell in the body of

44
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:54,909
the Adi Shakti.

45
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:58,610
Your entity, your personality is preserved.

46
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:08,530
Despite that you feel the Brahmachaitanya
through your senses and you can give realizations

47
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,439
to others, but you are in the body of the
Adi Shakti.

48
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:21,630
As long as you are in the body of Adi Shakti
you can do all that.

49
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:25,069
This is the greatest thing that has happened.

50
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:32,240
The whole of the Sahasrara has opened out
with all the seven peethas of all the deities,

51
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,560
who are just part and parcel of it.

52
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:46,650
The whole of it has come in the form of a
Mother who is humble, who is deceptive, illusive,

53
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,890
who is Mahamaya.

54
00:08:50,890 --> 00:09:00,990
It’s the greatest thing that could happen
to human beings and to the whole universe,

55
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:09,130
that now you can get your realization, you
can give realizations to others, you can understand

56
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:16,870
through your senses, through your logic what
is vibrations, what it does.

57
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:28,610
Just like the proof is here: all the flowers
were dead last night, finished with the heat

58
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,560
of the people who were carrying them.

59
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,680
And then I just put some vibrated water on
them, and you see how they are.

60
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:46,730
Brahmachaitanya has revived them, but their
personality is there, they are all vibrated,

61
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,589
and they are looking so fresh and beautiful.

62
00:09:49,589 --> 00:10:00,250
Same thing with you, you all look so fresh
and beautiful, anybody can make out a Sahaja

63
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,580
yogi.

64
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:07,790
Under these circumstances one has to understand
that there are certain limitations which you

65
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,010
have to observe.

66
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,709
First of all, I have taken you in My body.

67
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:24,829
A foreign thing has to go in the body and
it has to be looked after, nurtured.

68
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:35,980
But if you become troublesome, then you’ll
be thrown out, I can’t bear you.

69
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,560
Some people are extremely troublesome.

70
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:50,440
They do not meditate, they have their own
ideas about meditation, they do not develop

71
00:10:50,440 --> 00:11:03,250
themselves, they do not mature, they live
in the past or in the future, and such people

72
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,250
are troublesome.

73
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:11,760
A simple thing I’d requested you all, to
put some ghee in the nose, which is a very

74
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,630
simple thing but is very important.

75
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:25,610
You all suffer from a very bad Hamsa, and
one of the things that is a symptom in a AIDS

76
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,510
case is a bad Hamsa.

77
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:42,370
You’ll be vulnerable to AIDS – and a small
thing like that is not observed.

78
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:51,680
It has to be a religious obligation that you
must listen to Me, whatever I say.

79
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,720
Actually you must obey Me.

80
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:03,880
My hand obeys Me, My fingers obey Me, My feet
obey Me; what about you, who are raised to

81
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:20,760
the great dignity and the great position of
being the yogis in the body of the Adi Shakti,

82
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:34,980
and they are acting as cells in My body?

83
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:43,820
First and foremost thing is, to do this kind
of a venture, to put all kinds of things in

84
00:12:43,820 --> 00:13:04,360
your body is a very daring thing, and the
process is also very hazardous.

85
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:21,060
This has to be achieved with great patience,
love, compassion and above all, hard labor.

86
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:30,949
This has to be regarded as the greatest thing,
that Sahasrara was opened by Me.

87
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:40,190
Of course I am the master of Sahasrara, I
am the master of all the chakras, but also

88
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:45,149
I’m beyond Sahasrara, much beyond it.

89
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:53,009
If that is the situation, you should be careful
about your Sahasrara – that is Me – and

90
00:13:53,009 --> 00:14:03,060
looking after your own heart which is the
Brahmarandra peetha here, which opens out

91
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,759
ultimately when you get your realization.

92
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:15,790
Sahaja Yoga is spreading everywhere horizontally;
vertically it must also spread.

93
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:24,040
And there, if you really have proper understanding
of what I am, Sahasrara should be absolutely

94
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,449
clearcut.

95
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:33,730
And to keep Sahasrara clearcut you must listen
to whatever I have told you, obey it as absolutely

96
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:43,279
a ordained thing.

97
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,120
To keep the Sahasrara clean is to open your
heart.

98
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:55,149
If your hearts are not open, how will I fill
it up with My love?

99
00:14:55,149 --> 00:15:00,610
Open your heart to your fellow yogis and yoginis.

100
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:07,350
Don’t get worried about what has happened
in the past, don’t get worried about what

101
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:14,399
has happened in your life as far as your relationships
are concerned.

102
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,920
Such things won’t happen now in Sahaja Yoga,
they cannot happen.

103
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:27,029
It has been worked out that way, it cannot
happen.

104
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:31,850
If this hand is paining, the other hand is
there to help it out.

105
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:37,500
You’re not alone, you are in the body of
the collective being.

106
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:46,019
If there are stupid people, if there are idiotic
people, Sahaja Yoga is not meant for such

107
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:52,550
people – in Sanskrit language they are called
as “mudhahs.”

108
00:15:52,550 --> 00:16:01,290
Neither this is meant for people who are over-smart
and trying to cheat themselves – intelligence

109
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:13,519
has that capacity – and to indulge into
things which are not Sahaj.

110
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,079
Slowly you will find your vibrations will
disappear, you’ll become sick, you’ll

111
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:26,000
have problems and you’ll be in trouble.

112
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:38,160
This is not a kind of a warning but a request,
because you are in My body, and whenever 

113
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:48,610
anybody tries to be troublesome in My body
I have to bear it up, and suffer a lot.

114
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:59,360
It’s a funny type of a crucifixion when
every moment you are hanged onto a cross by

115
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,690
anyone who wants to do it.

116
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:14,700
Sahaja yogis have all the laws in their hands
to torture My life, to trouble Me if they

117
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:27,459
want to; but they have also such a capacity,
such a caliber, such a potential that they

118
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:32,170
can reside in My heart forever.

119
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:38,460
Open your hearts, that’s the thing I will
say.

120
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,880
Now we have to see what keeps our hearts closed.

121
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:53,740
Firstly it keeps our heart in a binding, the
fear of the past.

122
00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:01,810
In the past if you have done anything wrong,
in the past we have had bad experiences of

123
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,140
people, we are very frightened.

124
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:14,450
I’ve seen, I’m surprised, I’ve seen
it Myself that in England when we were staying

125
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:24,420
– it was that day unluckily or luckily it
was snowing for the first time, and we were

126
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,860
shifting, so I had gone out.

127
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:35,289
And when I came back I saw a lady and a little
baby in a pram, standing at the door and talking

128
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:36,289
to some lady.

129
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:44,140
The other lady was just talking through a
little opening in the door, because there

130
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,049
was a chain on.

131
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:53,770
Then I went out and came back after half-an-hour,
and I saw the same thing.

132
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:59,929
The lady was still standing in the snow, and
this lady was talking to her through a chink.

133
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:02,400
I was surprised.

134
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,700
What is this going like “Midsummer’s Night’s
Dream,” these people are talking to each

135
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,950
other – horrible!

136
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:16,980
What was it that was frightening to this lady
inside the room – what this lady would have

137
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,160
done with the child, who had come to her door?

138
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,910
What was there to be so frightened of?

139
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:31,309
Because of the ego within yourself: you have
frightened others, you have tortured others,

140
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:38,990
you have dominated others, you have done all
these things, so there is fear in your mind

141
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:43,970
that others may do the same thing to you.

142
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:48,230
Or what is there to be so much frightened,
to lock your doors to everyone who comes to

143
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:53,380
your house?

144
00:19:53,380 --> 00:20:01,100
Secondly, maybe you might have been tortured
by someone or troubled by someone, so your

145
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,840
heart is closed, you can’t open heart to
others.

146
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,070
People just don’t talk, they just keep “mum.”

147
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,510
What has happened?

148
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,770
Just like a dead body moving about.

149
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:25,899
Supposing I was like this, who would have
told you the secrets of Sahaja Yoga and Sahasrara?

150
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:32,440
So this kind of a nature comes from people
who are frightened in the past perhaps, or

151
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:39,480
they might have frightened people with their
bad Vishuddhi.

152
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:48,390
Aggressiveness is one of the qualities in
the West, and that also is inherited by you

153
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,570
people.

154
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:53,950
As soon as you put them onto something, they
become aggressive.

155
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,630
I can’t bear it within Myself.

156
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:06,539
Supposing I have some sort of a medicine that
makes some cells very aggressive, then what

157
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:07,539
happens?

158
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:11,169
Ultimately I become a patient of cancer.

159
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:24,480
An aggressive cell is called as the malignant
cell, and such a cell cannot give you proper

160
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:32,310
attention, cannot give you proper depth, but
you become nothing but a malignant cell, a

161
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:36,680
cell which is creating a cancer.

162
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,080
And such a person creates cancer among Sahaja
yogis.

163
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:51,220
I’ve heard horrible stories about how some
women, some men have become aggressive.

164
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,690
With a little position they get, immediately
they become aggressive.

165
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:04,940
Say somebody is a wife of a organizer, or
a so-called leader’s, then she thinks she

166
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:14,100
is nothing but a prime minister or something
– or her husband becomes something.

167
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,660
This aggressiveness adds to the aggressiveness
of another person.

168
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,480
So then reaction starts.

169
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,780
One says something, the another says something;
we become reactionaries.

170
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:31,210
We haven’t got something of our own, that
we should be reactionaries?

171
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:39,320
There should be no reaction to anything, because
we have something of our own.

172
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:45,499
Why should we react to something, whatever
people are doing to us or have done to us?

173
00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:46,929
– it’s finished.

174
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:49,070
Open your hearts.

175
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:55,730
That’s why when you came to India, I think
you must have noticed that in the Indian heart

176
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:06,169
there is nothing like an anger for say, for
English or for Portuguese, or for anybody

177
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:08,500
who has dominated them.

178
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:15,620
They have so much love and affection and respect,
and they see that what good you have done

179
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,770
to them.

180
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:24,410
Like some barristers came to India and they
visited some high courts, and they had holiday

181
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:35,750
for one day to celebrate the visit of these
British lawyers and barristers.

182
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:44,310
But if you go to England they will beat you,
throw you out.

183
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:50,580
This aggressiveness has to go from your heart,
it has to get out of it.

184
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:59,450
There’s no place in My body for aggressive
people, no place at all.

185
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:07,980
I have not aggressed you, and you shouldn’t
aggress Me.

186
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,390
If you aggress any Sahaja yogi, you are aggressing
Me.

187
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,170
But when it comes to others, they won’t
aggress others.

188
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:24,429
Like a bad husband will aggress his wife,
but not other people.

189
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,200
So those who are non-Sahaja yogis, they do
not aggress them.

190
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:36,799
That’s a very important part of Sahasrara,
because ego covers a great part of Sahasrara,

191
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:45,549
and if your Sahasrara is covered with this
ego business, how can I help you and how can

192
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:47,460
I help Myself?

193
00:24:47,460 --> 00:25:00,950
Now so many of you are in My body, just imagine,
circulating fast; and most of them are fighting

194
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,710
to be in My heart, but they are settling in
My ego.

195
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:13,980
Well, I am egoless, because I have no reactions.

196
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,000
If you have no reaction you cannot develop
ego.

197
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,720
I’ve no reactions, I’m reactionless.

198
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:37,700
I am in My own peace and glory, trying to
work out Sahaja Yoga.

199
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:51,210
I do not react to anything, but your reactions
trouble Me because you are within Me.

200
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:58,070
Then the second part is the fear that comes
from childhood.

201
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:06,610
I do not know about Americans, but so many
Americans who came to Me were half-mad, cracked

202
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:11,880
people, absolutely cracked in the head, nothing
normal about them.

203
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,580
Either they will not talk – if they talk
they talk irrelevantly, you don’t know what

204
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,020
they are talking about.

205
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,191
Same with the French.

206
00:26:20,191 --> 00:26:30,440
French were mad much before anybody was mad
in this world, I think; very cracky people

207
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:38,240
you see, very difficult, it’s absolutely
can’t understand, everything upside-down.

208
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:49,510
When you blame our Indian telephone, you must
know they were made by French.

209
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:59,580
I always say that in Pune we have got the
telephone just to see, because it is called

210
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:05,671
as “Punya Patnam” – means the, is the
“city of punyas” – and only God can

211
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:13,760
listen to this telephone, but even God cannot!

212
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:24,630
So this kind of a crackedness, or this what
you call this madness, aggressive madness,

213
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:40,260
comes from ego going to the level of super-ego;
and they get first of all “what’s wrong?”

214
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:47,059
When they talk you feel they are fighting,
and these are love talks, “romantic” they

215
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:50,950
say, and we feel they are fighting.

216
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:59,799
And then after some time the aggressiveness
is very apparent, and then it becomes as if

217
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:04,490
they are off their heads, absolutely off their
heads.

218
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:08,750
And it’s very common with Americans, very
common.

219
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:18,420
You can’t find Americans when they are talking,
any good speaker, who doesn’t have twitches

220
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:25,059
on his faces, on his body, everywhere, because
so many nerves have been already strained

221
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:38,830
with this kind of “what’s wrong?” business
– going to the other extreme of deciding

222
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,320
everything for yourself.

223
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:56,429
And the thing behind is a ghost, I should
say, a very big ghost, and which is not in

224
00:28:56,429 --> 00:28:59,940
the past or the future, but in the present.

225
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,059
And that ghost I call it as materialism.

226
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:13,240
Materialism – it’s a ghost, it’s a horrible
devil that has come onto the heads of Americans,

227
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:19,390
and from them to all of us.

228
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:23,860
This materialism is a horrible stuff.

229
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:37,250
It’s so ridiculous, shameful, doesn’t
even suit a human person; even a dog would

230
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:49,690
hate such a materialism, to what level human
beings have gone.

231
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:56,159
This materialism makes a person absolutely
shameless.

232
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:06,890
A lady would not mind asking another lady,
“By the way, have you got my spoons with

233
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,890
you?”

234
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,610
There’s no shame in it.

235
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:22,350
When we were small we were told in India – I
mean, that’s our culture – that if somebody’s

236
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:30,480
pin is in your house you should preserve it
and return it, but even if your diamond is

237
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,929
lost with somebody, never ask for it.

238
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:39,200
Is not good manners.

239
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:49,820
What is more valuable is not the diamond,
is the relationship, is the friendship, and

240
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,370
the emotions of human beings to be respected.

241
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,370
How can you ask?

242
00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:00,730
If there was a diamond they would have found
it and would have given it to you, but if

243
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:07,830
there is no asking for that or reporting like
that then it’s sure there’s no diamond;

244
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,399
and even if it is there, doesn’t matter.

245
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:17,990
After all, what is a diamond? – you are
wearing or they are wearing, what does it

246
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,990
matter?

247
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:25,213
In My father’s house all the doors were
open all the time, all the doors, day and

248
00:31:25,213 --> 00:31:26,213
night.

249
00:31:26,213 --> 00:31:31,860
Never a thief came in, thought that doors
are open so nothing is locked, there’s nothing

250
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,860
precious.

251
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:41,659
Only we had one theft, and the thief came
and took away a gramophone from us, and some

252
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:42,659
records.

253
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:44,990
So My father said, “He’s a connoisseur.

254
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:48,400
He took the right thing from this house, so
let it be.

255
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:56,980
What’s the use of informing the police?”

256
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:09,440
So this materialism that comes in is a mad,
mad, mad dog, and gives you a disease which

257
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,120
is worse than any disease that is possible.

258
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:22,860
How people play on it, on this disease, as
you must have known that doctors when you

259
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:27,760
get some disease little bit, they’ll take
out your teeth, take out your eyes, take out

260
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,410
your nose, take out your purse and take out
everything that you have, for a little thing

261
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,520
like malaria or something.

262
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:45,500
But this disease takes away everything that
is beautiful within you, that is good within

263
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,810
you.

264
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:51,020
For example, it started a fashion.

265
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,820
With this materialism they start fashions.

266
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:58,330
Ladies are more vulnerable.

267
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:06,210
Fashion starts, any sort of fashion starts,
like the sleeves to be made long – in India

268
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:13,840
also they started – then make it short,
then make it half, then make it no sleeves.

269
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,610
I said, “I am not running that race.

270
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:20,779
I will have the sleeves all the time, same
sleeves so I don’t have to bother.

271
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:26,580
I can tell My tailor and he can make whatever
way I want to have, the tailor, because he

272
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:31,830
knows I make one style” – finished with
it.

273
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:35,130
Why do people want to run with the fashion?

274
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:41,890
Just think of it, what is the need to run
with the fashion?

275
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:44,640
Now new race has started, run with it.

276
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,480
Then another race has started, run with it.

277
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,440
Then the third race has started, run with
it – all the time running with the mad race

278
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:57,309
of fashions.

279
00:33:57,309 --> 00:34:04,360
Now a new race has started of fashions not
to put any oil in the head, so you become

280
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,760
bald, then you buy wigs.

281
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:12,950
It’s all entrepreneurs who are working out,
it’s all enterprises.

282
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:24,960
So you become absolutely bald-headed people,
then you get your wigs from them, then there

283
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,500
is a special charge for dressing the wigs,
so you go for dressing the wigs.

284
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,870
Goes on like mad.

285
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:44,910
Then there’s another type: now a new fashion
has started in London because, you see, these

286
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,930
people want to make some money.

287
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:52,480
People don’t even have so much of logic
and intelligence left in their heads to see

288
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,180
that what they were preaching one day, they
are just the thing against it.

289
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:03,680
Formerly it was you had to wear a tail coat,
you had to have your hair absolutely done

290
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:10,470
with proper hair-grooming and all that, as
you can see in the old pictures.

291
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:15,680
Then it started striped three-piece suits.

292
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:25,060
Now it is, I mean, few days earlier was tight
clothes, then they developed varicose veins,

293
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,090
you see.

294
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:31,770
So no, no – now it is the fashion to wear
absolutely loose dresses.

295
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:37,590
I saw the other day one lady making a dress
out of a big blanket, going like this.

296
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:46,070
I thought she was some priest or someone!

297
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,290
So that stupidity has started.

298
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:59,390
Imagine – think of Sahasrara, think of Divine,
in what world we are, and in what world the

299
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:03,350
stupid people are going.

300
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:11,530
That’s another world, absolutely another
stupid world where people just go after nonsensical

301
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:18,090
things, changing from one to another, changing
from everything: ties are changed, everything

302
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,140
is changed, giving you such a headache.

303
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,020
All the time you have to think, “Now what
fashion is there?

304
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,250
Let’s find out in the newspaper.

305
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,790
What is – this is the fashion now.

306
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:29,690
All right, wear this dress.”

307
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:34,960
All this is befooling going on, because this
ghost has entered into us.

308
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:45,750
In Sahaja Yoga also when we enter, be careful,
materialism should not enter into your minds.

309
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:51,670
It’s nothing important.

310
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:57,560
Even when somebody dies you are supposed to
wear something black, or white or I don’t

311
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,990
know what else, but white or black.

312
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:07,810
And somebody died in England who was a great
friend of My husband, and I had no black sari,

313
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:08,810
completely black.

314
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,810
I mean we don’t have such a sari.

315
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,260
I didn’t know what to do.

316
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,410
I told My husband I don’t have a black sari.

317
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,880
He said, “Then You don’t come.”

318
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,620
Imagine how his wife would feel if I don’t
go to the thing, how she would take it.

319
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:29,900
All this is nothing, what is important is
the black sari!

320
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:37,680
In every walk of life you are being befooled
by this materialism.

321
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,540
I don’t know how you got stuck into it first
of all.

322
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,410
And the other side is, the same people are
befooling you.

323
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:52,520
“All right, this is not good, this is too
much” – so go to the anti-culture.

324
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:58,360
What is anti-culture is another kind of materialism,
another kind of nonsense.

325
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:05,160
Nowadays they are having in this London an
anti-culture movement which is called as “punks.”

326
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:11,790
I think out of date now Me, but still what’s
for the time being as I see is punks.

327
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:15,300
It costs them forty pounds sometimes to make
that hair.

328
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:24,110
I mean, is it something that you are saving
money on that?

329
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:31,370
So the whole thing works out just to take
out your attention from reality, from higher

330
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:39,880
values, to something nonsensical.

331
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:48,650
In Sahaja Yoga also people must learn to lead
a life of collectivity.

332
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:55,890
It’s very important that we have to be collective.

333
00:38:55,890 --> 00:39:02,040
We shouldn’t talk of “This is mine, this
is mine, and this I own.”

334
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:07,270
Even about children you should not do like
that, “This is my own child, this is my

335
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,480
own baby.

336
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:16,900
This is my brother, this is my sister.”

337
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:22,410
This “my, my” should go away; but that’s
not possible, it’s not easy to forget about

338
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:28,000
it because left Nabhi and right Nabhi has
to be all right.

339
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,240
The only way to do it is that “Mother, it’s
all Yours.”

340
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:40,590
It’s not dangerous to say that, because
I’ll never take anything that is supposed

341
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:44,450
to be yours.

342
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:49,180
Just to say, “Mother, it’s all Yours,”
to start it – “It’s all Yours.

343
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:57,190
I am Yours, my heart is Yours, all my things
are Yours, my life is Yours.”

344
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:02,320
Even saying that is a big mantra for Sahasrara.

345
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:11,390
The deity of Sahasrara is a very simple person,
extremely simple, and can be moved with very

346
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:17,110
little actions, can be pleased with very few
little actions here and there.

347
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,620
Not much is needed to please the deity of
Sahasrara.

348
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:30,940
It’s a very simple person; little things
make Her happy.

349
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:36,620
Yesterday you had brought the flowers, and
I didn’t take them.

350
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:40,350
You all must have thought, “What’s it,
we couldn’t give flowers to Mother, holding

351
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:41,500
in our hand.”

352
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:46,690
But I wanted to show this miracle to you,
that’s why I didn’t take.

353
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:52,570
And I took it in the end, and see now they
are the best among all of them; don’t they

354
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:58,490
look as if they have been plucked from the
tree?

355
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:04,590
Just I wanted to show this, so I said, “I’m
tired,” I sat down and then I looked at

356
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:12,970
you with the flowers, you see, in the hands,
you’re sitting all of you!

357
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:22,580
So She is Leela Vinodini.

358
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:31,110
She plays around, makes little mischiefs here
and there for you to learn lessons.

359
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:37,770
Because if I tell you “Do this” then it’s
not possible, but little circuitous way I

360
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:41,500
can show you that this is wrong, you should
not do it.

361
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:47,380
There’s nothing to feel bad, I would have
taken all the flowers; but somebody must have

362
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,010
thought of it, why Mother has not taken the
flowers today.

363
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:59,330
I don’t know if you thought of it or not,
but I knew it Myself that I have to take the

364
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:04,760
flowers to show this miracle to them, that
these flowers are going to last much longer

365
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:12,180
than any other flowers, because they are vibrated
with the Brahmachaitanya.

366
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:17,220
And the water was very, very, very cold, so
even I opened a hot water tap.

367
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:26,070
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, they didn’t
die, despite that they are perfectly all right.

368
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:32,890
So you have seen so many miracles of this
Brahmachaitanya which is showing on your photographs,

369
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:40,530
on so many your lives, in so many changes
that have taken place within yourself, within

370
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:44,730
your family, within every one of you.

371
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:49,110
All this has happened because you are in Brahmachaitanya.

372
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:55,370
All this you are receiving because you are
blessed by Brahmachaitanya.

373
00:42:55,370 --> 00:43:00,660
But others are not, so your attitude should
be towards them that they are in the other

374
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,040
world – what to do, how to help them?

375
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:10,080
We should try to help them if possible, but
up to a point.

376
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,550
We should not drag down ourselves for others’
sake.

377
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:18,740
Up to a point only we can help them, and we
have to be very happy that Sahaja Yoga is

378
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:22,230
spreading so much horizontally.

379
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:26,920
But for vertical thing we must know our quality
must improve.

380
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,740
If some people rise higher, others will also
start rising with them.

381
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:38,920
It’s the absolute honesty of purpose should
be there, absolutely understanding should

382
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,450
be there.

383
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:45,680
Open your hearts to each other, so that you
open your hearts to Me.

384
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:51,030
Every cell must know another cell, otherwise
it won’t work out.

385
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:59,870
That is a great thing that has happened, when
you are on this Earth, when you are the ones

386
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:03,310
who have to receive this great blessing.

387
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:09,810
So many saints did not receive it, so many
great people who came on this Earth, they

388
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:11,090
did not receive it.

389
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:17,120
Even the incarnations who came on this Earth
could not do it what you are doing.

390
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:25,800
So have that satisfaction and glory of your
own being and of your own standard, and of

391
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,800
your own caliber.

392
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,060
The others are not of your caliber, all right,
forget about it.

393
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:38,380
That should not give you ego, but should give
you a personality that does not react.

394
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:46,480
We have something of our own, we do not react
to things.

395
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,500
We are not reactionaries.

396
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:56,320
And things will disappear which are harmful.

397
00:44:56,320 --> 00:47:30,640
Everything will be perfectly all right, because
we are standing 

398
00:47:30,640 --> 00:48:29,190
in our 

399
00:48:29,190 --> 00:49:46,750
own perfection, in our own glory.

400
00:49:46,750 --> 00:50:23,020
What do we need?

401
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:46,540
Nothing, just enjoying ourselves.

402
00:50:46,540 --> 01:20:47,710
May God bless you all.
