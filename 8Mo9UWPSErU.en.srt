00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,739
Sahasrara Puja – “The Ghost of Materialism”
3rd May 1987

2
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:39,969
Thredbo, Australia

3
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:46,969
Today is a very great day for all the Sahaja
yogis. It was a long time back that I desired

4
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:01,420
Sahasrara should be opened out, but waiting
for a right time. It was important to do it

5
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,470
at the right time.

6
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:33,470
A boy in Aurangabad, quite young, asked Me
a question, “Mother, this all-pervading

7
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:45,869
Power of Brahmachaitanya is beyond senses,
you cannot feel it through senses. How is

8
00:01:55,349 --> 00:02:02,349
it we are now feeling it through our senses?”
This is the question he asked, and I ask you

9
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:13,520
the same question. Before this, those people
who got realization could not talk about it

10
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:27,010
in the way you can tell people, that you can
feel it on your senses. They could not explain,

11
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:40,069
they could not put it into experience. Just
what they did was to tell them in words, words

12
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:54,950
which were telling about something – like
the taste of mango, unless and until you eat

13
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:06,459
the mango how will you know the taste? By
just knowing about “it’s wonderful, it’s

14
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:13,459
great, it’s fantastic,” still you have
not tasted the mango.

15
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:22,459
So what has happened now, was the question.
Another thing was that these people got so

16
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:30,109
fed up, like Gyaneshwara at the age of twenty-one,
he took a samadhi. He went into a room and

17
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:38,889
closed the doors and settled down there, and
he died there. All of them – even Christ

18
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:49,950
got Himself crucified. Because they could
tell a parable, they could tell a simile,

19
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:58,159
but what had happened to them that they could
not explain, and they felt so sad and so frustrated.

20
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:13,840
In a way they finished their life very early.

21
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,840
This was the question. So what was the secret,
can any one of you tell Me?

22
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,240
The answer is simple, but it’s difficult
to digest. The answer is that all these incarnations

23
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:33,500
who came on this Earth were part of the Sahasrara,
were part of the Brahmachaitanya, were part

24
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:43,289
of the Adi Shakti. They came on this Earth,
gave realization to some people who were excellent,

25
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:57,729
good people who had no problems; as if they
came out of the ocean of love and took all

26
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:06,349
of them to the ocean of love, to enjoy that
ocean. As Kabira has said that “When a drop

27
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:14,449
becomes the ocean, what can I say?” (“Jub
mast hue, phir kya bole?”) So many of them

28
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:25,879
took to mauna, that is silence. They disappeared,
they got dissolved completely into the ocean

29
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:33,250
of love.

30
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:40,250
But you did not get dissolved. Something special
has happened to you, that the whole of Brahmachaitanya,

31
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:57,659
the whole ocean has taken the form of a cloud
– that’s Adi Shakti – and has come on

32
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:13,389
this Earth to shower the chaitanya on you
people, enrich you, nurture you, develop you,

33
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:34,500
by manifesting the love in such a manner that
you have entered into the body of the Adi

34
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:49,370
Shakti. So like one pitcher which is in the
River Ganges, you are like a cell in the body

35
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:56,409
of the Adi Shakti. Your entity, your personality
is preserved. Despite that you feel the Brahmachaitanya

36
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:10,319
through your senses and you can give realizations
to others, but you are in the body of the

37
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:18,509
Adi Shakti. As long as you are in the body
of Adi Shakti you can do all that.

38
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:27,780
This is the greatest thing that has happened.
The whole of the Sahasrara has opened out

39
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:34,780
with all the seven peethas of all the deities,
who are just part and parcel of it. The whole

40
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:42,300
of it has come in the form of a Mother who
is humble, who is deceptive, illusive, who

41
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:54,410
is Mahamaya. It’s the greatest thing that
could happen to human beings and to the whole

42
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:06,800
universe, that now you can get your realization,
you can give realizations to others, you can

43
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:15,300
understand through your senses, through your
logic what is vibrations, what it does.

44
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:23,870
Just like the proof is here: all the flowers
were dead last night, finished with the heat

45
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:34,839
of the people who were carrying them. And
then I just put some vibrated water on them,

46
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,839
and you see how they are. Brahmachaitanya
has revived them, but their personality is

47
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,560
there, they are all vibrated, and they are
looking so fresh and beautiful. Same thing

48
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:58,459
with you, you all look so fresh and beautiful,
anybody can make out a Sahaja yogi.

49
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:07,790
Under these circumstances one has to understand
that there are certain limitations which you

50
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:14,790
have to observe. First of all, I have taken
you in My body. A foreign thing has to go

51
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:23,350
in the body and it has to be looked after,
nurtured. But if you become troublesome, then

52
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:35,700
you’ll be thrown out, I can’t bear you.
Some people are extremely troublesome. They

53
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:47,649
do not meditate, they have their own ideas
about meditation, they do not develop themselves,

54
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:57,870
they do not mature, they live in the past
or in the future, and such people are troublesome.

55
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:11,010
A simple thing I’d requested you all, to
put some ghee in the nose, which is a very

56
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,269
simple thing but is very important. You all
suffer from a very bad Hamsa, and one of the

57
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:25,269
things that is a symptom in a AIDS case is
a bad Hamsa. You’ll be vulnerable to AIDS

58
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:42,450
– and a small thing like that is not observed.
It has to be a religious obligation that you

59
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:56,029
must listen to Me, whatever I say. Actually
you must obey Me. My hand obeys Me, My fingers

60
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:03,730
obey Me, My feet obey Me; what about you,
who are raised to the great dignity and the

61
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:13,329
great position of being the yogis in the body
of the Adi Shakti, and they are acting as

62
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:30,199
cells in My body?

63
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:41,980
First and foremost thing is, to do this kind
of a venture, to put all kinds of things in

64
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:50,820
your body is a very daring thing, and the
process is also very hazardous. This has to

65
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:11,699
be achieved with great patience, love, compassion
and above all, hard labor. This has to be

66
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:29,399
regarded as the greatest thing, that Sahasrara
was opened by Me. Of course I am the master

67
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:39,730
of Sahasrara, I am the master of all the chakras,
but also I’m beyond Sahasrara, much beyond

68
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:50,829
it. If that is the situation, you should be
careful about your Sahasrara – that is Me

69
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:58,970
– and looking after your own heart which
is the Brahmarandra peetha here, which opens

70
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,759
out ultimately when you get your realization.

71
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:13,759
Sahaja Yoga is spreading everywhere horizontally;
vertically it must also spread. And there,

72
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:23,269
if you really have proper understanding of
what I am, Sahasrara should be absolutely

73
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:31,040
clearcut. And to keep Sahasrara clearcut you
must listen to whatever I have told you, obey

74
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:38,110
it as absolutely a ordained thing. To keep
the Sahasrara clean is to open your heart.

75
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:54,120
If your hearts are not open, how will I fill
it up with My love? Open your heart to your

76
00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:03,459
fellow yogis and yoginis. Don’t get worried
about what has happened in the past, don’t

77
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:13,040
get worried about what has happened in your
life as far as your relationships are concerned.

78
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:21,399
Such things won’t happen now in Sahaja Yoga,
they cannot happen. It has been worked out

79
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:30,970
that way, it cannot happen. If this hand is
paining, the other hand is there to help it

80
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:38,190
out. You’re not alone, you are in the body
of the collective being. If there are stupid

81
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:47,759
people, if there are idiotic people, Sahaja
Yoga is not meant for such people – in Sanskrit

82
00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:57,569
language they are called as “mudhahs.”
Neither this is meant for people who are over-smart

83
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:04,980
and trying to cheat themselves – intelligence
has that capacity – and to indulge into

84
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:13,850
things which are not Sahaj. Slowly you will
find your vibrations will disappear, you’ll

85
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:24,100
become sick, you’ll have problems and you’ll
be in trouble.

86
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
This is not a kind of a warning but a request,
because you are in My body, and whenever 
anybody tries to be troublesome in My body

87
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:50,430
I have to bear it up, and suffer a lot. It’s
a funny type of a crucifixion when every moment

88
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:03,730
you are hanged onto a cross by anyone who
wants to do it. Sahaja yogis have all the

89
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:15,740
laws in their hands to torture My life, to
trouble Me if they want to; but they have

90
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:25,449
also such a capacity, such a caliber, such
a potential that they can reside in My heart

91
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:36,090
forever. Open your hearts, that’s the thing
I will say.

92
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:45,460
Now we have to see what keeps our hearts closed.
Firstly it keeps our heart in a binding, the

93
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:56,510
fear of the past. In the past if you have
done anything wrong, in the past we have had

94
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:06,890
bad experiences of people, we are very frightened.
I’ve seen, I’m surprised, I’ve seen

95
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:15,590
it Myself that in England when we were staying
– it was that day unluckily or luckily it

96
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:26,809
was snowing for the first time, and we were
shifting, so I had gone out. And when I came

97
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:34,350
back I saw a lady and a little baby in a pram,
standing at the door and talking to some lady.

98
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,840
The other lady was just talking through a
little opening in the door, because there

99
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:51,140
was a chain on. Then I went out and came back
after half-an-hour, and I saw the same thing.

100
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:59,929
The lady was still standing in the snow, and
this lady was talking to her through a chink.

101
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:06,929
I was surprised. What is this going like “Midsummer’s
Night’s Dream,” these people are talking

102
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:14,090
to each other – horrible! What was it that
was frightening to this lady inside the room

103
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:20,360
– what this lady would have done with the
child, who had come to her door? What was

104
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:27,360
there to be so frightened of? Because of the
ego within yourself: you have frightened others,

105
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:36,360
you have tortured others, you have dominated
others, you have done all these things, so

106
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:44,330
there is fear in your mind that others may
do the same thing to you. Or what is there

107
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:51,919
to be so much frightened, to lock your doors
to everyone who comes to your house?

108
00:19:53,380 --> 00:20:00,380
Secondly, maybe you might have been tortured
by someone or troubled by someone, so your

109
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:06,510
heart is closed, you can’t open heart to
others. People just don’t talk, they just

110
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:13,510
keep “mum.” What has happened? Just like
a dead body moving about. Supposing I was

111
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:23,250
like this, who would have told you the secrets
of Sahaja Yoga and Sahasrara? So this kind

112
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:33,370
of a nature comes from people who are frightened
in the past perhaps, or they might have frightened

113
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:39,480
people with their bad Vishuddhi.

114
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:46,480
Aggressiveness is one of the qualities in
the West, and that also is inherited by you

115
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:55,390
people. As soon as you put them onto something,
they become aggressive. I can’t bear it

116
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:03,440
within Myself. Supposing I have some sort
of a medicine that makes some cells very aggressive,

117
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:11,870
then what happens? Ultimately I become a patient
of cancer. An aggressive cell is called as

118
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:24,700
the malignant cell, and such a cell cannot
give you proper attention, cannot give you

119
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:33,909
proper depth, but you become nothing but a
malignant cell, a cell which is creating a

120
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:41,080
cancer. And such a person creates cancer among
Sahaja yogis.

121
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:48,080
I’ve heard horrible stories about how some
women, some men have become aggressive. With

122
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:58,270
a little position they get, immediately they
become aggressive. Say somebody is a wife

123
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:06,659
of a organizer, or a so-called leader’s,
then she thinks she is nothing but a prime

124
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:14,740
minister or something – or her husband becomes
something. This aggressiveness adds to the

125
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:23,270
aggressiveness of another person. So then
reaction starts. One says something, the another

126
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:29,039
says something; we become reactionaries. We
haven’t got something of our own, that we

127
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:36,039
should be reactionaries? There should be no
reaction to anything, because we have something

128
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:44,080
of our own. Why should we react to something,
whatever people are doing to us or have done

129
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:51,080
to us? – it’s finished. Open your hearts.
That’s why when you came to India, I think

130
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:59,289
you must have noticed that in the Indian heart
there is nothing like an anger for say, for

131
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:08,909
English or for Portuguese, or for anybody
who has dominated them. They have so much

132
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:16,770
love and affection and respect, and they see
that what good you have done to them. Like

133
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:23,770
some barristers came to India and they visited
some high courts, and they had holiday for

134
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:31,630
one day to celebrate the visit of these British
lawyers and barristers. But if you go to England

135
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:44,270
they will beat you, throw you out.

136
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:51,309
This aggressiveness has to go from your heart,
it has to get out of it. There’s no place

137
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:58,750
in My body for aggressive people, no place
at all. I have not aggressed you, and you

138
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:08,740
shouldn’t aggress Me. If you aggress any
Sahaja yogi, you are aggressing Me. But when

139
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:19,740
it comes to others, they won’t aggress others.
Like a bad husband will aggress his wife,

140
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:26,830
but not other people. So those who are non-Sahaja
yogis, they do not aggress them. That’s

141
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:36,340
a very important part of Sahasrara, because
ego covers a great part of Sahasrara, and

142
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:44,429
if your Sahasrara is covered with this ego
business, how can I help you and how can I

143
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:52,610
help Myself? Now so many of you are in My
body, just imagine, circulating fast; and

144
00:24:53,820 --> 00:25:00,820
most of them are fighting 
to be in My heart, but they are settling in
My ego. Well, I am egoless, because I have

145
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:18,850
no reactions. If you have no reaction you
cannot develop ego. I’ve no reactions, I’m

146
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:27,409
reactionless. I am in My own peace and glory,
trying to work out Sahaja Yoga. I do not react

147
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:46,990
to anything, but your reactions trouble Me
because you are within Me.

148
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:58,210
Then the second part is the fear that comes
from childhood. I do not know about Americans,

149
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:06,890
but so many Americans who came to Me were
half-mad, cracked people, absolutely cracked

150
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:15,090
in the head, nothing normal about them. Either
they will not talk – if they talk they talk

151
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:20,330
irrelevantly, you don’t know what they are
talking about. Same with the French. French

152
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:27,330
were mad much before anybody was mad in this
world, I think; very cracky people you see,

153
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:37,559
very difficult, it’s absolutely can’t
understand, everything upside-down. When you

154
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:45,330
blame our Indian telephone, you must know
they were made by French. I always say that

155
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:59,390
in Pune we have got the telephone just to
see, because it is called as “Punya Patnam”

156
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:07,559
– means the, is the “city of punyas”
– and only God can listen to this telephone,

157
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,760
but even God cannot!

158
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:20,760
So this kind of a crackedness, or this what
you call this madness, aggressive madness,

159
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:31,630
comes from ego going to the level of super-ego;
and they get first of all “what’s wrong?”

160
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:47,059
When they talk you feel they are fighting,
and these are love talks, “romantic” they

161
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:54,059
say, and we feel they are fighting. And then
after some time the aggressiveness is very

162
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:04,220
apparent, and then it becomes as if they are
off their heads, absolutely off their heads.

163
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:11,490
And it’s very common with Americans, very
common. You can’t find Americans when they

164
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:19,370
are talking, any good speaker, who doesn’t
have twitches on his faces, on his body, everywhere,

165
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:29,470
because so many nerves have been already strained
with this kind of “what’s wrong?” business

166
00:28:35,369 --> 00:28:41,320
– going to the other extreme of deciding
everything for yourself.

167
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:48,320
And the thing behind is a ghost, I should
say, a very big ghost, and which is not in

168
00:28:56,429 --> 00:29:02,059
the past or the future, but in the present.
And that ghost I call it as materialism. Materialism

169
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:09,059
– it’s a ghost, it’s a horrible devil
that has come onto the heads of Americans,

170
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:20,240
and from them to all of us. This materialism
is a horrible stuff. It’s so ridiculous,

171
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:35,140
shameful, doesn’t even suit a human person;
even a dog would hate such a materialism,

172
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:46,720
to what level human beings have gone. This
materialism makes a person absolutely shameless.

173
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:03,159
A lady would not mind asking another lady,
“By the way, have you got my spoons with

174
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:13,890
you?” There’s no shame in it. When we
were small we were told in India – I mean,

175
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:26,480
that’s our culture – that if somebody’s
pin is in your house you should preserve it

176
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:34,220
and return it, but even if your diamond is
lost with somebody, never ask for it. Is not

177
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:41,220
good manners. What is more valuable is not
the diamond, is the relationship, is the friendship,

178
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:56,750
and the emotions of human beings to be respected.
How can you ask? If there was a diamond they

179
00:30:57,269 --> 00:31:04,169
would have found it and would have given it
to you, but if there is no asking for that

180
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:09,080
or reporting like that then it’s sure there’s
no diamond; and even if it is there, doesn’t

181
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:16,080
matter. After all, what is a diamond? – you
are wearing or they are wearing, what does

182
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:18,830
it matter?

183
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:25,210
In My father’s house all the doors were
open all the time, all the doors, day and

184
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:31,070
night. Never a thief came in, thought that
doors are open so nothing is locked, there’s

185
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:38,070
nothing precious. Only we had one theft, and
the thief came and took away a gramophone

186
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:46,179
from us, and some records. So My father said,
“He’s a connoisseur. He took the right

187
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:53,190
thing from this house, so let it be. What’s
the use of informing the police?”

188
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:03,980
So this materialism that comes in is a mad,
mad, mad dog, and gives you a disease which

189
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:16,440
is worse than any disease that is possible.
How people play on it, on this disease, as

190
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:24,929
you must have known that doctors when you
get some disease little bit, they’ll take

191
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:30,580
out your teeth, take out your eyes, take out
your nose, take out your purse and take out

192
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:37,580
everything that you have, for a little thing
like malaria or something. But this disease

193
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:46,809
takes away everything that is beautiful within
you, that is good within you.

194
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:53,809
For example, it started a fashion. With this
materialism they start fashions. Ladies are

195
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:03,080
more vulnerable. Fashion starts, any sort
of fashion starts, like the sleeves to be

196
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:10,500
made long – in India also they started – then
make it short, then make it half, then make

197
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:17,269
it no sleeves. I said, “I am not running
that race. I will have the sleeves all the

198
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:23,480
time, same sleeves so I don’t have to bother.
I can tell My tailor and he can make whatever

199
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:30,480
way I want to have, the tailor, because he
knows I make one style” – finished with

200
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:38,200
it. Why do people want to run with the fashion?
Just think of it, what is the need to run

201
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,889
with the fashion?

202
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:47,730
Now new race has started, run with it. Then
another race has started, run with it. Then

203
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:54,730
the third race has started, run with it – all
the time running with the mad race of fashions.

204
00:33:57,309 --> 00:34:04,309
Now a new race has started of fashions not
to put any oil in the head, so you become

205
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:11,360
bald, then you buy wigs. It’s all entrepreneurs
who are working out, it’s all enterprises.

206
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:19,950
So you become absolutely bald-headed people,
then you get your wigs from them, then there

207
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:31,960
is a special charge for dressing the wigs,
so you go for dressing the wigs. Goes on like

208
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:39,030
mad. Then there’s another type: now a new
fashion has started in London because, you

209
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:49,430
see, these people want to make some money.
People don’t even have so much of logic

210
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:54,520
and intelligence left in their heads to see
that what they were preaching one day, they

211
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:01,140
are just the thing against it. Formerly it
was you had to wear a tail coat, you had to

212
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:08,140
have your hair absolutely done with proper
hair-grooming and all that, as you can see

213
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:15,340
in the old pictures. Then it started striped
three-piece suits. Now it is, I mean, few

214
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:25,950
days earlier was tight clothes, then they
developed varicose veins, you see. So no,

215
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:33,250
no – now it is the fashion to wear absolutely
loose dresses. I saw the other day one lady

216
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:40,200
making a dress out of a big blanket, going
like this. I thought she was some priest or

217
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:46,070
someone!

218
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:53,070
So that stupidity has started. Imagine – think
of Sahasrara, think of Divine, in what world

219
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:04,150
we are, and in what world the stupid people
are going. That’s another world, absolutely

220
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:13,540
another stupid world where people just go
after nonsensical things, changing from one

221
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:19,000
to another, changing from everything: ties
are changed, everything is changed, giving

222
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,240
you such a headache. All the time you have
to think, “Now what fashion is there? Let’s

223
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:29,680
find out in the newspaper. What is – this
is the fashion now. All right, wear this dress.”

224
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,960
All this is befooling going on, because this
ghost has entered into us.

225
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,960
In Sahaja Yoga also when we enter, be careful,
materialism should not enter into your minds.

226
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:52,750
It’s nothing important. Even when somebody
dies you are supposed to wear something black,

227
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:03,680
or white or I don’t know what else, but
white or black. And somebody died in England

228
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:09,330
who was a great friend of My husband, and
I had no black sari, completely black. I mean

229
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:13,600
we don’t have such a sari. I didn’t know
what to do. I told My husband I don’t have

230
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,900
a black sari. He said, “Then You don’t
come.” Imagine how his wife would feel if

231
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:25,900
I don’t go to the thing, how she would take
it. All this is nothing, what is important

232
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:32,900
is the black sari! In every walk of life you
are being befooled by this materialism. I

233
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:43,540
don’t know how you got stuck into it first
of all.

234
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:48,750
And the other side is, the same people are
befooling you. “All right, this is not good,

235
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:55,670
this is too much” – so go to the anti-culture.
What is anti-culture is another kind of materialism,

236
00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:02,670
another kind of nonsense. Nowadays they are
having in this London an anti-culture movement

237
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,200
which is called as “punks.” I think out
of date now Me, but still what’s for the

238
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:15,300
time being as I see is punks. It costs them
forty pounds sometimes to make that hair.

239
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:22,300
I mean, is it something that you are saving
money on that? So the whole thing works out

240
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:33,280
just to take out your attention from reality,
from higher values, to something nonsensical.

241
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:46,880
In Sahaja Yoga also people must learn to lead
a life of collectivity. It’s very important

242
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:59,600
that we have to be collective. We shouldn’t
talk of “This is mine, this is mine, and

243
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:06,700
this I own.” Even about children you should
not do like that, “This is my own child,

244
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:13,700
this is my own baby. This is my brother, this
is my sister.” This “my, my” should

245
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:23,430
go away; but that’s not possible, it’s
not easy to forget about it because left Nabhi

246
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:30,430
and right Nabhi has to be all right. The only
way to do it is that “Mother, it’s all

247
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:40,220
Yours.” It’s not dangerous to say that,
because I’ll never take anything that is

248
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:47,220
supposed to be yours. Just to say, “Mother,
it’s all Yours,” to start it – “It’s

249
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:54,990
all Yours. I am Yours, my heart is Yours,
all my things are Yours, my life is Yours.”

250
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:02,320
Even saying that is a big mantra for Sahasrara.

251
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:09,320
The deity of Sahasrara is a very simple person,
extremely simple, and can be moved with very

252
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:17,510
little actions, can be pleased with very few
little actions here and there. Not much is

253
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:24,510
needed to please the deity of Sahasrara. It’s
a very simple person; little things make Her

254
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:37,430
happy. Yesterday you had brought the flowers,
and I didn’t take them. You all must have

255
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:41,500
thought, “What’s it, we couldn’t give
flowers to Mother, holding in our hand.”

256
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:48,500
But I wanted to show this miracle to you,
that’s why I didn’t take. And I took it

257
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:53,340
in the end, and see now they are the best
among all of them; don’t they look as if

258
00:40:53,340 --> 00:41:00,340
they have been plucked from the tree? Just
I wanted to show this, so I said, “I’m

259
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:06,670
tired,” I sat down and then I looked at
you with the flowers, you see, in the hands,

260
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:12,970
you’re sitting all of you!

261
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:19,970
So She is Leela Vinodini. She plays around,
makes little mischiefs here and there for

262
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:34,350
you to learn lessons. Because if I tell you
“Do this” then it’s not possible, but

263
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:41,940
little circuitous way I can show you that
this is wrong, you should not do it. There’s

264
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:47,380
nothing to feel bad, I would have taken all
the flowers; but somebody must have thought

265
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:54,380
of it, why Mother has not taken the flowers
today. I don’t know if you thought of it

266
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:01,480
or not, but I knew it Myself that I have to
take the flowers to show this miracle to them,

267
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:07,830
that these flowers are going to last much
longer than any other flowers, because they

268
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:14,830
are vibrated with the Brahmachaitanya. And
the water was very, very, very cold, so even

269
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:20,120
I opened a hot water tap. It’s all right,
doesn’t matter, they didn’t die, despite

270
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:26,070
that they are perfectly all right.

271
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:32,890
So you have seen so many miracles of this
Brahmachaitanya which is showing on your photographs,

272
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:39,890
on so many your lives, in so many changes
that have taken place within yourself, within

273
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:47,530
your family, within every one of you. All
this has happened because you are in Brahmachaitanya.

274
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:56,110
All this you are receiving because you are
blessed by Brahmachaitanya. But others are

275
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:01,190
not, so your attitude should be towards them
that they are in the other world – what

276
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:08,190
to do, how to help them? We should try to
help them if possible, but up to a point.

277
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:16,070
We should not drag down ourselves for others’
sake. Up to a point only we can help them,

278
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:22,230
and we have to be very happy that Sahaja Yoga
is spreading so much horizontally.

279
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:29,230
But for vertical thing we must know our quality
must improve. If some people rise higher,

280
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:36,260
others will also start rising with them. It’s
the absolute honesty of purpose should be

281
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:43,570
there, absolutely understanding should be
there. Open your hearts to each other, so

282
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:49,560
that you open your hearts to Me. Every cell
must know another cell, otherwise it won’t

283
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:56,560
work out. That is a great thing that has happened,
when you are on this Earth, when you are the

284
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:06,800
ones who have to receive this great blessing.
So many saints did not receive it, so many

285
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,700
great people who came on this Earth, they
did not receive it. Even the incarnations

286
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:17,120
who came on this Earth could not do it what
you are doing.

287
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:24,120
So have that satisfaction and glory of your
own being and of your own standard, and of

288
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:32,060
your own caliber. The others are not of your
caliber, all right, forget about it. That

289
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:39,060
should not give you ego, but should give you
a personality that does not react. We have

290
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:47,610
something of our own, we do not react to things.
We are not reactionaries. And things will

291
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:58,950
disappear which are harmful. Everything will
be perfectly all right, because we are standing

292
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:37,640
in our 

293
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:36,190
own perfection, in our own glory. What do
we need? Nothing, just enjoying ourselves.

294
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:53,540
May God bless you all.
