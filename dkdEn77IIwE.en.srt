EnTc Peter VC 2019-0428

00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:07,040
Yesterday I was talking about two things, which

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,080
we have to do in England, which one should understand, you see.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,080
Because every country has its own problems

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,520
and we do absorb the problems.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi sounds like “Left hamari aur kar. Left hand, ha.]

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,999
[In Hindi: Point your left hand towards Me,

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,999
point your right hand outwards].

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,640
Now the thing is our work is spreading very fast

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,999
and people are taking to it.

11
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,080
In Europe I find the land is much more fertile, surprisingly

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,080
and once people get realization they become fantastic,

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,640
I mean they think it’s something that they have been expecting

14
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,960
and they understand Sahaj Yoga much better than we understand here.

15
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,560
Though your Kundalinis rise very high, I’ve seen that,

16
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:27,920
but the progress is not that all right.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,560
Now Ray has been to India, he’ll tell you how,

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,040
what sort of people we have in India

19
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,400
and how they have progressed themselves.

20
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,999
Now as I said the main problem of our country is lethargy

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,080
and lethargy is something we have to overcome somehow

22
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,999
and this lethargy is a, actually a satanic force.

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,560
It’s not lethargy only of the matter that comes from

24
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,760
material domination on the Spirit, but it is really satanic

25
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:10,000
because it stops your progress and is to be avoided.

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,080
And to get out of it one has to be really alert about it,

27
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,480
how it crawls onto you.

28
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:23,999
Krishna has put, the worst vice in the whole world is “aalasya”,

29
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,999
means lethargy. “Aalasyso Bijayate”

30
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,320
– everything comes out of aalasya.

31
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,680
According to Him, first the lethargy comes in

32
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,680
and because of lethargy we get into vices

33
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:40,999
and then we go to the right side also because of lethargy.

34
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,720
Because just to avoid the lethargy we go to the right side too much.

35
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:50,080
So according to Him everything starts with lethargy

36
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,480
and then the person loses the essence of life through lethargy

37
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,840
and this is our special quality and that is our real problem

38
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:05,080
– is the lethargy.

39
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,920
Because Sahaj Yoga is a thing where we say there is “akriya”.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We don’t have to do anything. It is effortless.

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,320
Everything works out effortless, spontaneously.

42
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,040
So we think that everything is going to work out for us spontaneously.

43
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Only the Kundalini Jagruti is spontaneous for the first time,

44
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:32,600
not for the second time, only for the first time.

45
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,440
That is I have to do it or My photograph has to do it.

46
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,440
But afterwards you have to work,

47
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,240
you have to keep your Kundalini afloat.

48
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,880
You have to understand what are your problems,

49
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,760
what are you getting into.

50
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:53,000
I mean, individually every one of you is a masterpiece,

51
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,280
individually. Because of lethargy you are clouded.

52
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:03,760
Secondly because of lethargy you are secluded,

53
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:06,320
lethargy gives you also ego.

54
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,999
Because anything that challenges lethargy

55
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,000
you get on top of that person, you don’t like such a person.

56
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,960
But the lethargy also those do not have

57
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,080
are the people their attention is not on spiritual development.

58
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,999
Theirs is as I told you yesterday, on other things,

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,200
which are not important to spiritual life.

60
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,320
We pay so much attention to other things than to our spiritual life.

61
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,520
Why is it? Why is it we pay more attention to material things,

62
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,760
to material comforts, to material achievements,

63
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:45,440
to material obsessions? Why? You must think about it.

64
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
And why not to our spiritual ascent?

65
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:52,760
The reason is we have been identified with matter.

66
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:57,560
We have been going through that circle.

67
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,200
We thought that we must have material development,

68
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,880
so we had industrial revolution, we created a society

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
dominated by industries, machinery came up.

70
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,999
We saw the machinery started dominating us.

71
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,200
We wanted to misidentify from that machinery.

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,200
Machinery has also given us lethargy

73
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,720
because we use machine made things our hands do not work.

74
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:28,999
We have lost all the deftness of the hands;

75
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,120
we have lost all the walking capacity.

76
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,360
We can only take a bus or a car; we do not want to walk at all.

77
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,520
Now this mechanization and the use of matter too much,

78
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:50,360
has made us sort of matters ourself. We have become matter

79
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,760
that we cannot live without it, it, yet we are so identified with it.

80
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,280
After realization if you are still identified with the matter,

81
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,320
then your realization slows down. So to, one has to understand,

82
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:13,640
one has to understand fully that matter is absolutely secondary.

83
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,200
Without of course getting your body you cannot receive realization,

84
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,320
you have to have your body.

85
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,560
But matter which is gross, is of no meaning.

86
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,720
Subtle matter is all right for us, that’s important.

87
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,920
Like this light, which is burning, is important.

88
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,999
Water that is in the ocean is all right.

89
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,999
The sky, open sky – say here it is not so good

90
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,999
but if you go to a country is even better.

91
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,680
The Mother Earth say example here, I don’t know how it is,

92
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:51,999
but in India certain places Mother Earth is very much subtle,

93
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,080
your material identifications.

94
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,999
So matter has been identified with us, we have been using it,

95
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,720
living with it and that’s why it is easy for us to get back

96
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:04,999
into the same circle of matter.

97
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,240
And we get into it, we pay attention more to it.

98
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,000
Now if I say, “Do not pay attention to it more,” then

99
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,920
you go on to another side, in a subtler way you jump into vices.

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:27,999
Vices of – I can say uncleanliness, filth, dirt, mismanagement.

101
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,400
So from one extreme to another extreme you go.

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,880
Now in the center what is matter, we should understand, and

103
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:41,999
we should try to then identify ourselves with our Spirit.

104
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,400
Now what is matter? Let us find out.

105
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,640
What is matter this. And what is created out of matter?

106
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Matter you know is made out of five elements.

107
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,640
You know the five elements, which have made this body of ours.

108
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,720
And these five elements are on the right-hand side

109
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
of the human beings

110
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:14,760
and these five elements either push you towards the left side

111
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:17,440
or pull you towards the right side.

112
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,920
I mean to say that when your start using the matter

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,840
gradually you become lethargic.

114
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,040
You become slave to it, it forms a habit.

115
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,240
If you use a chair then you cannot sit on the ground.

116
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,520
If you are used to a comfortable life,

117
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,760
you cannot live in an uncomfortable life. Sort of it slaves you.

118
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,840
Secondly, if you try to overpower the matter,

119
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,600
getting overactive with matter, you make everything properly

120
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,440
and make everything nicely and everything;

121
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,000
you are over efficient with the matter,

122
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,760
then your ego develops and when your ego develops

123
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:02,999
you go into violence.

124
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,320
Because if you produce more, you have to be violent about it

125
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,000
otherwise you do not know how to sell it.

126
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:16,840
You become, sort-of an aggressive businessman or a country,

127
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,040
which tries to sell the matter, which tries to overpower

128
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,000
other nations with their material advancement.

129
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,999
With violence you go little further, then

130
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,320
what becomes out of you is nothing but you become materialistic.

131
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,000
And materialistic people have no heart.

132
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,999
A materialistic person has no heart. He is just dried out.

133
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,520
He only understands money, money and money.

134
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,999
He doesn’t go beyond it. So too much attachment to money

135
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,080
is also materialistic, waste of money is also materialistic;

136
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,360
mismanagement of money is the worst of all.

137
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,600
So to be materialistic is your nature. You have started with it.

138
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,279
That’s human nature to be materialistic

139
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,999
because we have started with matter.

140
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,320
But it is also the human nature to ascend.

141
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,000
As it is natural to be a beast,

142
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,640
it is more natural to be a Sahaj Yogi.

143
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,200
So both things are part of the nature.

144
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,999
Now which way you go is the thing.

145
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Now the ladder can take you up or can bring you down.

146
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,680
If you have to go up your eyes should be upward.

147
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,680
Now these five elements create what within you?

148
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:40,840
They create the five chakras within you or you can say

149
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:47,920
the six chakras are created out of these five elements.

150
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,800
And these five elements, when they create the chakras

151
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:06,000
then they also give us a support to have the deities’ aasana,

152
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,040
a seat for the deities to come in. So they are important.

153
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,160
But if you have to give a deity a seat,

154
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,000
you do not give some sort of a filthy seat.

155
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,999
You give a nice, the best seat,

156
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,000
whatever is available, to the deity.

157
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:38,560
So you must know that when you are using the matter,

158
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,000
see the auspiciousness of it.

159
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,440
You have to know the auspiciousness of things that you are using,

160
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,000
whether it is auspicious or not. At random we buy clothes.

161
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,360
At random we buy things.

162
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,840
If you could use your vibratory awareness

163
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,960
to buy your things to see what you should buy, what would look nice

164
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,520
because beauty and auspiciousness goes hand in hand.

165
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,480
They are not two things.

166
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,520
Because beauty is a thing that gives joy to your Spirit,

167
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,040
auspiciousness is the same, which gives joy to your Spirit.

168
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,960
All other beauty is no beauty.

169
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,240
So for a Sahaj Yogi it is necessary to use

170
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,600
all the matters, which are auspicious.

171
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,640
Now auspicious matters, whatever are there,

172
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:41,000
which are important matters must be kept at a higher level always.

173
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:47,000
For example say My photograph, is very auspicious.

174
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:53,000
Then you don’t put it on the ground, then don’t trample over it.

175
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,160
In that also there are gradations of auspiciousness.

176
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,720
But now your clothes because you are saints now, are very important.

177
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,120
You are saints do you realize? Do you realize your self-esteem?

178
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,560
You are saints now. What clothes you wear?

179
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,480
you are not vagabonds. You are not tramps.

180
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,880
You are not on the street. So you have to wear dignified dress.

181
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,320
I have told everyone of you that, “Wear something dignified,

182
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,040
not indignified.”

183
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,520
It has to be majestic, because you are a saint now.

184
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,520
You are no more a person running on the street,

185
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,000
you are the selected saints by God.

186
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,800
So a dress you wear need not be absurd or something funny

187
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:51,000
but should give you dignity.

188
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,720
Not any false but a real dignity. You see the vibrations of a dress.

189
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:58,960
Wear your country’s dress.

190
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,479
You need not wear somebody else’s dress or something,

191
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,960
but the interest in the dress should be that

192
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
it should give you dignity and a sense of respectability.

193
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:15,000
It is to preserve your respect that you have to wear a dress.

194
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,800
That is the utility of a dress.

195
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:22,200
And now you go to another thing, anything that you are using,

196
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,960
for example your house.

197
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,960
Your house should be a house of cheerfulness, a house of dignity

198
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,960
where people come in, they have comfort, they sit comfortably.

199
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,440
But too much comfort is against Sahaj Yoga.

200
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,320
But spartan also is not necessary

201
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,999
that you do not have anything to spread on the ground or something.

202
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,960
It should be comfortable. But it should not be comfort personified,

203
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,840
because comfort creeps on you.

204
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:55,480
Comfort is one thing is better for English people

205
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,999
to avoid completely, is very good for them not to allow the body

206
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,120
to get into comfortable positions.

207
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,320
Specially bathroom addiction is

208
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,999
too much in English people I have seen it.

209
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,999
It is so much so I was so surprised that

210
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,440
if I go supposing to a reception

211
00:15:14,521 --> 00:15:16,960
I can tell you whether it is owned by an Englishman

212
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,999
or by somebody else. If it is owned by an Englishman,

213
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,918
the bathroom will be done up very well,

214
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:24,999
there will be towel for everything, soap for everything,

215
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,880
I mean they are extremely particular.

216
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,040
And immediately I know that it is done by some English gentleman,

217
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,520
because they are very bathroom conscious.

218
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,320
Though they do not take baths.

219
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,000
I have seen houses with sixty bedrooms and

220
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,040
no bath in England only. Now of course they have started.

221
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,480
Bathing is not their quality.

222
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,999
But bathroom – they are very particular.

223
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,676
And even if you put an easy chair they wouldn’t mind

224
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
sitting in a bathroom.

225
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,240
And as far as bathroom is concerned

226
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,040
one should just form such habits,

227
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,520
that within ten minutes you should be out from the bathroom.

228
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,999
Now when I say you have to take your baths,

229
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,506
that doesn’t mean that early in the morning go and take a shower,

230
00:16:23,587 --> 00:16:26,040
it doesn’t mean that. You should take a bath at a time

231
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,960
when you’ll have one hour before going out,

232
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,520
but that also from auspicious point of view.

233
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,880
Now you are saints, so use water as much as you can.

234
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,680
Wash your hands ten times is very essential.

235
00:16:41,816 --> 00:16:44,745
To get your vibrations all right, you must wash your hands.

236
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,520
But now in India there are people

237
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,999
who wash their hands countingly sixty four times.

238
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,999
And I always warn about the another side of it,

239
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,688
like doctors go on washing their hands. In the same way,

240
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:59,079
there are some people who go on washing their hands.

241
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,280
You need not take out the skin out of your hands.

242
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,360
But as many times as you wash your hands, it is a good thing.

243
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,999
I mean you are saints but you are children.

244
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,840
And I have to talk to you as to the children who are saints.

245
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:18,960
It’s a big complication. While you are grown up people

246
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,120
and sometimes you might feel hurt also, the way I have to tell you,

247
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,960
but this is important that you have to understand that

248
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,240
“We are saints and as saints, what we have to do as far as

249
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:40,360
the matter is concerned.” Now in a house there should be no dirt.

250
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,680
Dirt is not the sign of a saintliness. Miserliness: dirt -

251
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:53,000
you come to somebody’s house and you find a miserable beggary hole.

252
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,480
That kind of a thing should not be. You must have proper plates,

253
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,560
proper things or a broken plate somewhere, no.

254
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,999
All these things should be clean, neat, maybe handmade,

255
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,000
or even if you don’t get handmade,

256
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,280
but they should be clean, auspicious.

257
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,000
If you can get handmade things, nothing like it.

258
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,000
That’s a very good idea if you can get hand made things and if you

259
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,000
can use them it’s very good.

260
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,800
I think we went to see Gandhiji’s ashram, didn’t we?

261
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:27,800
You saw it was a simple place but very well done, everything.

262
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:30,960
And that way Japanese are very good at these things;

263
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,520
one has to learn a lot from them. You have to learn

264
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,960
from so many people and because of Zen influence, the Japanese

265
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
picked up the aesthetics of life. Very simple house they will have

266
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,960
but everything very comfortable. And they know how to make

267
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
the house look beautiful and how to make people feel comfortable.

268
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,999
Matter is to be treated with respect because it is created by God.

269
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,960
But whatever is respected is to be respected – not everything.

270
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,040
Everything in the matter is not to be respected.

271
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:38,999
For example, if you see some sort of a painting,

272
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,960
which is not auspicious, is not auspicious.

273
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,719
You should refuse to see such a painting. You should avoid

274
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,960
seeing such painting because it is not going to give you any joy,

275
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
any happiness, nothing. It’s not going to work out.

276
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,920
Now one of the things which people always tell Me

277
00:19:55,999 --> 00:20:02,040
that in … “Sahaj Yogis do not have a presence."

278
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:12,000
This is a very important thing. The presence is done by matter.

279
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,000
Now our presence, if it is not all right people can make it out.

280
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,960
All things that are in us,

281
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,280
if they become auspicious will have a presence.

282
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,000
Wherever we’ll stand people will know there’s a presence.

283
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:37,000
And this presence is a blessing of the matter to us.

284
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,999
So you must respect matter in the sense what clothes you wear.

285
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,999
Throwing clothes on the ground, throwing here and there,

286
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,999
living like a donkey, like a pigsty,

287
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,000
is not the way a Sahaj Yogi should live.

288
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,999
He has to be orderly; he has to respect his clothes.

289
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,960
But it should not be that you respect your clothes so much

290
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,279
that you throw away others’ clothes.
The others are Sahaj Yogis also.

291
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,640
You have to respect each other because you are all saints.

292
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,960
If you respect yourself you have to respect others.

293
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,960
And once you start respecting the matter,

294
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,440
which is the essence in you, that is attention.

295
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,960
The essence of matter is attention.

296
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:30,280
Attention gives you the presence. For example –

297
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,040
recently Marie was with Me. While translating Me, she suddenly

298
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,999
saw some flowers here and there, she started putting them right.

299
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,160
It created a very funny situation. Everybody started seeing

300
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,999
what’s matter with this woman? But now she’s understood it.

301
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,040
And now I told her that, “When you are speaking you should say it

302
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:58,000
with full concentration. Your attention, where is your attention?”

303
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,720
If your attention is on money, even if I am talking

304
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,240
about the highest things you’ll be thinking about money.

305
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,960
If your attention is on something else, even if I am talking

306
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,960
to something, you will be thinking of something else.

307
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,120
That’s why our presence should be such that nobody’s attention

308
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,960
is diverted or deluded. You understand My point?

309
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,240
If your presence is funny, like a joker or a clown

310
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,999
or a funny, untidy, everybody’s attention will be disturbed.

311
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,560
If you are overly dressed also the attention will be disturbed.

312
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,760
But if you are completely a presence then wherever you stand,

313
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:52,000
people will feel there is somebody standing, great.

314
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,880
The respect flows, actually respect flows.

315
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,800
And it is something so remarkable that you don’t know how people

316
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:06,000
try to help you then and how it works out.

317
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:15,840
Your attention if it is dominated by matter, people can make it out.

318
00:23:15,999 --> 00:23:20,280
And that is one thing has to look after very clearly because these

319
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:27,000
are countries who have advanced so much in material advancement.

320
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,760
So what happens, every matter attracts your attention.

321
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:34,960
You go on the street there’s this one woman is standing

322
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,759
or there is something selling, this happening. All the time

323
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,960
the attention … You see it is their job to attract your attention,

324
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,040
otherwise how are they going to exploit you?

325
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,960
See, they will have no justification. So they produce things, they

326
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,999
advertise things, to do in such a way to distract your attention.

327
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,480
Now this is a force, which is acting against our attention.

328
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,999
So as far as possible keep your attention straight,

329
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,800
or on the Mother Earth. If you can control your attention,

330
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:06,440
you can overcome your material domination.

331
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:12,920
Now the best thing is to put attention to your Spirit.

332
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:16,240
If you start putting your attention to Spirit,

333
00:24:16,353 --> 00:24:19,145
the sweetness of the Spirit itself will make the whole thing

334
00:24:19,226 --> 00:24:22,960
very sweet and beautiful. The attention should be in the Spirit.

335
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,320
Even you are getting ready; keep the attention on the Spirit.

336
00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:29,425
Now it’s not difficult because Kundalini has reached that stage.

337
00:24:29,506 --> 00:24:32,330
Before realization if I had said it, then you would have said,

338
00:24:32,411 --> 00:24:36,000
“Mother, how to do it?” But now when you have got realization,

339
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,000
try to bring your attention to Spirit.

340
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,960
Means first when the Kundalini rises you start looking

341
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,440
the Spirit or you say when you get realization you see the Spirit.

342
00:24:49,592 --> 00:24:52,213
In the sense that the Spirit starts flowing through you,

343
00:24:52,294 --> 00:24:55,174
you start watching its flowing in this thing.

344
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,520
But then after some time, you must enter into Spirit and see

345
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,840
through the window of the Spirit, the whole thing

346
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:08,440
by developing your witness Spirit.

347
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,880
If you develop your witness state,

348
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:20,240
from attention you become knowledge, the truth.

349
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:28,320
Then material things become the knowledge;

350
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,960
aesthetics of matter start giving you joy.

351
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,600
You do not want to possess it, but they start giving you joy

352
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,240
and even if you want to possess it, it would be just to enjoy it

353
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,999
and give it away to somebody else. It’s like that.

354
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:52,000
It’s for your enjoyment and you want to give it away to someone else

355
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,880
When you develop your witness state this will come to you

356
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:59,999
that you will not keep things to yourself

357
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,000
but you would like to give and share, sharing.

358
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,999
That is the time you should know you have become a witness, because

359
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:14,960
you're enjoying. Witness state is the state of Shri Krishna, of Virat.

360
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:22,000
When you start sharing your things then it is a proper thing.

361
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:13,000
Now the essence of puja is also how to overcome our material grossness.

362
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:22,000
Puja is nothing but is how to overcome our material grossness.

363
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,560
When we want to have a matter to ourselves,

364
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,440
we must know that it is given to us by God.

365
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,200
Everything belongs to God. Supposing we give flower to God,

366
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,640
after all it is God’s own creation, what are we giving?

367
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,520
We show light to God or do ‘aarti’ to God. What?

368
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,000
It is all God’s light only, what do we do?

369
00:27:49,999 --> 00:28:00,000
But by showing light to God what we do is we worship light within us.

370
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,200
The light element gets enlightened within us.

371
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:16,280
The light element is here on the Agnya.

372
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,960
When you do aarti, or when you put light before God,

373
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,960
when you show light to God, the light element within you gets

374
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,000
enlightened. When you give flowers, Mooladhara gets enlightened.

375
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,999
When you get honey, then your attention gets enlightened.

376
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,680
So, why we give it to God, after all God doesn’t need anything.

377
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,000
But God is the enjoyer. You are not the enjoyer, you cannot enjoy.

378
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,560
Enjoyer is God. In you, when God is there that enjoys,

379
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,800
that is the Spirit.

380
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:10,360
So whatever pleases your Spirit is used in the puja to be given.

381
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,999
Now you give rice – all these things are discovered –

382
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,800
that you give rice to the Devi. Rice should be put in Her lap.

383
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:23,160
Now what is rice, a little rice to a Devi?

384
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,040
Is, by putting rice, in you the satisfaction of getting food

385
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:35,000
or food that gives you satisfaction is enlightened.

386
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,999
But that doesn’t mean you start showering things on Me,

387
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,920
that doesn’t mean that. What I am trying to say,

388
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:49,480
do it with dignity and understanding. That you give Me rice.

389
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,960
Now, rice giving – these people don’t understand

390
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,680
why rice is to be given to God? After all, why give Him palm leaves?

391
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:04,600
What is He going to do? If Christ was the Son of God.

392
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:10,080
What was the use of putting palm leaves for Him?

393
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:18,000
Or to give Him oil, oil bath or to rub His feet with oil?

394
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,999
It is for you to get the advantage.

395
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,999
Now in Sahaj yoga it is proved now.

396
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,999
When you rub My feet, you feel better, not Me.

397
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,960
You rub My hands, you feel better.

398
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,960
When you fall at My feet, you feel better.

399
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,800
She, she is a great – what was, what is, what were you doing?

400
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:40,560
"Reflexology." Shri Mataji: Reflexology. Big name, ah? Reflexology.

401
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:43,599
And she is supposed to know about the feet and things like that.

402
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,280
One day she said, “Mother I want to come and massage Your feet.

403
00:30:48,361 --> 00:30:51,344
- I know this and all - that.” So I said, “All right, come along.”

404
00:30:51,425 --> 00:30:55,280
So she came to rub My feet. Instead of I feeling,

405
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,960
becoming relaxed, she was becoming relaxed.

406
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,999
The more she was rubbing she was getting relaxed.

407
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,440
So you see when you do for God, the blessings comes to you.

408
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,800
You are blessed. Whatever is the problem with you,

409
00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:15,080
you give to God to solve.

410
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,760
Also whatever satisfies you, you give to God.

411
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:22,040
The satisfaction comes to you.

412
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,440
Now, these flowers when you give it to Me, Mooladhara.

413
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,520
They give you two things, Swadishthana and Mooladhara.

414
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,520
Flowers that’s why are very important. They give Swadishthana,

415
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,520
if the flowers are beautiful, then they give Swadishthana

416
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:41,520
and if they are fragrant they cure your Mooladhara.

417
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,760
Now, I mean there is no end to flowers also.

418
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:54,360
But think about it, that you are doing it to improve your chakras.

419
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,520
Then other things that are used like say ghee. Ghee is used.

420
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:10,560
It is for Vishuddhi. Shri Krishna is very fond of ghee and butter.

421
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,000
So when you rub My feet with say butter,

422
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,560
your Vishuddhi will improve, you know that.

423
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,960
Not Mine, I have no problem. I have only one problem that

424
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
you are within Me and when you have problem I have problems.

425
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,999
Because these vibrations have to go to you.

426
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,360
So I prepare vibrations here as an antidote and they have to flow.

427
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,160
It’s a very subtle thing to understand.

428
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:43,160
To move from gross to Spirit, this is the thing by which you move,

429
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,560
because first you enlighten your chakras.

430
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:52,800
By enlightening your chakras, your deities get happy, prasanna.

431
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,960
By making the deities happy, you keep; get a passage

432
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,999
for the Kundalini to pass through.

433
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,760
By making the passage for the Kundalini, the Kundalini goes up

434
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:10,760
and then your attention starts becoming one with the Spirit.

435
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:15,800
It is step by step, you move from matter to subtler matter,

436
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:20,720
from subtler matter to your chakras, from chakras to deities,

437
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:28,000
from deities to the Spirit. Then Spirit enjoys itself.

438
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,960
So there you do not have to do anything.

439
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Just give your Spirit to Spirit.

440
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,639
That’s why these things were prescribed.

441
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,520
Now people could not see this linkage.

442
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,800
They thought that, “Why should we give anything to God?

443
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:50,240
After all it is all His own.” The argument started.

444
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:56,760
“Why should we put lights? There is no need.” But this is an escape.

445
00:33:56,999 --> 00:34:00,560
Where are you, at what stage? You are at a stage;

446
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:09,000
you are at a stage where you have to detach yourself from matter.

447
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,960
Same with Sahaj Yoga, I find it that you must understand

448
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,080
the complete vision of Sahaj Yoga.

449
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,680
It’s a very big thing you are doing. You are not small.

450
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,960
You are doing a very great work,

451
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,999
because it is 'the' solution of all the humanity.

452
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,440
This is the solution of all the problems,

453
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,000
whether political, economic or anything, whatever you call it.

454
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,320
Is not only that but the more people you have,

455
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,999
you will be surprised, I’ll work out much better.

456
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,999
Collectively I can cure cancer if you are more, if you are

457
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,120
clear people. But your channels are so full of problems

458
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:59,040
that nothing flows through you. If you get yourself cleared out,

459
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,680
collectively I can stop cancer spreading,

460
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:06,760
because if you spread more vibrations,

461
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:12,720
what happens that the left and right side in Virat becomes clearer

462
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,200
and the attack from the left and right side which creates cancer,

463
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,999
all these horrible diseases, will be less.

464
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,000
Because there will be less.

465
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,548
But you do not understand your responsibility what you are doing.

466
00:35:25,629 --> 00:35:29,840
You are playing into the hands of satanics.

467
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:32,960
By not paying attention to your cleaning,

468
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,760
by not paying attention to your spiritual growth,

469
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:42,840
you are not helping Me at all because these vibrations do not flow out.

470
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,320
They have to flow through you. If I could manage them

471
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,600
there was no need for Me to run after you.

472
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:53,240
It has to flow through you, you are the channels

473
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:59,240
and if you do not keep yourself clean and humble and meek about it,

474
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,440
it doesn’t work out. You are not helping Me at all by that.

475
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:10,400
So the localized problem of yours limited problems, should be

476
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,000
given up and see to the bigger problems that you’ll be solving.

477
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:21,000
I can stop the happening of cancer completely

478
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,000
if I have twenty-one thousand Sahaja Yogis.

479
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:30,480
Completely, Cancer will go out of … leprosy I can control.

480
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:32,999
Cancer already I am controlling,

481
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,040
but it’ll go down, collectively also.

482
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,200
I mean the statistics I’ve not seen but will go down.

483
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,960
It’s a left side attack and the more you try to go to left side

484
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,285
there will be more attacks.

485
00:36:47,366 --> 00:36:50,366
Right side attacks are also lots of these wars.

486
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,560
All these wars and all these things take place

487
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,840
because we are invaded from the right side.

488
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,640
All these aggressive people

489
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,240
like Hitler and all that are aggressing us.

490
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:09,880
How much it is necessary for you to rise above your lower self.

491
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,720
One should understand that

492
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,520
and not to indulge into nonsense that you are doing.

493
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,880
You have to really work hard for that.

494
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:23,640
Even if you have to get up early in the morning, you have to get up and do it.

495
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,640
You should understand your responsibilities, that’s the main point.

496
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,400
People are now busy only doing jobs, working here, how much money

497
00:37:34,481 --> 00:37:37,393
you get, how much do you go, when do you go to job and all that.

498
00:37:37,474 --> 00:37:39,194
That’s not important for us.

499
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,359
Now that doesn’t mean you give up your jobs and be a liability on the ashram,

500
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,600
it doesn’t mean that! It means you do your jobs, have money,

501
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,040
money is needed for the work. I need money, you know that how much

502
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,999
money we need for all this work.

503
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,999
You have taken such a big project of going to Europe

504
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,320
having this little money.

505
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,999
It’s not possible. But we are doing it somehow.

506
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,200
So, we need money, you have to earn, you have to give;

507
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,400
you have to give money. Here people are,

508
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:08,599
they are not even willing to give ten pounds.

509
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,640
Such people. With them where am I going to do Sahaj Yoga?

510
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,040
We are so attached to money in a subtler way.

511
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,280
We do not understand we have to give money and we have to do it up.

512
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,999
Not only money, money’s not the only solution;

513
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,160
we have to be ourselves channels.

514
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,200
But then some people have money,

515
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,440
then they are exploited in a wrong way and the money’s all wasted.

516
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,960
This is precious money, this is auspicious money,

517
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,480
this money goes into the right hands into right places.

518
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,640
Problems are created because of that.

519
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,520
Now this money I do not need, you know that very well.

520
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,359
But for your own betterment you have to give money.

521
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,960
Ask Gavin he’ll tell you.

522
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,120
He’s a very generous man and he, he found it very good.

523
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,720
It’s not that I need a single pai from you.

524
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:11,759
On the contrary I am willing to spend My own money on things,

525
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,520
you know that definitely.

526
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,520
But, you must understand this work has to be done, so you need money.

527
00:39:18,721 --> 00:39:20,960
I need not tell you that you have to pay money.

528
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,307
I have never said this to Indians, I have never told them.

529
00:39:23,388 --> 00:39:25,440
They have never given Me a problem you’ll be amazed.

530
00:39:25,521 --> 00:39:27,399
How they solve their problems God alone knows.

531
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,839
They are not the people of money.

532
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,560
There’s never a quarrel about money. Nobody talks about money,

533
00:39:31,641 --> 00:39:33,918
nobody tells Me anything, nothing of the kind.

534
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:37,480
Nobody oppresses anyone or mishandles anyone

535
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,827
or controls anyone, everybody does so well.

536
00:39:41,002 --> 00:39:44,119
Money is not with one person. Say about two, three people handle it.

537
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,880
Everybody knows how much money they are taking.

538
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,000
This one part is important.

539
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,280
For solving this problem you give Me rice.

540
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,520
It’s called as “Oti bharne,”

541
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,760
that you give Me rice I beg of you, actually. You put it in My sari.

542
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,280
Rice, you give Me five times, I give you seven times back.

543
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,760
That’s the symbol. You know how symbols work out.

544
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:16,760
Even when you say, “Mother are you the Holy Ghost?” it works out,

545
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
it gives you realization.

546
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:27,800
If there is somebody so alert and sensitive sitting before you,

547
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:32,720
you must know how to do the symbols, how to do them properly,

548
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,960
with full maturity, understanding, in the proper way.

549
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,760
You are very anxious to do the puja, but do you understand,

550
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:47,000
before the puja always there’s a quarrel going on.

551
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,760
Somebody who is a very possessed person will come, to begin with,

552
00:40:50,999 --> 00:40:54,200
and everybody will start fighting. Imagine!

553
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,760
You must take your bath, “What are you doing?”

554
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,320
In the morning don’t talk to anyone. Be in hush condition.

555
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,320
You are in for opening out to the great power,

556
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,000
which is going to solve the problem of the world.

557
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:20,400
So you cleanse yourself, you wash yourself; you cleanse yourself,

558
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,000
so that you get your chakras evolved.

559
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:30,640
People talked against it because they became only ritualistic,

560
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,440
mechanical; matter became very important.

561
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,999
Then only doing these things became important.

562
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:41,160
But not now, you people are different. You are realized souls.

563
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,439
That doesn’t mean that you should take to sanyasa or anything.

564
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,600
You should, I’ve told you, you should live like normal people,

565
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,920
but a very dignified people.

566
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,200
Nothing of indignity, childishness, superfluousness or joker-like,

567
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,200
clown-like, outstandingly funny, all these dresses should not be worn.

568
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,799
You should be properly dressed in a way that you have a presence.

569
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,880
I mean this is to a children I am telling you.

570
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,520
You must have a presence of grown up Sahaja Yogis, You are all saints.

571
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,999
You know such a lot even many saints do not know.

572
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,760
You can go and ask so many of them.

573
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,999
There’s one thing they know that I am that.

574
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:27,999
That’s one thing you do not know. They know that.

575
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,560
This is a big difference.

576
00:42:30,641 --> 00:42:33,399
Because I am easily available to you, you do not understand.

577
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,240
For them I am great. As I told you yesterday that how these saints

578
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,680
have recognized and they have sent people to help Me.

579
00:42:42,999 --> 00:42:47,000
In saintliness only, your recognition of Me is poor.

580
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,520
Because if it was not, you would not be shouting in My presence,

581
00:42:50,688 --> 00:42:52,999
quarrelling in My presence. You give Me headaches,

582
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,000
you tell Me things, which you should not tell Me.

583
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,520
“He knocked at my door,” somebody tells Me.

584
00:42:59,633 --> 00:43:02,239
He says “he came there, he did this,” another tells Me.

585
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:07,320
You should not talk like this to Me.

586
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,360
You are materially again bound by talking.

587
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,080
From where does the talk come from? Vishuddhi.

588
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,120
Talk comes from Vishuddhi, but it starts from, the whole vani,

589
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:30,920
the whole sound starts from much below. So, to raise it higher

590
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:36,480
there are stages of this sound coming in.

591
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,960
And when it becomes madhyama, is in the heart,

592
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,840
in the heart region where it just throbs,

593
00:43:42,999 --> 00:43:47,960
you do not feel the throbbing. Then it comes here.

594
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,120
Here it becomes vaikhari.

595
00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:01,120
Then it becomes pashyanti means it sees, it just sees.

596
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,960
Then it becomes Para, where it becomes just silent

597
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,680
in the aweness of the presence.

598
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:20,999
We have to develop those things. But we do not understand

599
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:25,000
that all these things are our attributes,

600
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,000
which we have to enlighten and rise.

601
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:34,560
And make every part, every petal of our being beautiful.

602
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,720
If you start understanding these small, small things,

603
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:47,960
which are very important because I am talking of very big things.

604
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:53,840
But even a small thing can close your eyes completely.

605
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
It’s a very big vision I have, very big vision.

606
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,040
And that vision can be done through you people.

607
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,600
You do not think that you are ordinary.

608
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,600
Otherwise I would never have chosen you.

609
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,960
But you have no recognition of yourself also,

610
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
as you have no recognition of Me.

611
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,960
You have to recognize yourselves and respect yourself.

612
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,680
Do not respect material things, respect yourself first of all

613
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,560
and the matter within you.

614
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,120
If you move that way I think you’ll understand better what I am saying.

615
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:42,040
The body of a human being is a temple of God.

616
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:48,760
But this temple has to be enlightened and has to be auspicious.

617
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,400
You have to clear and clean your being completely

618
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,760
so it’s a beautiful temple for God to reside there.

619
00:45:59,999 --> 00:46:01,960
But we deceive ourselves, you see?

620
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,600
When I am talking, you listen to Me

621
00:46:05,999 --> 00:46:09,160
and you think that “Oh, Mother talked very sweetly, beautifully,”

622
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,480
finished. But nothing goes inside.

623
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,920
Why? Because of lethargy.

624
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,280
Lethargy is a thing, which is a barrier.

625
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,640
It doesn’t allow Me to go inside you.

626
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,040
It’s a barrier.

627
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:25,960
It’s very sweet thing, which smiles, just you see thinking,

628
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,680
“Oh, Mother is saying something nice, it’s very great,”

629
00:46:29,923 --> 00:46:31,719
it gives you happiness and all that,

630
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,080
but it doesn’t go inside, you do not imbibe.

631
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,120
And that’s why, try to put your attention to yourself

632
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,400
and feel your dignity and honor.

633
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,440
Feel your presence that you have to have a presence

634
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,608
and when I tell to some people, they’ll say, “I know,

635
00:46:49,689 --> 00:46:51,919
Mother, I know I do that.”

636
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,960
Then why do you do it? That means you are possessed.

637
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,120
You are a possessed person that you know this is wrong,

638
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,800
still you are doing it. Then you are a possessed person.

639
00:47:01,999 --> 00:47:04,000
Then is better you beat yourself with shoes.

640
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,960
But that stage should go now, I don’t like you to beat yourself with shoes,

641
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I mean are you that, that level?

642
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:16,040
But the level is such still.

643
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,560
And your presence is the one that should give Prasannata,

644
00:47:21,999 --> 00:47:24,240
is the cheerfulness to others.

645
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,400
Others should feel cheerful in your company.

646
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,880
A presence is something, which you can understand.

647
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:39,999
A presence has prudence.

648
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:45,520
It understand how to behave in a particular thing.

649
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,520
It is not imprudent like it won’t rush to a thing.

650
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,520
It won’t jump on to a thing. If somebody is talking

651
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:59,000
you just do not become absolutely dominating on that.

652
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,000
When you talk, you do not talk in a way that is dramatic

653
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,440
or sort of theatrical; or neither you talk in a way

654
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,720
that is lunatic-like or something like that.

655
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,480
Presence has its own balance in the center

656
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,520
and that presence must be maintained.

657
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,999
Presence is very important and just see yourself:

658
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,800
are you having a presence?

659
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,200
Some people are very good Sahaj Yogis, but they have no “go,”

660
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:31,200
they have no dash, at all. They receive things, they see things,

661
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:37,880
they should have a dash. They have to tell people,

662
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,560
but in a way that is congenial, that is sweet, that is beautiful,

663
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:48,720
that works is the point. If it does not work, what’s the use?

664
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,160
Now again I am going for seventeen days.

665
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,760
Really seventeen days I’ll be out.

666
00:48:54,999 --> 00:49:01,000
I miss you all very much and I feel concerned so much,

667
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,880
because you have to still grow quite a lot.

668
00:49:06,999 --> 00:49:14,999
I feel that among you there is no understanding of collectivity.

669
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,960
A very irritable people; you get irritable with each other,

670
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:27,280
how can you? You are all saints. You must respect each other;

671
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,000
you must love each other,

672
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,800
talk sweetly to each other. You are all saints!

673
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:38,200
A saint meets another saint, how does he meet?

674
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:43,800
Have you seen anytime, a real saint meeting another real saint?

675
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:52,400
You should see. You do not look like that. The first proof is this.

676
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,999
Are you really saints or not. He has gone to India, how they met you?

677
00:49:59,362 --> 00:50:02,560
Yogi: Take really hold of me. Shri Mataji: See? Yogi: I couldn’t believe him …

678
00:50:02,672 --> 00:50:04,439
Shri Mataji: How they meet each other!

679
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,360
They’ll hug each other and they enjoy each other’s company.

680
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:13,040
They laugh at jokes and understand it is such a congenial thing.

681
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,960
Nobody thinks,  “I am right.” Nobody thinks like that.

682
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,815
Once you start thinking, “I am right and that person is wrong.”

683
00:50:18,896 --> 00:50:22,440
“I am doing all right, he’s wrong,” finished.

684
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,080
They enjoy themselves so much just like one wave it moves, you see?

685
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:31,999
They are all the time laughing, enjoying you know, loudly.

686
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,960
They help each other such a lot. It’s absolutely worth seeing that.

687
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:42,240
While we had only five or six people to begin with,

688
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:48,320
in Nilambar, from London. One better than the other.

689
00:50:48,999 --> 00:50:53,000
They are all fighting, quarrelling and they used to come up to beating.

690
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,640
Can you believe it? This was happening.

691
00:50:57,999 --> 00:51:01,960
So shameful I tell you and everybody was coming and telling,

692
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,960
“What sort of Sahaj Yogis you have got, Mother? Are they Sahaj Yogis, really?”

693
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,560
Arguing and doing this and doing that.

694
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:16,160
All sorts of things were on and they would not inform Me the whole of it,

695
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:25,160
but part of it would come to Me. I was so ashamed. Ask Malcolm.

696
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:31,280
They used to, I mean they would break each other’s heads there.

697
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,280
This was the condition. Can you believe it?

698
00:51:37,999 --> 00:51:42,720
While you would never find any Sahaj Yogis doing that, never, in India.

699
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:46,760
I have not seen anyone. Anybody who tries to be funny goes out,

700
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,999
immediately out of circulation.

701
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,880
There’s no group-forming, nobody fights with anybody, nothing.

702
00:51:52,999 --> 00:51:56,480
And everybody was surprised how strange these people were,

703
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:05,000
one better than the other. They were very irritable, hot-tempered, fighting and all that.

704
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,040
They were so surprised that how can there be.

705
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,760
Give you an example here of Chhaya, see.

706
00:52:13,999 --> 00:52:16,760
Despite, she’s quite shocked;

707
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,800
but she doesn’t know how to really beat things, meet.

708
00:52:20,999 --> 00:52:23,480
People are so criticizing, so this thing,

709
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:30,480
but she’s trying to keep the balance. She’ll be always at the back.

710
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,960
She’s never in the forward, when it comes to work she’ll be the first to do it.

711
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:44,960
She takes up responsibilities. This is what happened last time.

712
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,200
It’s not only lethargy,

713
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,080
it is worse than that. In lethargy, you see it is a devil’s mind,

714
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:55,040
and when you come out of lethargy you just come to blows.

715
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:59,680
But as it is in India, I’ve not seen people coming to blows, I really tell you.

716
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,680
Very seldom you’ll find people coming to blows.

717
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,960
I mean, people never even talk loudly or in a temper, never.

718
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,560
Now normally people are very quiet type. Then Sahaj Yogis,

719
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,000
Oh! You should see how they enjoy.

720
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,999
Oh! The girls and boys and every one, the way they enjoy.

721
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:26,999
Love seeing them. You must try to enjoy each other.

722
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,960
Now the worst thing that can happen to human beings is ego.

723
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,960
Worst thing, possession is better, at least you feel the pinch of it.

724
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,440
But ego you never feel the pinch.

725
00:53:39,999 --> 00:53:44,160
It is you never feel that there is ego in you

726
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,960
and you think you are the most correct person,

727
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,839
you are the best person and the temper shows here in the nose.

728
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,560
I can see the “haw-haw,” nose coming up like that.

729
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,720
Such ego, such ego,

730
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,760
and this ego Indians have also picked up from you.

731
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:07,164
Those who have come in contact with you, you see,

732
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:09,999
as the dog when he comes in contact with human being

733
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,320
learns many things,

734
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,480
in the same way Indians who have come in contact

735
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,040
with you people have picked up ego

736
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,999
and we can see the difference.

737
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:26,999
But in simple villages people try to be nice, congenial, good.

738
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,800
How – by understanding auspiciousness.

739
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,999
An auspicious presence is soothing,

740
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:41,040
comforting, absorbing, beautiful.

741
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,440
And this, how do you develop?

742
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,240
You should do little aarti to My photograph is a good idea.

743
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,600
Now when you do the aarti also,

744
00:54:53,721 --> 00:54:55,840
somebody is shouting at the top of his voice.

745
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:59,120
He’s trying to lead others. Then another trying to lead others,

746
00:54:59,201 --> 00:55:01,661
this should not be. There should be some, homogeneous,

747
00:55:01,742 --> 00:55:04,800
I can make it out, there’s no rhythm.

748
00:55:04,999 --> 00:55:10,040
Sing in the same tone, same style,

749
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:15,040
try to make it one, one, concord should be there.

750
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
In a humble way, in joyous way that we all are singing,

751
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,960
all our hearts are singing.

752
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,999
All of us are here to do it.

753
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,400
So many of us are… feel that joy, we are so many.

754
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,240
And it has a very bad effect on others when they see you this way.

755
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,240
I mean anybody would be shocked.

756
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,999
Why in India it is spreading, because they see that love

757
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,680
between the people.

758
00:55:47,999 --> 00:55:51,760
Now of our attention if you take it to the Spirit

759
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,280
you’ll feel the collectivity.

760
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,120
Attention should be, as I told you yesterday,

761
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:01,040
find out how many times you have talked nicely to others

762
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,560
and how many times have you have been quarrelling.

763
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,560
If somebody says even a harsh word just keep quiet.

764
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,680
Do not feel bad, it’s all right, it comes and goes.

765
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,680
Now some people are negative

766
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,800
in the sense that they are on the left hand side

767
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:21,840
and some people are negative because they are on the right hand side.

768
00:56:21,999 --> 00:56:24,640
Sometimes these combinations work very well.

769
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,760
When a dominating man tries to dominate a left handed person,

770
00:56:28,999 --> 00:56:31,120
they are great friends, nothing like it.

771
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,080
Because one dominates and another takes the domination.

772
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,400
As soon as the left hand side person becomes little on the center

773
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,400
or tries to come to the right, the dominating ones starts clashing.

774
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,960
Then they are the worst enemies of each other.

775
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,999
It happens like that, so be on the alert.

776
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:56,440
Now a person who is on the negative on the left side,

777
00:56:56,593 --> 00:56:58,079
should try to come in the center

778
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,120
and in the same way a person who is on the

779
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,880
right side should come to the center.

780
00:57:04,999 --> 00:57:11,040
Now how do you do it? Which is the way we can do it? Let us see it.

781
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,999
A person who is very much on the right hand side

782
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:20,999
should try to become friendly with the left hand side

783
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,320
and left hand side person

784
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,960
should try to be friendly with the right hand side, supposing.

785
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,520
Let us start like this. So what is the give and take in this thing?

786
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:37,560
The person who is on the right hand side will be better organizer,

787
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,960
may be, may not be.

788
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:47,520
At least will be a better orator or maybe a better sort of a leader,

789
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,520
may be, may not be, you can’t say.

790
00:57:50,999 --> 00:57:53,920
He may be the one who will

791
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,960
suggest things and who will bring out things,

792
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,960
who will say “I’ll do this; I’ll do–” sort of thing, maybe.

793
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,999
The left hand person will be frightened

794
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,920
but will be humble, more loving, more affectionate.

795
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,999
He’ll be much more at the command of others.

796
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,600
This one will be commanding

797
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,960
and the other will be receiving the command.

798
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,760
This will be there. Now how do we

799
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:22,400
solve the problem of this mixture, you see?

800
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:27,200
The one who is very much on the ego side

801
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:31,999
should try to obey the person who is on the left hand side.

802
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,999
And on the left hand side should try to command

803
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,960
more on the right hand side person and should be accepted.

804
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,188
They, it should be mutually understood,
there should be a contract. “All right,

805
00:58:45,269 --> 00:58:48,999
I am an ego oriented person and you are superego oriented,

806
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,319
now let us do one thing.

807
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,960
You try to dominate me and I’ll try to obey you.”

808
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,480
It will work out. It’s a psychological style.

809
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,999
You just work it out.

810
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:02,999
Try somebody who is a left sided person to dominate you.

811
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,720
But rather difficult to get left sided people here.

812
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:09,160
They are very few, because I believe some people were left sided,

813
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,160
but when it comes to ego they are worst than anybody else, you see?

814
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:19,080
So rather difficult, but you can have a person who is left sided

815
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:24,999
and let than ego oriented ask him to dominate.

816
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,999
Till he develops his ego, he’s all right. If he develops ego stop it.

817
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,760
But with complete understanding, watching yourself, how you develop,

818
00:59:33,999 --> 00:59:37,960
how far you go – a play should go on. Play with yourself.

819
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,200
But if you are identified with yourself that

820
00:59:40,281 --> 00:59:42,217
“I am always right, and nobody is right,”

821
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,470
nothing can work out. I can tell you this much.

822
00:59:44,551 --> 00:59:50,200
Because if you are perfect I need not waste My words here.

823
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,999
So the best way is to do this sort of a thing,

824
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,520
“All right you order and I’ll do.

825
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,760
Come along let’s see what do you think?

826
00:59:59,999 --> 01:00:05,040
Let you organize and we’ll do it. You tell us how to do it.”

827
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,999
So he will use your heart

828
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,000
and you will use your attention, it will work out very well.

829
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,000
The combination will be good.

830
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:16,920
Let us decide to improve ourselves and not to feel bad about it.

831
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,999
We have to improve a lot and a lot and a lot,

832
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,480
because the relationship between you seems to be so bad.

833
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:32,680
It’s like cancer – absolutely cancer. It is malignant.

834
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,520
So try to see your ego

835
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:40,960
and if it’s a…now even people if you have told them

836
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,577
that somebody says you should say

837
01:00:42,658 --> 01:00:44,519
“I’m sorry,” they’ll not say like that.

838
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:48,040
They’ll say sarca… “Aha, I am sorry,” or something like that.

839
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:52,360
They’ll say in a sarcastic way so that sorry also has no meaning.

840
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:57,640
All right, all right don’t say anything. This is not the way.

841
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:02,960
You should say, “See yourself. So this ego has come.

842
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,760
Now please tell me something else, I’ll do it.”

843
01:01:07,999 --> 01:01:14,760
Christ washed the feet of His disciples. Just think of that.

844
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,760
And that’s what a sensible Sahaj Yogi does.

845
01:01:18,999 --> 01:01:21,200
He washes the feet of another disciple.

846
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,999
If you remember Aradhna, my granddaughter,

847
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,000
when you people came to My house.

848
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,520
There were I think about eight or ten of them.

849
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:35,520
She got a small bucket; she washed each and everybody’s feet.

850
01:01:35,832 --> 01:01:38,790
Every time she would take it back to the bathroom throw it away,

851
01:01:38,871 --> 01:01:43,520
again fill it up bring it with great Spirit. She was five years.

852
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,840
She had not completed her five years

853
01:01:45,999 --> 01:01:47,960
and she would wash everybody’s feet,

854
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,960
wipe them, again put back.

855
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,960
She did for everybody and then after that she came on My feet

856
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,236
and then she said “I’m not going to look at anybody,

857
01:01:57,317 --> 01:02:02,600
I’m going to run away now I have done my job,” and she went away.

858
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,640
Aradhna is of a very high quality Sahaj Yogini she is,

859
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:06,999
very high quality.

860
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:11,000
But she thought that this is the best way of washing their feet

861
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,960
is showing the essence of collectivity.

862
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,960
“Some part of me is not all right, let me clear it.”

863
01:02:21,999 --> 01:02:24,440
For example if you think of Me

864
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:29,600
and you, you will understand how much I work hard on you.

865
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:33,960
Why? Because I love you very much and you are My part and parcel.

866
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,240
If you are not all right I’m not going to be all right.

867
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:43,240
If you consider then, you will never think somebody is lower than you.

868
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:47,800
Is better to wash the feet of someone than to wash your own feet,

869
01:02:47,999 --> 01:02:51,960
will be a good idea. Put down your ego every time.

870
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,480
Mohammad Sahib used this method. But best was used by Nanaka:

871
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:01,480
He said, “Let all the Sikhs do some seva.”

872
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
They have to, as a punishment they have to do some seva.

873
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:09,999
So, what is a seva when there is a group? Somebody has to sit down.

874
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:13,999
Even one guru, very big guru, had to clean the shoes

875
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,880
of all the people who came for the program.

876
01:03:17,999 --> 01:03:20,040
He was given polish, brush and everything –

877
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,440
very recently he was punished

878
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,520
to clean the shoes of the people who came round.

879
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,640
He was supposed to wash their clothes,

880
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,760
wash their things, as a punishment.

881
01:03:30,999 --> 01:03:32,840
Anybody who is arrogant should do it.

882
01:03:32,999 --> 01:03:35,600
Anybody who quarrels or fights should do it.

883
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:42,160
Anybody who is blunt should do it. And it worked, it works.

884
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,360
They are supposed to wash their clothes,

885
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,640
they are supposed to wash their feet,

886
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:52,960
rub their feet, give them a massage and feel better.

887
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,280
In India if you see,

888
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:57,480
all the Sahaj Yogis are working on each other’s chakras.

889
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,000
But here nobody will accept even that you have these chakras caught up.

890
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:05,920
Have you seen that? Everyday they are working, cleaning everybody’s,

891
01:04:06,001 --> 01:04:08,347
they’ll say, “Baba, clean my chakra,” they’ll say.

892
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:11,760
Then when they do it they say “Thank you, you’ve cleaned mine.”

893
01:04:11,999 --> 01:04:14,480
And then they helped them, they rub their hands, feet

894
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:19,999
because you have done so much work for them. This is not done here.

895
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:24,960
I would like to see more mutual understanding, mutual love,

896
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:32,600
mutual attraction for each other, should look forward to each other.

897
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:35,560
Try to help each other than to criticize.

898
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:40,080
I hate to hear any criticism of anyone from any one of you.

899
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:45,080
But when it gets, goes too much is better to tell Me.

900
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,680
But you must judge yourself, “What are we doing for others?”

901
01:04:48,761 --> 01:04:51,679
Some people think, “As long as we keep quiet it’s all right.”

902
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,360
It’s not the point.

903
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:57,320
Try to be nice, give some presents, talk to them

904
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:02,360
and there are so many ways of expression of your love to them.

905
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:07,960
Give sometimes flowers, try to find out what are the likes them.

906
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,520
and dislikes of the person is, is very good idea.

907
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:13,520
Do not do things that people do not like, sometimes you see.

908
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,360
It’s better not to do it. What is the use?

909
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,480
If the relationships are spoilt, not to do those things.

910
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,320
Just find out what you don’t like.

911
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:27,560
A simple thing: my husband doesn’t like Me to put flowers in the hair.

912
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,720
But in Maharashtra all the married women

913
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,800
are supposed to put the flowers in the hair,

914
01:05:33,999 --> 01:05:37,960
that’s a custom. But because of I’ve married him, he doesn’t like

915
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,520
because in their community, only bad women put flowers in the head;

916
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,720
I have never put flowers in My head.

917
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:48,040
Only when it is a special puja or they tie up –

918
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,520
in Maharashtra, there I agree.

919
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,800
But I never make a bun and put a thing. It’s all right,

920
01:05:53,999 --> 01:05:55,480
if he doesn’t like it why do it?

921
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:01,440
Unnecessary to increase all the clashes and the problem.

922
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,840
Don’t do anything that people do not like you to do.

923
01:06:04,999 --> 01:06:08,720
Try to avoid, it creates problems.

924
01:06:08,817 --> 01:06:10,719
Try to do something that pleases others.

925
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,240
Let us see if you have devised this method how to please.

926
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,999
If you please others, your deities will be very happy,

927
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,999
because they are all one,

928
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:23,520
within you, within her, within her, they are all one.

929
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,960
And they feel happy, because they’re all related to each other,

930
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,560
and they feel unhappy when you try to be unkind to each other,

931
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:34,200
because they are one.

932
01:06:34,999 --> 01:06:38,680
If this is worked out, properly, understandingly,

933
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,960
all of you are going to be great saints.

934
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,800
I see your image in future also.

935
01:06:43,999 --> 01:06:46,880
Of some of you are going to be very, very great

936
01:06:46,999 --> 01:06:48,999
and some of you are going to take it up.

937
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,400
It’s a, it’s a project launched.

938
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,560
Launch a project against yourself,

939
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,600
towards yourself, building up yourself.

940
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:01,160
How sweet you are going to be others, let’s have it.

941
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,760
Talk to others. Some people just don’t talk,

942
01:07:03,848 --> 01:07:05,999
I have seen they are all the time …[SILENCE];

943
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,280
they will have very bad Vishuddhi.

944
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:12,000
You must talk; you must be nice you must be open-hearted.

945
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,239
This Yugoslav girl is very open–hearted,

946
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:17,600
I like her for that reason. She has a big heart.

947
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,880
Talk with a big heart, open!

948
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:26,960
No secretiveness and this cold, what is it called, English manner?

949
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,960
Yogini: Aloof? Shri Mataji: Aloof?

950
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,560
Yogini: When you keep yourself above people.

951
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,240
Shri Mataji laughs: Aloof.

952
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:41,999
I think there must be some English special word for this thing.

953
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:46,198
The way they are cold you know. When you sit….Other yogini: Stiff upper lip, Mother.

954
01:07:46,279 --> 01:07:50,160
Shri Mataji: Ha? Several yogis: Stiff upper lip … Upper lip.

955
01:07:50,241 --> 01:07:52,842
Shri Mataji: Upper lip? Upper lip, not so much upper lip.

956
01:07:52,923 --> 01:07:55,798
There need not be upper lip, could be pride.

957
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:03,400
[Yogi’s laugh and one make an indistinct comment at which Shri Mataji laughs]

958
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:07,960
Shri Mataji: That kind of a presence is here, [INDISTINCT: DOUR,]

959
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,160
which is specialty of English also, isn’t it?

960
01:08:10,241 --> 01:08:13,732
You go in a train, they just don’t talk. I mean they don’t allow you to talk,

961
01:08:13,813 --> 01:08:17,999
they freeze you with silence.

962
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,440
They can’t see people laugh, smile or joke,

963
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:24,360
anything a …[SILENCE] and you don’t know what to do with them.

964
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,999
Newspaper they will read only all the way,

965
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:30,720
and they will fold it and read it.

966
01:08:30,801 --> 01:08:33,505
But they know each and everything about you.

967
01:08:33,586 --> 01:08:36,960
Yogini: Could it be called “insular.”

968
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,960
Shri Mataji: Insular. Ah yes! And is a very dangerous thing for Sahaj Yogis.

969
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,040
The one who becomes insular is in for trouble.

970
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,200
Is in for trouble, insular.

971
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:54,200
You know why, because you are left alone, you’ll be attacked.

972
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:59,480
Be together. All these bhoots also know you are insular.

973
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:02,640
They’ll attack you.

974
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,560
By any chance you try to become unique, they’ll attack you.

975
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,999
Even some people become,

976
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:11,680
by talking too much also they can become insular, unique;

977
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:18,240
you sit on top of everybody else. Better be with everyone, is better.

978
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,560
Be one with everybody, congenial.

979
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:22,999
Take a joke from others.

980
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,760
Other are joking with you, you should not get angry.

981
01:09:25,841 --> 01:09:27,918
If somebody joking with you, “Oh! Shut up.”

982
01:09:27,999 --> 01:09:32,440
Like that one should not do. Take a joke, be a sport.

983
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,999
English language has one very good quality

984
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,320
that they can laugh at themselves, you see. All the

985
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,960
language has found out ways and methods of how to laugh at yourself,

986
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,320
that’s something beautiful about English language.

987
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,360
I don’t think any language has so many words

988
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,999
to express these odd situations,

989
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:57,280
which are very, very embarrassing you see.

990
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,320
You can only brand them and by branding them, you know where you are.

991
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,080
You exactly know what medicine is needed for this.

992
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,560
You see it is like that.

993
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,960
It’s just branding, “Oh this is it,”

994
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,999
and it’s very interesting to watch these things

995
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,719
in the society and everywhere.

996
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,280
Which is described, even Charles Dickens, now example,

997
01:10:16,361 --> 01:10:18,319
at that time he found out these things

998
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:22,160
and he said it. And I mean the description of all these things is

999
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:27,160
so beautifully done in the literature that you are amazed how people

1000
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,040
had a capacity to see themselves,

1001
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:33,600
the society as it is and to de… Characterization of people:

1002
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,720
how characters are built up you see

1003
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,720
and how it becomes a social problem.

1004
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,440
It’s beautifully done

1005
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:44,840
and that’s the wisdom. That’s the real wisdom of British, I tell you

1006
01:10:44,999 --> 01:10:46,280
I mean you may lose it

1007
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:49,200
if you start getting dominated by nonsensical ideas,

1008
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,520
but otherwise that wisdom you have innate.

1009
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,680
I mean to have a person like Shakespeare itself shows what?

1010
01:10:54,999 --> 01:10:58,480
I mean you are a country of great people. How can that be?

1011
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:03,080
Where some, they are not  “some,” there are quite a lot of them

1012
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,320
and you are going to be the wisest

1013
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,320
because you have the advantage of their creation.

1014
01:11:08,999 --> 01:11:12,640
On top of, you have got advantage of your creation.

1015
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,199
Then/that? you belong to a great country like that.

1016
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:19,960
Imagine the whole country is getting into the mire of lethargy,

1017
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,563
who is going to save this country?

1018
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:28,320
You people. So again and again it is against lethargy

1019
01:11:28,999 --> 01:11:33,999
and whatever is lethargy is anti Christ,

1020
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:38,999
is anti God, is anti Mataji.

1021
01:11:40,999 --> 01:11:45,320
Try to become cheerful and blissful,

1022
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:51,120
happy, dignified, sensible, sweet.

1023
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:57,400
It’s not too many things, is very few, it’s only one.

1024
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:01,760
And I know we are going to enjoy life very much.

1025
01:12:01,999 --> 01:12:04,480
You are going to be very happy people.

1026
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:08,960
Take out your tempers from your heads first of all, the angers you see

1027
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,280
and to say, “I got very angry.” Means what? Why did you get angry?

1028
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:18,240
To be proud of your anger and temper and your irritations!

1029
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:21,240
It will be very beautiful I am sure. You are growing up,

1030
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,999
but the growth becomes little

1031
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:27,600
dwarfed with these nonsensical things, you know.

1032
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,760
So you have to protect your growth from these things

1033
01:12:30,999 --> 01:12:35,999
as we protect a small plant from say frost falling on a plant.

1034
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,280
It’s like that.

1035
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,960
Frost is nothing compared to the plant, because plant is growing,

1036
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,840
but the frost can kill it and that’s how you do not make it a frost.

1037
01:12:44,999 --> 01:12:45,960
Be cheerful.

1038
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,960
People come up and they go down. I’ve seen people come up

1039
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,960
and then they go down. Try to look after yourself.

1040
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,960
Now after seventeen days I am going to come and see you

1041
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,080
very beautifully developed and all the time My attention is on you,

1042
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,160
I work on you all the time.

1043
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:07,520
And I’m much more intimate with you than with anybody else,

1044
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,999
because these people see Me only for two days

1045
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:13,280
and then they started crying!

1046
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:19,999
They’re lost. But I see you so much, more than even Indians.

1047
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,760
Is Paul there? Paul has come?

1048
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,960
Yogi: Yes Mother.

1049
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:32,520
Shri Mataji: Yes. Hm. Paul, what happened?

1050
01:13:32,672 --> 01:13:36,999
Paul: I want to get a message to, from the people of India… Shri Mataji: Ha?

1051
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,855
Paul: …Apart from the – the people of India send their love.

1052
01:13:39,936 --> 01:13:43,560
But one of the Sahaj Yogis in india has become very ill.

1053
01:13:43,641 --> 01:13:46,291
Shri Mataji: Who? Paul: Professor [INDISTINCT: Manneh] in Rahur.

1054
01:13:46,372 --> 01:13:50,320
Shri Mataji: I know. But why did you get angry with Dhumal?

1055
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:55,240
Paul: Dhumal? By that time I’d really, I’d

1056
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,920
had enough of seeing in India the way that

1057
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,800
there’s two classes of people in India:

1058
01:13:59,999 --> 01:14:02,240
those who have a lot of money and those who–

1059
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:04,999
Shri Mataji: And what about in this country?

1060
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:07,199
Paul: Well it’s the same deal in this country,

1061
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,960
but the people in this country who don’t have a lot of money,

1062
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:11,880
at least they have bare necessities of life.

1063
01:14:11,961 --> 01:14:13,421
You know like a roof over their heads.

1064
01:14:13,502 --> 01:14:17,622
Shri Mataji: You went there to do Sahaj Yoga or to do these things?

1065
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,280
You see, what I’m saying, where was your attention?

1066
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:25,999
Now you knows, Dhumal has given realizations to ten thousand people.

1067
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:30,960
And he’s your elder brother, you should respect him.

1068
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,960
He has a servant, because in India the situation is different.

1069
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,999
If he gives up his servant, he’ll have no food to eat.

1070
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,999
It’s not that everybody use brain.

1071
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:44,245
You see this is one thing in this country people do not realize.

1072
01:14:44,326 --> 01:14:48,240
If you use, you work much harder than his servant, do you know that?

1073
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:51,440
Because your brain never stops.

1074
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,160
His servants works with his hand he doesn’t think!

1075
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:58,960
His energy goes to his hands, he rests also.

1076
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,120
You see here the idea is if somebody’s working with the hand,

1077
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,000
it’s cruelty.

1078
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,800
But what about this brain?

1079
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,120
The amount of brain you use all the time – now tell me,

1080
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,840
you cannot stop your thinking, all right?

1081
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,800
Now see My servant,

1082
01:15:13,999 --> 01:15:17,999
though he works hard, he’s much more relaxed than My husband is.

1083
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:23,880
My husband doesn’t do even lifting a, say lifting a glass.

1084
01:15:23,999 --> 01:15:25,240
All right?

1085
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:29,000
And what happens, that one can say that this man is a lazy fellow,

1086
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:30,800
he’s enjoying everything in life,

1087
01:15:30,999 --> 01:15:33,999
he’s enjoying all the comfort while the servant is not.

1088
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:37,320
But My servant is, in a way, is doing his handwork,

1089
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:40,520
because that’s all he can do; his brain is not that developed.

1090
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:43,999
And he has much more rest than My husband has.

1091
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,760
He’s much more relaxed.

1092
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:51,440
Somebody is the hand, somebody is the feet and somebody’s the head.

1093
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:54,480
But if you do work with your head, is the same.

1094
01:15:54,561 --> 01:15:56,519
Now if you are doing work with your head,

1095
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:00,000
you have to have certain amount of comfort to your body,

1096
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:02,960
otherwise even if you have to suffer on your body –

1097
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,520
of course I do not say that servants

1098
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,440
should be ill-treated by any chance,

1099
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:11,200
that should not be done – but…

1100
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,120
And nobody gives your money to anybody else like that.

1101
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:15,520
You see he’s paid for it

1102
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,280
and he does the work with his hands so you can see it.

1103
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:24,520
But what about the brain part, do you see the brain how it works?

1104
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:28,400
I wish you could have a microscope to see how the brain works,

1105
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,440
and all the chakras, “cutcutcutcut-cutcutcutcut” going on.

1106
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:39,080
One thought itself is a dynamite

1107
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,080
and you cannot stop it, ask him.

1108
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:44,240
Yesterday his thought going on like a machine!

1109
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,200
There’s a machine here working out.

1110
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,960
So, this happens and then one should understand

1111
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,080
that when you go to any country,

1112
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,640
you are a guest there…

1113
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:57,400
He was very unhappy and he wrote a very sad letter to Me

1114
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,960
and that was not good. You didn’t want him to be unhappy, you w–

1115
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,960
Paul: What if I write? Shri Mataji: Ha? Dhumal?

1116
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,960
Paul: We didn’t have an argument. Shri Mataji: Ha?

1117
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,960
Paul: I didn’t have an argument. Shri Mataji: You didn’t have what?

1118
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:07,960
Paul: I told him what I felt. Shri Mataji: Ha?

1119
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,280
Paul: I told him what I felt, I just went, I just… you know the most,

1120
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:15,000
quite a lot of places in India. And–

1121
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,960
Shri Mataji: You, what did you feel?

1122
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,720
Paul: Well I felt that if somebody’s telling me how many houses they’ve got

1123
01:17:21,999 --> 01:17:26,960
and how many houses they’re buying, when their servant doesn’t have a roof over his head,

1124
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,960
when the roof leaks and the children–

1125
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,960
Shri Mataji: Now, supposing, here people have so many houses which are lying empty, here,

1126
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,680
in England. Do they give their houses to you people?

1127
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,960
Do they? Is there any way?

1128
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,960
How many people you should give also, is there any system by which you should give?

1129
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,960
See that is not Dhumal’s problem, is the problem of the government.

1130
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:57,960
Dhumal has houses, he has given a huge big fort to us as a present to Sahaj Yoga.

1131
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,960
If he gives a house free to his servant, I think he will make him a parasite out of him.

1132
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,960
Do you know in India, beggars have got big, big buildings? Do you know that fact?

1133
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:16,960
Some of the buildings on Marine Drive are owned by people who are professionally beggars.

1134
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,960
So if you see some problem it has so many deeper roots, which you do not see.

1135
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,960
But, you just write a letter of apology to him. I was hurt, very much,

1136
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:32,960
because he, he has done such a tremendous job.

1137
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:38,960
He is going to give a huge big place to us for Sahaj Yoga.

1138
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,960
Nobody has been able to do that so far.

1139
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:49,960
He has given Me ten thousand people as Sahaj Yogis. And when you people say,

1140
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:58,960
“I felt,” what is this “I,” what is this “I”? I know you have a very sympathetic heart,

1141
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:05,960
but sometimes you are swayed by it. Sympathetic heart, to a point is good.

1142
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,960
It should be prudent heart, it should not be unwise.

1143
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,960
You must know the sense of proportion.

1144
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,960
I mean that’s a system in India, which is working, but you cannot do without servants.

1145
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,960
Here also. What is happening to you, without servants, you are all intelligent people,

1146
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,960
why you live in a mess, in pigsties?

1147
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,960
Because you are using your brains, you don’t know how to use your hands.

1148
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,960
All these communistic ideas are of no use. People have to do some sort of a job,

1149
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,960
this job or that job. There’s nothing wrong. Some people who can do brain job,

1150
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,960
have to do brain job, those who have to do handwork has to do handwork.

1151
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,960
Of course there should not be much disparity in their living, I agree,

1152
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,960
but that’s not his problem, is the problem of the whole country.

1153
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,960
But I tell you even to servants I have seen, you give them something…

1154
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,960
There was a lady nurse, you see?

1155
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,960
Once I was rather sick so she used to come and see Me and help Me a little bit.

1156
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,960
So I thought just as a favor I must do something to her.

1157
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:09,960
So I sent her by our ship to sea, I said “Let her have a holiday, she’ll be all right.”

1158
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,960
So I sent her to Africa. I mean the problems are much deeper than you understand.

1159
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,960
I sent her to Africa. You know, she came back and she started telling the doctor off.

1160
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,960
She thought she has become the doctor.

1161
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,960
And the doctor told Me, “Why did you do it?” They get into imbalances. You see,

1162
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:32,960
even to poor persons, if you give them something like that, they go into imbalances.

1163
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,960
I’ll give you another very concrete example.

1164
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,960
My husband, who is very socialistic in his approach, and is a good thing,

1165
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,960
so what he did, was to increase the pay of the drivers.

1166
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,960
You see the drivers started getting one thousand Rupee, which was very, very big amount.

1167
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,960
And the lowest clerk gets about say twelve hundred.

1168
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,960
So there was a very little disparity.

1169
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,960
Now the driver’s getting one thousand Rupees, was too much.

1170
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,960
Within six months their wives came to Me.

1171
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,960
They said, “This was a very wrong thing he did to our husbands.

1172
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,960
They have got keeps now; they have started drinking;

1173
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,960
they have started not giving any money to us.”

1174
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,960
So to poor people if you give them more money,

1175
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,960
they do not know how to use it, they will be drinking.

1176
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,960
Poor people drink much more than the rich people.

1177
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:28,960
So they had to be trained how to use money. You just give them money is no use.

1178
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:35,960
You do not understand the deeper… thing… People are to be brought up properly.

1179
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,960
Like we have got in India Schedule Caste – I agree Schedule Caste is a nonsense,

1180
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,960
it should not be there, you should not treat somebody as a lower caste, is all right.

1181
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,960
But what they have brought into now, suddenly,

1182
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:52,960
that Schedule Caste must have equal seats, equal rights in every job and everything,

1183
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,960
whether they are qualified or not. So you have got people who are not qualified,

1184
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:01,960
or even in exams, in the colleges, you must have so many Schedule Caste.

1185
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,960
Now what has happened, by doing this kind of a top-heavy work,

1186
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,960
some muck has come up, and they are absolutely useless people,

1187
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,960
they cannot do administration. Instead of that,

1188
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,960
what Ghandiji had said, that, “Train them up, educate them, bring them up.”

1189
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,960
Suddenly the educated people are there

1190
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,960
and some people suddenly, uneducated, nothing, brought to that, they cannot bear it.

1191
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,960

1192
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,960
Now we had a servant with us who came to Me,

1193
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,960
who was a – you must be knowing him, Paramshivam – who came down here.

1194
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,960
And he used to, he was getting hardly hundred Rupees there,

1195
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,960
we gave him a big pay and everything, when he came here he started misbehaving.

1196
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,960
Then his mother, when I wrote to them that, “He’s misbehaving,

1197
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,960
I don’t know what to do. He has developed all bad habits.”

1198
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,960
He was buying pornography pictures here, going to the pub,

1199
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,960
then having girlfriends and doing all sorts of things, he started here.

1200
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,960
So when I wrote to his mother, what his mother wrote to Me is very interesting to read.

1201
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:16,960
She said, “Those people who live in mud, if they have to sleep on a bed, it hurts them.

1202
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,960

1203
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:24,960
So suddenly giving them something materially is not going to improve him.

1204
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:30,960
You have to train them up. You do not know what problems there are of poverty.

1205
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:40,960
Poverty is just like leprosy. Leprosy: you know what the leprosy parasites eat?

1206
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:47,960
They eat petrol; they thrive on petrol. So gross it is.

1207
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,960

1208
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,960
And then, you being an Englishman should not have said it,

1209
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:03,960
because English are responsible for the poverty of India, you like it or not.

1210
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,960
They have created this problem for us, we didn’t have this problem before.

1211
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,960
Our servants were part and parcel of our house.

1212
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,960
They treated us just like slaves, so we have got this idea from them.

1213
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:22,960
How they treated us! I must say Dhumal was very decent not to say this to you,

1214
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,960
but this is what it is. The way they treated us in India, you have no idea.

1215
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:27,960

1216
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:36,960
Even till yesterday we had “White Clubs” where Indians were not allowed on our own soil!

1217
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,960
When we were independent, and they’re fighting for it.

1218
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,960
They killed thousands of people, raped so many woman there.

1219
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:50,960
“We English” should not say that, in that country were we have ruled

1220
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,960
and made them slaves. You see they did not allow us to come up.

1221
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,960
What are you doing to foreigners here who are coming up?

1222
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:04,960
How you treat them? What racialism you have here compared to what we have in India,

1223
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,960
we have no racialism. They treated you with such great respect.

1224
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,960
They should have said, “You are white, so ‘racialism,’ all right we’ll ill-treat you.”

1225
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:19,960
But if you go to Africa they will teach you. Africans, West Indies – they are on top of you.

1226
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,960
What I’m saying, to break the vicious circle try to understand the problem of every country.

1227
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,960
From where does this problem come to India,

1228
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,960
and to most of the countries who are underdeveloped.

1229
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:40,960
The French, they dominated also many countries.

1230
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:46,960
This is also, one should understand that we should not dominate any more.

1231
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,960
We should wash their feet, that’s what it is.

1232
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,960

1233
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,960
Now you have killed the culture of all the Africans

1234
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,960
and Africans have taken to all French and English culture.

1235
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,960
Absolutely, they have prostitutes the same way you have,

1236
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,960
they have the women the same way you have; their ideas of liberation’s the same,

1237
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,960
only the Indians have resisted you.

1238
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,960
Otherwise everywhere you have never respected anybody’s culture or anything.

1239
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:25,960
You have to face it. If you go to South America,

1240
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,960
you’ll be shocked the way people have wiped out all the… all the people who lived there;

1241
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,960
all of them, one and all. Except for Columbia, can you imagine?

1242
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:43,960
Every country, every soul has been wiped out. Just see that.

1243
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,960

1244
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:55,960
Of course if he was ill-treating him I can understand, but he doesn’t ill-treat.

1245
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,960
These ideas are Western ideas; they’re applicable to you people, not to Indians.

1246
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,960
And this is the big mistake people are doing is to put your ideas onto us.

1247
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,960
For example in field reforms, you see?

1248
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,960
My son-in-law is a very enlightened fellow, he had twenty-five miles,

1249
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:18,960
square miles of area of his own. But he used to get his labor from all these areas,

1250
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,960
he used to provide them everything, he used to pay them very well;

1251
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,960
they were living very well. Suddenly the idea came,

1252
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,960
“No. They must have their own land holdings,” all right – without understanding

1253
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,960
that they are to be trained, they are to be brought up, they are not educated,

1254
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,960
there must be communication – so everybody was given a one patch here

1255
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,960
and a one patch there and a one patch there and a one patch there.

1256
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,960
What happened, that they started getting strangulated in those areas.

1257
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,960
There was no way of communication to them, they could not get their wheat,

1258
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,960
they could not get their seeds, they could not do anything, they started starving.

1259
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,960
And they came to My son-in-law that, “You come forward,

1260
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,960
you are the one who was the agency in between and you should have done it.”

1261
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,960
But they removed the agency and without training these people.

1262
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,960
Ghandiji suggested these things. He said that,

1263
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:14,960
“You must enlighten the rich people and you must also try to emancipate these people

1264
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,960
by education, by making them understanding,” and all that.

1265
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:27,960
There is a huge, areas in India, which are called as “Backward Areas,”

1266
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,960
where these aboriginals live. They do not believe in any sedentary habits,

1267
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,960
they are like, what you call the gypsies. So what they do,

1268
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:43,960
these people plough their fields and all that, and they come in the night and plunder it.

1269
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:49,960
And they live like that. And they have been living like this and they feel very happy about it.

1270
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,960
They second is this (?), the so-called poor of India.

1271
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,960
You must see how leprosy grows also.

1272
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,960
They started in Maharashtra a scheme by which they said,

1273
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:06,960
“We will provide you jobs and otherwise we’ll give you a dole.”

1274
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,960
Now this is the worst thing that can happen to anyone; that we have realized very soon,

1275
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,960
I hope they have withdrawn it. So they what they did –

1276
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,960
Indians as it is they are very cunning and clever –

1277
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,960
so what they did they would go and write their names as the people who are doles,

1278
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,960
getting doles, you see? And they would work somewhere and get the dole as well,

1279
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:32,960
double money. Then they would go and drink. What are these people doing,

1280
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:41,960
but to drink? It’s such a problem, prohibition; they, they drink iodine, they drink,

1281
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,960
what you call this… What do you eat, drink for this thing,

1282
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,960
it’s some sort of sulphuric acid or some sort of an acid they drink?

1283
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,960
I don’t know? Various yogis: Meths… Methylated Spirits.

1284
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:57,960
Shri Mataji: Methylated or whatever… [laughs] I don’t know! I don’t understand.

1285
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,960
So, you see they are so foolish,

1286
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,960
what I am saying that taking up anything like that at random is not good.

1287
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,960
And I was sorry because his wife wrote to Me,

1288
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,960
“How much they have done for Sahaj Yoga.”

1289
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:17,960
The only solution is Sahaj Yoga. There’s no other solution, which he has helped Me a lot.

1290
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,960
“You see,” and he was very sorry he said that, “How am I to do without servants?”

1291
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,960
You see the servant system is like that. If he gives roof to everyone he’ll be left with no house.

1292
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,960
There’s not done, this kind of generosity’s not done anywhere.

1293
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:37,960
If there was such an agency like that, which was doing such a work, it is possible.

1294
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,960
Even the so called communists everywhere, wherever they are in a democracy,

1295
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:50,960
have their own properties. Once the democracy will go away they won’t be able to even talk.

1296
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:56,960
But I do not say that Capitalism is the solution; I say Sahaj Yoga is the solution, all right?

1297
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,960
It is the Sahaj Yoga and he’s done so much for Sahaj Yoga.

1298
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,960
For that servant we cannot in any way insult him; servant is not important for us,

1299
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:10,960
who is the servant? Who are these poor people to us?

1300
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:16,960
We are not responsible for them, the state is responsible.

1301
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:23,000
We are responsible for Sahaj Yogis, because they are the people who make the difference.
