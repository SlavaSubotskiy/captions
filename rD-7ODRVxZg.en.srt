1
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:45,744
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,053
Just now, Albert has very clearly described to you

3
00:04:58,374 --> 00:05:01,755
the mechanism that is within us

4
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:06,753
which works out our self-realization.

5
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:10,636
There is a mechanism, no doubt.

6
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:16,620
When we are in this room we see so many lights

7
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,878
and there is a mechanism behind this.

8
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:27,286
But what we do is to just switch on and the lights are there.

9
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:31,870
So the whole mechanism is already built within us

10
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,203
through our evolutionary process.

11
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:42,079
Now we have reached at a point when we have to achieve

12
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:46,453
the result of the evolutionary process.

13
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:57,578
In the West, people had the quest to find out outside this body.

14
00:05:57,778 --> 00:06:07,495
I would say that they tried to find out the knowledge

15
00:06:07,695 --> 00:06:14,662
about the tree of life, but when the life is found out

16
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:18,578
from outside you can go up to a point,

17
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:22,370
and the tree can also grow up to a point.

18
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,495
You have to go to your roots.

19
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:29,411
This is the knowledge of our roots.

20
00:06:29,611 --> 00:06:35,037
Now to say that it comes from India

21
00:06:35,237 --> 00:06:39,286
or it comes from a particular region is not true.

22
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:43,662
India being an ancient country, of course,

23
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,620
they have been able to go deep into it,

24
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,037
but even in the Bible you get sentences like,

25
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:55,453
“I will appear before you like tongues of flames”

26
00:06:55,653 --> 00:07:00,703
and these centers really looks like tongues of flames.

27
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:05,120
Then in the Koran also it is there called as Assas,

28
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,954
the kundalini, and it is described

29
00:07:08,154 --> 00:07:10,037
that you have to be connected with God,

30
00:07:10,237 --> 00:07:12,912
otherwise whatever you do in the name of God

31
00:07:13,112 --> 00:07:19,245
you’ll become cruel and you will be disintegrated.

32
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:25,745
It’s clearly said. Same thing in any religion that you read,

33
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,829
that you have to have your self-realization.

34
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:31,870
Every religion has talked of the spirit.

35
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,745
Every religion has said that you must find out your spirit.

36
00:07:36,945 --> 00:07:40,912
Now, when we are ignorant about the spirit –

37
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:45,578
and there are so many people in the market which I say

38
00:07:45,778 --> 00:07:49,870
as a ‘guru shopping’ going on – people don’t know

39
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,286
what to expect and what to find.

40
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:59,703
What is self, what is spirit, and why should we get it?

41
00:07:59,903 --> 00:08:05,620
As I said, it is the epitome of our evolution

42
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,578
that you have to become the spirit and that is the truth

43
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:14,161
that you are the spirit. If you are the spirit,

44
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:18,120
then you have to achieve that state,

45
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:24,453
by this way or that way, that is your birthright –

46
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:28,411
is born with you, that’s why we call it Sahaja Yoga.

47
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:33,370
Sahaja means, Saha is ‘with’, ja is ‘born with you’.

48
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,079
That is the yoga, the union with the Divine.

49
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,453
The Divine is the all-pervading power of God’s love,

50
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:48,829
which is the subtle of subtler all pervading.

51
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:54,995
It exists in everything and you have to feel it.

52
00:08:55,195 --> 00:09:00,829
That’s what we call as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost:

53
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:08,453
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. In the Bible, there’s no description of Holy Ghost.

54
00:09:08,653 --> 00:09:13,453
This kundalini is the reflection of that Holy Ghost.

55
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:20,995
Holy Ghost is the desire of God, that’s the power of God

56
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:24,787
reflected within us as Holy Ghost, as kundalini,

57
00:09:24,987 --> 00:09:29,703
in three-and-a-half coils: is our pure desire.

58
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:33,411
All other desires that we have are impure

59
00:09:33,611 --> 00:09:37,453
because we have been desiring for this and that,

60
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:42,453
we know economic laws are such that in general wants

61
00:09:42,653 --> 00:09:47,328
are not satiable. Why? Because those wants are not pure.

62
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:51,037
So this is the power of kundalini,

63
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:54,787
which resides in the triangular bone within yourself.

64
00:09:54,987 --> 00:09:57,912
Now, when I am telling all this to you,

65
00:09:58,112 --> 00:10:01,745
you should not have a blind faith about it,

66
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:06,912
but it’s an hypothesis. If you are a scientific person

67
00:10:07,112 --> 00:10:12,079
or if you have a very logical mind then you must understand

68
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,203
that you should not close your mind.

69
00:10:15,403 --> 00:10:19,495
You should be with an open mind and see for yourself

70
00:10:19,695 --> 00:10:23,370
if this proves, then it’s all right.

71
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,745
But you should not be a person who is cynical,

72
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:28,870
who is already challenging Me,

73
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,954
because what I am doing is to give you what you have,

74
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:37,245
is to tell you what you have, which is your property,

75
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:41,037
it’s your own. I am nothing to do with it as such,

76
00:10:41,237 --> 00:10:46,120
but I can’t also help it without telling you.

77
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,912
This kundalini has to rise from its seat,

78
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:53,037
which he has shown just now,

79
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:56,370
which is residing in the triangular bone called as sacrum.

80
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:02,286
Sacrum itself means ‘sacred’, that means the Greeks knew

81
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:07,495
about this word, knew about kundalini,

82
00:11:07,695 --> 00:11:09,954
that’s why they called it sacrum.

83
00:11:10,154 --> 00:11:17,203
Now when this kundalini rises through these various centers,

84
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:20,161
she passes through six centers;

85
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:24,370
the seventh center is below her,

86
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:33,286
and this seventh center looks after the glory, or the chastity,

87
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:38,537
or we can say protects the Mother Kundalini within us.

88
00:11:38,737 --> 00:11:42,203
Now the first center is the most important center,

89
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:47,745
and the first center is the center of our innocence.

90
00:11:47,945 --> 00:11:52,495
When we try to play with our innocence,

91
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:57,203
this center gets spoilt which has to protect the kundalini,

92
00:11:57,403 --> 00:12:02,578
and when this center is spoilt we can get into lots of problems.

93
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:09,120
Nowadays you can hear a big cry about this killer’s disease,

94
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,245
Aids: we have to fight it;

95
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:15,537
it’s a wrong thing that we have done,

96
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:18,161
one thing we must accept.

97
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:20,370
And then we have to fight it;

98
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,245
it’s not difficult to fight this disease if you accept

99
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:26,161
that you have lost your innocence.

100
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:33,537
The trouble is when people started getting the knowledge

101
00:12:33,737 --> 00:12:36,870
of the tree, they really went amok.

102
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,662
They didn’t know what to do with themselves –

103
00:12:38,862 --> 00:12:41,079
now they have finished with this, they have finished with that,

104
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,954
so now eat your nose or eat your eyes or eat your teeth,

105
00:12:46,154 --> 00:12:51,286
something like that – a maddening way rushed into people

106
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:53,995
and they didn’t know what to do with themselves

107
00:12:54,195 --> 00:12:56,662
so they started practicing also sex.

108
00:12:56,862 --> 00:12:59,912
I would also blame Freud for that.

109
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:04,370
In India Freud won’t be accepted at all; it’s nonsense.

110
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:09,578
Nobody can accept his theory where they say

111
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:12,370
that you have all the time feelings

112
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,537
of carnal love for your mother.

113
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:18,829
Of course, this is ridiculous for us.

114
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:24,495
But anything new has to be accepted: that’s the modern idea.

115
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:27,620
Anything new that comes to you, we must accept.

116
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,370
Anything new may not be all right.

117
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,161
The other day we were having a banquet

118
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:40,120
and I had a neighbor who was Ambassador from Mexico

119
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,370
and he told me that “I know you don’t like Freud

120
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,411
and You like Jung, but Jung talked of the same old thing.”

121
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:52,954
I said, “Same old thing, but something new about it.”

122
00:13:53,154 --> 00:13:55,912
Evolution takes place in that manner

123
00:13:56,112 --> 00:14:00,328
that first you have the tree and then you have the branches,

124
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:03,995
then you have the leaves and then you have the flowers

125
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:06,829
and then the flowers have the fruits.

126
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:09,286
But if somebody just takes out a flower from somewhere

127
00:14:09,486 --> 00:14:12,912
and gives you, then you know that it’s plastic.

128
00:14:13,112 --> 00:14:18,370
It must have some basis; it must have some tradition.

129
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,745
It must be in our ancient books.

130
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:26,286
It should be described by people who have lived before.

131
00:14:26,486 --> 00:14:28,245
Suddenly if Mr. Freud comes along

132
00:14:28,445 --> 00:14:31,912
and says some new theory, it’s like mushrooms.

133
00:14:32,112 --> 00:14:34,079
These people come up and start telling stories

134
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:38,328
and we believe in them. It’s a fungus.

135
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:41,578
Now, so I told the gentleman, I said,

136
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:44,161
“All right, we have eaten all kinds of food before.

137
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:47,203
We haven’t eaten the table: why not we eat that,

138
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:53,578
because it’s new?” In the same way,

139
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:57,119
everything that is new we started accepting

140
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:01,495
because ‘this is new, this is a new idea, we should get to it’

141
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:05,286
and it’s mad race, I tell you, it’s a real mad race.

142
00:15:05,486 --> 00:15:10,286
All our attention goes to all these mad things.

143
00:15:10,486 --> 00:15:14,245
For example, now, the fashions that have started.

144
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:17,662
These are entrepreneurs who are materialists,

145
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:23,161
who want to befool us, all the time changing

146
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:26,037
one fashion to another to another. Now in England

147
00:15:26,237 --> 00:15:28,870
you won’t find anybody with any hair now left,

148
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,286
because poor things they tried with this, that, and that,

149
00:15:32,486 --> 00:15:35,079
lastly they came to punks and when I said,

150
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,286
“Now to punks, then what?” they said,

151
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:41,119
“Mother, You’re out of date!” Now it is all bald heads.

152
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:45,537
This is what is, we are giving up all ourselves,

153
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:50,495
all our thoughts to somebody who is making us play like this.

154
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:55,745
Materialism is for us, we are not for materialism.

155
00:15:55,945 --> 00:15:59,537
Matter is for us; we have to dominate this matter.

156
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:03,703
All the time the spirit is dominating the matter,

157
00:16:03,903 --> 00:16:06,787
and when the spirit comes up,

158
00:16:06,987 --> 00:16:10,286
then it uses matter for its own purpose.

159
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:12,370
It is not dominated by matter;

160
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,995
nobody can dominate a person who is the spirit.

161
00:16:16,195 --> 00:16:23,620
But we are so much lost into it, trying new things like mad,

162
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:30,079
jumping from one to another that we don’t see the sense in it,

163
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:36,870
just like eating the table. We haven’t got our own ideas;

164
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:42,119
we are reactionaries or we accept ideas that are others’.

165
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:44,995
If somebody tells us some ideas, we say, “Oh, it’s great.”

166
00:16:45,195 --> 00:16:48,537
But why, why it is great?

167
00:16:48,737 --> 00:16:52,079
It must be tallied by few things.

168
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,119
First of all, we must find out

169
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:57,787
does it have any relationship to any tradition,

170
00:16:57,987 --> 00:17:03,453
to any ancient books, to any prophets,

171
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:06,037
to any incarnations who came on this earth?

172
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:09,912
They were not all useless people, they were not false people,

173
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:14,286
they were not telling us lies. But we are reactionaries,

174
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:17,870
like we find now Christianity has failed,

175
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,995
the churches are failing, so we react. No,

176
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:25,787
Christianity may fail but Christ doesn’t fail.

177
00:17:25,987 --> 00:17:30,370
Like yesterday we had a very interesting couple of people,

178
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,620
one of them came for my interview

179
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,620
and another one was a photographer.

180
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,954
The photographer is an ardent Christian, so he said,

181
00:17:39,154 --> 00:17:41,453
“Do You mean to say, Mother, we got everything wrong?”

182
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:44,411
I said, “No. You love Christ, isn’t it?”

183
00:17:44,611 --> 00:17:47,829
“Yes, I love Christ very much.” I said, “Then, you’ll get it.

184
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:50,537
If you have loved Christ, then you will get it.

185
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:55,203
But if you are busy with the organizing of Christ,

186
00:17:55,403 --> 00:18:00,120
then it’s rather difficult. You can’t organize Christ.

187
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,120
You cannot dictate Him and you cannot use Him

188
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,537
for your purposes for making money,

189
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:09,703
for making huge big palaces for yourself.

190
00:18:09,903 --> 00:18:15,578
As you can see what’s happening now in the Vatican –

191
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:20,870
big problems there are with the Mafia,

192
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,328
and they don’t want to hear it. No, nothing,

193
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:25,203
they don’t want to hear about it.

194
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:29,161
How could these people talking of righteousness, of virtue,

195
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:32,079
of values, have gone to that limit?”

196
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:38,787
Same in India, Hindu religion has gone to dogs,

197
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:43,495
absolutely to dogs. They’re using the same black magic,

198
00:18:43,695 --> 00:18:50,037
the same old things which were done in Indian villages.

199
00:18:50,237 --> 00:18:52,537
They have come to the cities now.

200
00:18:52,737 --> 00:18:58,453
In the temples now they are selling drugs

201
00:18:58,653 --> 00:19:03,037
which are of horrible nature to people who come there.

202
00:19:03,237 --> 00:19:08,161
Is that Hinduism? What about Islam?

203
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:10,787
You see Islamic people, how they are quarrelling

204
00:19:10,987 --> 00:19:13,870
among themselves when Islam is surrender.

205
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,203
They are all fighting among themselves.

206
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:21,578
Is that the religion which Mohammed-Sahib preached?

207
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:26,453
What about Buddhists? They are another nonsensical people:

208
00:19:26,653 --> 00:19:33,453
extremely materialistic. Every religion has gone to dogs.

209
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:37,995
Why? Because they did not understand the main point,

210
00:19:38,195 --> 00:19:41,453
and the main point is you should be connected with God.

211
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:43,161
You are to be born again.

212
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:46,620
It’s not just to give a certificate to yourself, “I’m a born-again”

213
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,453
going about: “I’m a born-again.”

214
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:52,954
One lady from that came actually to beat Me!

215
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:54,745
I started laughing at her!

216
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:58,245
This born-again lady has come to beat Me, for what?

217
00:19:58,445 --> 00:20:06,620
You cannot certify yourself. This self-certificate

218
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,120
or certificate from somebody is absurd.

219
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,119
You have to have the powers of being born-again.

220
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:19,620
The born-again have powers of their own manifesting,

221
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,245
they are not just born-again going around.

222
00:20:22,445 --> 00:20:26,328
Now what are the powers of a person who is born again?

223
00:20:26,528 --> 00:20:33,495
First of all, such a person is a tranquil, peaceful person;

224
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:37,203
he becomes automatically righteous, automatically.

225
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,079
I don’t have to tell you, “Don’t do this and don’t do that.”

226
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:44,119
That’s finished now with Moses. No more of that.

227
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:46,787
As soon as you become the Spirit,

228
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:51,578
you just give up all those things that are destructive for us,

229
00:20:51,778 --> 00:20:57,370
automatically. No pressures are needed,

230
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,662
no warning is needed, nothing of the kind, automatically,

231
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:05,203
because the spirit is the light, you get your enlightenment.

232
00:21:05,403 --> 00:21:08,745
Supposing I am holding a snake in my hand,

233
00:21:08,945 --> 00:21:11,370
and it’s not light. Somebody tells me it’s a snake,

234
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,453
I say, “No, it’s a rope, I am holding on to a rope.”

235
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:19,286
But when there is a light I just drop it. In a simple way,

236
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,286
nobody has to tell Me, I see the light and it drops out.

237
00:21:22,486 --> 00:21:25,662
In the same way, you are an enlightened person.

238
00:21:25,862 --> 00:21:30,328
You can make out what is truth and what is untruth.

239
00:21:30,528 --> 00:21:35,703
For example, you see someone, even from Indian jails,

240
00:21:35,903 --> 00:21:37,870
some people who have just come out of jails,

241
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,703
they don’t know what to do with themselves.

242
00:21:39,903 --> 00:21:43,161
So they walk out with saffron clothes to Germany,

243
00:21:43,361 --> 00:21:47,745
maybe to Australia also, and they become great babajis here.

244
00:21:47,945 --> 00:21:53,537
Now these great babajis sit on some of the important places

245
00:21:53,737 --> 00:21:57,245
in the city and everybody is surrounding them,

246
00:21:57,445 --> 00:22:01,119
giving them money, giving them their lives, you see,

247
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,537
all big talk of love going on and everything.

248
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:10,245
Is he a realized soul or not? How will you find out?

249
00:22:10,445 --> 00:22:14,995
You don’t know whether he’s a realized soul or not

250
00:22:15,195 --> 00:22:20,203
because you are not at an absolute point.

251
00:22:20,403 --> 00:22:24,370
You are still in a relative understanding.

252
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,328
Because this person is wearing this kind of a dress,

253
00:22:28,528 --> 00:22:32,620
is sitting very quietly there, so he must be a babajii.

254
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,453
You cannot recognize a person,

255
00:22:37,653 --> 00:22:42,203
whether a person is true or not. You can’t recognize Me,

256
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:45,119
either, whether I am telling you the truth or not.

257
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:48,787
Unless and until you become that absolute being,

258
00:22:48,987 --> 00:22:51,703
you cannot make it out. Then what happens,

259
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:54,620
that when the kundalini rises and pierces

260
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,829
through your fontanel bone area,

261
00:22:57,029 --> 00:23:00,578
then you also start feeling on your fingertips –

262
00:23:00,778 --> 00:23:02,370
these fingertips are nothing

263
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,037
but the sympathetic nervous system centers,

264
00:23:06,237 --> 00:23:16,745
which are indicating of the truth. If the person has got cool

265
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:20,870
wind or cool breeze coming from that person,

266
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:26,037
then he is a real one. If he doesn’t have, then he is not.

267
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:34,037
There are many persons who claim to be great,

268
00:23:34,237 --> 00:23:36,829
but they are not – ultimately we find out

269
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:39,495
and we are shocked the way they are.

270
00:23:39,695 --> 00:23:43,620
We don’t know, how is it our brain has failed,

271
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,453
how is it our brilliance did not show clearly

272
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:51,703
what was wrong with this gentleman?

273
00:23:51,903 --> 00:23:55,870
Because we are not that. We have to accept humbly

274
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,161
that we are still at a human awareness

275
00:23:58,361 --> 00:24:00,912
and we have to be at a spiritual awareness.

276
00:24:01,112 --> 00:24:02,995
That’s the dimension we have to get,

277
00:24:03,195 --> 00:24:05,912
otherwise we cannot judge things properly.

278
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:09,954
In this country now we have certain problems,

279
00:24:10,154 --> 00:24:12,370
in this whole world we have problems –

280
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:17,079
problems of atom bomb, every day you are hearing

281
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,995
about this problem and that problem:

282
00:24:19,195 --> 00:24:26,037
all created by human beings. Imagine, intelligent,

283
00:24:26,237 --> 00:24:32,537
such good people have created problems for themselves:

284
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:37,161
killing each other, preparing bombs and things like that;

285
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:40,912
protecting each other – I mean, no animal does that.

286
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:45,703
Only human beings are trying to protect themselves

287
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:50,453
from each other. They’re all the time worried

288
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:54,578
who is going to attack them; not sure of themselves.

289
00:24:54,778 --> 00:24:59,453
The reason is they haven’t reached that state of absoluteness.

290
00:24:59,653 --> 00:25:04,161
The time has come now, the time has come for you

291
00:25:04,361 --> 00:25:08,703
either to take to constructive working out of the problem,

292
00:25:08,903 --> 00:25:13,703
or the destructive. By discussions, by arguments,

293
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:16,787
by anything you are not going to achieve anything

294
00:25:16,987 --> 00:25:20,037
unless and until there’s a complete transformation

295
00:25:20,237 --> 00:25:24,829
in the human mind. And transformation is only possible

296
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:26,912
when you become the Spirit,

297
00:25:27,112 --> 00:25:30,119
because Spirit is the universal being within you.

298
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:33,537
And you become collectively conscious – means,

299
00:25:33,737 --> 00:25:35,079
you start a universal feeling;

300
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,995
you just start feeling another person on your fingertips.

301
00:25:38,195 --> 00:25:43,745
And if you know how to correct it, you have corrected that person.

302
00:25:43,945 --> 00:25:49,079
This is only the play of love of God;

303
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,161
it’s so simple, even children can do it.

304
00:25:52,361 --> 00:25:57,203
Many children when they put their fingers in their mouth or their thumbs in their mouth,

305
00:25:57,403 --> 00:26:01,328
according to Mr. Freud it’s something nonsense,

306
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:03,954
but according to us they are suggesting

307
00:26:04,154 --> 00:26:07,537
what centers you are catching.

308
00:26:07,737 --> 00:26:13,286
To understand your own children you have to be a realized soul

309
00:26:13,486 --> 00:26:17,328
because the understanding is still not matured.

310
00:26:17,528 --> 00:26:20,079
Unless and until you become a realized soul,

311
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:23,620
you are not a mature personality to judge anything.

312
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:28,203
At that level, whatever you judge will have another point of view.

313
00:26:28,403 --> 00:26:34,662
You can take ten small children who are realized souls –

314
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:38,411
we have many like that – and hide their eyes.

315
00:26:38,611 --> 00:26:42,328
Now ask them, “What’s the wrong with this particular person?”

316
00:26:42,528 --> 00:26:45,954
They will all raise one finger meaning this, or this finger.

317
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:50,120
If this finger, means that person feels guilty for nothing at all

318
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,495
(it’s the Vishuddhi on the left-hand side) or the right,

319
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,829
means he talks too much and he has problems here.

320
00:26:57,029 --> 00:27:05,037
This knowledge becomes your own.

321
00:27:05,237 --> 00:27:08,787
This is one of the powers I have described to you

322
00:27:08,987 --> 00:27:13,954
that you feel the collective consciousness within yourself.

323
00:27:14,154 --> 00:27:19,703
Whatever you achieve in your evolution is a living process.

324
00:27:19,903 --> 00:27:26,120
It is not a dead process, it’s a living process

325
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,245
by which your central nervous system can feel

326
00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:38,120
what is around you, what is within you.

327
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,745
What you call the parasympathetic nervous system

328
00:27:40,945 --> 00:27:43,286
gets activated, and you can understand

329
00:27:43,486 --> 00:27:45,954
the parasympathetic while, if there are any doctors

330
00:27:46,154 --> 00:27:48,245
they will tell you that they don’t know much

331
00:27:48,445 --> 00:27:53,745
about parasympathetic. Now all these things happen to you

332
00:27:53,945 --> 00:27:58,453
and even if you are a child, you can manage the show.

333
00:27:58,653 --> 00:28:01,119
The second power that you get

334
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:04,703
is that you can raise the kundalini of another person

335
00:28:04,903 --> 00:28:08,537
like one enlightened light can enlighten another person.

336
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:12,079
But we cannot deal with people who are nasty,

337
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:17,954
who are superficial, who are stupid, not meant for that.

338
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:25,995
It is meant for people who are seekers, who are intense:

339
00:28:26,195 --> 00:28:32,537
they are the chosen ones and they are called as ‘seekers’

340
00:28:32,737 --> 00:28:41,662
nowadays. They might be drug addicts, or they might be anything – doesn’t matter.

341
00:28:41,862 --> 00:28:44,453
They have been truly seeking;

342
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:48,870
they have taken something wrong as right

343
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:53,161
or they might have done some mistakes – doesn’t matter.

344
00:28:53,361 --> 00:28:57,411
Everything is forgiven. They will get what they want

345
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,037
because they have been intensely seeking,

346
00:29:00,237 --> 00:29:04,119
truly wanting to be the Spirit.

347
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,119
This is the pure desire of the person that works out –

348
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:15,161
not a person who is just wanting it for the sake of some sort

349
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:21,328
of a selfish or some sort of a power-oriented ideas.

350
00:29:21,528 --> 00:29:27,119
Now the third power one gets is this,

351
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:31,161
that a person becomes absolutely dynamic.

352
00:29:31,361 --> 00:29:38,620
He works very hard in the office time; he can do things

353
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,829
which he has never done before. I know of somebody

354
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:47,537
who has never done anything artistic,

355
00:29:47,737 --> 00:29:51,370
suddenly he started painting. I know another one

356
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,370
who has never known what is poetry

357
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,578
because he’s a chartered accountant;

358
00:29:56,778 --> 00:29:58,703
he has been dealing with money all the time.

359
00:29:58,903 --> 00:30:02,203
Suddenly he started writing poetry,

360
00:30:02,403 --> 00:30:07,870
that too in Urdu language which is such a difficult thing.

361
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:13,286
Such dynamism one develops. Apart from that

362
00:30:13,486 --> 00:30:22,120
you develop a special feeling of oneness with others

363
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:29,370
who are realized souls. Friendship and fraternity

364
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:34,620
are such a rare quality that you have never seen such people,

365
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,370
even those people who go to fight in the war and all that,

366
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:43,286
they don’t have that love and that pure understanding

367
00:30:43,486 --> 00:30:48,870
and pure relationship that you find among the people

368
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:53,578
who are realized souls. There was a girl who had realization

369
00:30:53,778 --> 00:30:56,954
and she went to Sicily; another one was a diplomat,

370
00:30:57,154 --> 00:31:00,370
she had her realization from Rome, she went to Sicily.

371
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:04,037
And they were sitting in two corners of one restaurant

372
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:08,245
and they looked at each other and they felt the vibrations

373
00:31:08,445 --> 00:31:12,037
and one got up from there and she asked her,

374
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:15,079
“Do you feel cool breeze in your hands?” She said,

375
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,912
“Have you got realization from Shri Mataji?” She said,

376
00:31:18,112 --> 00:31:19,328
“Yes, I’ve got it!” and they just hugged each other.

377
00:31:19,528 --> 00:31:21,203
And they were so very happy, they said,

378
00:31:21,403 --> 00:31:23,745
“Mother, such happiness and joy we have never felt with anyone.”

379
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:26,286
Such security, such help. Anywhere in the world you go,

380
00:31:26,486 --> 00:31:28,245
they are with you, your brothers and sisters in purity:

381
00:31:28,445 --> 00:31:30,703
they don’t want anything – without any lust,

382
00:31:30,903 --> 00:31:33,079
without any greed, just feeling of oneness.

383
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,203
You don’t have to pay anything: how can you pay?

384
00:31:35,403 --> 00:31:38,120
It’s ridiculous again that people think that you can pay for everything.

385
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,954
Now, if you have to say sprout a seed,

386
00:31:40,154 --> 00:31:41,870
how much will you pay to the Mother Earth?

387
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,578
How much money will She take for that kind of a thing?

388
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:45,286
This is one thing people don’t understand –

389
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,829
anybody who asks for money,

390
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:48,662
anybody who lives on the money earned in the name of God

391
00:31:48,862 --> 00:31:49,995
cannot be connected with God.

392
00:31:50,195 --> 00:31:56,578
You cannot earn your living in the name of God, you cannot.

393
00:31:56,778 --> 00:32:02,578
Is a simple thing, it’s sinful. Of course, now, they have said,

394
00:32:02,778 --> 00:32:04,245
they have told me that when I travel,

395
00:32:04,445 --> 00:32:08,370
people have to spend money. I mean, I can spend myself,

396
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,245
I, by God’s grace I am alright,

397
00:32:11,445 --> 00:32:13,495
but supposing I was in the condition of Christ,

398
00:32:13,695 --> 00:32:17,203
then people would have paid for this air travel – it’s alright,

399
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:21,411
doesn’t matter, He need not pay for your salvation.

400
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:24,745
Air travel you can pay, it’s all right,

401
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:29,286
but He doesn’t need anything, does He? In the same way,

402
00:32:29,486 --> 00:32:33,829
I don’t need anything. What I need is to see

403
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:36,037
that many people get their realization,

404
00:32:36,237 --> 00:32:38,120
then they become their spirit.

405
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:46,203
By God’s grace it is working out very well in Australia.

406
00:32:46,403 --> 00:32:51,829
Australia surprisingly has worked out so well

407
00:32:52,029 --> 00:32:55,829
and I am sure that these things will work out

408
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:58,578
today also here in Brisbane.

409
00:32:58,778 --> 00:33:01,411
The another good thing about Sahaja Yoga

410
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:05,286
is that you settle down with good marriages.

411
00:33:05,486 --> 00:33:10,453
We have had 71 marriages last year and out of them

412
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:15,328
100% they are successful and they have beautiful children,

413
00:33:15,528 --> 00:33:20,495
very beautiful children, and very sweet lives

414
00:33:20,695 --> 00:33:24,578
they are leading together. It is surprising how,

415
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:29,578
from the muck of that nonsense that was there,

416
00:33:29,778 --> 00:33:34,829
the ideas of destroying the whole humanity,

417
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:39,411
how these beautiful lotuses have come out.

418
00:33:39,611 --> 00:33:45,870
When I see that I forget that there are so many more

419
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:51,995
have to come out of it. It has to work out.

420
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:55,870
There are so many who can receive it

421
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,037
and become the lotus flowers

422
00:33:58,237 --> 00:34:00,954
to make the whole universe fragrant.

423
00:34:01,154 --> 00:34:08,787
It’s a work of few years more I think,

424
00:34:08,987 --> 00:34:15,037
I am sure lots of people will get realization,

425
00:34:15,237 --> 00:34:19,620
but those who do not want, those who are adamant,

426
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:25,662
those who do not want to have the blessings of God,

427
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:33,662
will be judged because this is the Day of Judgment.

428
00:34:33,862 --> 00:34:40,370
I hope today most of you will get your realization.

429
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:43,703
I would like some of you to ask Me questions,

430
00:34:43,903 --> 00:34:45,662
but ask relevant questions

431
00:34:45,862 --> 00:34:48,370
and not just questions to attack Me

432
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:51,870
because I am not come here for an election or anything.

433
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,945
Just simple questions.

434
00:35:03,029 --> 00:35:04,620
Can you get Me some water?

435
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,862
So many speeches, morning to evening!

436
00:35:28,903 --> 00:35:30,737
Yes, please?

437
00:35:47,862 --> 00:35:51,453
Is it possible that those who teach about the spirit

438
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:54,578
differ on different points?

439
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:58,328
In the beginning they do, little bit,

440
00:35:58,528 --> 00:36:01,245
still they are not settled down, you see.

441
00:36:01,445 --> 00:36:03,537
They have to mature in Sahaja Yoga, no doubt,

442
00:36:03,737 --> 00:36:08,203
but in the beginning they do little bit differ but not much.

443
00:36:08,403 --> 00:36:10,495
In the beginning they do little bit sometimes differ,

444
00:36:10,695 --> 00:36:13,662
that I have seen, because one has to mature first of all.

445
00:36:13,862 --> 00:36:16,079
Once they are mature, they don’t.

446
00:36:16,279 --> 00:36:18,954
They are very much in unison with each other.

447
00:36:19,154 --> 00:36:23,154
There’s no difference at all.

448
00:36:42,862 --> 00:36:45,119
Do you have to sit in any special posture

449
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:48,370
when you are doing this or can it be done at any time,

450
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,453
in any way

451
00:36:50,653 --> 00:36:53,787
No. You see in this Sahaja Yoga you become the Spirit,

452
00:36:53,987 --> 00:36:55,829
then you don’t have to meditate much –

453
00:36:56,029 --> 00:36:58,286
about ten minutes or so is sufficient –

454
00:36:58,486 --> 00:37:04,286
and there’s nothing much particular restriction or anything in it,

455
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:06,537
you can sit in any pose you like,

456
00:37:06,737 --> 00:37:09,328
there is no restriction of any kind

457
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:10,995
because you become the Spirit.

458
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:14,578
Only thing is you have to get into thoughtless awareness,

459
00:37:14,778 --> 00:37:17,870
that’s the first state is, which we call as Nirvichara

460
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,703
and for that state to achieve, you see, you have to sit down just

461
00:37:21,903 --> 00:37:24,537
and refuse to take any thoughts in your mind.

462
00:37:24,737 --> 00:37:26,912
Just say, “Not this, not this” so suddenly

463
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:29,578
because your kundalini is there already up there,

464
00:37:29,778 --> 00:37:32,578
so you become thoughtlessly aware.

465
00:37:32,778 --> 00:37:34,870
Once you become thoughtlessly aware,

466
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:38,370
you can stay like that for about five minutes or so –

467
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,662
just that’s all. It’s not much time is needed

468
00:37:41,862 --> 00:37:46,528
because you are in meditation.

469
00:38:01,403 --> 00:38:04,870
He says that from his previous experience he finds

470
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:10,161
that it is not possible to have a moment or so

471
00:38:10,361 --> 00:38:12,328
where there is no thought.

472
00:38:12,528 --> 00:38:16,954
It’s true, you cannot till the kundalini is awakened, you can’t have.

473
00:38:17,154 --> 00:38:21,537
You see, one thought arises and falls,

474
00:38:21,737 --> 00:38:23,662
another thought rises and falls;

475
00:38:23,862 --> 00:38:26,245
there’s a little space in between

476
00:38:26,445 --> 00:38:29,703
which we call in Sanskrit as Vilambha, very little spaces.

477
00:38:29,903 --> 00:38:32,119
Now what happened with kundalini awakening,

478
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:35,037
both these thoughts become elongated

479
00:38:35,237 --> 00:38:37,161
and this Vilambha increases.

480
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:40,079
So you will automatically have that,

481
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:43,403
you won’t have to worry about that.

482
00:38:57,611 --> 00:39:00,161
Is the kundalini awakening good for the children?

483
00:39:00,361 --> 00:39:04,537
Excellent. They are the best. Children are the best –

484
00:39:04,737 --> 00:39:07,411
I mean, they have no complications, you see.

485
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:08,912
We are complicated,

486
00:39:09,112 --> 00:39:10,870
we are on the left side or the right side,

487
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:14,411
we have complications. They are such balanced things,

488
00:39:14,611 --> 00:39:21,079
they are the best. Children are the best – the more the merrier!

489
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:24,119
I told them to bring all the children here

490
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:26,453
and I would have been so happy in their company.

491
00:39:26,653 --> 00:39:33,237
They may be – most of them – may be already born realized, you can’t say.

492
00:39:49,445 --> 00:39:54,495
What is the sensitivity of the children?

493
00:39:54,695 --> 00:40:01,954
If they are sensitive, how would the children be guarded

494
00:40:02,154 --> 00:40:05,203
against being hurt by others?

495
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,328
Oh, they know themselves, they are very clever,

496
00:40:08,528 --> 00:40:10,703
and they are to be told how to take

497
00:40:10,903 --> 00:40:14,745
a guarding thing around their body and all that,

498
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,745
and they do it. They are very sweet,

499
00:40:16,945 --> 00:40:19,370
even little, little things they do with their hands,

500
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:21,954
raising of their kundalini, very sweetly,

501
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:24,787
and they could immediately as soon as they see a horrid man

502
00:40:24,987 --> 00:40:28,119
they just start doing like that, they are very active.

503
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,903
Must say, they are very good.

504
00:40:39,903 --> 00:40:41,245
Would that be teaching them to put a golden light?

505
00:40:41,445 --> 00:40:43,662
Yes, what we call as bandhan,

506
00:40:43,862 --> 00:40:47,453
is means that it’s a kind of a protective thing to your auras.

507
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,411
You see, you put with your own hands

508
00:40:49,611 --> 00:40:51,703
because the vibrations start flowing from your hand,

509
00:40:51,903 --> 00:40:54,328
then you just give it a bandhan,

510
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:57,286
and the children do it immediately, they do it immediately.

511
00:40:57,486 --> 00:41:01,161
They’re very quick. They are tremendous.

512
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:04,119
They are the ones who protect.

513
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,745
One father wanted to have his realization, couldn’t reach,

514
00:41:07,945 --> 00:41:10,703
so he just got so frustrated came on to My Feet,

515
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:13,411
so this fellow came on My Feet

516
00:41:13,611 --> 00:41:16,662
but his child jumped on his back and he started using

517
00:41:16,862 --> 00:41:19,370
a bit of slide to take his kundalini up first.

518
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:22,279
It was so interesting the way children react.

519
00:41:38,737 --> 00:41:42,995
How did You begin this? How were You initiated in this?

520
00:41:43,195 --> 00:41:47,745
I was not initiated; I had this from My very childhood.

521
00:41:47,945 --> 00:41:53,745
You see, I know you would like to know about Me;

522
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:56,537
it’s better first you know yourself,

523
00:41:56,737 --> 00:41:59,486
then you’ll know about Me better. All right?

524
00:42:54,611 --> 00:43:01,662
She’s asked if you would leave the present plane of consciousness

525
00:43:01,862 --> 00:43:04,245
just by getting to the realization.

526
00:43:04,445 --> 00:43:06,453
She said that she has come here to learn

527
00:43:06,653 --> 00:43:10,703
but it shouldn’t happen that you lose your present plane

528
00:43:10,903 --> 00:43:16,161
of consciousness. Is that the question?

529
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:20,620
No, you don’t lose it. No, no, nothing like that.

530
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,495
No, no, nothing like that happens.

531
00:43:23,695 --> 00:43:27,870
Actually what happens that you get a additional,

532
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:31,954
new awareness within yourself. You are very much there,

533
00:43:32,154 --> 00:43:35,079
very much alert, absolutely aware,

534
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:40,119
but you get an additional awareness which is of the Spirit.

535
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,037
You don’t lose anything like that.

536
00:43:43,237 --> 00:43:46,079
Say, now, for example, you have a brother.

537
00:43:46,279 --> 00:43:50,995
Now you have not very good feelings for him, say,

538
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:55,620
for example. When you get your realization,

539
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:01,870
you see that he’s a good boy and you forgive him

540
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:06,995
with your heart and you love him and you forget

541
00:44:07,195 --> 00:44:10,286
that what was wrong with him.

542
00:44:10,486 --> 00:44:14,370
You see the good points about him, because you become absolute.

543
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:21,161
Your judgment differs. You laugh at yourself.

544
00:44:21,361 --> 00:44:27,870
What was wrong with him is no more.

545
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:31,411
I was wrong at that time. You don’t mind accepting that point:

546
00:44:31,611 --> 00:44:34,787
I was wrong, not now, I was.

547
00:44:34,987 --> 00:44:45,495
Another thing is, supposing you have a particular habit

548
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:50,495
and you can’t get over it, it’s impossible. Even if you want to,

549
00:44:50,695 --> 00:44:54,328
you cannot. Now you are so powerful that you don’t look at it.

550
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:59,037
You don’t want to have it any more. You just don’t like it.

551
00:44:59,237 --> 00:45:05,079
I would say this way, that an animal can pass

552
00:45:05,279 --> 00:45:09,161
through a dirty lane, it doesn’t feel the dirt or filth or anything,

553
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:12,037
doesn’t smell anything, but a human being cannot.

554
00:45:12,237 --> 00:45:15,912
In the same way the realized soul doesn’t like anything

555
00:45:16,112 --> 00:45:20,370
that is wrong. It becomes righteous automatically,

556
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:25,578
virtuous automatically, and he’s not asserting that on anyone.

557
00:45:25,778 --> 00:45:30,286
They are virtuous, they are righteous and they live in their own glory.

558
00:45:30,486 --> 00:45:44,079
This is how the awareness takes a beautiful turn.

559
00:45:44,279 --> 00:45:50,695
Anything else, please?

560
00:45:56,237 --> 00:45:57,578
Do You believe in reincarnation?

561
00:45:57,778 --> 00:46:00,912
Yes, of course, there is reincarnation, no doubt about it

562
00:46:01,112 --> 00:46:03,370
and when Christ has said, “I’ll come again”,

563
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,161
that means there is reincarnation.

564
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:12,620
So, but most important thing, what are you, now?

565
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,662
And what you get, now, is the most important.

566
00:46:16,862 --> 00:46:19,286
We shouldn’t worry about what we were in last life –

567
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:21,119
what does it matter?

568
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:27,029
Yes, please?

569
00:46:35,445 --> 00:46:38,079
Is your spirit one with your mental and physical being

570
00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:40,286
or is it separate from it?

571
00:46:40,486 --> 00:46:44,537
It enlightens all that. Now can you say that this light

572
00:46:44,737 --> 00:46:50,203
that is enlightening us, is it one with us or without us?

573
00:46:50,403 --> 00:46:54,995
You see the light is separate, the spirit is separate from us,

574
00:46:55,195 --> 00:47:00,203
no doubt, but it integrates everything. The reason is we see.

575
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:03,870
Now for example you’re sitting in an enlightened way,

576
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:05,912
but supposing you are sitting in the darkness,

577
00:47:06,112 --> 00:47:07,870
you’ll be rushing each other, you would not know

578
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:10,870
how you stand with each other, there’s no integration.

579
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:19,537
So the light on the physical, mental, emotional side

580
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:24,703
of our life is complete and completely integrated.

581
00:47:24,903 --> 00:47:30,319
That’s a good question.

582
00:47:45,945 --> 00:47:47,611
When a person is enlightened,

583
00:47:49,528 --> 00:47:52,995
Of course, of course. When you are enlightened,

584
00:47:53,195 --> 00:47:56,237
you can enlighten another person: that’s the power you get.

585
00:48:03,653 --> 00:48:05,119
How does it happen?

586
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:08,037
It happens because you become that.

587
00:48:08,237 --> 00:48:09,662
Supposing there’s one candle.

588
00:48:09,862 --> 00:48:11,995
Now this candle is not enlightened, all right?

589
00:48:12,195 --> 00:48:14,203
Now I enlighten this, then with this candle

590
00:48:14,403 --> 00:48:20,578
I can enlighten any other candle. So simple as that.

591
00:48:20,778 --> 00:48:29,203
It is so simple. You see, everything that is divine is simple;

592
00:48:29,403 --> 00:48:32,829
everything that is human is complicated.

593
00:48:33,029 --> 00:48:37,279
Take it like that. It’s extremely simple.

594
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:49,495
In your discourse You referred to the kundalini

595
00:48:49,695 --> 00:48:53,037
as ‘She’. Is that because You are a woman?

596
00:48:53,237 --> 00:48:58,703
No, no no; She is the female side, you see.

597
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:01,245
She is the Shakti, She is the female side.

598
00:49:01,445 --> 00:49:06,537
That’s why the quarrel about women and men

599
00:49:06,737 --> 00:49:12,995
is all falsehood. There’s nothing like that; they exist together.

600
00:49:13,195 --> 00:49:15,995
It’s like the moon and the moonlight;

601
00:49:16,195 --> 00:49:19,328
it’s like the sun and the sunlight;

602
00:49:19,528 --> 00:49:22,119
it’s like the God and the Kundalini;

603
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:28,361
it’s like the word and the meaning.

604
00:49:41,486 --> 00:49:44,578
Is it fair to say that the kundalini energy arises

605
00:49:44,778 --> 00:49:48,453
and meets another energy coming from above?

606
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:53,620
Yes, it is all-pervading power, all right now?

607
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:58,119
When the kundalini rises, what she does,

608
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:03,286
she enlightens our subtler side of our nerves, our brain

609
00:50:03,486 --> 00:50:07,829
and everything, she enlightens and by that we start feeling it.

610
00:50:08,029 --> 00:50:10,370
Is the enlightenment that we get

611
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:13,829
because of our connection with the all-pervading power?

612
00:50:14,029 --> 00:50:18,286
It exists, already it exists, but you cannot feel it normally.

613
00:50:18,486 --> 00:50:23,787
When she rises then your nerves are so enlightened

614
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:32,328
that you can feel it. All right? You might be already getting it;

615
00:50:32,528 --> 00:50:36,370
I think so. All right, should we have it now?

616
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:41,778
All right, again, one more question.

617
00:50:51,361 --> 00:50:55,829
I’ve heard that there are stories that it is dangerous

618
00:50:56,029 --> 00:50:59,453
to arouse the kundalini. Why are there such stories?

619
00:50:59,653 --> 00:51:03,912
The stories are because people who were not authorized

620
00:51:04,112 --> 00:51:07,328
have tried to raise the kundalini.

621
00:51:07,528 --> 00:51:12,119
The person who has to raise the kundalini has to be authorized

622
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:17,537
by the Divine. Such a person must have that pure character.

623
00:51:17,737 --> 00:51:23,495
These people just try to raise the kundalini

624
00:51:23,695 --> 00:51:27,119
and the deity of the last chakra,

625
00:51:27,319 --> 00:51:29,995
what they call the chakra of innocence,

626
00:51:30,195 --> 00:51:32,662
is the one which gets annoyed,

627
00:51:32,862 --> 00:51:39,954
and that’s how they get into trouble. As I told you,

628
00:51:40,154 --> 00:51:43,995
this is the chakra looks after …

629
00:51:44,195 --> 00:51:47,995
Those people who are not authorized to do it, or we can say,

630
00:51:48,195 --> 00:51:51,286
in a very gross way one can explain this way,

631
00:51:51,486 --> 00:51:54,328
that a person who does not know about electricity

632
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:57,954
and puts his finger into the plug, he gets a shock.

633
00:51:58,154 --> 00:52:00,286
But it’s much worse than that.

634
00:52:00,486 --> 00:52:04,662
A person who does not have a proper character or a proper life

635
00:52:04,862 --> 00:52:10,328
and tries these tricks gets into trouble.

636
00:52:10,528 --> 00:52:14,120
Not by the kundalini but by the deity

637
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:19,578
which is protecting its chastity.

638
00:52:19,778 --> 00:52:29,411
These stories are there, and naturally such people should,

639
00:52:29,611 --> 00:52:33,620
they give these sensational stories and people like it,

640
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,537
and many people follow them.

641
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:37,703
I mean, it is so dangerous

642
00:52:37,903 --> 00:52:40,829
to be following all those wrong things.

643
00:52:41,029 --> 00:52:46,537
Now, I must have given this kundalini awakening to thousands

644
00:52:46,737 --> 00:52:48,578
and thousands and thousands of people

645
00:52:48,778 --> 00:52:53,119
and nobody had any problem. She’s your mother,

646
00:52:53,319 --> 00:52:57,079
and as your mother has given you your birth,

647
00:52:57,279 --> 00:52:59,120
taking all your pains herself,

648
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,703
She takes up all the pains.

649
00:53:00,903 --> 00:53:02,662
She doesn’t give you any trouble at all.

650
00:53:02,862 --> 00:53:05,328
At the most you might feel a little tingling or something.

651
00:53:05,528 --> 00:53:10,995
Maybe if somebody’s possessed

652
00:53:11,195 --> 00:53:13,870
then he starts a little bit jumping also;

653
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:18,119
if there’s a possessed man, starts a little bit jumping,

654
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:23,495
but so far we didn’t have any funny experiences of that kind.

655
00:53:23,695 --> 00:53:27,954
TM people start jumping –

656
00:53:28,154 --> 00:53:33,119
I’ve seen that, or people from this black magic –

657
00:53:33,319 --> 00:53:36,328
they start jumping before Me.

658
00:53:36,528 --> 00:53:40,745
Also these Rastafarians, they started jumping.

659
00:53:40,945 --> 00:53:44,954
There’s some people who do that way, but they’re all possessed,

660
00:53:45,154 --> 00:53:53,662
they’re not normal people. But they jump for a while;

661
00:53:53,862 --> 00:53:57,319
you can bring them round; it’s not so difficult.

662
00:54:17,653 --> 00:54:22,037
What happens to the Spirit after you die on this earth?

663
00:54:22,237 --> 00:54:27,453
We’ll talk about it later; it’s a very long subject.

664
00:54:27,653 --> 00:54:30,161
You see, the Spirit, when you die,

665
00:54:30,361 --> 00:54:35,537
has different diverse type of existence after we die.

666
00:54:35,737 --> 00:54:38,829
It depends on – if you are a realized soul you are a free bird,

667
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:41,620
do what you like. But if you are not

668
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,829
then you are different categories,

669
00:54:44,029 --> 00:54:48,411
and according to your categories you live and exist,

670
00:54:48,611 --> 00:54:52,161
but I think that’s a very long subject, and some other time

671
00:54:52,361 --> 00:54:55,737
I’ll let you know about it, all right? Yes?

672
00:55:07,653 --> 00:55:12,079
I don’t know why, but I’m so reluctant to be enlightened.

673
00:55:12,279 --> 00:55:16,203
Firstly, you have a liver problem, Sir,

674
00:55:16,403 --> 00:55:21,370
and a lot of heat in the body. If you put your left hand on here

675
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:25,370
the heat will come down – no, no, left hand on the right side,

676
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:28,495
a lot of heat, and the reluctance is there.

677
00:55:28,695 --> 00:55:33,079
The liver is the horrid stuff, you see, that makes all the problems.

678
00:55:33,279 --> 00:55:37,537
Put your right hand like this, and…

679
00:55:37,737 --> 00:55:46,119
Liver makes you think, think, think, think all the time.

680
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:50,279
Anything else?

681
00:56:09,319 --> 00:56:12,286
What makes for suffering and misery in this world

682
00:56:12,486 --> 00:56:14,787
and why do people cheat each other?

683
00:56:14,987 --> 00:56:24,029
(he feels the distress also)

684
00:56:24,737 --> 00:56:29,245
This is good, but you should see this as human beings

685
00:56:29,445 --> 00:56:33,537
treating each other like that, isn’t it? What to do?

686
00:56:33,737 --> 00:56:37,537
That’s the question I ask you. You see, all this stupidity,

687
00:56:37,737 --> 00:56:39,620
why is it there? It is there

688
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:42,203
because they are not the Spirit as yet.

689
00:56:42,403 --> 00:56:48,245
They need transformation; all of them need transformation.

690
00:56:48,445 --> 00:56:50,286
But supposing tomorrow Hitler comes

691
00:56:50,486 --> 00:56:52,411
and asks Me for transformation, I say,

692
00:56:52,611 --> 00:57:04,319
“I’m sorry, next life we’ll see about it”! Yes?

693
00:57:17,403 --> 00:57:25,912
In taking out of the stress from other people, do you get it

694
00:57:26,112 --> 00:57:29,870
on Your body and does it come in as pain to You?

695
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:34,662
No, nothing. I’m not taking out anything, you see.

696
00:57:34,862 --> 00:57:43,995
Just a state of mind which becomes enlightened by the Spirit.

697
00:57:44,195 --> 00:57:48,703
You just become relaxed, that’s all. It’s in your own will.

698
00:57:48,903 --> 00:57:52,037
Supposing, now, this is ‘on’ and this is ‘off’

699
00:57:52,237 --> 00:57:59,537
in the same way, but it is nothing that I have to do about it.

700
00:57:59,737 --> 00:58:02,995
See, it’s within you, just works out within you,

701
00:58:03,195 --> 00:58:05,328
and the kundalini itself, when she rises,

702
00:58:05,528 --> 00:58:10,611
relaxes you automatically. So why will it hurt Me?

703
00:58:14,695 --> 00:58:16,954
She’s asking will it hurt her if she’s taking on the stresses

704
00:58:17,154 --> 00:58:18,411
of other people?

705
00:58:18,611 --> 00:58:23,954
No, no. In the beginning I would say you should not do that

706
00:58:24,154 --> 00:58:25,537
because in the beginning you don’t know

707
00:58:25,737 --> 00:58:28,453
how to do it properly, but after you are mature

708
00:58:28,653 --> 00:58:32,370
nothing can happen. You see, like something,

709
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:35,870
which is not matured, can take the imprints,

710
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:39,829
but once it is matured it is perfectly all right.

711
00:58:40,029 --> 00:58:41,787
First you have to mature yourself.

712
00:58:41,987 --> 00:58:45,070
Takes about a month to mature yourself, then it’s all right.

713
00:58:57,361 --> 00:59:00,954
Why did the stressed person become that?

714
00:59:01,154 --> 00:59:03,245
Is it because of the charkas being blocked?

715
00:59:03,445 --> 00:59:08,203
Yes, very much, very much. Blocked or imbalanced,

716
00:59:08,403 --> 00:59:11,912
specially imbalance. Imbalance is very much,

717
00:59:12,112 --> 00:59:14,745
because the chakras are like this supposing, all right?

718
00:59:14,945 --> 00:59:16,662
Now, you push it too much this side,

719
00:59:16,862 --> 00:59:20,703
there’s an imbalance and this chakra’s become blocked here.

720
00:59:20,903 --> 00:59:23,787
Now this could be on the left side or the right side;

721
00:59:23,987 --> 00:59:27,361
any side it can work out. This is due to imbalances.

722
01:00:05,528 --> 01:00:11,037
I have search for the material and a search for the spiritual,

723
01:00:11,237 --> 01:00:14,203
but while I am young should I use it for the search

724
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:17,119
for the material or the search for the spiritual?

725
01:00:17,319 --> 01:00:20,578
If you get the Spirit you get the material automatically.

726
01:00:20,778 --> 01:00:28,870
The whole material is controlled by the Spirit.

727
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:33,870
It’s very surprising how you get it.

728
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:36,829
You enter into the realm of God.

729
01:00:37,029 --> 01:00:42,995
You’ll be amazed that in England there’s such a lot

730
01:00:43,195 --> 01:00:58,161
of joblessness – people don’t have jobs at all – unemployment;

731
01:00:58,361 --> 01:01:06,079
but not a single Sahaj Yogi is unemployed,

732
01:01:06,279 --> 01:01:09,453
not a single Sahaj Yogi is unemployed.

733
01:01:09,653 --> 01:01:12,703
The other day one gentleman was to come

734
01:01:12,903 --> 01:01:21,119
from Paris to Australia for a particular seminar,

735
01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:23,245
and he thought it was – he wanted to come

736
01:01:23,445 --> 01:01:25,537
because this is the other side of the world and all that,

737
01:01:25,737 --> 01:01:28,286
but quite excited, but he didn’t have money,

738
01:01:28,486 --> 01:01:32,037
and suddenly he got the money

739
01:01:32,237 --> 01:01:36,411
which he was to get for eight years.

740
01:01:36,611 --> 01:01:40,119
Suddenly he got the money and he’s here.

741
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:44,829
All such miracles work out.

742
01:01:45,029 --> 01:01:47,453
From Australia I’ll tell you one miracle, it’s most interesting.

743
01:01:47,653 --> 01:01:50,245
There was a little girl, she wrote a letter to Me “Mother,

744
01:01:50,445 --> 01:01:52,495
I want to come and see You in India,

745
01:01:52,695 --> 01:01:57,119
but I don’t have so much money to come.”

746
01:01:57,319 --> 01:01:59,453
She and her mother, they both wanted to come.

747
01:01:59,653 --> 01:02:03,286
They had a fete in the school,

748
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:06,620
and she had taken a trinket for selling,

749
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:09,411
and when the teacher saw, she said,

750
01:02:09,611 --> 01:02:14,662
“This is gold, gold, yes, better take it to your mother.”

751
01:02:14,862 --> 01:02:18,787
And when they went to the jeweler,  the amount was the same

752
01:02:18,987 --> 01:02:22,328
as they would need to go to India.

753
01:02:22,528 --> 01:02:25,829
So, in so many ways you are helped.

754
01:02:26,029 --> 01:02:31,453
You don’t know the realm of God; is very different, so efficient.

755
01:02:31,653 --> 01:02:37,528
Works so fast. We haven’t entered into that realm.

756
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:13,411
These – You’ve talked about the imbalances or blockages

757
01:03:13,611 --> 01:03:16,119
in the chakras. How do we become aware of them

758
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:18,787
and how do we correct them?

759
01:03:18,987 --> 01:03:21,995
That’s what you have to learn; it’s very simple.

760
01:03:22,195 --> 01:03:24,495
You see, once you get your realization

761
01:03:24,695 --> 01:03:28,079
you’ll have to come to our centers and we’ll tell you how to do it.

762
01:03:28,279 --> 01:03:30,829
It’s very simple. There are a few methods

763
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:32,995
by which you can just clear them out.

764
01:03:33,195 --> 01:03:35,620
But you have to come to our center, you see.

765
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:38,245
You have to respect your self realization

766
01:03:38,445 --> 01:03:41,662
and you have to little bit pay attention to it,

767
01:03:41,862 --> 01:03:50,411
because people, you see, to them is like buying Coca Cola in a bar shop –

768
01:03:50,611 --> 01:03:53,703
is not realization.

769
01:03:53,903 --> 01:03:57,537
It’s the epitome of your evolution, is the highest thing

770
01:03:57,737 --> 01:04:01,161
and has to be respected that way.

771
01:04:01,361 --> 01:04:05,119
They come to my lectures all right,

772
01:04:05,319 --> 01:04:08,870
but they don’t try to work out their realization.

773
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:11,662
You have to work it out and you have to become masters.

774
01:04:11,862 --> 01:04:14,245
You have to become your own gurus.

775
01:04:14,445 --> 01:04:25,653
All of you can. One more?

776
01:04:40,903 --> 01:04:43,829
When talking about realization,

777
01:04:44,029 --> 01:04:47,745
is it that when you get it you keep it or can you lose it,

778
01:04:47,945 --> 01:04:52,411
or just glimpses of it?

779
01:04:52,611 --> 01:04:56,620
No, you see, the thing is, if you have realization

780
01:04:56,820 --> 01:05:01,119
you have to look after it, nourish it, and develop it.

781
01:05:01,319 --> 01:05:04,578
Just like a little plant, you see.

782
01:05:04,778 --> 01:05:08,161
When you have a little plant you have to develop it.

783
01:05:08,361 --> 01:05:12,453
Once it becomes a tree, then many come for the shelter

784
01:05:12,653 --> 01:05:15,578
under that tree, isn’t it? In the same way

785
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:18,495
you have to look after it. It may not diminish,

786
01:05:18,695 --> 01:05:20,912
but it won’t have much effect

787
01:05:21,112 --> 01:05:24,119
and it will always be in a dangerous position.

788
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:30,203
The thing is to make it absolutely matured.

789
01:05:30,403 --> 01:05:35,995
It hardly takes any time, any effort, any money.

790
01:05:36,195 --> 01:05:41,279
One has to know how to do it.

791
01:05:52,029 --> 01:05:55,370
Why have the churches not told us about this?

792
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:59,870
That was not the time, Sir. Imagine,

793
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:04,662
Christ lived for only three and a half years, in the sense that,

794
01:06:04,862 --> 01:06:09,954
for His spiritual undertakings, He was allowed only for three

795
01:06:10,154 --> 01:06:14,829
and a half years to live like that. Churches do not know it,

796
01:06:15,029 --> 01:06:18,745
but even Christ…. Imagine, for four years

797
01:06:18,945 --> 01:06:25,620
I was struggling with seven English boys and girls

798
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:28,912
to give them realization.

799
01:06:29,112 --> 01:06:31,662
He did quite a good job, I must say,

800
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:34,829
still, but that was not the time.

801
01:06:35,029 --> 01:06:39,411
Christ actually came on this chakra – is the Agnya Chakra.

802
01:06:39,611 --> 01:06:43,578
That was His time, to show the way of resurrection;

803
01:06:43,778 --> 01:06:47,119
that was His life, and that’s what He’s done,

804
01:06:47,319 --> 01:06:54,245
but the churches have missed the point. Churches have missed the point,

805
01:06:54,445 --> 01:06:56,286
and they will go on missing the point.

806
01:06:56,486 --> 01:07:03,787
Their main interest is how to make money. Is not good.

807
01:07:03,987 --> 01:07:07,737
Or how to convert people – is not good.

808
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:14,286
Are there a lot of holy people in the church?

809
01:07:14,486 --> 01:07:18,203
There could be many people who are very simple,

810
01:07:18,403 --> 01:07:21,079
who believe in Christ, who go to churches

811
01:07:21,279 --> 01:07:23,829
because they believe that they’ll be saved.

812
01:07:24,029 --> 01:07:27,161
All of them will be saved, no doubt.

813
01:07:27,361 --> 01:07:28,995
They’re very simple people;

814
01:07:29,195 --> 01:07:34,703
they give such a lot of money to the church and they give such dedication to the church,

815
01:07:34,903 --> 01:07:37,370
even though they are wrongly placed.

816
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:39,912
But they will be saved, no doubt about it.

817
01:07:40,112 --> 01:07:44,870
They all have to be saved. But there are people

818
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:47,120
who are just making money out of churches,

819
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:50,995
trying to make an organization out of it.

820
01:07:51,195 --> 01:07:52,954
They are trying to convert people,

821
01:07:53,154 --> 01:07:54,995
trying to make a political end out of it;

822
01:07:55,195 --> 01:08:01,578
then such a thing won’t work out. That’s not proper.

823
01:08:01,778 --> 01:08:05,495
Churches should only deliver the goods

824
01:08:05,695 --> 01:08:11,037
of giving realization to people, that’s what a church is for.

825
01:08:11,237 --> 01:08:18,495
They will learn, I’m sure; they will have to become.

826
01:08:18,695 --> 01:08:20,620
Some of them will have to become,

827
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:25,119
but if they are money oriented I just don’t know.

828
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:29,787
They are more interested in the kings and prime ministers,

829
01:08:29,987 --> 01:08:33,662
princesses and all that. I just don’t understand.

830
01:08:33,862 --> 01:08:37,570
They have nothing to do with God.

831
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:08,578
Why is there a need for judgment

832
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:12,328
when some people make progress and some don’t progress,

833
01:09:12,528 --> 01:09:16,370
and why do others judge them?

834
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:24,195
Why is there a need for a time of judgment?

835
01:09:26,154 --> 01:09:30,787
It has to be some time, my child, for judgment,

836
01:09:30,987 --> 01:09:32,578
and this is a particular time,

837
01:09:32,778 --> 01:09:35,870
because is what we call the worst time

838
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:39,954
because the Man is so much in confusion.

839
01:09:40,154 --> 01:09:44,203
The most difficult time for human beings

840
01:09:44,403 --> 01:09:49,453
to exist is modern times, what we call as the Kali Yuga,

841
01:09:49,653 --> 01:09:53,119
and this was the time when it had to happen,

842
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:59,161
otherwise man won’t take to God seriously, perhaps, maybe.

843
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:04,703
Maybe our forefathers didn’t have this stress and strain,

844
01:10:04,903 --> 01:10:07,620
and they didn’t want to relax or think of God.

845
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:10,995
They were quite happy with their agricultural work

846
01:10:11,195 --> 01:10:14,411
that they were doing, but now it is really we have reached

847
01:10:14,611 --> 01:10:34,662
to that point. Everything has to come to its boiling point,

848
01:10:34,862 --> 01:10:42,662
and now this is the time for the world to get its results,

849
01:10:42,862 --> 01:10:46,778
either this way or that way.

850
01:11:09,528 --> 01:11:12,370
Why is there a time of judgment now,

851
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:16,787
because if there is reincarnation they will keep going back

852
01:11:16,987 --> 01:11:20,703
and coming until there is a change?

853
01:11:20,903 --> 01:11:26,453
I’ve already told you that this is the time

854
01:11:26,653 --> 01:11:30,495
when the people are most confused

855
01:11:30,695 --> 01:11:34,495
and they have to take a decision.

856
01:11:34,695 --> 01:11:41,119
That’s why this is the judgment time.

857
01:11:41,319 --> 01:11:47,662

01:11:47,862 --> 01:11:59,445

859
01:12:06,486 --> 01:12:10,361
Heaven is within us.
