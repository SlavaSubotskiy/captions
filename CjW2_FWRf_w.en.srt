1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,420
Mataji: So, [everyone UNCLEAR?] a nice weekend?

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,620
Yogis: Thank you Mother.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,680
Mataji: [UNCLEAR]

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,680
I wish you could send your thanks to [UNCLEAR]

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,580
Mataji: Hello [UNCLEAR], how are you?

6
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,740
Hello [UNCLEAR], how are you?

7
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,660
Mataji: Now, are you all right? Now, are you all right?

8
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,160
Mataji: [UNCLEAR] everyone understands?

9
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,260
Mataji: I am sorry, I have to go [by this one UNCLEAR]

10
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,420
You have to go by which one?

11
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,880
Mataji: He has to drive his own car.

12
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,520
Maatji: All right, bye bye.

13
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,320
Mataji: God bless you all.

14
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,740
Angry people very much. they are being very kind to us.

15
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
Yogi:Here comes mother

16
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,220
Mataji: Let's go there where the water is flowing.

17
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,960
Mataji: This is the source of Thames river.

18
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,340
Be careful.

19
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,820
[UNCLEAR] start going [UNCLEAR]

20
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,480
That's written on the

21
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,400
Mataji: That's [UNCLEAR] inside there, you see?

22
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,479
Yogi: [UNCLEAR] father Thames, [UNCLEAR] seven [UNCLEAR]

23
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,880
Yogi: Then they call father

24
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,260
Mataji: What's the meaning of [UNCLEAR]?

25
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,560
Yogi: It's used to be [UNCLEAR]

26
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,560
Yogi: It's used to be [UNCLEAR]

27
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,120
But still the Isis or anyone [UNCLEAR] Oxford, they still call it the [UNCLEAR].

28
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,540
Yogi: The Oxford or the [UNCLEAR] call it Isis, that is [UNCLEAR] the baby's name [UNCLEAR].

29
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,700
Mataji: It has started.

30
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Mataji: [UNCLEAR] water you never get it [UNCLEAR]

31
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,320
Mataji: There is nothing.

32
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,100
They will never get into [UNCLEAR]

33
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,300
Surprisingly.

34
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,240
Yogi: We take, we should take off all of our shoes.

35
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,680
Mataji: Keep your feet there.

36
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,100
Mataji: It is rising. It has to rise.

37
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,060
Maatji: All these things will go away [UNCLEAR]

38
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,360
Yogi: Bolo Shri Ganga Mata Shri Nirmala Devi ki Jay!

39
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:02,100
Mataji: See the cool breeze coming, are you feeling the cool breeze now?

40
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,100
Mataji: [UNCLEAR] She is happy, no body has respected her [UNCLEAR]

41
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,280
Yogi: Now, we will respect.

42
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,260
Mataji: Cool Breeze is coming.

43
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,020
Yogi: Robert, how many people are there here?

44
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,780
Mataji: All of you have a meaning, after all.

45
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,060
[UNCLEAR]

46
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,580
Mataji: [UNCLEAR] power

47
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,680
Mataji: [UNCLEAR] in sahaja yoga

48
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,480
Mataji: It has started, quite a bit.

49
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,980
Mataji: Of course, of course.

50
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,700
Mataji: [Take away your UNCLEAR] badhas and everything.

51
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,800
Mataji: Wash your hands at least.

52
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,040
Mataji: 35 crore devatas are there.

53
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,700
Yogi: What does that mean?

54
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,540
Yogi: 35 times 10 million devatas in the universe.

55
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,980
Mataji: 35 crore, I crore is equals to 10 million.

56
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,140
That's an impossibility

57
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:09,420
Mataji: 33. Yogi: But some say 35. It is in the Devi Bhagawat. It is 35.

58
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,820
Mataji: Peace has settled down.

59
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,360
Yogi:

60
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,729
It is a holy place.

61
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,349
Small girl.

62
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,129
Take her down. Take her down carefully because she might touch she should not touch.

63
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,520
Little baby.

64
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,240
Thames river comes from this river.

65
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,900
Mataji: This is where the Thames river originates. There are 7 places where water is coming from. Go and see.

66
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,460
Baby: No, I have already seen it.

67
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,560
Mataji: Go and put your feet in it and come, its very cold.

68
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,420
Mataji: Can somebody carry her in the lap?

69
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,780
Mataji: It is a very holy place. Just somebody should take her down.

70
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:21,899
I think Alan can do it.

71
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:27,779
Alan just take her down, let her, put in the water.

72
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,480
Yogi: She was there. Mataji: She was there?

73
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,640
Yogi: We counted 36, Mataji: She has to go, you didn't count her.

74
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:06,039
Very cool, very soothing all left is waking up

75
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,180
Water

76
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:23,240
I think they went to tourist attractions.

77
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:28,040
Mataji: I see there are the tourist [UNCLEAR] but this is the deity [UNCLEAR]

78
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:37,260
Mataji: They should come, you see they should understand the meaning.

79
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,660
Mataji: Now, I have become an actress or what?

80
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,200
Yogi: You are the movie stars of movie stars Mother.

81
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
Yogi: You move the Stars Mother.

82
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Mataji: Just look after her, she should not put on the [UNCLEAR].

83
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,560
Yogi: They are watching her Mother.

84
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,329
There was that thing on the wall, someone said

85
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,380
Yes, letters, inscriptions.

86
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:00,389
What.? [UNCLEAR] inscriptions.

87
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:07,620
[UNCLEAR]

88
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:17,810
Oh father Thames this your

89
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,550
7

90
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:31,520
Nik? yeah.

91
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,899
Take the stone of mother you took it with you did you?

92
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:50,680
Yogi: I just wanted to find if you can see the seven sources

93
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,899
Yogi: Did Mother stand on this one here?

94
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,320
Yogi: This one here.

95
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,180
Just get one

96
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,280
Mataji: [UNCLEAR]Just can't see the water flowing or anything? Yogi: No Mother.

97
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,740
[UNCLEAR] in the building [UNCLEAR]

98
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,160
Mataji: What sort of an arrangement they have?

99
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,460
Mataji: We can't see anything there?

100
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,320
Yogi: [UNCLEAR] the building there [UNCLEAR]

101
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,840
Mataji: It's a tap there?

102
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,700
Yogi: But they actually have to electrically pump it up the ground.

103
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,900
Mataji: It's nice here, you see.

104
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,500
Mataji: Very meditative, the vibrations are coming.

105
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,160
Mataji: It's [sulphur?] that is [clouding?] the water, it will never [UNCLEAR]

106
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,340
Mataji: The vibrations are [UNCLEAR]

107
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:47,540
Yogi: Mother, this was the hall we wanted to have a meeting one time. Mataji: We are going to have? Yogi: We were going to have this one time. Mataji: When?

108
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:50,160
Yogi: The meeting you had last night. This is the one we wanted.

109
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,080
Mataji: Next time.[UNCLEAR]

110
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,220
Mataji:  [UNCLEAR] that's what they do.

111
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,020
Yogi: It does the same effect on the brain cells.

112
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,760
Mataji; Just [UNCLEAR]

113
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,180
Mataji: The worst thing that I have [UNCLEAR] is that

114
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:59,600
Mataji: those who are [UNCLEAR] feel they are wise but then they come to Sahaja yoga and think they are [UNCLEAR]

115
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,340
Maaji: This is the thing I [UNCLEAR], isn't it?

116
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,260
Mataji: How can you [UNCLEAR] that you [work for sahaja yoga UNCLEAR?]

117
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,020
I just don't understand that [those who are settled? UNCLEAR]

118
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,780
Not you Robert, so many others.

119
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,680
Not you, you are not like that.

120
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,180
But must be some reason.

121
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,180
 

122
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,320
I asked a sahaja yogi [UNCLEAR]

123
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:48,880
I said, "What how were you so much  [subjugated? UNCLEAR], you should have asked questions. He said no, they say that this is to kill your ego.

124
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,160
Yogi: So you have to go out of the mind?

125
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,640
Mataji: I mean they are very frank and honest.

126
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,900
Mataji:  [Even if ?UNCLEAR] you are out of your mind.

127
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,680
They do not understand the world.

128
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,780
[UNCLEAR] means hell.

129
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:37,160
Yogi:  The entrance of the center where I went, you know, [UNCLEAR] They put, "Please take off your shoes and your mind." Leave your shoes and mind outside the door.

130
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:46,040
See that means, they want to say that we don't send the mind.

131
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,780
But that is what they would like to say,  [UNCLEAR]

132
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,740
They are trying to  [UNCLEAR] us

133
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,680
[UNCLEAR] that you transcend the mind beyond mind.

134
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,980
They say that you keep your mind outside.

135
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,280
Mataji: People are very attached to shoes so

136
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,980
it will make them nervous when they take out their shoes.

137
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,560
Keep them outside.

138
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,760
There is a saying in Marathi.

139
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:36,200
means, you get into the temple and all your attention is on your shoes which is outside.

140
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,680
In India it is very common if you lose them.

141
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:49,000
When they go to a temple, they buy something, which is absolutely useless, which they want to get rid of.

142
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,420
Because in the temple,  [UNCLEAR] it is stolen.

143
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,800
Or they replace their  [UNCLEAR]

144
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,440
These are the ones we are getting  [UNCLEAR]?

145
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:31,900
Mataji: It should have been a very good  [UNCLEAR]

146
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,320
How far is Bristol from here?

147
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:11,260
Yogi: Mother they wondered why we were all sitting here

148
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,980
Mataji: So what did you say?

149
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,920
Yogi: I said we were just waiting to see the water

150
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:18,430
Just waiting to see the water.

151
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:19,040
Mataji: What did they say?

152
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,040
Yogi: They said, "That's all right."

153
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,980
They didn't say that if it's going to be ready they're trying

154
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:38,120
Yogi: We could hear the pump going that's all. Could you can you just check because the pump is actually there's thumping away?

155
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,640
Mataji: Make a bandhan maybe.

156
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,340
What's that?

157
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,620
Yogi: That's where the water is actually [coming from?]

158
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:59,860
Mataji: On top?

159
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:15,140
They used to be, in 1830 they used to come  [UNCLEAR]  with handles they used to pump it  [UNCLEAR]

160
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,400
Yogi: But now it's  [UNCLEAR] electrical.

161
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:24,020
Yogi: [UNCLEAR] didn't come up? There's nothing to see honestly?

162
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:44,300
That  [UNCLEAR] was just taken from the tap, not from the top. There's a little tap there you just took it from the tap so

163
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,000
Mataji: It must be also  [UNCLEAR]

164
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,520
[UNCLEAR] sulphur?

165
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,080
I see,  [UNCLEAR] salt.

166
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,280
That thing you get is  [UNCLEAR] salt?

167
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,240
It's like that.

168
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,080
Mataji: In 10 minutes, we leave.

169
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:00,380
Mataji: Go record the water.

170
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,620
Yogi: Mother was telling

171
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:42,340
[UNCLEAR] is good for  [UNCLEAR], anybody who has

172
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,480
got a  [UNCLEAR] , left nabhi, problem.

173
00:59:52,780 --> 01:00:00,920
Mataji: Yello colour, is  [UNCLEAR] good for liver that is [sleepy?]

174
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:03,340
Like carrot could be very good also.

175
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:09,520
And all that white colour is vitamin A.

176
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,520
 

177
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:21,440
Because calcium , calcium is white in colour. Sulphur is yellowish.

178
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:30,640
[UNCLEAR] but calcium is also   [UNCLEAR]

179
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,340
[UNCLEAR] people who are having a cold.

180
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:40,420
specially for children, you have got allergies and if you give them calcium,

181
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,040
[calcium is not good?]

182
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:56,740
You see we have got a liver which is over active and the one which is absolutely active.

183
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,480
The one which is overactive is [UNCLEAR] too much  [UNCLEAR] too much

184
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:05,140
And those who have inactive one are the one who are  [UNCLEAR]

185
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:09,860
[UNCLEAR] or sort of  [UNCLEAR] develop allergies, more on the left hand side.

186
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,960
So those who have allergies, should take to sulphur,  [this is good for them ?UNCLEAR]

187
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:21,220
And for the right-sided people better to take cooler things. [UNCLEAR]

188
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:25,700
Like you can say, sugar, sugar is very cooling, sugar is a coolant.

189
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:40,660
Yogi: Mother, people who are anxious and have too much nerves problem, they take these yellow plant, marigold type.

190
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:43,240
And make tea out of it, fresh from the plant.

191
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:46,820
I tried that in  [UNCLEAR], two or three times.

192
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:51,080
And also it has an effect in the liver.

193
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:04,220
Mataji: Nervous people are mostly the people who are left sided.

194
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,200
Mataji: That could be very good.

195
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:21,360
Yogi: Also also jasmine tea helps.

196
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,160
Mataji: Jasmine tea is very good.

197
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,660
Yogi: It's yellowish too.

198
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:02,680
Mataji: Ganges river, you see, go anywhere, wherever river Ganges goes

199
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,940
you will never find these dirty things.

200
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:11,300
Yogi:  [UNCLEAR] river Ganga comes from the snow.

201
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:15,700
and it goes past many flowers and herbs in the meantime.

202
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:20,480
Yogi: And it also picks up all sort of elements and it mixes in the Ganges.

203
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,800
Mataji: Its  [UNCLEAR] in the Sahashrara of Shiva.

204
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:42,100
Yogi: Yes Mother, we are going to have a havana there,  and the people to come [UNCLEAR] the jewish ego.

205
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,960
We have some plans Mother.

206
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:52,280
Like saying Jewish hyms,  singing and also the Lord's prayer to confuse them and Mataji's mantra.
