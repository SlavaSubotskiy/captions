00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
Happy Diwali to All the Sahaja Yogis

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:17,880
From Mataji Nirmala Devi, Your Mother.

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,160
27th of October 1981

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:30,400
Happy Diwali, Mother.

5
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,040
He is very happy.

6
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,720
Datta, what's happening to you?

7
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,640
Very happy.

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
All the joy.

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,920
All are catching here, are they?

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,640
Left Vishuddhi?

11
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,880
All right, take it.

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,680
Now, should we...? Have they come?

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,880
Warwick Road?

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,200
Gayle, Gayle is not there and we have to wait for Gavin also.

15
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,720
Gayle has not come as yet?

16
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,440
She is here. She's just gone out.

17
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,720
All right, she is here.

18
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,960
So, she must have told Warwick Road people.

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,800
Mother, Jeremy is working, Mother.

20
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,360
And he is in Cambridge.

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
Who is?

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,080
Jeremy is working.

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,320
Working where?

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,600
He's at work tonight.

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,600
All right.

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,080
He lives in Cambridge. So then Chhaya ...

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,040
Come along. Hello. How is Magda?

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,440
Sheâ€™s come?

29
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,220
Coming, yes.

30
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,720
All right, good, good.

31
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,200
May God bless you. You are all looking so nice.

32
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,880
Thank You, Mother.

33
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,960
Both of you, really looking very nice.

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,960
Not very cold outside, is it?

35
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
No.

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,960
Since I have come, I think the temperature has come up.

37
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,280
Yes, exactly, isn't it?

38
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,120
It was very cold, was that?

39
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,040
Yes, it was.

40
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,040
Actually, when we were coming by plane only, they announced

41
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,320
it's three degrees.

42
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,120
And then I've seen the temperature suddenly rose after that.

43
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,640
Now you have to start walking.

44
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
All right?

45
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
Come along.

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,400
This one is also very happy.

47
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,800
All right?

48
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,640
Very happy.

49
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,120
Linda, take him back.

50
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,560
As a... Where has she gone?

51
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,600
She's not here.

52
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,640
All right, then let her come. Let her come then.

53
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,640
So how are you, all of you?

54
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,200
Happy, Magda?

55
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,400
Very happy to be here, Mother.

56
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,120
America was difficult.

57
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,960
Not so simple, I knew that.

58
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,440
But we've done it, I mean

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,960
we've got centers everywhere now, in New York,

60
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,920
we've got centers in,

61
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,800
what's that place, is

62
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Santa Cruz,

63
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,560
then one, maybe in Santa Monica we might get one

64
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,080
and one in Los Angeles,

65
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,760
one in,

66
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,280
maybe Vancouver,

67
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,640
I don't know, if we are about to have it, one there.

68
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
Like that.

69
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,800
The only place we didn't go was San Francisco.

70
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,960
What a nice sari!

71
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
Looking so nice.

72
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,360
This is the, all the spring colours are there in the sari.

73
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,960
You see, what you should do is to stitch it up for her

74
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,160
so that it is easier for her to wear like a lehenga.

75
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,960
And you will also have a sari, will you?

76
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,760
You want to have a sari, also?

77
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,720
Ha, Nicki?

78
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,120
I'll get you one small sari, all right?

79
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,640
And then you can wear it like this, like her.

80
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
No?

81
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,040
You feel shy?

82
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,800
Did she go to Maria?

83
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,640
Yes, she's happy.

84
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,200
Is she quite happy with Maria?

85
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:48,960
Yes.

86
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,960
Maria has a problem, a little bit.

87
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,840
What about Pat and all these people? Are they not back from work?

88
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,320
Grace is coming.

89
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,280
Grace?

90
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,240
Grace will be coming here.

91
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,800
Coming.

92
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,440
And Houston of course, Houston was such a big success.

93
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,840
For the first meeting there were forty-five people.

94
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
I mean, the repeat.

95
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,840
After My coming so,

96
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,680
already there are forty-five working.

97
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Santa Cruz we had lots of people.

98
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,960
Next time I think we'll do much better,

99
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,920
because I met a man who was very, very

100
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,040
influential person, extremely influential.

101
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,880
He knows all the Congress men, this thing, that thing,

102
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,200
and he's an Indian.

103
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,880
They said if this man does something,

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,200
then something will happen.

105
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,160
We went and met him and he was very nice

106
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,920
and he said that, "You should have come

107
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,960
earlier and You should have let me know

108
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,800
of the complete program and then I would have put You

109
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,640
on all the medias and everything, I'll work it out."

110
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,680
He said that, "Next time when You come, give me

111
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,040
at least a month or two months notice and I'll

112
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,920
put You up."  Because to go to these

113
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,240
medias there, it's very difficult

114
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,560
and you have to pay a lot of money just to get into it.

115
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,560
Hello, Pat! How are you?

116
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,880
Hi, Mother. How lovely to see You.

117
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
What about David?

118
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,560
Is he not coming?

119
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,680
I think, I don't know. David, he stays here?

120
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,880
Yes, Mother.

121
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,960
Are you, are you recording?

122
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,960
Keep it for a while, then do it.

123
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,560
So anybody who is trying to come?

124
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,760
Are there any plans?

125
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
In England?

126
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Not yet known.

127
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,960
Annie from France will come in India.

128
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,240
France people are different, but from England, those who are coming.

129
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,120
What do you think, Nick? Why don't you come?

130
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,240
If I can go, yes.

131
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,880
Nick, you should, I think.

132
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,320
It will be a good idea.

133
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,200
Will be good idea for you.

134
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,680
What about you, Cathy? All right.

135
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,840
Marcus, what do you think?

136
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,240
I've been for certain years.

137
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,200
You should try,

138
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,960
it would be a good idea.

139
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,560
All left-sided people.

140
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,680
It's a good idea.

141
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,400
What do you think about? Felicity?

142
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,120
Where is she?

143
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,880
I'd like to be there.

144
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,280
You have no money?

145
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,400
Well, I'm working. You see, I

146
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,880
it's just when I start teaching again.

147
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,960
So, you won't be able to take leave?

148
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,800
Maybe for Australia, Mother, but ...

149
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,440
Australia but not India.

150
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,080
You can go to Australia?

151
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,120
Yes, that might be my future holiday.

152
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,040
It's difficult taking time off work, because we get holidays.

153
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,720
If you are going to Australia will be no change to you.

154
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,960
I mean, India is the place where one should go.

155
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,680
Australia is another Western country.

156
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,400
I'll ask. I'd like to come, Mother.

157
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
Try.

158
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,120
Especially when you go to those villages, it is very

159
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,880
pure land, you know.

160
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
People are very pure there.

161
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,320
Isn't it, don't you think so, it helps a lot?

162
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,640
Very simple people and meeting them, you see,

163
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,400
many problems can get solved.

164
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,760
And what about you?

165
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,200
I might go to India.

166
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,240
You try, at least.

167
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,400
I wanted Christine to come.

168
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,560
She requires it very much.

169
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,600
Maybe Kate might come.

170
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,960
Patricia, what about you?

171
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,320
I want to come.

172
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,960
I think you better do it, once again.

173
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,840
Kay is coming as well, Mother.

174
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,280
Kay will be coming, I know.

175
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,160
Mother, I think ...

176
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Who's there?

177
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,320
I think Bernard said he wanted to come and, if he's serious about.

178
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Bernard,

179
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,080
from the hotel said he wanted to go to India.

180
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,820
Is it?

181
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,960
Yes, Mother.

182
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,880
So, get all their names.

183
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,080
What about you?

184
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,840
Me?

185
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,080
I'd love to, Mother, but how am I going to [fund] it though?

186
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,360
Yeah, I mean all those who can manage.

187
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,840
You should experience after all.

188
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,960
You see, the atmosphere and everything...

189
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,560
You know, people are so sensitive there.

190
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,000
Simple people living with simple lives,

191
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,920
not complicated, they donâ€™t think so much,

192
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,920
and their style is very

193
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,960
slow-paced and you have to keep pace with them.

194
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,320
So, you bring down... Neesha has run away.

195
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,200
Last time we were there only for three days,

196
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,720
where they didn't want you to stay there.

197
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
We ran out.

198
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,360
Kharus was a good place we went to.

199
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,960
But this time we'll have another route,

200
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,680
some other places we can go to.

201
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,320
Raulbai has gone to Baroda

202
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,760
and she wants you all to go to Baroda also.

203
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,360
Instead of going by plane, why don't you all go by train

204
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,360
from Bombay to Delhi?

205
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,160
So you can do many other places on the way.

206
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,280
You can go to Baroda, you can go to...

207
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,160
Ahmedabad or something.

208
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,760
It's always good, because you leave your vibrations

209
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,080
in all these places.

210
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,960
You can also go by bus if you want to.

211
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,720
You can have two buses hired.

212
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
It will take about...

213
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,400
I think two days to go to Delhi, two days.

214
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,560
Two or three days, at the most.

215
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,400
But, I mean, you'll vibrate the whole place,

216
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,280
you'll go around, it would be good idea.

217
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,840
Good, good, very good, very good, very good.

218
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,160
She knows how far...

219
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,400
She's treating everybody's Agnya and Sahastrara.

220
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
No?

221
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Good.

222
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
No?

223
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,160
And she takes out like that also, you know, like this...

224
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,040
That's how they do it.

225
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,560
Even Olympia does that, you must have noticed, like this.

226
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,960
Chhaya has not come, Regis and all these people either.

227
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,960
I hope they know, they have to come.

228
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,960
They're coming, Mother. They come back from [UNCLEAR].

229
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
All right.

230
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,840
I think I have said we can have again a little,

231
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,120
what you call a feed-back.

232
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,720
Mother, if we could have a big public meeting

233
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,240
and get...

234
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
How are you?

235
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,960
How are you? What?

236
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,240
How are you?

237
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,960
Do you want tea?

238
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
It's very hot.

239
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,160
Otherwise it was out. You take this.

240
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Little bit.

241
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,920
What language is that?

242
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,840
Divine language?

243
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,440
You don't want this?

244
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,840
This is what you want? All right.

245
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
What is it?

246
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
It's hot.

247
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
How will she eat?

248
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,920
She likes channa only, you know?

249
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,400
All realized...

250
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,680
But this channa is hot...

251
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,960
Have you got another channa?

252
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,280
How are you?

253
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
How is going on?

254
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,560
Brother's marriage?

255
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,920
20-th December.

256
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,000
Means December?

257
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,240
December.

258
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,600
So you will go?

259
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,600
And he? Douglas, are you coming?

260
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,160
I'm afraid not, I'm not able to.

261
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,400
However, I'd like Devyani to go.

262
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,800
Now is sitting in my lap.

263
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,160
I have to give that to Aradhana.

264
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,040
She has been inquiring about Olympia, about Orio,

265
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,640
and everyone she has been inquiring.

266
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,080
We have lots of photographs.

267
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,040
Peter have brought some photographs...

268
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,960
Have you got some?

269
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,680
Yes, about fifteen of them.

270
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,640
So how are you doing now?

271
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
How is Pat?

272
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
Very well, Mother.

273
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,960
Have you come? All right, come along, sit down.

274
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,200
Linda, you can give him.

275
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,280
I do not want him to to eat all that. Little bit.

276
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,680
They make a powder out of it, among Greek people,

277
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,680
they do it, you see, and make some sort of a chutney.

278
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,240
They make a powder and

279
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,840
paste and they eat it with that.

280
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,960
Hello. How are you?

281
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,880
Very well, thank you.

282
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,760
You've come from Brighton?

283
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,380
Yes, Mother.

284
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,920
What about others?

285
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,160
Pamela, is she coming?

286
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,120
We have a meeting in Brighton, this evening, Mother.

287
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,160
We have a meeting in Brighton this evening.

288
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,920
Should we start now?

289
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
But today

290
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,920
I want to tell you about

291
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,800
the celebration

292
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,400
of this night

293
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,960
called as Lakshmi Puja.

294
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,960
It is the day

295
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,240
when they worship

296
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Lakshmi.

297
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,320
So, one has to understand

298
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
that

299
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,760
Lakshmi represents the power

300
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,240
by which we evolve.

301
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,640
Is the power by we are redeemed,

302
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
redeeming power;

303
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,280
by which we improve

304
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
from

305
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
baser self

306
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
to higher.

307
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
To begin with,

308
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,720
you see, is the Lakshmi form.

309
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,080
First is the Lakshmi.

310
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,320
Now, this Lakshmi

311
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
came out of

312
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,840
the great churning

313
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,720
called as Amrutmanthan,

314
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,320
for which I'll give you another lecture some other time.

315
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,560
But

316
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
this

317
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,880
Lakshmi that came out of

318
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,960
the churning

319
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
represents

320
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,320
our seeking into our own well-being.

321
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
So, first of all,

322
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,400
we have basic

323
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,240
seekings, like food.

324
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,880
In the animal stage we seek food.

325
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,760
And, with that seeking only,

326
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
we developed

327
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,080
into

328
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,720
sometimes very cunning animals, sometimes very ferocious animals

329
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,360
and sometimes very timid animals.

330
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,800
Because they could not find food,

331
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,120
so they had to hide and slay animals.

332
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
So the food

333
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,560
was the beginning, I should say,

334
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,440
of this Lakshmi tattwa.

335
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
But

336
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,120
when She becomes actually

337
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,320
the Lakshmi, then

338
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,200
She has a form

339
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,960
that suggests that the Spirit of Lakshmi

340
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
is

341
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,960
for the total well-being of human beings, total well-being.

342
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,960
Now, totality is different from

343
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,880
partly, because in evolution, you see, you grow partly,

344
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,360
till you reach a stage where you really achieve your

345
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,880
total well-being.

346
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,360
And now, you know that, without realization

347
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,080
your well-being has no meaning.

348
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,680
So, She has

349
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,640
arisen out of the sea,

350
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,080
so She is

351
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,400
Miriam, you can call Her. She is Marie,

352
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,600
She is Marie. That's why Christ's Mother's name was Mary

353
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,800
because She came out of the sea.

354
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,560
People, I don't know if they think about it, why She was called

355
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,800
Mary, of all the things. Why this name, Mary?

356
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,800
Now, this

357
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,280
power which came out of the sea,

358
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
because

359
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,720
the whole thing, the seeking started in the sea, first of all,

360
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,960
as you know. It had to be in the sea, because

361
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,000
first animals were born in the sea only.

362
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,080
Becomes, when She comes out of the sea,

363
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
becomes

364
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,040
a Raja Lakshmi

365
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,760
and a Gruha Lakshmi.

366
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,000
Raja Lakshmi is the One

367
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,320
where collectively

368
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,840
collectively you enjoy your well-being.

369
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,680
Collectively.

370
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,840
On the right hand side you can say.

371
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,600
Like, we have

372
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,920
some places which are for public usage, here,

373
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,880
public well-being.

374
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,280
And Gruha Lakshmi is the one which is for the individual,

375
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,320
individual well-being.

376
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,320
So we have the essence of Lakshmi

377
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,720
and then we have,

378
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,960
when we evolved

379
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,000
we started having our homes, houses,

380
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,620
our own family, our own private life, our these things.

381
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,440
So we had,

382
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,240
Gruha Lakshmi.

383
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,320
And then they started having collective,

384
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,560
like we can say, the queen represents here Raja Lakshmi.

385
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,120
A queen represents

386
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,880
here a Raja Lakshmi of England.

387
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,200
She is a symbol of that.

388
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,560
Our queen here is the symbol of that Raja Lakshmi.

389
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,960
You know the word "raja" means

390
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,560
the kingdom or you can say the

391
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,280
the royal,

392
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,600
royal kind of the reality.

393
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,600
So when the Lakshmi is a regal Lakshmi, She is for collectivity.

394
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,120
So the queen doesn't

395
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,320
live for herself, she lives for

396
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,960
all the collective being.

397
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,440
In the same way, the Raja Lakshmi

398
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,120
is the One that is for all of us.

399
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
For example this place we got here,

400
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,760
it's through the blessings of Raja Lakshmi.

401
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,120
She gave us this place.

402
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,400
Her power gave us this place to live,

403
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,840
because you are all Sahaja Yogis,

404
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,280
you are the epitome of evolution,

405
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,880
you are the highest people in the evolution,

406
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,960
you are the ones who are looked after by God,

407
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,840
you are the most important people.

408
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,160
It's true.

409
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,960
And you know She provided for you.

410
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,160
You should have no problem of money, you should have no problem

411
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,640
of housing, you should have no problem of anything.

412
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,320
So it is She, the Raja Lakshmi, who gives you all that.

413
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,080
Then you have your wife,

414
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,960
as Gruha Lakshmi.

415
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,800
So we have to have a wife as Gruha Lakshmi.

416
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,160
These two things one should understand very, very clearly

417
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,920
because we confuse them.

418
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,640
Wife is a Gruha Lakshmi, is the one, she is the Goddess

419
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,440
of the household.

420
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,600
Now she has to be the Goddess also.

421
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,400
I mean she just doesn't become Goddess

422
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,960
just by becoming. You have to become again.

423
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,120
You have to become the Goddess.

424
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,720
And the Goddess

425
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,640
of the Gruha Lakshmi

426
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,720
is, we can say,

427
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,360
that the deity of the gruha, of the house,

428
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,880
is the Gruha Lakshmi.

429
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,200
Now this deity must become one with the housewife.

430
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,760
Then the blessings

431
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,360
of the Lakshmi

432
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,680
essence, is of well-being comes to you.

433
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,760
If she is not the Goddess, you'll always suffer.

434
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,280
You'll always have problems.

435
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,880
You'll always have

436
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,440
all kinds of untold miseries.

437
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,320
It is Her blessings which brings you solace,

438
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,160
peace and redemption - redemption is the word - of anything.

439
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,080
So that's why the left Nabhi is very important

440
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,880
as you know, and that is always bad in the present.

441
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,640
So I would say that the whole society is responsible

442
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,000
for spoiling that,

443
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,160
because housewife is not respected

444
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,560
first of all. We should blame our society.

445
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,800
Our housewives are not respected.

446
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,400
Housewife, the one who is a dedicated wife, even

447
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
is placed higher than yatis.

448
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,440
Yatis are the highest evolved,

449
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,040
you can say, avdutas are the highest evolved

450
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,960
seers,

451
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,280
and a dedicated wife

452
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,800
has got more powers

453
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,400
than even a yati - it is said so.

454
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,440
And even Krishna was

455
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,000
little worried about them.

456
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,560
Everybody had to worry.

457
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,960
So the dedicated wife, you see,

458
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,960
the Gruha Lakshmi, is such an important thing,

459
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,960
because she is the essence

460
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,680
of this well-being, which is peace.

461
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,760
I think I have so far never talked to you about peace.

462
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,960
And peace is only achieved through the Gruha Lakshmi,

463
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,960
through your proper

464
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,840
adjustment of your spleen I should say.

465
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,440
Because spleen is the giver

466
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,160
of the

467
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,120
blood cells. All right?

468
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,360
It creates the nutrition for the whole body.

469
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,000
If there is no peace

470
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,960
in that area within us,

471
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,960
the whole

472
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,200
system can go out because that's the nourishing

473
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,440
center  within us, that's the nourishing center.

474
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,000
And that center which nourishes also peace,

475
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,160
it is the peace. You must have heard this:

476
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,720
"Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Shanti rupena saonsthita".

477
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,680
The Goddess that is the Shanti

478
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,800
which is present in every human being as peace.

479
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,720
So this peace is only possible if the housewives

480
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,440
realize their importance,

481
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,320
bear it upon of themselves, are forgiving

482
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,800
and are redeeming

483
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,800
the family life. They have to redeem the family life.

484
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,280
And where this gets spoiled the whole system goes out.

485
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,960
See, America, I went

486
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,320
and I found all of them have got left Nabhi.

487
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,600
All right. And they are very violent.

488
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,880
Very violent, extremely violent.

489
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,040
And what I felt that in the beginning,

490
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,400
the society neglected the housewives,

491
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,880
the institution of housewife which is a Goddess.

492
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,960
And now the women cannot forgive them.

493
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,080
Because the women cannot forgive them, you see, it has become a big

494
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,800
struggle there.

495
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,840
The children have become violent.

496
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,560
I mean if the housewives are not all right

497
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,920
there will be always violence.

498
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,960
I'll give you the example in India.

499
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,720
We have in the north and the south

500
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,640
two types of systems

501
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,960
because in the north the muslims ruled and they had

502
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,720
the system of keeping the women in the purdah system and all those

503
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,600
and lot of prostitution and all those ideas came

504
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,160
through those horrible nawabs who ruled in the north.

505
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,440
In the south it was the other way round,

506
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,560
because they kept to the dharma and all those things

507
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,440
and they wouldn't accept this kind of a

508
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,320
nonsensical ideas. They looked after their women.

509
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,440
Even the people of the north sometimes say

510
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,720
that the, I mean the south people are very

511
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,960
sort of henpecked or whatever it is,  say Maharashtra downward.

512
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,120
Now, because of that,

513
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,960
there is so much of difference in the law and order system

514
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,960
in that same country.

515
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,280
For example in Maharashtra if you are going by bus in the night

516
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,680
anytime, two o'clock you have seen,

517
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,080
nobody plunders you,

518
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,840
nobody is bothered, the bus is going through.

519
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,000
You can live here, stay here, nobody steals anything.

520
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,560
The servants in Maharashtra

521
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,800
are so good, they'll never touch your things.

522
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
I mean you can leave the keys with them.

523
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,920
They will do all your house up and they will

524
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,440
never touch anything, your money, anything they cannot touch,

525
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,760
they will never touch.

526
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,960
Same about any funds or anything like,

527
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,400
we can say our

528
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,800
Sahaja Yoga funds, never a problem in Maharashtra.

529
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,760
Say puja funds and all that,

530
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,280
all these things they understand.

531
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
But the main thing is

532
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,960
the housewife in Maharashtra is an important thing, very important.

533
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,800
So in the house she is the,

534
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,640
she is the lady. And the lord is outside.

535
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,560
Whatever she says, goes.

536
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,640
But when it is the other way round, everything goes upside down.

537
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,000
It can never be blissful.

538
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,720
But that doesn't mean that

539
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,240
the woman should also say outside as well as inside.

540
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,880
I mean the woman should not interfere

541
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,680
with the husband's work in the office, should not dominate there.

542
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,280
Like so many these women, like Chang Kai-Shek's wife did

543
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,960
and all these people did. That's not necessary.

544
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,080
She should be a support.

545
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,800
But in the house

546
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,960
she is the one who should be respected.

547
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,280
She must be respected in the household,

548
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,080
otherwise there cannot be auspiciousness,

549
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,840
there cannot be peace.

550
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,960
And peace is the gift

551
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,720
of Gruha Lakshmi.

552
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,400
Now some people may say, "Oh, it's all right,

553
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,120
they are not having a good time, the wife is bad,

554
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,200
but she's got money."  Money it's not Lakshmi.

555
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,640
This confusion must be absolutely removed from your mind.

556
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,600
And last time I explained to you what Lakshmi is.

557
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,160
But you can go through again that tape, if you want to.

558
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,040
But I'll tell you for short,

559
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,280
that Lakshmi has got four hands.

560
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,440
And She stands on a lotus.

561
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,200
And She is a body with a, which is

562
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,680
I mean, not a slim type of a body,

563
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,280
but She has a substantial body, but She stands on a lotus.

564
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,720
Means wherever She lives, you see,

565
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,880
She doesn't show Her presence

566
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,800
by staying. She is so,

567
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,960
so beautiful that She adjusts Herself even on a lotus.

568
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,320
She doesn't exert Her weight.

569
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,120
Like, cheap women do, anywhere they go, they'll say,

570
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,440
"Oh, I don't like this and I like that

571
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,320
and I would like to have this and

572
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,040
I would like to sleep in a place like this and

573
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,120
I, I like this type of thing."

574
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,280
So the first quality of a woman who is a Lakshmi is adjustability.

575
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,960
See, no one feels her when she is there

576
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,960
nobody feels. Only thing they can feel her fragrance like a lotus.

577
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,280
I mean that's the sign of a woman who adjusts herself.

578
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,320
She is not bothered about her own life

579
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,800
but she's bothered about others.

580
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,920
Now we had a very funny incident.

581
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,400
We had a lady from Germany.

582
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,960
And I told them that

583
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,080
it's better that the girls should wait

584
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,960
till the boys have their food, look after them,

585
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,960
and then the girls can have their food, you see.

586
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,400
It's better. And she felt insulted.

587
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,120
On the contrary it is invariably done in India. Invariably.

588
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,240
That the woman will always wait

589
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
till the husband finishes the food,

590
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,600
because she can look after him better.

591
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,880
I mean it's a privilege.

592
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,760
It's more matured

593
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,760
that you can look after your husband,

594
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,000
that you can look after your children.

595
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,320
It's your job, you are responsible for it.

596
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,640
You are the lady of the house, you are supposed to do it.

597
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,840
Like Seema told Me that

598
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,960
here nobody asks you for food or anything.

599
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,120
Everybody is eating, whatever they want to eat

600
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,960
they go and eat anytime, they want, they will eat anytime.

601
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,280
They go on eating and eating and eating.

602
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,680
Nobody asks that you come and have food or anything.

603
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,080
That's done in India.

604
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,200
So she said, "I waited for a day, nobody asked me.

605
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,680
Then I said I better take something for myself."

606
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,760
So the ladies have to take up upon themselves

607
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,400
that they invite people, ask them to eat

608
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,160
and cook for them special things.

609
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,080
You see this is the job of a woman.

610
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,680
She has to develop these qualities,

611
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,600
the womanly qualities, of feeding

612
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,600
men, looking after them when they come to their house.

613
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,200
She should not make faces

614
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,320
and try to show, "This is my private house.

615
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,800
Nobody come in the house."

616
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,320
She should be the one who

617
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,040
should welcome more than the husband should. She should be.

618
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,680
She should be the one whom people should feel closer to

619
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,840
like the brothers and sisters of the husband,

620
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,720
or relations. She should be the one who should give that

621
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,640
feeling of security, of peace and of

622
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,560
welcoming the guests. It is her job. Then she becomes the Lakshmi.

623
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,400
So the well-being is not only that you have money.

624
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,960
So what happens with Her, the well-being part of it?

625
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,160
That She has in one hand,

626
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,560
the hand is like this,

627
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,840
that means that with one hand it should flow.

628
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,240
Generous - it should go.

629
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,400
She must give, She must give, She must give.

630
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,320
And She should not demand at all.

631
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,320
Others should say that you must have this.

632
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,960
An example I'll say, that for the last, I think,

633
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,240
four years C.P. is trying to buy one faultless ring for Me.

634
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,640
Because I gave away all My diamonds to My daughter.

635
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,440
Try it, try it - cannot do it. Just try, just try - neutralize it.

636
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,880
"No, not this time, next time, this time, that time". I'm just...

637
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,280
Because you see, I know he wants to buy that position for Me.

638
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,640
Isn't it? So I'm postponing it,

639
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,600
"It's all right, we'll do it. Now [money] used to have a house",

640
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,960
and this and that. Like that.

641
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,600
So the demanding you see, that "Give Me this" - there's no need.

642
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,760
Let, let the men start seeing that, "Oh, she doesn't have this.

643
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,800
She should have this."

644
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,960
It is they who should do it and the woman should never demand.

645
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,920
It's a sign of bad manners actually, according to Sahaja Yoga.

646
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,200
You should never demand for anything.

647
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,800
You should have forbearing, you should be able to

648
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,560
bear it, not with a sort of a big martyrdom,

649
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,560
"Oh, I'm bearing up" and all that. No.

650
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,880
But with the understanding that you are grown up and you are

651
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,960
matured, you are supposed to bear it up.

652
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,200
Now the responsibility on men also is there,

653
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,040
that when she is giving, they should allow her to give, you see.

654
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,840
But I find it's the other way round, where

655
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,720
is that the women are not so generous as the men are.

656
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,160
It's the other way round, you see.

657
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,440
Women are, you see - if they find somebody has come to their house

658
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,320
they will secretly go and cook something and pass it on,

659
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,960
they let the husband not see.

660
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,400
They feel that satisfaction of Annapurna,

661
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,320
you see, the feeding.

662
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,560
That feeling of feeding your own child,

663
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,680
of feeding somebody else who has come you see,

664
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,160
from the back door they just pass on something which husband don't see.

665
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,080
Very sweet it is, very sweet it is.

666
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,560
It is something they, I think they are

667
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,960
brought up that way or they inculcated.

668
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,760
So it's such a nice thing that you can feed someone.

669
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,640
Or, if somebody is coming, then they know what that person eats,

670
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,880
so they'll cook it very sweetly and keep it.

671
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,080
And then when the person comes in, they'll

672
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,560
put forward that, "This should be given".

673
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,800
So the man has to hide his money,

674
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,600
because the wife will be giving away.

675
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,960
It's the other way round.

676
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,720
But when the woman starts becoming selfish and self-centered,

677
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,680
and worried about money and all that,

678
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,640
then it's a wrong thing. She should not be

679
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,000
extravagant about herself,

680
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,960
like going to

681
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,760
some place, buying something expensive for yourself

682
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,160
then going somewhere buying something expensive for yourself.

683
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,760
But doing for your husband, doing for your children,

684
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,040
doing for others, and automatically they do for you.

685
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,120
They are anxious to do it.

686
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,880
Just start thinking on those lines.

687
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,720
But now for men, they must also understand

688
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,640
that they have to have that due.

689
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,440
You see, this ego oriented society is very tilted one.

690
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,960
If you just say, "All right, do what you please.

691
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,680
You have this money, you spend this money",

692
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,200
then the men, you see, they can

693
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,880
just take it for granted, ego-oriented, you see.

694
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,920
They can just take you for granted and say, "All right.

695
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,360
Then don't give her anything."

696
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,960
So when the mutual understanding is not there,

697
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,640
when there is an imbalance, then these things come up.

698
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,720
But in Sahaja Yoga we should understand.

699
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,720
You have to look after your wife, her needs, everything,

700
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,920
you have to give her due respect.

701
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,440
You are never to insult her in the presence of others.

702
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,880
It's absolutely forbidden.

703
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,160
But the women also

704
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,120
should know how to respect their husbands, not to be provocative,

705
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,680
and use all their cunning against their husband.

706
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,240
You see, I've seen people sit down and plan out

707
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,200
how they will insult their husband, in what way.

708
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,320
This is absolutely, you have to love your husband,

709
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,240
you have to really love him and forgive him like

710
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,600
you would forgive your own child, in the same way.

711
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,040
But the husband also, it's a very mutual thing.

712
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,960
I cannot just tell something to the women and not to the men.

713
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,400
It's absolutely essential, that men must respect their women

714
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,720
as goddess.

715
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,360
As goddess. But women have to behave like goddesses.

716
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,560
If they behave like street women

717
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,840
then a competition starts, the man behaves like a

718
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,960
street man and the woman behaves like a street woman.

719
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,960
Then they behave like Soho people, then they behave like that.

720
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,840
I mean it goes on, competition.

721
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,720
But if you have to synthesize it, to bring to the balance,

722
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,920
then both of you must decide

723
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,760
that you can only enjoy

724
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,960
if you have proper balance system among yourselves.

725
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,040
One person goes one way, another person goes that way.

726
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,280
There's no end to it.

727
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,760
Thereâ€™s no end to it and the

728
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,320
chariot will never move forward, you see.

729
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,400
Both the wheels have to be balanced,

730
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,120
realizing that,

731
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,680
without this wheel the another cannot exist,

732
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,160
so this is as important as the other.

733
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,040
But they will say that, "I'm important."

734
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,880
No, she is important, if I have to exist.

735
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,960
Or she has to say,

736
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,400
"He is important because I have to exist".

737
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,000
It's such a mutual thing, so the,

738
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,800
to get the Gruha Lakshmi point I must say that

739
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,960
the woman should behave like a Gruha Lakshmi, with her dignity.

740
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,440
I mean it is really indignified even to ask them to. Why?

741
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,040
What is to ask? It's your all own, your own,

742
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,960
whenever you want to get married.

743
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,760
Try to develop that theory within you.

744
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,240
And the men respect their women as, really as,

745
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,080
Gruha Lakshmis.

746
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,800
It's very good, respect them, look after them,

747
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,840
and know that the deities, once they are identified

748
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,200
with your wife, you'll have no problems.

749
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,280
Now, on the other hand, She has one hand of protection,

750
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,800
that the Lakshmi gives protection.

751
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,760
Always gives protection to everyone.

752
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,680
Even against the husband, even against the husband She protects.

753
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,640
Say, for example, I'll say my own sister-in-law

754
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,680
was such a Lakshmi like that, we had.

755
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,720
My own sister-in-law was like that.

756
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,320
And, if I was bothered - was little,

757
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,360
because they were much older than us, you see, was hard on us -

758
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,720
so she use to come out,

759
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,200
with the protection. She said, "No, how can you say that to them?"

760
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,960
So sweet she was, you can't imagine.

761
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,840
And then the brother, I mean, my own brother,

762
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,880
you see, she would say that, "No, you can't do this to your sister."

763
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,960
Same thing with Me, my own sister-in-law

764
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,280
was more attached to Me than to My husband for the same reason,

765
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,280
because I would always protect her against even the husband.

766
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,080
Though he is her brother.

767
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,800
I mean naturally they are very close to each other, naturally.

768
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,440
But you should protect their interest

769
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,960
to that extent, than protect yourself only.

770
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,120
Protect those who come to your house - that is her duty.

771
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,920
If she does it, she can do it very well. Now,

772
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,960
I'll give you one of the examples

773
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,080
in My own lifetime. I was in Delhi,

774
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,560
and that time this trouble had started of,

775
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,680
what you call, this

776
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,720
partition and many

777
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,400
people ran here helter-skelter. And

778
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,040
once I was just sitting outside my father's house, I was knitting,

779
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,560
because Kalpana was to be born and I was sitting outside.

780
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,040
And a lady came to Me and she said,

781
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,120
"We are refugees, we have no place to go to."

782
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,160
And, "Will you be able to give Me some place in your house?"

783
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,960
I said, "All right." It was a huge house of My father.

784
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,320
I said, "It's such a big house,

785
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,760
and we have a room to get outside which you can use

786
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,000
and also you can have a kitchen there and a bathroom, we can set."

787
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,280
She said to me, "We have a friend and my husband.

788
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,280
Can we stay here?" I said, "All right."

789
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,760
So we arranged for them to stay there.

790
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,080
And it so happened that

791
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,600
people

792
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,280
in My family didn't like it very much.

793
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,640
Specially My brother, you see, My husband told him that

794
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,960
"I don't like

795
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,960
this lady to be here. God knows what sort of a lady she is," and

796
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,160
My brother said, "Now, if she has said it,

797
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,000
if my sister has said it, I can't say anything,

798
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,240
cause She's the one who has to decide about this house.

799
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,720
So it is her, her job to decide, so I can't say anything."

800
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,840
So, they all kept quiet about it and they stayed over.

801
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,760
And this man, her friend,

802
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,080
her husband's friend, was a Muslim.

803
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,320
And there was a big riot

804
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,320
in Delhi, very big riot.

805
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,920
And so many Hindus, you see, like these

806
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,320
Jan Sanghis and fundamentalists, they had formed a

807
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,400
horrible group which was killing many Muslims also.

808
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,880
So from the servants and all that they must have known

809
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,720
that there's a Muslim staying in this house.

810
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,160
So they came to My house, about five, six of them with

811
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,680
clubs and this and that.

812
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,320
So they, these people got frightened. So I told this Muslim,

813
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,120
I said, "You go and hide in My room. I'll go and face them."

814
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,680
I went outside.

815
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,960
So they said, "We have heard there's a Muslim in your house."

816
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,200
I said, "No, there isn't."

817
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,080
Because that's not their right to know.

818
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,680
I said, "There isn't any Muslim in this house."

819
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,240
They said,

820
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,840
"We'll have to

821
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,360
go and search." I said, "You cannot.

822
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,640
If you have to go, you have to kill Me and then go".

823
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,960
And now they saw My big tikka and all that.

824
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,920
"You cannot get inside the house. If you have to go, I'll stand here.

825
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,920
You cannot go in My house at all. You cannot enter."

826
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,160
And they left. They knew there was a Muslim

827
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,920
otherwise I would not protest so much.

828
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,160
But because I was protecting they could not enter, so they just went away.

829
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,200
And the fellow was saved.

830
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,960
Then this lady became a very big, well-known actress

831
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,960
in India and she did lots of things. I mean

832
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,320
that, I mean the whole thing then changed her.

833
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,960
But what I am saying, that

834
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,760
a housewife has to protect.

835
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,960
The Lakshmi has to protect, the man who has money must protect.

836
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,920
See, they must have people in his ashraya, means, in his protection,

837
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,960
like servants you can have,

838
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,120
servant's family. Some people treat their servants very badly

839
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,960
and they are very, very, very

840
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,280
they ill-treat and

841
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,960
that's not the way a Gruha Lakshmi is to be.

842
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,320
Or, anybody, say some students are staying in the house,

843
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,680
or some children are staying, some say,

844
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,960
you have some people in the house like lodgers you can say, or

845
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,960
Sahaja Yogis now, staying say

846
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,840
with people who are to be looked after, with women,

847
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,080
they have to protect, always,

848
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,960
from others - that is the job of a Lakshmi.

849
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,280
The mother has to protect her children.

850
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,960
Whatever may be wrong with the children, but

851
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,040
she has to protect her children against all the rest of the people.

852
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,800
Of course, not in wrong things. I mean she should not tell,

853
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,360
I mean, always I have to tell the other side of it because

854
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,840
you might say that, "My child has gone and beaten somebody else."

855
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,160
So that's not good, that is not protection.

856
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,320
What I am saying, if the children are

857
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,840
under any peril or any trouble,

858
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,960
it is the Lakshmi who has to protect.

859
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,560
This is the job of the Gruha Lakshmi.

860
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,800
Right side is the Raja Lakshmi.

861
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,280
The Raja Lakshmi

862
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,960
is the, we can say, the queen of a place.

863
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,320
Now, here the queen and king is one.

864
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,400
But, what I am saying,

865
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,280
where the king and the queen are too different,

866
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,080
then the queen of the thing has to have that dignity.

867
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,720
Thank God our queen is quite a Raja Lakshmi, I must say.

868
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,800
I'm very happy with her.

869
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,000
She has that dignity and she has that sense and

870
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,360
she is a sweet lady and she is really a good person.

871
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,840
Thank God you have a good lady and

872
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,800
Diana also is another realized soul who is coming now,

873
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,680
will be another blessing for you.

874
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,680
So it is her well-being, you see,

875
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,800
her, I should say, the essence of well-being

876
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:04,600
permeates that peace, that happiness and that good thing.

877
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,320
If supposing a man is a president is there

878
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,960
and his wife is a very funny woman, like this

879
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,320
Kennedy's wife was, there can never be peace,

880
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
neither in the society, nor

881
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,160
because wherever she'll go she'll create a problem.

882
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,880
You see, sheâ€™ll go to a society,

883
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,400
she being the First Lady, everybody will try to follow her.

884
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,880
You see here also, you know that when

885
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,960
Queen Elizabeth had some sort of a problem on her neck,

886
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,920
she had some sort of a patch or something,

887
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,720
so she started using a collar.

888
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,240
And everybody had that Elizabethian collar,

889
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,280
all these things, like

890
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,960
whatever

891
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,360
problems, say, Victoria had, and she made a dress,

892
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,400
others had to wear the same types of dress. So,

893
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,320
all the collective patterns and fashions and all those things

894
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,240
come through this First Lady.

895
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,680
So the First Lady is the Raja Lakshmi.

896
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,960
And one has to respect

897
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,600
that Raja Lakshmi, as the woman who is a queen.

898
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,880
Now for example this country is already cursed

899
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,840
because seven queens were

900
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,360
killed in this country, I mean already cursed, I must say.

901
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,080
It's a horrible thing,

902
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,120
I mean, how did people allow any one king to be

903
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,120
doing that. Seven of them, it's too much.

904
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,720
Is already a curse here.

905
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,400
So this kind of a thing is, we can go to a point with these things:

906
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,280
at the most you can arrest, or at the most I mean if ...

907
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,840
I mean, these are not, of course, good women,

908
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,360
I was telling you about those who are like that.

909
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,600
For example Mao's wife,

910
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,040
whom they thought was not so good and all that.

911
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,200
But one should not humiliate,

912
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,640
because if you humiliate then, then you are humiliating

913
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,960
that principle of Raja Lakshmi.

914
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,440
And then to put them to imprisonment,

915
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,440
and to kill them like this and wash their dirty linens on the street,

916
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,120
means there is no dignity at all about it, you see.

917
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,960
So we have to keep the dignity, the serenity of a Raja Lakshmi,

918
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,400
and that Raja Lakshmi is very important for England.

919
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,960
Because we are missing in Raja Lakshmi nowadays.

920
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,360
And that Raja Lakshmi comes through the activity of the people.

921
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,240
And if you are inactive, Raja Lakshmi will go down.

922
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,440
So we come to the point that we have to be active.

923
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,280
We have to be active producing more wealth.

924
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,280
You see, not like taking out the wealth from here

925
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,080
putting to something else, but we should produce more wealth.

926
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,400
How do you produce more wealth? You should see that.

927
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,080
By changing form, by anything.

928
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,840
We should get to it that we should produce more wealth.

929
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,120
For example if Sahaja Yogis think that,

930
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,200
"All right, I am not going to work and I am going to sit at home and

931
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:51,040
I'm just going to be a, sort of a dishwasher,"

932
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,080
that's not the way.

933
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,960
Sahaja Yogis have not only to work,

934
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,560
but to work according to their deserving.

935
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,960
Apart from that, they should improve.

936
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,280
Like

937
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,960
you see somebody, "Oh, I'm all right, I can paint a little bit,

938
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,320
but if it comes to something, better painting,

939
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,240
then I think I'll have to get somebody else."

940
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,840
That means at least you don't know even painting.

941
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,760
You have to, in activity, you must know that you must perfect

942
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,240
as profession.

943
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,320
All the Sahaja Yogis must have a profession. You just perfect it.

944
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,440
It's not like this that, "I am, I'm just a waster.

945
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,840
All right, accepted the situation, I'm a waster,

946
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:38,720
sitting like a waster, and doing no activity."

947
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,160
Only, then the problems, like the ones we had, come up,

948
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,640
that you start earning money out of women or do sort of

949
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,400
useless things like

950
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,320
swindling and telling stories, taking out money.

951
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,880
So wasters are not allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

952
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,960
Anybody who tries to be a waster will be thrown out.

953
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,000
Never justify your

954
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,800
inefficiency, inadequacy, or incompetence.

955
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,560
You have to be first class competent people,

956
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,720
in every respect.

957
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,360
There should be no diffidence in you.

958
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,320
If there is diffidence, you are no good for Sahaja Yoga.

959
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,200
So, not that you should get after the money, but Raja Lakshmi,

960
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,320
means there should be complete activity

961
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,240
of your complete manifestation of all your qualities.

962
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,080
Try to improve it, try to improve.

963
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,240
That doesn't mean you run a rat race,

964
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,360
like a madcap, nothing of Sahaja Yoga, not that.

965
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,040
It doesn't mean that. I have to warn you there.

966
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,680
But you should not be just a waster, you see, that you don't have two

967
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,640
pounds here and you go on, like a beggar you are moving about.

968
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,960
This is not proper.

969
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,960
Try to improve your condition, try to improve your technique.

970
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,800
Try to improve your competence and understanding

971
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,720
of the whole subject, whatever you take up, take up this or that.

972
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,800
Get it to it and work it out, sort it out.

973
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,240
You should be called... you can do it with Sahaja Yoga.

974
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,640
This is one of the big problems we have of Sahaja Yogis,

975
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,440
do you know that?

976
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,040
One of the biggest problems.

977
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,560
Because nobody is impressed by you.

978
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,880
Nobody is impressed.

979
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,640
They think some loonies have gathered around Me.

980
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,280
Nobody is impressed.

981
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,200
Everybody looks like a confused personality,

982
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,440
you see, walking like this.

983
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,440
They think that Mother must have mesmerized them,

984
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,320
and they are all moving like a wave to this and that.

985
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,560
So today, on a Diwali day,

986
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,960
we have to say that, "We'll become more competent, expert

987
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,600
in whatever we are doing. We have to do it.

988
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,960
We have to be people with impression."

989
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,960
Now, what impresses people,

990
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,840
in this world? Only two things.

991
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,760
Either,

992
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,320
in the beginning -

993
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,600
in superficiality, only two things can impress, in superficiality.

994
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,640
Because firstly they are superficial.

995
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,040
When they will see us, they will see our superficial only.

996
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,400
First they will see, what are you.

997
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,840
I mean if you look like a drunkard, nobody is going to follow you.

998
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,160
If you look like a hippie, nobody is going to follow you.

999
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,960
Nobody has any faith in hippies, I must tell you very frankly,

1000
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,560
anymore.

1001
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,800
It's an individual system.

1002
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,320
If you work on... You cannot be leaders.

1003
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,920
If you have to be leaders you are not to be hippies at all.

1004
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,920
Which hippie has been a leader so far, you tell Me?

1005
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,080
Of course, this, now this thing is dying out,

1006
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,400
this thing is dying out. We should think about it seriously.

1007
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,960
That this hippism it's got just a craze, it's dying out.

1008
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,840
Then another craze came in, dying out,

1009
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,080
that another craze. We are not crazy people.

1010
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,760
We should know our goal how we are doing. We have to impress people.

1011
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,960
Now only we can impress them superficially, because

1012
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,120
in the beginning people just see superficial facts.

1013
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,960
So the first thing is that we should be such

1014
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,000
that we should have competence.

1015
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,920
We should - say for example, if you have to make a speech,

1016
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,760
you should know how to make speeches.

1017
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,440
Now, people when they speak, either

1018
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,320
they cannot impress or they go on like mad

1019
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,840
they put down their heads and say something. That's not the way.

1020
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,120
You must practice it. Go to the sea, go anywhere in the open,

1021
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,920
say loudly. You can go, say, for example, to

1022
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,960
this,

1023
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,040
you got Hyde Park.

1024
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,920
And say loudly what you have to say. Say loudly.

1025
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,560
Practice it. Say how you, practice it, overcome your defect.

1026
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,960
Do not enjoy your defect. It's not the way. Now no more time left

1027
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,240
for that kind of a thing.

1028
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,960
Because there is no impression of people on others.

1029
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,640
They are not impressed by you.

1030
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,920
You see, with Me whatever is impressed is all right.

1031
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,840
But you have to become the gurus, you have to become the leaders.

1032
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,920
And the impression should be on people that

1033
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,200
you are people who are smart at it,

1034
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,960
you know the job, you know how to speak, how to present Sahaja Yoga,

1035
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,240
and do it in a way that is congenial, loving, affectionate,

1036
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,760
and not like a volcanic stuff also.

1037
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:30,040
Sometimes, you see people get very volcanic with others, that also.

1038
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,240
With complete poise

1039
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,960
and self-control, with self-control.

1040
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,960
This is only achieved through self-discipline.

1041
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,320
You must discipline yourself.

1042
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,320
And do not waste yourself, must have self-esteem.

1043
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,240
This is one of the biggest lacking in Sahaja Yoga today.

1044
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,120
There's no impression on people.

1045
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,880
And this is what one has to do in your dressing up,

1046
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,840
how you talk to people, how you behave

1047
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,440
That's very important in the outside.

1048
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,280
But inside this, there is all the time

1049
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,760
you harp upon it, "Oh I can't do it.

1050
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,320
This is not for me. This much I can do."

1051
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,640
Then you have not been kind to yourself and to anyone.

1052
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,960
So come up to it. I would say everybody must come up to it.

1053
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,840
And forget those days of

1054
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,320
taking to drugs and sitting down.

1055
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,960
Whom are you going to impress with the drugs, tell Me.

1056
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,800
The another thing that impresses people

1057
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,600
is hypocrisy which we cannot take.

1058
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,400
If you are a hypocrite, you see, wear a bhagwan dress,

1059
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,760
have a chillum in the hand and go round,

1060
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,680
and you say "Oh, I was chosen by God. Go and think."

1061
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,640
That way impresses - that you can't do.

1062
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,240
So the whole thing is, both the things, the Nabhis are

1063
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,800
for our well-being

1064
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,720
which is manifested outside as well.

1065
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,960
I mean it's all right. We should have a good hotel to live in.

1066
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,440
All right, given.

1067
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,200
Have you got the eliteness of living in a hotel?

1068
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,960
Let's see. But put a question to yourself.

1069
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,440
You asked for a hotel, you've got a hotel, all right.

1070
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,400
Have you got that eliteness or how are you behaving?

1071
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,120
Just think of it. In this hotel, supposing,

1072
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,840
somebody has to live, for example,

1073
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,320
XYZ. He will have a particular type of eliteness.

1074
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,440
Isn't it? Even sometimes I find the bags you carry

1075
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,680
are so dirty, filthy, dented, holes in it.

1076
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,720
Somebody might think that somebody is running away from this hotel,

1077
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,640
something he's taking out.

1078
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,880
The rags and things should be given up and thrown away.

1079
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,640
Now I hope there is one word like "throw",

1080
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,600
which is not used.

1081
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,800
I'm sitting down, I've never come up to see anything.

1082
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,680
But the "throw" part of it is necessary.

1083
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,800
Throw away all nonsensical things like rags,

1084
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,320
and other things which you think is very good looking,

1085
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,800
but it's not, please throw it away.

1086
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,960
See, for example, some of sweaters,

1087
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,680
and blankets and things that people carry,

1088
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,080
are horrible. Color should be smart,

1089
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,040
everything should be smart.

1090
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,040
You know you should not look a ragged person.

1091
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,560
I mean how are you in Raja Lakshmi state?

1092
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,640
One has to see it's a Raja Lakshmi standing.

1093
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,960
You see, there is no need

1094
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,720
to show that we are beggars.

1095
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,960
That's only, only good for the people who are hypocrites, not for us.

1096
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,080
You see, beggars are normally not beggars.

1097
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,680
They are hypocrites. So they beg.

1098
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,240
They earn money. In India you'll be surprised, some of the beggars

1099
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,640
have got huge, big buildings on Marine Drive. They own it.

1100
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,560
And still their profession is begging.

1101
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,640
So they are not really beggars. They are hypocrites you see.

1102
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,320
They make money like that.

1103
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,560
So why should we be dressed up like that?

1104
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,120
Moreover if you dress up like that, the other side will follow

1105
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,200
and that is the bhoot.

1106
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,880
That will sit on you.

1107
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,040
Because they want bhootish people to look at.

1108
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,280
They won't sit on a [neat] person, who is properly dressed,

1109
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,120
who has got properly

1110
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,680
done his hair and who is taking bath and all that.

1111
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,320
They like filth, they like dirt, they like dirty smell,

1112
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,760
and if you have all these things in you,

1113
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,120
they will be just on top of your head walking with you,

1114
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,880
wherever you'll go. They like such things. You see, like,

1115
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,280
you put something filthy,

1116
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,120
you will find all the flies come down there.

1117
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,560
You see, simple things.

1118
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,760
Anything you put filthy

1119
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,960
there will be all the worms getting inside that.

1120
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,640
It's like that.

1121
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,080
So the way you are that's how it works.

1122
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,160
So for your Raja Lakshmi,

1123
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,960
for your Gruha Lakshmi,

1124
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,760
it is important that you should have

1125
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,440
self-control in your behavior, how you talk.

1126
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,800
When you talk, if you talk like a

1127
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,000
cheap person,

1128
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,840
or like a

1129
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,640
a person who is doused with something,

1130
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,960
then nobody is going to be impressed.

1131
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,960
How you behave is very important,

1132
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,120
how you sit, how you talk.

1133
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,960
The other day, Neema, you see, they asked Neema to speak

1134
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,680
and Neema has never spoken, she's quite nervous.

1135
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,240
But Gregoire said, "You should tell us about our defect".

1136
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,360
And she said really somemething very sensible.

1137
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,560
She said that, "I have so many defects and we Indians all have defects

1138
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,160
but what I find about you people is that

1139
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,760
that before Mother when you behave,

1140
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,040
the protocol is missing.

1141
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,720
You take Her for granted. 'It's all right, She's Mahamaya,' and all that",

1142
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:57,040
but there also what she said, that "For us it's just like

1143
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,960
a setting we had that 'This is the Goddess,'

1144
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,400
the tradition of Goddess is there.

1145
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,440
And we found Her, is there like a diamond, we put Her in the set.

1146
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,800
So it's just done, we have no problem.

1147
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,240
But sometimes I find the way people walk before Her

1148
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,280
just like horses, the way they talk,

1149
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,960
and all those things are surprising. Their behavior is surprising.

1150
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,760
I can't understand how you can do it when you know

1151
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,080
She's the Goddess, of course She is."

1152
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,120
So, in that case,

1153
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,680
I would say once this Raja Lakshmi business comes up,

1154
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,280
then you will understand the respect.

1155
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,840
Because once you respect yourself, you start respecting others also.

1156
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,080
And that you are all saints,

1157
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,720
you have to respect each other, in the same way.

1158
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,840
You should really, call each other, I mean,

1159
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,680
if it is in Hindi language I would say

1160
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,840
you should call "thou" because we say it to elder people, like that.

1161
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,240
"Please be seated, please be," it's a great respect of people.

1162
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,760
It will impress others. Instead of that, in the program,

1163
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,240
you find somebody slapping each other, holding each other's

1164
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,240
hair and shouting. What will they think, what saints,

1165
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,400
from where these new types of saints have come?

1166
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,880
Saints have to respect each other.

1167
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,800
They come to your house,

1168
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,960
you offer them some nice seat to sit down.

1169
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,160
You must see how the saints respect the saints.

1170
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,600
That respect should be there among yourselves, the oneness,

1171
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,960
the understanding, is ... Without respect,

1172
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,040
you cannot have any rapport.

1173
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,960
And to have a rapport,

1174
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,400
there should be equal level

1175
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,720
of understanding, that as I want respect others must be respected.

1176
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,680
You should be respectful and to be respected.

1177
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,920
Both things should be done. This is the Lakshmi staying here.

1178
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,360
And today now, the light,

1179
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,720
the light is there, light is a very important thing.

1180
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,680
From the very beginning you see, when a man discovered

1181
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,400
the fire,

1182
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,960
the fire was used in the Gruha Lakshmi state,

1183
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,880
where the food was cooked and the fire cooked the food,

1184
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,720
and was used, you see, the warmth of the Mother you see,

1185
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,960
was shown through that heart that we use in the house,

1186
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:10,320
to warm up her children, to give them food and all that, that state.

1187
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,440
Then it became an, say, in any collective thing,

1188
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,880
which is expressed as light, you see.

1189
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,160
If you have to celebrate, say, your Republic Day

1190
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,600
or your Independence Day, we put the lights on.

1191
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,560
Or we have fireworks you see.

1192
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,080
To express ourselves, then that one

1193
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,680
is in the Raja Lakshmi. Now the Mahalakshmi.

1194
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,400
Mahalakshmi is the evolutionary state.

1195
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,040
In the evolutionary state,

1196
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,920
when the evolutionary state starts

1197
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,680
then the Mahalakshmi starts asserting Herself,

1198
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:46,160
and that comes when your well-being is established within you.

1199
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,880
I mean if you are still worried as to how to get

1200
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,960
a cup of tea for yourself, you cannot get to Mahalakshmi state.

1201
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,000
So once that is little bit established

1202
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,080
and you feel that peace within yourself,

1203
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:03,120
and that dignity then the Mahalakshmi power starts acting on you.

1204
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,800
And the Mahalakshmi power is that it really makes you the light.

1205
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,720
You have now become the light.

1206
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,120
You don't have to have any light. You are the light.

1207
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:24,160
When you go anywhere, when people see you

1208
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,720
they take guidance from you. They use you as a torch

1209
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,920
which guides them.

1210
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,760
They will come and consult you and ask you how to go.

1211
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,080
It is you who are the light.

1212
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,960
So this is what it is.

1213
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,040
One has to know that Mahalakshmi tattwa is represented here

1214
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,160
as the light. And you see these lights can enlighten.

1215
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:49,360
Even a small light how it reacts and how it shows.

1216
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,800
And now you have become the light.

1217
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,600
Even this light can do it. You see I put My hand to it

1218
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,840
and it recognizes and moves there.

1219
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,040
Because it is now enlightened.

1220
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,760
It is put before the photograph, it's enlightened, it works that way.

1221
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,440
Now what about you? You are the light now.

1222
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,440
You are the Diwali, for God.

1223
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:15,000
Diwali means the, the rows of light.

1224
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,960
So you are going

1225
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,200
to make this beautiful mansion of God

1226
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,560
full of Diwali light.

1227
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,120
You have entered into the kingdom of God

1228
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,160
and you have to enlighten.

1229
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,720
So you are the decoration of God,

1230
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,720
on one side,

1231
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,720
you are the glory of God,

1232
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,960
and also on the other side you are the guide.

1233
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:46,080
Guidelines, you are like the torches. You can say you are

1234
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,560
like the

1235
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,880
what you call them, which are used by ships also.

1236
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,000
Lighthouse.

1237
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:57,960
Lighthouse?

1238
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:58,960
Beacon.

1239
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,560
You have to become lighthouses,

1240
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,800
so that people see you. You stand out, and light the sea.

1241
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,640
Like that you have to be.

1242
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,800
And for that you have to have self-discipline.

1243
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,320
Put your will power, put it.

1244
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:18,280
The will power. Put it down, "How can I not do it?"

1245
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,600
Now in this place I am going to start

1246
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,960
within say two, three days, after Diwali,

1247
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,800
a morning session, say about,

1248
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,960
we can start about five o'clock every morning,

1249
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,800
or five thirty every morning.

1250
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:40,160
You have to have your bath before coming here.

1251
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,680
Say five thirty, or five o'clock, will that be all right?

1252
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,680
Your Mother gets up at four thirty whatever may happen.

1253
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,120
You have to change your habits. You have to.

1254
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,320
Get up in the morning. You know by

1255
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,160
getting up in the morning you

1256
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,960
finish off so much of work.

1257
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,920
Because in the night what do you do? Just gossip, waste your time.

1258
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,080
But if you say that, "Tonight let me sleep late

1259
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,960
and tomorrow I'll get up early," you'll never.

1260
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,040
First get up early then you'll sleep early.

1261
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,960
The other way around. You see, you have to see your mind how it works.

1262
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:14,640
So get up in the morning,

1263
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,960
have your bath and sit down for meditation.

1264
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:20,040
It's quite a warm room. So have your nice hot bath,

1265
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:24,120
sit down for your meditation for about an hour or so, meditate.

1266
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,240
You'll feel so nice. After some time

1267
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,960
you cannot sleep after four thirty.

1268
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,080
Now look at my system, I mean whether I am in America,

1269
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,800
or whether I am in India, I get up at four thirty.

1270
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,040
How do I manage?

1271
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,360
I have no watch or thing like that, I just get up at four thirty.

1272
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,960
I have tuned Myself to the sun.

1273
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,960
You are tuned more to the moon.

1274
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,680
I've tuned Myself to the sun.

1275
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,840
When the sun comes at this angle I have to get up

1276
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,680
because that is the time the vibrations start to flow,

1277
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,360
all over the world.

1278
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,400
At four thirty in the morning all these vibrations

1279
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:06,080
the best time, flow in the purest form.

1280
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,600
That's why all the seers get up very early in the morning,

1281
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,680
have their bath,

1282
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,320
and sit down for meditation. It's too much I know,

1283
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,040
specially for Englishmen.

1284
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,760
But you have to train up yourself.

1285
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,720
You will do it, you will like it, if you do it like a festival.

1286
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:33,240
See today is a festival day, let us get up and have a nice bath,

1287
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:34,800
and have a nice soap you see,

1288
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,960
perfumed one and nice things and ... you'll enjoy.

1289
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,240
Bath should be a ritual.

1290
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,240
But should not be all the time.

1291
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,040
Because I see they are just sitting there quite happy.

1292
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,920
Like Indians also, they bathe too much, that is not necessary.

1293
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,560
Too much not, but one.

1294
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,320
And then if you sit at home

1295
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,960
for about an hour or so, the house is lighted.

1296
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,120
I could get this place lighted in the morning

1297
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,400
you come here, you will be amazed

1298
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,240
that if you develop this habit

1299
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,080
you can do such a lot,

1300
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,960
because in the evening you are tired, you cannot do many things,

1301
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,120
and you are absolutely fade down you see.

1302
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,760
So you'll sleep early.

1303
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:21,720
And this is the English thing, "early to bed and early to rise".

1304
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,680
Not Indian, is it?

1305
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,280
And that's what we have to do.

1306
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,440
And you'll be amazed you'll do thousand and one things,

1307
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,600
thousand and one things if you get up early in the morning.

1308
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,000
So we are going to try that after Diwali.

1309
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,560
I'm going to announce. Those who can try with Me, can do it.

1310
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,120
And I used to sleep sometimes at two o'clock,

1311
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,880
two thirty, mostly at two,

1312
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,360
and get up at four thirty, finish My bath.

1313
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:51,000
Everybody was still sleeping and I didn't want to disturb them.

1314
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,840
Then at about eight o'clock, I would say,

1315
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,160
"Now, will you please get up?"

1316
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,960
Once Gregoire, you see, it was the day he had to leave,

1317
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,920
he was saying, "Oh, it's already two o'clock.

1318
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,040
There are only three hours."

1319
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,880
I said, "Gregoire, you better sleep now.

1320
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,640
Worrying about it you won't sleep, so better sleep."

1321
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,280
"How, how will I wake up, what will happen?"

1322
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,960
At five o'clock I just said, "Now." I got up four thirty.

1323
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,960
Five o'clock, "Five o'clock!"

1324
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:19,880
And they all got up.

1325
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,280
Ask him.

1326
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:27,960
And it's so, it's very easy to do it, you see. It's very easy.

1327
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,200
You did not sleep like Me till two o'clock.

1328
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,920
Then, but if I sleep [a bit],

1329
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,960
then in the daytime I sleep for an hour or so.

1330
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,280
I make up. But then you will feel sleepy,

1331
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,560
go off to sleep. In the night it's a waste of time to keep awake.

1332
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,280
It's really waste.

1333
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:47,640
What do you see? These dirty pictures in the TV. What else?

1334
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,960
After nine o'clock is there anything worth seeing?

1335
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,760
Nine thirty, ten at the most.

1336
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,680
Then all filth is there.

1337
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,400
You'll feel healthier, you'll be much better off.

1338
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,560
Harry has improved very much with this kind of a thing.

1339
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,040
And morning time you don't think much, you really meditate.

1340
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,400
it's a very good thing.

1341
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:09,320
So just I am leaving one thing for your

1342
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,400
understanding, that let us work it out,

1343
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,960
something out of our self discipline.

1344
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,720
It's very important. See the ego doesn't allow you

1345
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,920
to have a discipline. He'll say, "Ah, what's wrong?"

1346
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,120
That's the way we have to put our ego down.

1347
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,960
And self discipline will give you

1348
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,240
freely, I tell you, self-control.

1349
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,640
Self-control is very important

1350
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,400
and that self-control

1351
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,960
is only possible if you really know how to

1352
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:42,840
develop it, inculcate it and become yourself.

1353
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,240
It's a beautiful

1354
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,000
analogy given in Katha, Katha Upanishad,

1355
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:53,440
that, you see, the body is like a chariot,

1356
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,880
it says, body is like a chariot.

1357
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,680
And the charioteer

1358
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,160
is the buddhi,

1359
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,560
and the Spirit is the master.

1360
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,280
And the charioteer is the buddhi, is the intellect.

1361
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,760
Buddhi is better word than intellect is, you see.

1362
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,640
I mean you can call the

1363
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,120
wisdom, wisdom.

1364
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,400
Now the senses are like the horses.

1365
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,160
Senses are like the horses,

1366
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,040
they are running here or there, hither, thither and all that.

1367
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,000
And the controlling of it, the reigns,

1368
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:32,560
are in the hand of the buddhi, the char..., in the person

1369
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:35,040
who is handling it, the charioteer,

1370
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,440
is the wisdom or the intellect within us.

1371
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,560
The intellect has to control the senses.

1372
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,960
And the reigns are to be controlled.

1373
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,960
Now when you allow these

1374
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,240
senses to go wherever it likes you see

1375
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:52,960
and you do not control it,

1376
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,560
then you are neither here nor there.

1377
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,960
You say, "I know, I know, I know."

1378
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,040
What part knows, what part goes wrong,

1379
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,600
where are you? And then why are you doing it?

1380
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,760
"I know I should have been, I know it's very bad, I know."

1381
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,840
Why? If you know, it should be your knowledge,

1382
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,080
it should be your complete

1383
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,960
being of that kind. If you know it's done.

1384
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:25,240
Knowledge should be one with your behavior.

1385
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,840
I mean, I know this is white.

1386
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:31,040
All right, then I treat it like white. Or do I treat it like black?

1387
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:37,040
If I know, this is, this is the fire, I don't put my hand there.

1388
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,840
I say, "I know it is fire," do I put hand there?

1389
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,960
So to control our sense organs,

1390
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,240
we have to have our buddhi, our

1391
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,720
mind, quite intact.

1392
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,160
and put in the hands of the Self,

1393
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:02,720
where "I" doesn't remember: "I do it, I, I," all that.

1394
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:04,960
Spirit doesn't like it.

1395
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:09,320
You have to have a very disciplined mind which

1396
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:13,800
should improve your method, of everything, of talking,

1397
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,920
doing things. I mean you must improve,

1398
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,560
all the time you have to improve.

1399
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,240
If you are reconciled with yourself then it's finished.

1400
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,200
Then the whole thing is settled down.

1401
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:24,960
So that's how you progress

1402
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,920
and you'll go better and better with it.

1403
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:31,160
And today's day is a very great day for us because

1404
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,120
the saints are celebrating Diwali.

1405
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,800
I am celebrating My Diwali enlightening light in your hearts,

1406
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:44,240
that you enjoy your own joy and your own beauty,

1407
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,200
that you are now the Spirit.

1408
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,960
Enjoy it, that you are that.

1409
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,880
Now you are in the kingdom of God, no doubt.

1410
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,320
I mean you, even if you don't do anything anymore,

1411
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:55,680
you'll be all right there.

1412
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:59,960
But you should not take it for granted.

1413
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,600
You have to come forward because your Mother

1414
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,440
needs your help. You have stand up,

1415
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,400
you have to rise, you have to come up,

1416
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,560
you have to become the leaders of tomorrow.

1417
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,160
You have to work it out and not just be talkers and

1418
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,960
thinking big and saying big, big things,

1419
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:20,240
and if, even if I ask you to wash a spoon you cannot do it.

1420
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,640
What's the use?

1421
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,440
So you are tomorrow's citizens,

1422
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,920
you are the ones who are going to impress people.

1423
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:32,200
I expect you to have an understanding

1424
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,960
about what you have to achieve.

1425
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,800
But don't sit down and plan

1426
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,800
because planning means you will never do it.

1427
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,080
"This is our plan: tomorrow morning, I'll get up in the morning,

1428
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,680
I'll do my meditation and write it down in a book."

1429
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,920
And three days you'll never get up.

1430
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,800
Because you have already written it down.

1431
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,400
You have planned it.

1432
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:51,680
You have planned it.

1433
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:54,880
The planning is done.

1434
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:58,000
Why should you do it actually? It's done. You've done it.

1435
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,640
In the, in the diary, it's all there.

1436
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,880
That's what planning is.

1437
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,960
Planning is: you sit down, "All right, so what should we do?".

1438
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,600
Let's sit down. It's craziness, some people ...

1439
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,960
Nothing happens. What happens? Everything in the planning.

1440
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,040
Who is going to revise it and see it is done?

1441
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,960
And that's how mentally we have a satisfaction, "Oh, we've done it.

1442
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,080
All of us sat together, we had a big committee meeting."

1443
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:28,960
You all talk, talk, talk,

1444
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,040
"We decided this Mother, we have decided on this, and decided."

1445
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,960
What have you achieved? Nothing.

1446
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,080
How is it? What have you decided?

1447
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,960
To achieve, that is what it is. That's not planning.

1448
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,800
So you do not plan, but just get up tomorrow morning.

1449
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,920
All right? Try that. Do not plan,

1450
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,400
because planning is the one that fixes you up

1451
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,360
not to do a thing. And that has led to this

1452
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,640
kind of idiotic country and everywhere else.

1453
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:01,640
Just they plan. Plan for what?

1454
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,840
Now is there any question?

1455
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,160
Then we retire.

1456
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,600
We have to have now

1457
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,960
collective understanding also that we have to do some programming,

1458
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,200
every Saturday and Sunday I should be free

1459
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:23,760
after the 24th. Saturday, Sunday if not,

1460
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,040
we can have the meetings - after the 24th I will be quite free.

1461
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:32,560
But even before that you see, we can have it on Saturdays, Sundays.

1462
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,400
Now there are two Saturdays, Sundays in between.

1463
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,920
You can plan something if you want Me to go somewhere,

1464
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,280
you want to have a meeting anywhere, or here, or if

1465
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,960
people want to meet Me, you can do it.

1466
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,680
But we cannot get Caxton Hall on Saturdays, Sundays.

1467
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,840
I cannot do on weekdays, so get some hall where I can go there,

1468
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:52,040
some school hall or something on a Saturday,

1469
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,280
we all can meet. There are two Saturdays we can use.

1470
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,760
Or Sundays, anything that you want to.

1471
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,560
A school hall will be all right on a Sunday, Gavin.

1472
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,200
And you can advertize in the papers, about it.

1473
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:06,960
Now, this,

1474
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,880
for example I am going on the 28th,

1475
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,880
so there are two Sundays now,

1476
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,640
where we can meet. All right?

1477
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,120
And when I go,

1478
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,960
and I come back, then also we can meet

1479
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,960
on weekdays, then I can meet on weekdays.

1480
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,440
But before that I can meet, meet you

1481
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,920
on any Saturday or Sunday.

1482
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,680
There are hardly two Saturdays, Sundays.

1483
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:35,760
So you arrange it, or if you want we can meet in Chelsham Road,

1484
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,440
in the ashram.

1485
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:40,440
Anyway,

1486
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:43,600
if you, Sahaja Yogis can meet Me, any problem,

1487
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,800
anything you can tell Me. Now, again, we are having a puja,

1488
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,960
in any case, on this Sunday.

1489
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,440
Sunday, 30th.

1490
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,960
Friday, Friday, Friday.

1491
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,560
Friday, going? 30th, Friday.

1492
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:58,960
What time?

1493
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:03,440
All right. So next Sunday you can have a meeting, if you want to.

1494
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,120
On the next Sunday you can have a meeting.

1495
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:10,160
Now, what about Brighton?

1496
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,960
How are they? What meeting are they having today?

1497
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,760
They are having a regular program?

1498
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:21,400
Yes, Mother, we are having programs on Tuesdays and Thursdays

1499
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,240
and now we have started Fridays.

1500
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,960
Where? In the house or in the?

1501
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,680
No, we have a meeting, public meeting every Tuesday

1502
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,560
at Brighton Hall, and we are also starting

1503
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,840
another public meeting on Fridays.

1504
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:37,760
And we have a meeting at a house on Thursdays.

1505
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,240
I would suggest that

1506
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:43,880
public meetings, whatever you people have,

1507
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,760
should be on a Saturday and a Sunday.

1508
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,720
Would be better if you can get a hall.

1509
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:51,800
Because you see, weekdays we have programs here.

1510
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,960
For the time being it's all right because Saturday, Sunday

1511
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,760
now we'll be having, these two Saturdays, Sundays. But normally,

1512
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,680
you know if Friday is a puja and all, if you have a meeting,

1513
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:02,200
you should consult people here also,

1514
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,680
because then they would like to come for the puja, no?

1515
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,960
This Friday, you all should come for a puja.

1516
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:08,720
All right?

1517
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,320
We can have some music.

1518
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,400
Mother, what time we will have the program on Friday?

1519
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,720
What time we will have the puja on Friday?

1520
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,960
puja we should start about

1521
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,640
about, it has to be evening time.

1522
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,960
Whatever time suits you people. But after that,

1523
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,880
I mean, you have to have some music, or something we can have.

1524
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,160
After that.

1525
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,680
Seven o'clock? Seven.

1526
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,960
Seven is all right. Because all of you will be working.

1527
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,600
You can even have it on Saturday if you like, whatever you say.

1528
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,080
Will that suit people, seven o'clock, Friday?

1529
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,000
Or it will be tiring?

1530
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,440
We get on the right.

1531
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,800
Put your left to the right, you see, always.

1532
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,080
Put your left to the right, you won't be tired.

1533
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,000
Because you think too much, you see.

1534
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,560
That's why. Put left to the right, hundred and eight times.

1535
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,600
All the time tired.

1536
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:21,320
Left to the right. Good for your heart, good for all these.

1537
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:26,680
Good, see. Thinking is much better.

1538
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,200
Agnyas.

1539
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,840
Now I would like to see your dear husband,

1540
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,160
tomorrow, if he can come and see Me.

1541
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,920
Is he here? Cooley? Where are you?

1542
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,400
You come and see Me tomorrow, all right?

1543
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,160
You and, where is ... Djamel has come?

1544
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,320
No, Mother.

1545
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:50,960
All right, Djamel, I'll talk to him but

1546
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,800
in any case you come and see Me tomorrow.

1547
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,960
And tell Kay to come and see Me tomorrow.

1548
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,760
Is she coming tomorrow morning?

1549
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,560
She arrives tomorrow morning.

1550
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,560
All right. Let her come in the evening tomorrow and see Me.

1551
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,600
All right? Now who else wants to see Me personally?

1552
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,440
Can come tomorrow morning.

1553
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,960
At what time, Mother?

1554
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,680
What time you can come?

1555
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:15,760
I'm working.

1556
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:19,160
What time you'll be over? What time?

1557
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,160
Near five.

1558
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,960
All right, then about five thirty.

1559
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,960
I'll be here. Or you send Me word,

1560
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,160
with the servant. Five thirty I'll be here.

1561
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,800
Those who want to see Me

1562
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,920
in the morning, can come here in the morning. All right?

1563
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,840
Anybody who wants to see Me. Magda, you want to see Me?

1564
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,720
Any time morning, you can come. I'm here.

1565
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,800
Gavin, are you all right now?

1566
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:43,600
[TO AN END?]

1567
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:44,880
Better?

1568
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,360
How are you, Jane?

1569
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,040
Are you all right?

1570
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,200
Liver will be all right with this, see. Now better?

1571
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:57,400
Thinking is better now.

1572
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:58,920
Yes.

1573
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,240
You put from right to left.

1574
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,240
You and Felicity. Felicity right to left.

1575
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,320
Put your right to left.

1576
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,240
Do it hundred and eight times. And don't think. Watch Me.

1577
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,640
Don't think.

1578
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:22,800
Good.

1579
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:33,200
Now inform all the people, in Cambridge, everywhere, you see.

1580
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:36,040
And then what we can do is to,

1581
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:40,280
I can stay over and next day, or maybe I'll go Saturday.

1582
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,440
These people stay over there.

1583
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,760
Then I can talk to them on Saturday.

1584
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,880
So if any personal problems are there we can solve it out.

1585
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,800
Or else,

1586
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:52,960
if you have the puja on Saturday evening it would be better, I think.

1587
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,800
Chhaya, everybody can come on Saturday.

1588
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:59,960
And then Sunday, you see. Let us have it on Saturday evening.

1589
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,920
Which date is Saturday?

1590
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,280
31-st.

1591
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:05,840
It will be all right.

1592
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:06,960
31-st, yes.

1593
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,080
31st, you see.

1594
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,720
Halloween.

1595
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:10,560
End of week.

1596
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,040
Halloween, yes.

1597
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,960
Halloween, Mother, it's a, it's a festival

1598
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:19,960
of doubtful origin.

1599
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,040
It's a fest, it's a fest,

1600
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:25,200
Halloween is an abbreviation for the term "Hallow's Eve",

1601
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,400
because November the first is supposed to be All Saints' Day

1602
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:32,400
November the first, so the last day of October is Hallow's eve.

1603
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,960
It's called Hallow e'en. It's supposed to be the night when

1604
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,720
all the demons and witches fly through the sky on broomsticks.

1605
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,960
Things like that, Mother. When all the spirits take to the sky

1606
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,800
on the night of Halloween. That's Saturday night.

1607
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,960
Then we should do it on a Sunday then.

1608
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:56,680
The children dress up Mother, and dress up as spirits and

1609
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:00,040
ghosts and they carry lanterns.

1610
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:00,960
Witches.

1611
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:01,960
Very bad.

1612
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,000
Witches, too.

1613
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,040
It's reputed to be a night when the spirits,

1614
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,680
when the dead come out and ...

1615
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,120
Then supposing... So we'll have it on a Sunday then?

1616
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:10,640
Shall we do it on Sunday?

1617
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,360
I would not like to do that day.

1618
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,280
Sunday, Sunday is reputed to be All Saints' Day, Mother,

1619
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,360
the day of all the saints, November the first.

1620
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,760
That's good. It's called All Saints' Day.

1621
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,840
That's a good day, then we'll have All Saints' Day

1622
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:23,960
plus Diwali day.

1623
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:27,120
Saints' day. It's good. We'll have it on Sunday, all right?

1624
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,360
So Sunday we can have the puja.

1625
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,360
I mean ...

1626
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,600
We have to have puja then,

1627
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,720
in the morning then, we can have morning puja,

1628
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:39,640
and then I can stay over and in the evening we can light

1629
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:43,040
the lights and all that and have some fireworks and things.

1630
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,920
Fireworks?

1631
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,680
And we can have the music.

1632
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,160
So whole of Sunday we can spend together, there.

1633
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,960
All right? Keep it Sunday.

1634
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,440
Sunday I'll be there. Sunday.

1635
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,400
What time for the puja, Mother?

1636
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,840
Then, Sunday should be about, we should start at ten,

1637
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,960
you see, because we have sufficient time then.

1638
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:04,160
Ten o'clock will that be all right, for all of you?

1639
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,560
What time will you get up Sunday?

1640
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:11,000
Four thirty, Mother.

1641
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:13,240
It's so simple.

1642
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,800
You know, I don't know why people find it so difficult.

1643
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,320
It's just a matter of self-discipline.

1644
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,120
Just a matter.

1645
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,640
I know everybody has this problem but ...

1646
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:28,200
Even Indians have now, young people have this problem.

1647
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,880
They are taking up from you people.

1648
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,640
They are becoming now more westernized and

1649
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:38,960
they can't get up anytime.

1650
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:42,280
But even, you see, my husband, he cannot sleep after six.

1651
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:45,440
We were brought up like that I think, our generation,

1652
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:46,880
was brought up like that.

1653
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:49,560
A lot of self-discipline because we were born at the time

1654
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:52,000
where we needed our independence you see. So we had to

1655
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,000
become like military people, you know.

1656
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,040
We had to really stick on to things.

1657
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,880
So we are very well disciplined that way.

1658
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,840
So it's a good day, Sunday, we'll have it, on Saints' Day.

1659
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,800
All right? And this, business of this,

1660
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:12,960
witches and all that should be finished. It's all nonsense.

1661
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,640
They are not to be taken so easily.

1662
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:18,960
This must just come from since long I'm sure in this country when

1663
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,280
people were indulging into nonsensical things.

1664
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:22,960
You see, they were barbaric people.

1665
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,600
Barbaric people always go to these things, you see.

1666
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:29,080
They must have done it and still that is continuing.

1667
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:32,200
Halloween becomes because of All Saints' Day

1668
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,400
the idea that all the spirits are frightened

1669
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,200
because of the next day.

1670
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,600
Then, this is like Naraka Chaturdashi we have.

1671
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:42,400
That is the day all the devils are put in the Naraka.

1672
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:46,040
It's done, only it's done, yesterday was the day.

1673
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,560
This is a bad week for bhoots, Mother.

1674
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:58,960
But that's why Diwali.

1675
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,160
That's why the light.

1676
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,920
That's why you have to have light.

1677
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,880
After the fourteenth day, then the fifteenth day

1678
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,240
they celebrate Diwali.

1679
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,320
Fifteenth day, that is the darkest night.

1680
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,120
Which night is that, Mother?

1681
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,320
That is tonight.

1682
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:14,280
That is the darkest night.

1683
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,680
And then tomorrow is the day

1684
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,840
that is the first day, you see.

1685
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:22,040
It's celebrated as the New Year for many people.

1686
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:25,960
Not in Maharashtra, they celebrate from My own dynasty that

1687
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:30,200
they do it. But in north they celebrate first day, tomorrow.

1688
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,160
And the second day is the brothers' day,

1689
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:34,080
where the brothers and sisters tie the ...,

1690
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,120
that we can do also in the puja,

1691
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,680
the brothers and sisters, they tie the thing.

1692
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,560
Where is your husband? He has not come?

1693
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:43,960
He's not well, Mother.

1694
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:45,000
What's the matter?

1695
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,600
The muscles in his back have ...

1696
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,400
When did it happen?

1697
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,840
... turned too much and he's flat on his back and can't move.

1698
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:54,960
When did this happen?

1699
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:57,960
The day before yesterday.

1700
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:58,880
I know why.

1701
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,960
Tell him not to use his hands too much.

1702
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,680
He was trying to shut a window when it happened.

1703
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,920
Tell him that. I came to know about it.

1704
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:12,200
And I knew it was going to act that way.

1705
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,640
All right? Tell him not to use his hands.

1706
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,320
So can I take your leave now?

1707
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:20,640
May God bless you.

1708
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,840
Happy Diwali to you all.

1709
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,960
I wish I could prepare something sweet for you

1710
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,960
but in this place I don't know what to do.

1711
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,960
How are you now? Are you better?

1712
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:33,960
You.

1713
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:41,200
Put right to the left. Right to the left.

1714
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,960
How you will go alone?

1715
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,080
What?

1716
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:03,960
He is not coming?

1717
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,360
Why?

1718
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,600
I am thinking...

1719
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:10,960
I will go with someone else.

1720
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:14,360
Nobody will go on that time.

1721
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,360
If you go earlier then fine.

1722
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:22,000
Will you go earlier?

1723
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,840
Our servant will go. Do you want to go with him?

1724
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:30,080
With Saturday's flight.

1725
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,360
But it's quite early, isn't it?

1726
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:38,960
Douglas, you don't want to go now, to India?

1727
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:43,920
Here I am,  Mother. No, I'm not really able to take time off from work,

1728
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,280
you see, I think it's ...

1729
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,880
I don't think it's right that I should take time off now.

1730
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:49,960
She has to go alone, she ...

1731
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:52,240
I think perhaps she can go with Kay.

1732
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:54,760
Kay is not coming now.

1733
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:56,840
Kay has given up her job?

1734
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:00,400
I think it's worked out in a slightly different way Mother,

1735
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,000
because she has gone to Berlin

1736
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:05,360
and I think they would let her take her job back until Christmas.

1737
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:09,280
Anyway, I'll, first of all I'll see what the situation with Kay is.

1738
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,040
Why do you feel so frightened? Are you crying?

1739
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,360
She is feeling afraid to go alone.

1740
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,960
Oh, no, I wouldn't like for her to go alone.

1741
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,360
It's all right, nothing will happen.

1742
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,880
There is nothing to fear, someone will come to pick you up there.

1743
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:26,320
You have a direct flight to Mumbai.

1744
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,960
Air India it's a direct flight.

1745
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,160
You see and she knows Bombay very well. This is fine.

1746
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:33,920
Nothing will happen, you should go for marriage.

1747
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:36,080
Her father would meet her there as well.

1748
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:37,400
You see, everybody will be there.

1749
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:38,960
Oh, yes, she may go. I mean that she...

1750
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:41,200
But she wants you to go.

1751
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,560
She doesn't want to leave you. I think she is crying for that.

1752
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:47,000
Not for him. My father will be upset.

1753
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,400
You know, it's her father will be upset I think.

1754
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,880
But something, I'm sure, something will work out.

1755
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:55,960
But how can he come? Already he has lost his one job.

1756
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:58,640
Having one job lost, now should he lose his second job?

1757
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,960
From such a long distance, everybody cannot come.

1758
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,960
Isn't it? You should tell your father.

1759
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:10,280
He will be upset a bit, I agree, but he will understand.

1760
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:13,560
This time she was pregnant so...

1761
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,360
Did she delivered?

1762
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:17,240
Why should she lift vacuum cleaner?

1763
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,240
Why are you working like a horse, here?

1764
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,160
You see, women should not become horses.

1765
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:23,440
All right?

1766
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:27,960
Don't do like that again. Once you start, you will get the habit of that.

1767
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,200
Thank you.

1768
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,960
Thank you very much.

1769
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,360
Lakshmi and Ganesha.

1770
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:58,200
Good.

1771
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,640
Happy Diwali from U.K. Mother.

1772
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,120
What's that?

1773
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:20,320
See, from everybody. From everybody, Mother.

1774
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,960
Sweet?

1775
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:23,040
No, no, no.

1776
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,800
What is it? Mappin and Webb.

1777
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:26,200
What is that?

1778
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,240
Nothing expensive I hope.

1779
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:34,960
Mappin and Webb, you know ...

1780
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,840
You can't do that. It's too much, it's too much.

1781
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,400
It's from all of us.

1782
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:50,720
But it's too much.

1783
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,640
No, Mother, [that's the fake one].

1784
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,840
Oh God, for Lakshmi?

1785
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:07,560
I would like to wear this now.

1786
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:15,120
Can you take it out?

1787
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,600
Be careful, be careful.

1788
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,040
What he is trying to say that be careful.

1789
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,160
Thank you.

1790
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:27,880
[You have served?]  SY: Yes.

1791
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:29,880
This is Bombay halwa.

1792
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:32,640
May God bless you.

1793
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:40,680
May God bless you.

1794
01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:59,640
Would you like me to help You?

1795
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:01,800
I think I can manage.

1796
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,960
Are you going? Good, thank you.

1797
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,320
Looking nice?

1798
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,880
Beautiful, very beautiful.

1799
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,120
Thank you very much.

1800
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:18,960
You shouldn't do all these things

1801
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:21,600
otherwise I'll be considered as other gurus.

1802
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:23,960
They are from Chelsham Road, Mother.

1803
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:28,960
Thank you. Now, these flowers must be put,

1804
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:31,720
[I would say that] you have just to put them somewhere else.

1805
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:32,800
Yes, Mother.

1806
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:41,680
Thank you very much, thank you. It's very kind of you.

1807
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:44,960
But why go to Mappin and Webb? They are very expensive people.

1808
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:50,840
We felt the vibrations, Mother. Yes, very good vibrations.

1809
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,160
Yes, I know, it is, o.k..

1810
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,080
I have so many chains, I've never worn a chain all My life.

1811
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,600
This would be a good idea. You have really chained Me.

1812
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,720
Chained with your love.

1813
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,240
We've been chained to Your heart.

1814
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:39,400
It's better now? Did you see?

1815
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,960
Very much, Mother, yes, yes.

1816
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:41,680
Did you see it?

1817
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:42,360
Yes.

1818
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,880
She wants to sit there?

1819
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,360
[Or she goes to Auriel]]?

1820
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:21,440
All right, come and say "Happy Diwali" to Mr. Shrivastava. Come.
