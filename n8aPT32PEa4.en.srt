1
00:00:02,642 --> 00:00:07,238
Shri Fatima Puja, St Georges, Switzerland,
14 August 1988.

2
00:03:14,632 --> 00:03:18,283
Today we have gathered to do the puja of Fatima Bi,

3
00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:22,808
who was the symbol of Gruha Laxmi,

4
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,550
and so we are going to have the puja

5
00:03:27,198 --> 00:03:30,181
of the Gruha Laxmi principle within us.

6
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:36,520
As the housewife has to finish every work,

7
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:40,525
everything in the household, and then she goes for a bath,

8
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:45,125
in the same way this morning, I had to do lots of things

9
00:03:45,511 --> 00:03:48,423
and then I could come for your puja,

10
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:51,570
because today the house wife’s jobs were many.

11
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:55,469
So I had to finish them like a good house wife.

12
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:03,764
Now, the principle of Gruha Laxmi

13
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:09,835
has been evolved and developed by the Divine,

14
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:13,552
it’s not a human being’s creation

15
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,171
and as you know it resides in the Left Nabhi.

16
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:29,409
The Gruha Laxmi is the one that is represented in the life of Fatima

17
00:04:29,661 --> 00:04:34,010
who was the daughter of Mohammed Saheb.

18
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:40,872
Now She is always born in a relationship

19
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:50,538
to a Guru, which is of virginity, of purity.

20
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:54,508
So She comes as sister or

21
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:57,924
She comes as a daughter.

22
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:04,033
Now the beauty of Fatima’s life is

23
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:08,919
that after the death of Mohammed Saheb,

24
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,592
as usual, there were fanatic people who thought they can take

25
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:19,932
the religion into their hands

26
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,762
and can make it a very fanatic thing.

27
00:05:25,286 --> 00:05:27,973
The attention was not paid so much

28
00:05:28,553 --> 00:05:31,277
towards the ascent of the person.

29
00:05:32,547 --> 00:05:36,623
Even Mohammed Saheb has described his son in law in many ways.

30
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:39,266
And He is the only one -

31
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:43,552
or there’s another incarnation- of Brahmadeva,

32
00:05:45,265 --> 00:05:47,820
who came on this earth. Ali came on this earth,

33
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:50,137
He was the incarnation of Brahmadeva

34
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:55,436
and his - another incarnation was Sopandeva
 [brother of Jnaneshwara],

35
00:05:55,783 --> 00:05:58,928
which, you can go to Pune,

36
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:00,991
you can see the temple of Sopandeva there.

37
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,458
So we have Ali and his wife Fatima

38
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:45,489
who incarnated on the principle of the Left Nabhi.

39
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:53,443
She stayed in her house, in her household

40
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:58,004
and She observed what you call

41
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:02,387
a kind of a panda
 [? Pata: veil]

42
00:07:02,514 --> 00:07:07,375
or niqab as they call it, to cover her face.

43
00:07:08,997 --> 00:07:11,379
It is a symbol that a woman

44
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:17,240
who is a housewife has to

45
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:28,140
save her chastity by covering her face because

46
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:31,825
She was a beautiful woman and

47
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:39,509
They were born in a country which was very, very violent

48
00:07:40,558 --> 00:07:43,451
and She would have been definitely attacked

49
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:47,986
in case She had not lived in that kind of fashion.

50
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,102
As you know, in the time of Christ,

51
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:55,700
though Mary was Mahalaxmi’s incarnation,

52
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,292
had to be very, very potential personality

53
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:03,844
and Christ did not want anybody to know what She was.

54
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,209
But though She was in the house, She was Shakti,

55
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:17,025
so She allowed her sons

56
00:08:17,307 --> 00:08:20,164
or actually ordered them

57
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:23,677
to fight those fanatics

58
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:29,612
who were trying to deny the authority of her husband.

59
00:08:31,164 --> 00:08:34,688
And you know that  Hasan and Hussain, they were killed there.

60
00:08:35,476 --> 00:08:38,390
It’s a very beautiful thing how

61
00:08:39,357 --> 00:08:41,896
the Mahalaxmi Tatva of Sita

62
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,010
took a form of Vishnumaya

63
00:08:49,103 --> 00:08:55,422
just to establish the beautiful principle of

64
00:08:59,637 --> 00:09:02,121
a housewife.

65
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:07,101
Now, She was very powerful, no doubt,

66
00:09:07,956 --> 00:09:10,908
and She knew that her children will be killed.

67
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:16,320
But these people are never killed,

68
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:19,735
they never die nor do they suffer.

69
00:09:19,903 --> 00:09:23,397
It’s a drama they had to play to show people how stupid they are.

70
00:09:24,623 --> 00:09:27,519
As a result of that,

71
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:35,011
another system started where they respected saints;

72
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:41,192
like in India Shiya people respect Auliyas

73
00:09:41,704 --> 00:09:43,928
or we can call them the people

74
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,073
who are Realized souls like Nizamuddin Saheb.

75
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:51,497
Then we have got “Chisti”.

76
00:09:51,786 --> 00:09:57,751
We have got, in Ajmer, Hajrat Chisti.

77
00:09:58,174 --> 00:10:01,707
All these great Saints were respected by Shiyas.

78
00:10:02,298 --> 00:10:06,442
But still they could not transcend

79
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:13,164
the limits of religiosity.

80
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,931
So they also became extremely fanatic.

81
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:23,753
Firstly they would not see to

82
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:27,972
another religion where they had saints.

83
00:10:28,307 --> 00:10:32,383
They would not respect the saints who belonged to another religion

84
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:39,333
and even when we had a great saint

85
00:10:39,997 --> 00:10:45,093
like Sai Nath of Shirdi, who was a Muslim to begin with,

86
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:52,032
and it is said that Fatima herself brought him

87
00:10:52,255 --> 00:10:56,431
as a child in her lap and gave him to some lady.

88
00:10:57,864 --> 00:11:02,373
We did not deny,

89
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:05,148
as far as Hindus were concerned,

90
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:10,978
his saintliness, but the Muslims did not accept it.

91
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:15,443
There's another one who is called Haji Malang, who is very near

92
00:11:15,812 --> 00:11:18,636
Bombay, who was a realised soul.

93
00:11:19,356 --> 00:11:24,556
He, too, realised the fanaticism of the Shias.

94
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:28,489
`Shia' word comes from Siya;

95
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:31,174
in U.P. Sita is called as Siya.

96
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:34,925
Sitaji is called as `Siya'.

97
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:42,166
They also did not realise that there are saints who are not,

98
00:11:43,015 --> 00:11:47,183
so called, Muslims but they are saints.

99
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:49,505
So they could not get out of it.

100
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:52,945
So we have another one called Haji Malang

101
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,693
who was worshipped by Hindus.

102
00:11:57,338 --> 00:12:00,332
Some Muslims also go there, no doubt.

103
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:05,450
This Haji Malang

104
00:12:06,094 --> 00:12:10,714
was quite worried about the fanaticism of the Shias,

105
00:12:11,157 --> 00:12:15,132
so he appointed some Hindus to worship him,

106
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:17,691
just to counter balance.

107
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:19,947
They did all kinds of things.

108
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:22,990
There are many saints like that.

109
00:12:24,271 --> 00:12:30,099
I went to Bhopal. There is another big saint who was buried [there].

110
00:12:30,711 --> 00:12:36,328
But his all disciples were just depending on the earnings

111
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:39,939
of that place, which was very bad. Even

112
00:12:40,185 --> 00:12:44,092
Hazrat Nizamuddin's things are the same way as the Hindus do.

113
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:46,746
They all make an earnings,

114
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:50,343
I mean it's a kind of a commercial business.

115
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:57,488
So this saint died and was buried there.

116
00:12:57,858 --> 00:13:00,143
There were many people who were depending on it.

117
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,794
When I went there, I just, by the way, asked them,

118
00:13:04,754 --> 00:13:06,964
 'What is your religion?'

119
00:13:07,723 --> 00:13:09,366
So they said 'We are Muslims'.

120
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:12,971
I said what 'Was the religion of that saint who died?'

121
00:13:13,347 --> 00:13:15,855
He said 'Saints have no religions.'

122
00:13:17,415 --> 00:13:21,084
So I said 'Then why do you want to follow religion?
Why don't you follow his religion?'

123
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:23,187
They have no religions.

124
00:13:25,223 --> 00:13:29,262
Even, it is said, in Sanskrit,  the Sanyasis have no religions.

125
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:33,126
They are dharmatita, they go beyond the religion.

126
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:36,656
But as it has happened with every incarnation,

127
00:13:36,712 --> 00:13:40,444
it has happened even with the Shia people, with the Sunnis,

128
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:43,163
with the Hindus, with the Muslims and everyone,

129
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:45,928
that they made a fanatic group.

130
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:51,113
Now fanaticism itself is absolutely against religion,

131
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:55,359
against your innate religion within your-self

132
00:13:55,717 --> 00:13:58,216
because it creates poison.

133
00:13:59,944 --> 00:14:02,095
It's a venomous thing.

134
00:14:02,987 --> 00:14:05,518
It makes you hate others.

135
00:14:06,301 --> 00:14:08,587
When you start hating others,

136
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:12,637
then it reacts in you as horrible poison

137
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:17,373
which eats up all that is beautiful within you.

138
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:23,429
Hating any one

139
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:27,622
is the worst thing that human beings can do, but they can do it.

140
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:31,124
They can do whatever they like.
Animals do not hate any one.

141
00:14:31,493 --> 00:14:33,947
Can you imagine? They don't know how to hate.

142
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:36,608
They bite some one because that is their nature.

143
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:39,382
They cut some one because that's their nature.

144
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:41,606
They never hate someone.

145
00:14:41,902 --> 00:14:45,554
They may not like someone but this hatred, which is a poison,

146
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:50,924
is a speciality of human conception

147
00:14:51,132 --> 00:14:54,634
and human absorption. Only human beings can hate.

148
00:14:57,235 --> 00:14:59,983
And this horrible thing hatred

149
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:05,160
was settled between even the Muslims which was not done.

150
00:15:05,713 --> 00:15:10,079
This Karbala was not created for hatred, but for love.

151
00:15:10,972 --> 00:15:15,402
Everything that was done for love was converted into hatred,

152
00:15:15,526 --> 00:15:17,873
in every religion.

153
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:22,260
Now the worst part of the whole thing is,

154
00:15:22,436 --> 00:15:28,239
that one part which hates thinks the other part is the worst of all,

155
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:34,322
and the another part thinks that the first part is the worst of all.

156
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:40,162
Under what rule, law or logic they decide -

157
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:44,841
that is their own lookout. So they club together like that.

158
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:52,224
While this principle of the Gruhalakshmi was specially created

159
00:15:53,383 --> 00:15:56,057
to overcome that hatred,

160
00:15:56,526 --> 00:16:01,475
to subdue that icy stuff called hatred,

161
00:16:02,022 --> 00:16:05,432
to remove, from the minds of the people, hatred -

162
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:09,816
this Gruhalakshmi principle was created.

163
00:16:10,694 --> 00:16:16,045
How? In the family when you have a household,

164
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:25,357
the Gruhalakshmi principle has to subdue the hatred

165
00:16:25,782 --> 00:16:32,309
between the children, between the husband and the children.

166
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:37,553
But if she herself enjoys her hatred

167
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:41,138
then how can she subdue it?

168
00:16:41,337 --> 00:16:46,356
She is the source of that peace which subdues hatred.

169
00:16:46,628 --> 00:16:49,558
Now in India we have joint family [system], you too have

170
00:16:49,735 --> 00:16:52,592
relations like uncles, aunties, this that.

171
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:58,258
But the housewife's job is to smooth

172
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:06,640
smooth out all angularities of people which create friction.

173
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:13,227
Now the man has to worship a housewife.

174
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:17,118
It is said so, 'Yatra Narya Pujyante, Tatra Ramante Devata'-

175
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:20,582
'wherever the housewife is respected,

176
00:17:21,404 --> 00:17:24,158
there only the Gods reside'.

177
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:31,204
In our country, I, must say credit must go to the housewives

178
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,630
because we are no good for economics,

179
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:37,656
no good for politics, administration. Hopeless.

180
00:17:37,818 --> 00:17:39,461
Men folk are useless,

181
00:17:39,646 --> 00:17:42,407
they don't know any household work or anything,

182
00:17:42,535 --> 00:17:45,963
women have kept it to themselves, but our society is first class,

183
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,636
 is maintained by the women of the household.

184
00:17:51,013 --> 00:17:55,809
So the man has to respect the housewife, that's very important.

185
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,348
If he does not respect his housewife, there's no possibility

186
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:04,843
of any Gruhalakshmi tattva being maintained.

187
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,764
It's like the preservation of that

188
00:18:13,768 --> 00:18:17,586
principle of a housewife.

189
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:22,752
But some men, I mean many of them,

190
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:27,423
think that it is their birth right to ill-treat their wives,

191
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:31,824
to torture them, to say all kinds of things,

192
00:18:33,568 --> 00:18:36,432
to be angry,  if she is a good woman.

193
00:18:38,478 --> 00:18:40,693
 But if she is a nagger, if she is a bhoot,

194
00:18:40,874 --> 00:18:42,632
then they are subdued, completely subdued.

195
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:46,769
If the wife is a bhoot then husband always, sort of,

196
00:18:47,565 --> 00:18:51,870
tries to please her and be extremely kind to her.

197
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:55,001
He knows she is a bhoot, after all, you know, be careful

198
00:18:57,068 --> 00:19:00,260
 [you] don't know what time the bhoot will come like a snake on you!

199
00:19:00,858 --> 00:19:04,549
And if she knows how to nag or to argument,

200
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:06,941
then also they are afraid. There's no love,

201
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:09,366
they have no love or respect for each other

202
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:12,440
but they have an awe or fear.

203
00:19:14,197 --> 00:19:16,294
And they are afraid of such a woman.

204
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:21,447
Now some women think if they become flirtish then
 the husbands are better controlled.

205
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,867
But their basic principle they lose.

206
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,354
The basic shakti that they have, they lose,

207
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:35,249
and they land up in difficulties.

208
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:40,120
So the basic principle of a Gruhalakshmi

209
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:42,693
 is to respect her chastity,

210
00:19:45,056 --> 00:19:49,097
to respect her chastity outside, inside.

211
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:52,841
That is the steadiness of her.

212
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:55,976
Of course most of the men take advantage of it.

213
00:19:56,773 --> 00:20:01,427
If the wife is docile or obedient,

214
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:07,404
they make it a point that they just rule the wife, left and right.
 Alright!

215
00:20:09,353 --> 00:20:13,353
 But this woman, the housewife,

216
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:18,152
has to know that she is not docile.

217
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,761
She is obedient to her own righteousness,

218
00:20:24,772 --> 00:20:29,792
to her own virtues, to her own qualities.

219
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:34,107
If the husband is stupid, alright,

220
00:20:34,324 --> 00:20:36,768
he's stupid like a child, finished!

221
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:40,431
But the husband has to know that he must

222
00:20:40,715 --> 00:20:43,687
respect, otherwise he is a lost case, he's finished,

223
00:20:44,764 --> 00:20:46,768
he's good for nothing.

224
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:51,546
First thing is that he must see

225
00:20:51,777 --> 00:20:56,454
that the woman in the household is respected as a Gruhalakshmi.

226
00:20:57,364 --> 00:20:59,197
Then the blessings flow.

227
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:04,995
But in no way he should insult her

228
00:21:05,451 --> 00:21:08,425
 or be unkind to her

229
00:21:08,652 --> 00:21:11,903
 and raise his voice or say things to her.

230
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:17,493
But the wife has to be the one who is to be respected.

231
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:21,005
I have so many times said, your wife is dominating,

232
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:24,624
 give her two slaps on the face, of course, no doubt.

233
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:28,125
She has not to be dominating,

234
00:21:28,342 --> 00:21:32,389
she has to remove the dominating forces of others.

235
00:21:33,086 --> 00:21:35,514
She is the source of peace,

236
00:21:37,366 --> 00:21:39,813
she is the source of joy

237
00:21:40,203 --> 00:21:42,633
and she is the peacemaker.

238
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,294
If she is the one who creates problems,

239
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:50,639
then you can slap her nicely, bring her to her shape, is alright.

240
00:21:52,764 --> 00:21:56,274
 So this Gruhalakshmi tattva is mutual.

241
00:21:57,642 --> 00:22:01,207
It doesn't depend only on the wife or husband but both of them.

242
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:06,705
So once if you are making your wife suffer,

243
00:22:06,935 --> 00:22:10,811
your left Nabhi can never improve.

244
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:18,510
Or if you are a bad wife your left Nabhi cannot improve.

245
00:22:19,428 --> 00:22:22,562
 Now in the west the problem with women

246
00:22:22,678 --> 00:22:27,003
is this that they don't realise as to what is their power.

247
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:35,394
An eighty year old woman also would like to look like a bride.

248
00:22:36,394 --> 00:22:40,994
 They do not feel their dignity
and enjoy their dignity within themselves.

249
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,872
They are the queen of the house

250
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:47,780
but they want to behave like [a] cheapish, childish,

251
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,066
young frivolous girl.

252
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:54,858
They do not feel the dignity of their being,

253
00:22:55,327 --> 00:22:59,086
they talk too much, they behave in a manner

254
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:04,060
that, does not behove a housewife.

255
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:06,904
Like they'll take out their hands, talk like this,

256
00:23:07,404 --> 00:23:11,106
as the fisherwomen do, when they sell their fish to someone

257
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:13,284
and when they have to fight.

258
00:23:14,604 --> 00:23:17,805
Or they shout sometimes, they shout also, I mean,

259
00:23:17,956 --> 00:23:22,038
I heard they shout and sometimes they beat their husbands,
 that's the limit!

260
00:23:25,777 --> 00:23:29,340
 They start always comparing themselves

261
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,964
with the husband, to begin with.

262
00:23:32,385 --> 00:23:36,736
Like I am such a rich man's daughter,

263
00:23:36,888 --> 00:23:40,421
I am from such and such family, my husband is from such a

264
00:23:40,591 --> 00:23:42,966
low family he has no money,

265
00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:45,611
nothing, he's not educated, so ill-treat him.

266
00:23:46,096 --> 00:23:48,592
 Treat him in a manner that so no respect.

267
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:52,650
Such a woman will lose all her powers.

268
00:23:54,854 --> 00:23:59,745
Also in her own ways

269
00:24:00,277 --> 00:24:01,859
she will feel guilty,

270
00:24:02,487 --> 00:24:06,116
she'll feel guilty because, first of all, nobody has right

271
00:24:06,371 --> 00:24:10,262
to look down upon any one whatsoever in Sahaja Yoga specially.

272
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:17,986
Then, to look down upon your husband, is something unbelievable.

273
00:24:19,557 --> 00:24:22,664
He may not be a Sahaja Yogi. Alright.

274
00:24:22,991 --> 00:24:26,990
He may not be up to the point, but by your behaviour,

275
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:30,506
by your strength, by everything

276
00:24:32,876 --> 00:24:36,966
you can save him. But why are you losing yourself

277
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:43,481
by dominating others, by strangling others,

278
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:48,073
by making your husband a very, sort of a,

279
00:24:51,526 --> 00:24:53,938
frog in the well.

280
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:58,921
Telling him, 'Oh, we both are after all we should enjoy.

281
00:24:58,985 --> 00:25:00,628
Lets have our house separately,

282
00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:03,821
nobody should come in the house'.
 Even a rat won't enter that house.

283
00:25:05,954 --> 00:25:10,953
Even to say, 'Oh, these are my children, my husband, myself',

284
00:25:12,805 --> 00:25:16,659
is the negative of Sahaja Yoga,

285
00:25:17,453 --> 00:25:20,219
is the negative form of understanding.

286
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:24,580
These are absolutely absurd things,

287
00:25:24,692 --> 00:25:29,272
they do not look like, of any Sahaja Yogi or any sahaja yogini.

288
00:25:31,434 --> 00:25:33,737
 All this kind of selfishness,

289
00:25:34,023 --> 00:25:38,795
all this kind of seclusion is against Sahaja Yoga.

290
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:44,151
But a thing of a housewife is,

291
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:47,780
'Oh, now how much should I prepare?'

292
00:25:48,252 --> 00:25:51,825
 For example, 'There will be 50 persons coming.'

293
00:25:52,248 --> 00:25:54,446
 So the husband says 'But only 10 are coming.

294
00:25:54,573 --> 00:25:56,906
Why do you want to have for 50 persons ?'

295
00:25:57,386 --> 00:25:59,906
 'But may be they would like to eat more.'

296
00:26:00,494 --> 00:26:02,743
 'But then why do you have 50 plates?'

297
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:05,729
 'Maybe they might bring there friends.'

298
00:26:06,285 --> 00:26:09,782
So she thinks of her generosity.

299
00:26:10,076 --> 00:26:11,760
She enjoys her generosity.

300
00:26:12,427 --> 00:26:13,911
I have known many like that.

301
00:26:14,046 --> 00:26:16,950
 Though they are not even Sahaja Yoginis.

302
00:26:19,193 --> 00:26:21,494
They will say 'Will you come, sister in law,

303
00:26:21,574 --> 00:26:23,470
 will you come for dinner?'  'Oh, I am not coming,

304
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,748
 you cook too many things.' 'Not coming?

305
00:26:25,978 --> 00:26:28,665
 No, no, I'll cook very few things but please come.'

306
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:30,844
Then she just start thinking immediately.

307
00:26:30,996 --> 00:26:33,903
'What vegetables are available in the market?

308
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:36,310
What should I get? What is the best?'

309
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:41,317
 I mean, I am not their Guru, I am not their mother,

310
00:26:41,514 --> 00:26:43,738
I am just a relation,

311
00:26:44,581 --> 00:26:47,718
but they want to express their love through the food,

312
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:52,770
they are the giver of food - Annadha . They are the Annapurnas

313
00:26:54,403 --> 00:26:56,688
and this is one of  the quality,

314
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:59,188
 the generosity for woman doesn't have

315
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,788
she is not a sahaja yogini, by any chance. Take it from me.

316
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:08,049
Husband may be little miserly, doesn't matter,

317
00:27:10,554 --> 00:27:12,897
but wife has to be very generous

318
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,706
and sometimes, she secretly gives money,

319
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:20,188
not to her own children but to others.

320
00:27:22,177 --> 00:27:26,513
Such beautiful women have to be there in Sahaja Yoga.

321
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:30,502
But I feel so sorry, sometimes

322
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:35,394
that the attack comes from the women of Sahaja Yogi,

323
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,099
not from the men, on me. I'm a woman myself,

324
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,446
and I feel shocked that women should attack me like this, for what?

325
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:53,176
In Sahaja Yoga there is no domination of any kind

326
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:57,918
 but all these so called ideas of servility or domination comes

327
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:03,433
from the false ideas you have, about your own dignity,

328
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:06,954
about your own understanding.

329
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:09,693
You are not aware of yourself.

330
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:15,452
You do not know that you are the queen, nobody can dominate you.

331
00:28:15,957 --> 00:28:19,798
Who can dominate the lady, who rules the household?

332
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,472
If supposing the husband says, 'I don't like this colour!'

333
00:28:25,615 --> 00:28:27,337
  Alright, leave it for a while.

334
00:28:27,514 --> 00:28:29,701
Then somebody will come and say 'What a nice colour!'

335
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:32,622
 'Ah, such a nice colour, oh, don't change it.'

336
00:28:34,508 --> 00:28:37,391
The women must understand the men.

337
00:28:37,915 --> 00:28:41,456
 They have big eyes. They are not microscopic.

338
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:45,255
They see everything in a big way, you see.

339
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,782
So today they will say something, tomorrow they will forget about it

340
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:52,728
and they don't have microscopic eyes.

341
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:54,688
They are too above these things.

342
00:28:55,058 --> 00:28:58,975
They are above these things. You must understand that!

343
00:29:00,576 --> 00:29:04,854
But if he sits on the horse, 'I must also sit on the horse
and fall down.

344
00:29:05,588 --> 00:29:08,437
If he goes for skiing - I'll also go for skiing.

345
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:12,592
If he develops his muscles - I'll also develop my muscles.'

346
00:29:14,566 --> 00:29:16,645
It is coming to that point.

347
00:29:17,026 --> 00:29:19,800
I mean women start looking like nothing on earth.

348
00:29:19,935 --> 00:29:22,945
You don't know what sort of women these are with big, big muscles

349
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:25,622
without any moustaches.

350
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:33,448
So this kind of stupid ideas we have.

351
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:36,364
But there is no subordination of any kind.

352
00:29:36,452 --> 00:29:38,810
You are subordinated to your own dignity,

353
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:42,249
to your own chastity, to your own sense of honour

354
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:45,151
and, above all, to your righteousness

355
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:49,599
 because you are in charge of that. The man who is in charge,

356
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:53,668
has to look after that side.

357
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:56,894
How many quarrels you create?

358
00:29:57,046 --> 00:30:01,486
How can you be quarrelsome
when you are supposed to become the peacemaker?

359
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,305
Supposing we send two peacemakers

360
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:08,239
to some country to make peace and they cut each other's throat,

361
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,694
what will you say to such a thing?

362
00:30:13,405 --> 00:30:16,684
You are the one who has to smooth down every thing,

363
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:22,205
you have  the one who has to bring such

364
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:27,545
expression of love, such sweet things

365
00:30:30,614 --> 00:30:36,562
that the family itself feels rested in you, secured

366
00:30:37,097 --> 00:30:39,080
because you are the mother.

367
00:30:39,512 --> 00:30:42,210
The family must feel secured within you

368
00:30:43,149 --> 00:30:46,453
 and this love is your power.

369
00:30:48,905 --> 00:30:51,555
 This is your power that you can give love

370
00:30:51,986 --> 00:30:56,433
and giving love you will find, you will always enrich yourself.

371
00:30:57,851 --> 00:31:01,343
I mean imagine what presents I give compared to what I get.

372
00:31:01,446 --> 00:31:03,843
 I don't know I'll have to build another house!

373
00:31:04,044 --> 00:31:06,281
I am telling them "Don't give me individual present.

374
00:31:06,384 --> 00:31:08,170
 I will not take any individual presents."

375
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:10,878
Now still despite that. I don't know,

376
00:31:11,085 --> 00:31:16,761
just with love if I get something with care, that love, you know,

377
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,180
itself manifests and comes back to you like a poetry.

378
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:24,404
You are some times surprised.

379
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:30,387
 I'll give you one simple example of my own life

380
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:34,097
which will tell you how love can work it out.

381
00:31:34,716 --> 00:31:38,037
I was a housewife to begin with and to end with, I think.

382
00:31:38,653 --> 00:31:40,994
And once I was in Delhi,

383
00:31:41,248 --> 00:31:46,133
my daughter was to be born, so I was knitting something for her,

384
00:31:46,248 --> 00:31:47,701
sitting outside in the lawn,

385
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:51,808
 when three persons walked into the house, one lady and two men

386
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:54,478
and they came and said, "See now we are...

387
00:31:54,716 --> 00:31:58,099
housewife, I am a housewife and these two are,

388
00:31:58,218 --> 00:32:00,889
one is my husband and he is the friend of my husband

389
00:32:01,056 --> 00:32:02,288
and he is a Muslim,

390
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:05,694
and we have come to you for shelter because we are refugees."

391
00:32:06,242 --> 00:32:08,495
I looked at them, they looked very good to Me,

392
00:32:08,591 --> 00:32:09,805
 they were quite alright.

393
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:13,400
I said, "Alright you please settle down in my house."

394
00:32:13,623 --> 00:32:15,841
So I gave them the outside room which had a kitchen

395
00:32:15,945 --> 00:32:18,026
and a bathroom and this thing,

396
00:32:18,193 --> 00:32:20,673
and for the gentleman, I said, "There is another spare room,

397
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:23,062
you can stay there, and husband wife can stay here."

398
00:32:24,515 --> 00:32:26,440
In the evening my brother came in.

399
00:32:26,592 --> 00:32:28,440
He started shouting at the top of his voice,

400
00:32:28,576 --> 00:32:29,609
he said "What is this?

401
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,895
You don't know these people, they may be thieves,

402
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:36,137
they may be this, they might do this...[UNCLEAR]

403
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:38,025
my husband came, he also joined him

404
00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:41,398
 because, you see, they were friends!
He told you

405
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,418
All men just the same, you see,

406
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:46,652
so he said, "You see, she doesn't understand

407
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:48,685
she has kept these three persons here.

408
00:32:48,852 --> 00:32:51,790
God knows, what they are, saying refugees, this thing.

409
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:54,294
She doesn't know, he's a Muslim, he's a Hindu.

410
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,622
God knows, she's two husbands, one husband" like that,

411
00:32:57,749 --> 00:32:59,251
all kind of things.

412
00:33:00,955 --> 00:33:02,835
Next morning they forgot about that.

413
00:33:03,598 --> 00:33:06,274
I said "Alright. Let them be there for one night. Is alright?

414
00:33:06,814 --> 00:33:08,761
I can't drag them out today, one night."

415
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,360
Next morning they forgot that they where living there.

416
00:33:11,701 --> 00:33:12,782
That's like men!

417
00:33:12,878 --> 00:33:14,846
First day, such a blasting, such a blasting,

418
00:33:14,965 --> 00:33:18,342
I said "Alright, one night. Now don't shout. They will feel hurt.

419
00:33:18,668 --> 00:33:21,502
So let them stay one night, they'll be soothed down."

420
00:33:22,146 --> 00:33:24,531
Next morning they went away for their work.

421
00:33:24,634 --> 00:33:27,229
 They had no time. It was, you see,

422
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:30,858
only on a weekend they become active in the household,

423
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:34,202
otherwise they are inactive. So they went away.

424
00:33:35,342 --> 00:33:38,753
It so happened that these people stayed with me for one month.

425
00:33:39,122 --> 00:33:42,299
Then this lady got a job

426
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:48,837
and she went away with her husband and this Muslim.

427
00:33:49,123 --> 00:33:53,672
But in the meanwhile there was a big riot in Delhi, very big riot

428
00:33:54,101 --> 00:34:00,893
Because many Hindus and Sikh people were killed in Punjab.

429
00:34:01,354 --> 00:34:03,159
It had a reflection in Delhi

430
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:05,572
and they started killing all the Muslims there.

431
00:34:06,005 --> 00:34:09,926
So, three, four Sikh people and one or two Hindus came to my house

432
00:34:10,061 --> 00:34:13,716
and they said "We are told that you have a Muslim staying with you."

433
00:34:14,044 --> 00:34:15,861
I said, "No. How can I have?"

434
00:34:16,338 --> 00:34:18,516
They said, "There is a Muslim. We have to kill him."

435
00:34:18,787 --> 00:34:21,701
I said "See I am wearing such a big teeka (bindi),
can you believe it

436
00:34:22,003 --> 00:34:24,213
that I could have a Muslim in the house?"

437
00:34:25,269 --> 00:34:28,597
They thought I must be a real Hindu fanatic, you see!

438
00:34:32,342 --> 00:34:35,121
So they believed me. I said, "See now,

439
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,677
if you have to go in my house, you'll go on my dead body

440
00:34:37,796 --> 00:34:39,343
because I will not allow you!"

441
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:41,605
So they felt quite frightened. They went away.

442
00:34:41,811 --> 00:34:46,592
So this fellow heard My things and he came and he said,

443
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,637
"I'm surprised. How did you risk your life?"

444
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:51,304
 I said, "There is nothing. Nothing."

445
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,076
His life was saved.

446
00:34:53,581 --> 00:34:56,049
 Now this gentleman, this Muslim gentleman,

447
00:34:56,191 --> 00:34:59,184
became a great poet called Sahir Ludhianvi,

448
00:35:01,043 --> 00:35:03,667
and this lady became a great actress,

449
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:06,012
Kai nau ahe tenza?
(What is her name?)

450
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:08,694
 the one who used to act like a mother?

451
00:35:10,168 --> 00:35:13,345
Ha, Sachadev, Achala Sachadev.

452
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:17,302
I knew it was, they had become one day and all that.

453
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,270
But I didn't tell anybody about it.

454
00:35:19,477 --> 00:35:22,639
I said "Now supposing they come to know, I am in Bombay,

455
00:35:22,846 --> 00:35:24,611
they will just go mad about Me,"

456
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,904
and I said "I have no time for all that."

457
00:35:27,246 --> 00:35:32,053
So, we started a film centre for the young people,

458
00:35:32,136 --> 00:35:33,358
to give them some good films.

459
00:35:33,445 --> 00:35:36,137
But it all made into a farce, later on.

460
00:35:36,366 --> 00:35:38,511
 They never listened to Me, but whatever it is.

461
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:43,283
So they said "We should get this Achala Sachadev to act as a mother"

462
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:45,281
I said "Alright ,but don't tell her

463
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:47,503
 I have said, I have anything to do with it."

464
00:35:48,783 --> 00:35:53,882
So, years had passed, about I think about twelve  years or so.

465
00:35:55,943 --> 00:35:58,651
So they went and told her. So she was fussing like an actress.

466
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,439
"No, no - how much are you going to pay me? I cannot act free.

467
00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:04,330
Everybody will ask for free. Then how can I give you free.

468
00:36:04,466 --> 00:36:05,824
You will have to give me Sari.

469
00:36:05,912 --> 00:36:07,666
You'll have to give so much money. This thing."

470
00:36:07,743 --> 00:36:09,674
They said "Alright come to the muhurat at least.

471
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,517
Come to the muhurat", to the beginning,

472
00:36:11,629 --> 00:36:14,414
 big muhurat is the one where you start it.

473
00:36:15,087 --> 00:36:18,510
 So she came and I was there. She looked at Me

474
00:36:18,688 --> 00:36:20,769
and just, you know, she couldn't believe

475
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:22,557
 that she has seen Me after twelve years.

476
00:36:22,669 --> 00:36:24,783
The tears starting swelling her eyes.

477
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:27,918
Absolutely she couldn't say anything, just she came and

478
00:36:28,577 --> 00:36:30,524
fell into my arms

479
00:36:30,947 --> 00:36:34,489
and she said "Where were you last all these days?

480
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,642
I have been trying to trace you out."

481
00:36:36,906 --> 00:36:40,099
Then she started describing Me and all.

482
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:43,030
Then Sahir Ludhianvi was there and he said,

483
00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:46,286
"How this Lady is here?" They said, "This is Her work."

484
00:36:46,607 --> 00:36:49,577
"Oh God, why didn't you tell us? You see,

485
00:36:49,688 --> 00:36:51,378
we'll give our lives for Her!"

486
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,002
And they were all amazed, how they were changed.

487
00:36:54,114 --> 00:36:56,743
"No money, nothing, I am going to give money for this project.

488
00:36:56,957 --> 00:36:58,024
Nothing doing. "

489
00:36:58,253 --> 00:36:59,253
 See now,

490
00:36:59,661 --> 00:37:02,892
I was a housewife just an ordinary housewife.

491
00:37:03,202 --> 00:37:06,848
I didn't have so many rights on

492
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,632
my husband's property, or anything,

493
00:37:10,736 --> 00:37:12,896
and my brother another dominating fellow,

494
00:37:13,126 --> 00:37:15,755
both of them put together,

495
00:37:15,978 --> 00:37:18,392
just were about to kill me that night,

496
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:22,246
with their temper and anger. I soothed them down

497
00:37:23,048 --> 00:37:25,338
and then you know when I told my husband

498
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:27,577
and my brother, they were amazed.

499
00:37:27,736 --> 00:37:30,246
I said, "They are the ones who have become like this

500
00:37:30,684 --> 00:37:32,192
 and see the change,

501
00:37:32,621 --> 00:37:34,958
how much they have...",

502
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:38,240
and they said, "No more, we are going to say

503
00:37:38,328 --> 00:37:40,178
no to any charitable institution.

504
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:42,211
This is the last mistake we have committed!"

505
00:37:42,378 --> 00:37:47,398
And the whole idea of a...

506
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:52,498
earning and money just toppled down.

507
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:56,016
And she has acted in many films for charity

508
00:37:56,731 --> 00:38:01,356
and this Ludhianvi also wrote many things for charity.

509
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:08,911
So a woman can make a man a charitable personality -

510
00:38:10,012 --> 00:38:12,226
because she herself is charitable.

511
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:15,641
She has so many beautiful..she's an artist!

512
00:38:16,924 --> 00:38:19,209
And she can create beauty around her,

513
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,452
in her household, in her family, in her society.

514
00:38:23,611 --> 00:38:25,455
Everywhere. But no!

515
00:38:25,624 --> 00:38:29,076
Women want to fight like men. They will have associations.

516
00:38:29,555 --> 00:38:34,360
They would have called that [UNCLEAR]

517
00:38:36,661 --> 00:38:38,233
 [UNCLEAR]

518
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,384
unions, unions  they will like to have unions to fight for that.

519
00:38:45,773 --> 00:38:49,511
I agree that some of the men have been extremely cruel,

520
00:38:49,622 --> 00:38:52,705
some of the laws have been extremely cruel, this thing, that thing,

521
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,351
and that they have to be told.

522
00:38:56,045 --> 00:38:57,854
But this is not the way!

523
00:38:58,365 --> 00:39:03,872
 There is another way of improving these men, who try to

524
00:39:05,437 --> 00:39:06,689
destroy the women,

525
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:11,898
because women have one very great quality that Ganas are with them

526
00:39:14,397 --> 00:39:16,959
and Shri Ganapati is with them.

527
00:39:17,284 --> 00:39:20,201
He will never side with men if they are chaste

528
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:23,435
and do not try to show off their body

529
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:26,268
 and show off their beauty and want to make,

530
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,805
sort of, a capital out of it.

531
00:39:31,857 --> 00:39:35,613
Such women are extremely powerful,

532
00:39:37,101 --> 00:39:39,635
extremely powerful, and they show their valour

533
00:39:39,913 --> 00:39:41,439
when it comes to anything

534
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:45,100
like we had Jhansi ki Rani. She was an ordinary housewife.

535
00:39:45,577 --> 00:39:46,999
She fought the British.

536
00:39:47,206 --> 00:39:48,946
And the British also

537
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:51,623
were surprised at her valour and they said that

538
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,347
we had got Jhansi, alright,

539
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,636
but the glory goes to the Queen of Jhansi.

540
00:39:59,738 --> 00:40:02,166
Like that we had many, Noorjahan we had,

541
00:40:02,397 --> 00:40:05,883
we had Ahilya Bai. We had many great women in India

542
00:40:06,012 --> 00:40:09,465
because of these institutions. Padmini we had,

543
00:40:10,565 --> 00:40:13,385
Chand Bibi. There's so many women we can mention

544
00:40:13,592 --> 00:40:16,982
who have been great women, who were housewives.

545
00:40:20,361 --> 00:40:27,127
So the woman's qualities are like the potential of the mother earth

546
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,918
or potential of any energy.

547
00:40:29,069 --> 00:40:31,966
 Like electricity has its potential somewhere else.

548
00:40:32,093 --> 00:40:34,421
You see the lights here, makes no difference,

549
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:37,900
 one light or two lights, but the potential is important.

550
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:41,137
So one has to understand that we are potential

551
00:40:41,312 --> 00:40:45,282
and to preserve our potential we must have the sense of dignity,

552
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:48,348
honour and righteousness within ourselves.

553
00:40:48,595 --> 00:40:52,179
Now men must respect their women who are like this.

554
00:40:52,592 --> 00:40:54,586
 But men are another stupid stuff

555
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,677
because they will not respect a woman

556
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:00,449
who loves them, who is chaste,

557
00:41:00,643 --> 00:41:03,817
who is good, who wants them to become collective,

558
00:41:03,971 --> 00:41:06,972
who wants them to give, who be charitable,

559
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:10,594
who wants that Sahaja Yoga should be promoted

560
00:41:10,746 --> 00:41:14,034
and the one who wants that her husband should be happy

561
00:41:14,217 --> 00:41:18,246
and joyous and that he should come to Sahaja Yoga as well.

562
00:41:18,693 --> 00:41:22,457
Instead of that they run after some funny, stupid women.

563
00:41:24,994 --> 00:41:30,258
 What is there to be so attracted towards bhootish women,

564
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:33,459
must be some bhoots in them, I don't know,

565
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,193
that the way they get attracted.

566
00:41:35,725 --> 00:41:38,586
As a result of all this misbehaviour of men,

567
00:41:38,848 --> 00:41:41,000
women become very insecure

568
00:41:41,528 --> 00:41:43,988
and they get insecured. As a result,

569
00:41:44,195 --> 00:41:46,785
the men suffer and women suffer.

570
00:41:48,153 --> 00:41:51,431
A man who neglects his wife, and treats like that,

571
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:56,880
will consequently get blood cancer.

572
00:42:04,901 --> 00:42:07,099
And the woman who behaves like this,

573
00:42:09,614 --> 00:42:14,004
in this manner and if she ill-treats

574
00:42:14,354 --> 00:42:17,769
her husband, will get asthma

575
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:23,776
or of a very serious type of cirrhosis,

576
00:42:26,305 --> 00:42:29,749
could be brain damage, could be paralysis,

577
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:34,367
could be complete dehydration of the body.

578
00:42:39,597 --> 00:42:42,240
Because left nabhi is so important.

579
00:42:43,383 --> 00:42:46,676
If the left Nabhi is made hectic, as you know

580
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:51,543
by your running about and by jumping about and by being hectic,

581
00:42:52,259 --> 00:42:56,285
that left Nabhi becomes hectic and you develop blood cancer.

582
00:42:56,749 --> 00:42:58,276
I have always seen

583
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:02,823
 that the women who are thin, their husbands as jittery - why?

584
00:43:04,924 --> 00:43:07,482
Because the wife is all the time making him run up and down.

585
00:43:07,593 --> 00:43:09,984
"Do this, do that, you didn't bring this thing for me!

586
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:12,605
I had asked you to bring the Coca-cola you didn't bring!

587
00:43:12,793 --> 00:43:15,131
You didn't do that!" As if he's the sinner all the time.

588
00:43:15,711 --> 00:43:19,326
And the man becomes jumpy all the time, jumpy.

589
00:43:20,544 --> 00:43:23,720
He gets something for the jumping

590
00:43:23,962 --> 00:43:27,652
and she gets something for her torturing.

591
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:32,641
There's no love. There's no joy. There's no happiness.

592
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:38,682
This so-called figure madness,

593
00:43:39,145 --> 00:43:42,454
which is now subsiding, thank God. It's coming from America now.

594
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:47,784
 It's subsiding. This figure madness makes you funny.

595
00:43:50,934 --> 00:43:53,552
Women have to be settled down women.

596
00:43:54,796 --> 00:43:56,796
They have to be Grahasthis,

597
00:43:57,028 --> 00:43:59,519
that is, 'The one who settles in the household'.

598
00:43:59,784 --> 00:44:02,157
 Said to be satisfied with her household.

599
00:44:02,676 --> 00:44:04,590
If she is all the time running about,

600
00:44:04,693 --> 00:44:06,274
 she doesn't want to stay in the house

601
00:44:06,402 --> 00:44:10,587
then she is not a housewife, but she is a maid servant.

602
00:44:13,016 --> 00:44:17,794
There is a saying that there was a lady who was a maid servant,

603
00:44:18,024 --> 00:44:20,209
and then she was made a housewife

604
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:22,625
but she could not stop her running about

605
00:44:22,816 --> 00:44:24,721
because she was a maid servant.

606
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:28,514
She doesn't settle in the household.

607
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:32,691
Now for whom is the household, is not only for herself,

608
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:36,163
No, not for her husband, no, not for her children

609
00:44:36,486 --> 00:44:38,581
but for others to welcome.

610
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,299
Like this Mother Earth has spread all these beautiful things for you

611
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:44,743
 to come and sit and enjoy.

612
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:48,303
But is a very common thing, also that in Sahaja Yoga,

613
00:44:48,414 --> 00:44:51,210
we find that people, after marriage,

614
00:44:51,346 --> 00:44:55,611
become absolutely engrossed into each other and lose Sahaja Yoga.

615
00:44:57,101 --> 00:45:00,753
Then their children suffer. Their children become fussy, funny

616
00:45:01,047 --> 00:45:04,271
and disobedient, torturesome.

617
00:45:05,227 --> 00:45:09,487
They have some physical problems also - is a punishment.

618
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,595
Not that I punish this,

619
00:45:12,759 --> 00:45:15,139
but it is your own nature that punishes - supposing you

620
00:45:15,248 --> 00:45:18,190
put your hand in the fire, it will burn.

621
00:45:18,429 --> 00:45:21,444
I mean who is punishing? You are punishing yourself!

622
00:45:24,428 --> 00:45:27,004
Then children become funny.

623
00:45:28,798 --> 00:45:31,114
 Just for your family, just for your food,

624
00:45:31,223 --> 00:45:34,742
just for your household, this selfishness,

625
00:45:35,982 --> 00:45:39,148
if it crawls up into man, then God save that family.

626
00:45:39,365 --> 00:45:42,292
If it's a woman, its alright, at least a little bit

627
00:45:42,761 --> 00:45:45,264
but if the man is a gone case,

628
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:51,266
that I should have a house, I should have a job,

629
00:45:51,411 --> 00:45:54,757
I should look after my children, it's for my family.

630
00:45:56,178 --> 00:46:00,779
Our family is not of one man one woman

631
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:03,635
but the whole universe is our family.

632
00:46:06,015 --> 00:46:08,387
We are not on our own,

633
00:46:09,036 --> 00:46:12,513
 and if you become arbitrary, and if you become secluded.

634
00:46:13,262 --> 00:46:16,024
I must tell you one thing and warn you today

635
00:46:16,422 --> 00:46:19,068
that-  those people who will try to seclude themselves,

636
00:46:19,435 --> 00:46:20,870
a day will come,

637
00:46:21,072 --> 00:46:25,601
when they will have horrid diseases on them don't blame Sahaja Yoga!

638
00:46:26,431 --> 00:46:31,443
Sahaja Yoga has it's own beautiful realm of God's Kingdom.

639
00:46:31,551 --> 00:46:34,465
But in the God's Kingdom, you have to be collective.

640
00:46:37,348 --> 00:46:41,618
But a bad wife can create problems because she's..[INAUDIBLE]

641
00:46:41,812 --> 00:46:45,599
and she'll create a problem she'll form a group of people,

642
00:46:45,716 --> 00:46:46,942
group of women,

643
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:51,250
 she'll go on rolling down with her bhoots to everyone.

644
00:46:58,064 --> 00:47:00,827
Or may be she's very conscious of her education

645
00:47:00,964 --> 00:47:04,591
may be conscious of her position or of her money and all that -

646
00:47:04,801 --> 00:47:08,364
then also she will try to keep the husband aloof.

647
00:47:12,285 --> 00:47:15,589
Such people have to pay for what they have done.

648
00:47:15,741 --> 00:47:19,029
Not because it is a punishment from God.

649
00:47:22,685 --> 00:47:26,184
 So Gruhalakshmi tattva in Sahaja Yoga is very important.

650
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:32,731
Those people who have got problems after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

651
00:47:32,897 --> 00:47:36,835
most of them have neglected their Gruhalakshmi principle.

652
00:47:41,074 --> 00:47:44,724
Because Gruhalakshmi, if it goes out, then centre heart catches.

653
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:50,104
Those women who have tried such tricks,

654
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:54,092
 should give up immediately because it's very indignified.

655
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:56,284
Nobody respects such a woman.

656
00:47:57,812 --> 00:48:01,000
It's very true with the leaders' wives and the leaders.

657
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,598
The leader's wife or the leadership

658
00:48:04,714 --> 00:48:12,272
is a minimal of a minimal of a minimal  of a so-called position.

659
00:48:12,994 --> 00:48:14,984
Most insignificant.

660
00:48:17,276 --> 00:48:21,258
What you got is much higher than this.

661
00:48:23,298 --> 00:48:28,174
If you ask a saint to become a king. He'll say, What?

662
00:48:28,785 --> 00:48:31,274
You want to put the ocean into a cup?

663
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:39,185
Is the minimal of minimal.

664
00:48:39,538 --> 00:48:41,212
Is the lowest of lowest.

665
00:48:41,529 --> 00:48:45,366
Those who think their life is service are another stupid people.

666
00:48:46,865 --> 00:48:49,426
Their life is enjoyment, not service.

667
00:48:51,668 --> 00:48:54,705
But that service itself is enjoyment.

668
00:48:55,894 --> 00:48:57,848
 But if you just keep to service.

669
00:48:58,087 --> 00:49:02,162
"Oh, I am sacrificing, this is my tapasya!" Finished!

670
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:08,688
Then you end up like a tapasvi,
with like a beanstalk [figure] - thin.

671
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:11,493
You can be used for a cross!

672
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,980
So, in Sahaja Yoga it is enjoyment but,

673
00:49:19,115 --> 00:49:22,827
 unless and until you have that essence

674
00:49:22,954 --> 00:49:26,355
of enjoyment into everything, it cannot be an enjoyment.

675
00:49:28,295 --> 00:49:33,310
If you take out the essence from the cane sugar

676
00:49:34,508 --> 00:49:38,476
or what you call the sugar cane bamboo,

677
00:49:38,969 --> 00:49:40,765
then what is left?

678
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:44,967
In the same way, all the so-called service

679
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:47,445
and seva and tapasya

680
00:49:47,668 --> 00:49:50,932
and all that has no sweetness in it,  finished.

681
00:49:52,952 --> 00:49:56,002
So the essence of all this is sweetness

682
00:49:57,572 --> 00:50:00,135
and that is generated by women.

683
00:50:02,174 --> 00:50:04,531
But they are very strict. "Don't spoil this.

684
00:50:04,682 --> 00:50:06,627
Keep this nice, keep that nice."

685
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:10,178
The husband comes home like as if like a criminal, you know.

686
00:50:15,711 --> 00:50:19,131
He has to be like a bull in a china shop, he has to be.

687
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:22,328
It's a good thing in a way.

688
00:50:23,535 --> 00:50:27,625
Is nice, how he doesn't know anything, is even better for you.

689
00:50:32,046 --> 00:50:34,254
But to make him all the time slave,

690
00:50:34,373 --> 00:50:37,182
"Do this! You didn't do this for me! Do that for me!",

691
00:50:37,345 --> 00:50:39,566
Is not the job of a housewife!

692
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:48,809
Her job is like the Mother Earth. Does She complain?
Nothing.

693
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,412
She gives you everything.

694
00:50:51,508 --> 00:50:54,618
So much is the sustenance in [UNCLEAR]. So dignity.

695
00:50:55,196 --> 00:50:56,714
Such powers She has.

696
00:50:56,873 --> 00:50:59,794
What does She care for anybody giving her anything?

697
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:03,957
 You will be amazed if I tell you today, till today, till yesterday,

698
00:51:04,053 --> 00:51:07,778
I never asked my husband to buy me anything.

699
00:51:08,004 --> 00:51:12,426
For the first time I asked him to buy me a camera,

700
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:15,136
and you see the result, in the evening what he said.

701
00:51:15,343 --> 00:51:16,933
Least expected!

702
00:51:18,898 --> 00:51:20,802
Never in life-time.

703
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,091
He used to say, "You must tell me what you want".

704
00:51:24,297 --> 00:51:26,384
First time, I said something and see the effect.

705
00:51:26,488 --> 00:51:29,011
Because I've never said him!

706
00:51:31,796 --> 00:51:35,097
 So such a woman has to be self-satisfied,

707
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,790
satisfied in her self because she has to give.

708
00:51:37,889 --> 00:51:40,770
The person who has to give, how can she demand?

709
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:43,677
She has to give love because she is love.

710
00:51:44,198 --> 00:51:46,697
She has to give all the services.

711
00:51:46,817 --> 00:51:48,739
She has to give all the possessions,

712
00:51:48,882 --> 00:51:52,194
she has to sooth down. What a responsibility, I tell you,

713
00:51:52,314 --> 00:51:54,269
what a responsibility!

714
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:58,367
More than a Prime Minister, more than any king or anyone,

715
00:51:58,537 --> 00:52:00,267
is the responsibility of a woman,

716
00:52:00,402 --> 00:52:03,595
and she should feel proud of it,
 that such a responsibility has come to me.

717
00:52:04,326 --> 00:52:05,698
A housewife

718
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:09,365
 has much more responsibility than a leader of Sahaja Yoga.

719
00:52:10,362 --> 00:52:14,594
But the wives of leaders can be horrid

720
00:52:16,281 --> 00:52:18,320
because they think they have become leaders.

721
00:52:18,471 --> 00:52:20,037
I mean, this is the minimal of minimum.

722
00:52:20,156 --> 00:52:23,746
I mean it's like, I said, the ocean coming into a little cup.

723
00:52:25,877 --> 00:52:29,769
And their behaviour becomes so funny and absurd, I am surprised.

724
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:34,329
 I was married in a family where we had 100 people living together

725
00:52:38,263 --> 00:52:41,734
and each one of them adores Me.

726
00:52:42,266 --> 00:52:44,682
If I go somewhere in Lucknow,

727
00:52:44,833 --> 00:52:47,113
all of them will come from all over to see  me

728
00:52:47,193 --> 00:52:50,314
but my husband goes, nobody comes to see him.
He always complains.

729
00:52:51,216 --> 00:52:55,409
He's the relation, I am not the relation,
 and they come and see me, not him!

730
00:52:58,098 --> 00:53:00,130
If I had not given them love,

731
00:53:00,265 --> 00:53:02,681
if I had not given them whatever they wanted

732
00:53:03,114 --> 00:53:04,995
they would have not come to Me.

733
00:53:06,468 --> 00:53:10,572
So they are the preservers, preservers of others.

734
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:13,774
 They don't have to preserve things for themselves.

735
00:53:15,762 --> 00:53:19,208
And we have many stupid women with us, I tell you,

736
00:53:19,343 --> 00:53:20,973
many stupid women.

737
00:53:21,426 --> 00:53:24,824
We call them buddhu (idiot) in Hindi language, the buddhus.

738
00:53:26,989 --> 00:53:29,957
Because they don't know what power they have got.

739
00:53:33,441 --> 00:53:36,647
They don't know what responsibility they have.

740
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,651
 I'm an example before them.

741
00:53:44,932 --> 00:53:48,550
 And this is the very big problem with me that practically

742
00:53:48,844 --> 00:53:52,036
I think 60% leaders have horrible wives.

743
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:54,659
I must say, horrible.

744
00:53:57,173 --> 00:53:59,728
And Sahaja Yoga goes 'dhup' like that with them.

745
00:54:00,756 --> 00:54:02,676
They can't live in an ashram,

746
00:54:02,811 --> 00:54:05,934
they will have their food,
 the husband must see that they have their food.

747
00:54:06,053 --> 00:54:08,881
But it is they who have to feed everyone,

748
00:54:09,064 --> 00:54:12,653
everybody has to be looked after and at the end they should eat.

749
00:54:16,257 --> 00:54:19,717
Everybody must get a bed, they must see everybody is sleeping now,

750
00:54:19,868 --> 00:54:22,790
they must cover all the children, everything, then they must sleep.

751
00:54:25,728 --> 00:54:26,965
But No, they sit down,

752
00:54:27,101 --> 00:54:29,902
they become mini-matajis or greater-than-matajis.

753
00:54:30,585 --> 00:54:33,286
"Get me this thing! Get me that!

754
00:54:33,421 --> 00:54:35,281
Just do that! Do this!"

755
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:42,057
They don't know how to cook, most of them.

756
00:54:43,086 --> 00:54:46,839
Every wife of a leader

757
00:54:47,088 --> 00:54:51,984
has to cook and learn cooking. It's compulsory now.

758
00:54:56,753 --> 00:54:59,546
They have to cook. And with heart.

759
00:55:00,018 --> 00:55:04,112
They should be able to cook and give with love to others.

760
00:55:04,742 --> 00:55:07,142
That's the minimum of Annapurna.

761
00:55:09,668 --> 00:55:12,572
And the husband shouldn't find faults with them.

762
00:55:12,847 --> 00:55:15,865
In the beginning they might make mistakes then encourage.

763
00:55:16,175 --> 00:55:19,249
Encourage their qualities, encourage their goodness,

764
00:55:19,379 --> 00:55:21,577
encourage their niceness.

765
00:55:21,879 --> 00:55:24,335
 Also I have seen, some very good ladies

766
00:55:24,407 --> 00:55:27,289
who were taking very active life in Sahaja Yoga.

767
00:55:27,393 --> 00:55:28,650
After marriage they are lost.

768
00:55:28,714 --> 00:55:31,919
Husbands are also supposed to be Sahaja Yogis - lost.

769
00:55:34,117 --> 00:55:37,942
Sometimes they appear, sometimes if I am there they come,
 otherwise they are not there.

770
00:55:38,921 --> 00:55:42,765
Today I was asking Arnaud,
 he told me so many of them are like that here.

771
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:46,493
That means there's something wrong with the husbands

772
00:55:47,901 --> 00:55:50,218
because before marriage they were better off.

773
00:55:51,773 --> 00:55:56,375
 So how much it is important, a Gruhakshmi Principle with in us,

774
00:55:56,788 --> 00:55:58,674
for us to be together,

775
00:55:58,937 --> 00:56:02,127
to us to grow together. To feel the togetherness,

776
00:56:02,376 --> 00:56:04,875
all the time, the oneness that is within us.

777
00:56:05,548 --> 00:56:09,016
 So yesterday, as I told you, that I'll tell you about

778
00:56:09,175 --> 00:56:10,833
the Ragas we have.

779
00:56:11,064 --> 00:56:12,878
Ra is energy.

780
00:56:13,712 --> 00:56:17,518
Ga is in Sanskrit language 'Ga, Gayathi'  means 'which penetrates',

781
00:56:17,677 --> 00:56:19,018
'which moves into everything',

782
00:56:20,201 --> 00:56:23,243
it's the ethereal, etheric qualities.

783
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,074
etheric...... into which you see

784
00:56:26,241 --> 00:56:29,114
You put anything in the ether and  you can receive it anywhere.

785
00:56:29,924 --> 00:56:34,371
 So the Raga, is the energy which goes into ether

786
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,336
and touches your spirit.

787
00:56:40,228 --> 00:56:41,672
That is the Raga.

788
00:56:42,302 --> 00:56:47,774
And these Ragas, I would say are something like a housewife.

789
00:56:52,823 --> 00:56:56,878
Supposing if you stand with a military band

790
00:56:57,345 --> 00:57:00,558
you will be fed up, "left right, left right, left right".

791
00:57:02,396 --> 00:57:06,493
But a beautiful melody that's a melodious thing, melody.

792
00:57:06,703 --> 00:57:11,553
And this melody itself is suggestive of a beauty.

793
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:16,407
 The way the housewife decorates the house.

794
00:57:16,863 --> 00:57:20,999
She smoothes down everyone, makes them feel happy.

795
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:23,155
Then she's looking after everyone.

796
00:57:23,235 --> 00:57:25,354
 Everybody knows she is standing there.

797
00:57:25,522 --> 00:57:29,636
Imagine, like a modern style would be, you call

798
00:57:29,899 --> 00:57:33,457
some people for birthday cake of your child

799
00:57:33,711 --> 00:57:35,786
and you cut the cake first

800
00:57:36,731 --> 00:57:38,678
because you are the housewife.

801
00:57:39,544 --> 00:57:43,142
How will it look? It is that ridiculous, I tell you.

802
00:57:44,018 --> 00:57:47,354
The way the housewife always puts forward before everybody else.

803
00:57:47,624 --> 00:57:50,897
They have to be on the back because you have to look after.

804
00:57:52,894 --> 00:57:54,913
Look after all of them,

805
00:57:56,342 --> 00:58:00,792
and this is what is a Raga is.

806
00:58:00,854 --> 00:58:05,463
It caters to all your angularities.

807
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:08,688
Supposing a person is very upset and worried,

808
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:11,445
comes from office, sits down, puts on a Raga.

809
00:58:12,235 --> 00:58:13,861
It soothes you down.

810
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,834
It makes you settle down.

811
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:23,776
Like people come home for five days, live like

812
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:26,699
 I don't know, what to call, not even hotels,

813
00:58:26,964 --> 00:58:29,910
and live in a tent-like thing

814
00:58:30,061 --> 00:58:33,159
and the sixth day they are out at the sea

815
00:58:33,924 --> 00:58:35,797
or they go and stay in a hotel.

816
00:58:36,202 --> 00:58:38,443
Nobody wants to stay in the house

817
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:42,240
because there is no Gruhalakshmi principle between the two.

818
00:58:45,005 --> 00:58:48,597
But Raga needs better this  sitting down, settling down.

819
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:51,909
Unless and until you settle down, you cannot enjoy Raga.

820
00:58:52,024 --> 00:58:55,698
Imagine somebody listening to a raga when he's a jumpy.

821
00:58:57,988 --> 00:58:59,712
So, one has to settle down

822
00:59:00,117 --> 00:59:05,535
and that settling down is what is the work of a woman

823
00:59:05,814 --> 00:59:07,435
who is a housewife,

824
00:59:07,738 --> 00:59:11,303
and the man has to act, is to settle down.

825
00:59:11,901 --> 00:59:15,680
 As I have told you many a times how your left Nabhi goes out

826
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,762
in the modern times, much more,

827
00:59:18,205 --> 00:59:22,750
and many children are also born of the women who are hectic.

828
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:25,134
Is that the wife...

829
00:59:25,884 --> 00:59:28,973
normally in India before, you see,

830
00:59:29,053 --> 00:59:31,341
the husband used to get up, have his bath,

831
00:59:31,571 --> 00:59:33,693
all the time his wife is not with him.

832
00:59:33,955 --> 00:59:36,830
She is cooking for him. She is looking after the children.

833
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:41,108
All the time sticking on to husband also is a sign of boredom.

834
00:59:41,823 --> 00:59:44,357
Husband gets bored, the wife gets bored,

835
00:59:44,685 --> 00:59:46,367
then they have a divorce.

836
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:49,985
So must have other interests like looking after the children,

837
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:52,445
household, Sahaja Yoga, things like that.

838
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:56,513
Then he comes from the bath, he sits,

839
00:59:57,182 --> 00:59:59,502
sits on the ground, in India.

840
00:59:59,693 --> 01:00:02,235
Now we are sitting on the tables, all right,

841
01:00:02,338 --> 01:00:05,260
at least sit on the tables, not on the table, but on the chair.

842
01:00:05,398 --> 01:00:09,725
Then she doesn't tell him at this time "Why did you do like this?"

843
01:00:11,143 --> 01:00:13,095
Or  "This lady was quarrelling

844
01:00:13,215 --> 01:00:15,883
or I met another lady she was telling me you were this

845
01:00:15,997 --> 01:00:19,187
and you were that." No! She says "Let him eat his food".

846
01:00:20,153 --> 01:00:21,493
That's why in India

847
01:00:21,613 --> 01:00:23,700
 if husband has to show his temper he doesn't eat

848
01:00:23,803 --> 01:00:26,854
 his food in the house or he will wash his underclothes himself.

849
01:00:31,063 --> 01:00:32,891
That is how, they show their temper.

850
01:00:33,145 --> 01:00:36,097
 So then she fans the husband slowly

851
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:39,951
and tells him good things, you see, today you know why?

852
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:44,241
My son got up and he said "I love my father very much".

853
01:00:44,943 --> 01:00:47,801
He said  "Really?" "Yes, yes. He said, he said so".

854
01:00:48,066 --> 01:00:51,344
And husband knows she is telling lies also,

855
01:00:55,136 --> 01:00:57,257
but you see all nice things, you see,

856
01:00:57,426 --> 01:01:00,522
and "I think better your mother is much better now.

857
01:01:00,684 --> 01:01:02,753
I think I'll go and look after your mother.

858
01:01:02,882 --> 01:01:04,485
And your sister is coming.

859
01:01:04,613 --> 01:01:06,589
So I think you are buying a Sari for her."

860
01:01:06,749 --> 01:01:08,765
All such nice - nice thing she will talk to him.

861
01:01:09,011 --> 01:01:13,233
So he eats his food nicely then he goes washes his hands

862
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:16,258
and goes in a bullock cart, not in a car

863
01:01:16,443 --> 01:01:18,579
where there is a jam, always.

864
01:01:19,265 --> 01:01:24,378
Alright, now the bullock cart is over, the fan is over.

865
01:01:24,819 --> 01:01:28,066
You have to be very fast. Life is fast now.

866
01:01:28,297 --> 01:01:30,569
In this fast thing, as I have told you,

867
01:01:30,768 --> 01:01:33,206
that on the periphery of the

868
01:01:34,495 --> 01:01:36,608
wheel you have the speed

869
01:01:36,843 --> 01:01:41,526
but at the axis it is not.
So the Sahaja Yogis have to be at the axis,

870
01:01:42,274 --> 01:01:46,649
and so the husband and the wife,
 the left and the right side of a chariot

871
01:01:47,033 --> 01:01:49,153
have to be on the axis

872
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:52,211
and the left is left and the right is right.

873
01:01:52,753 --> 01:01:55,406
 Now the women always take more time to get ready.

874
01:01:55,557 --> 01:01:57,892
Not me, I take less than My husband,

875
01:01:58,513 --> 01:02:02,824
much less than my husband, but normally. So, that is their habit.

876
01:02:03,367 --> 01:02:06,932
Forget it. Now women have their own habits.

877
01:02:07,077 --> 01:02:10,380
They are women. Women will remain women, men will remain men.

878
01:02:10,587 --> 01:02:12,763
Men must see their watches ten times.

879
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:17,768
Women might see it once or may be
their watches are lost or out of order -

880
01:02:17,991 --> 01:02:19,590
if they are real women.

881
01:02:19,908 --> 01:02:23,060
They are not jumpy like men, they are different type.

882
01:02:23,476 --> 01:02:26,724
But they are women and you are men,

883
01:02:26,915 --> 01:02:29,829
and God has made men and women.

884
01:02:30,078 --> 01:02:31,976
If it was to make a unisex,

885
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:34,619
He would have made unisex, He did not.

886
01:02:35,992 --> 01:02:39,304
 So one must accept the sex is which you are born,

887
01:02:39,527 --> 01:02:44,198
with grace and beauty and dignity - both.

888
01:02:44,629 --> 01:02:47,138
And you must know this is Woman's party!

889
01:02:47,486 --> 01:02:50,535
 In India we have this thing like, you know,

890
01:02:50,702 --> 01:02:53,794
I was married in a family,

891
01:02:53,881 --> 01:02:56,892
very orthodox where they used to even cover the face and all that.

892
01:02:57,091 --> 01:02:59,822
So, one day, the collector, is the friend of my husband,

893
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:03,976
so, he told my elder brother-in law that, why not the wife of

894
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,259
my friend come and see Me.

895
01:03:06,738 --> 01:03:12,532
So he said, "Of course! of course!" So just to make it easy for him

896
01:03:12,734 --> 01:03:16,077
he took leave from his office and disappeared into another town

897
01:03:16,316 --> 01:03:19,756
and told his wife that "See that she goes and sees the collector".

898
01:03:20,132 --> 01:03:22,053
See how beautiful it was,

899
01:03:25,964 --> 01:03:28,170
how beautiful it was,

900
01:03:30,492 --> 01:03:32,978
and I never felt that he was dominating Me

901
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:36,742
because after all that was the system of that family,
alright, its alright.

902
01:03:39,341 --> 01:03:43,408
 But for this what you need is Pure Intelligence.

903
01:03:44,332 --> 01:03:47,530
If the husband is a dullard he'll bring down his wife.

904
01:03:47,827 --> 01:03:50,631
If the wife is a dullard she'll bring down her husband.

905
01:03:50,949 --> 01:03:55,260
If the woman is very smart, talks well and you know she knows how to

906
01:03:56,179 --> 01:03:59,892
talk and impress people doesn't mean that she is very intelligent.

907
01:04:00,173 --> 01:04:04,294
I call that person the most intelligent who sees the benevolence,

908
01:04:07,675 --> 01:04:11,629
the ascent and the ultimate goal.

909
01:04:11,812 --> 01:04:15,403
That person is the most sensitive,

910
01:04:15,896 --> 01:04:17,620
is the most intelligent.

911
01:04:18,003 --> 01:04:21,026
All other intelligence is avidya, is useless.

912
01:04:21,855 --> 01:04:24,412
Now, on this subject I think I can write a book,

913
01:04:24,571 --> 01:04:26,161
so, is better leave it to the book,

914
01:04:26,312 --> 01:04:28,433
and today let us have the puja

915
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,131
May God Bless You.

916
01:04:30,238 --> 01:04:31,943
 Any questions?

917
01:04:37,635 --> 01:04:40,294
This means, I'll be spending some money?

918
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:44,752
I don't know, there's no chance. I don't know when will spend.

919
01:04:44,942 --> 01:04:47,561
I love to spend, I mean, everybody should love to spend.

920
01:04:47,681 --> 01:04:49,315
 That's why the money is for.

921
01:04:49,429 --> 01:04:51,167
Must give to others, you see.

922
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:53,286
Why the matter is there? Matter is to give to others.

923
01:04:53,338 --> 01:04:55,230
Just enjoy giving others.

924
01:04:56,329 --> 01:04:58,916
So enjoyable, to give something to others.
