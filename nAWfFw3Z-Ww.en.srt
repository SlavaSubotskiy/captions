1
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,919
Again, I bow today to the seekers of truth.

2
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,599
From the very beginning, I have to say,

3
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,960
that I would like to address

4
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,720
to all those who are really seeking the truth.

5
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,720
I am not going just to read something to you

6
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,440
and give My own interpretation about it.

7
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,360
All of you have got sufficient intelligence to read any book you like

8
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,200
and to have your own interpretation.

9
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,960
We have so many interpretations of the Holy Bible,

10
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,760
that it is amazing, how people,

11
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,359
do not understand,

12
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,040
that when they have their own interpretation, it could be wrong!

13
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,960
For example, our great leader in our country,  Mahatma Gandhi, was

14
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,000
once asked by a Christian

15
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,159
to become a Christian.

16
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,080
He said: "Why don't you become officially a Christian?"

17
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,439
And he laughed aloud and he said: "I would like to, but,

18
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,120
please, tell me what should I become,

19
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,960
should be a Catholic or a Protestant

20
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,440
or I should to be

21
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,240
another sect of Protestants"?

22
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,600
Especially the Protestants have so many sects,

23
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,199
like Penticostals, they have got Seventh Day Adventists,

24
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,640
they have got Methodists, they have...

25
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,040
another one - what is that called as...

26
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,880
Penta... I mean so many like that.

27
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,599
So he asked: "Which one should I join?

28
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,120
If you tell me exactly which one to join, I would like to join."

29
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
And he had no answer to it!

30
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,440
So, there is some sort of a gap

31
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,600
in the understanding of the Bible, we should know!

32
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,959
The gap lies because

33
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,600
the first books, of The Old Testament, are not written

34
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,400
after Christ, but before Christ!

35
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,760
There was a big controversy, which the Jews put up,

36
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,600
even today in England, saying that

37
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,319
there was no mention of the "Virgin” in the Old Testament,

38
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,600
but it was written "a girl", not "a Virgin".

39
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,719
So, they denied this immaculate conception,

40
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,719
because it is not written that it's "a Virgin", but was written

41
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,479
as "a girl".

42
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,680
Now, this controversy is stupid.

43
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,000
But no use talking to them, because they won't to listen to Me!

44
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,240
In Hebrew language there's only one word

45
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,960
for the virgin and the girl.

46
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,640
Even in Sanskrit language there's only one word,

47
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,520
called "kanya" for the virgin.

48
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Even "a girl" is the same word as "kanya".

49
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,239
Now, with these things, what they wrote was:

50
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,120
"There will be a virgin, who will give the birth”.

51
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,720
Because logically, why should they write "a girl"?

52
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,280
This is a prophecy so, the word "girl",

53
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,760
itself suggest

54
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,680
that there was something special

55
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,840
about the person who is going to be born!

56
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,400
After all, a child is not going to be born to a man, is it?

57
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,640
Moreover, in modern times, we don’t see any virgins!

58
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,360
Even old women say that they are  girls.

59
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,960
So we don't have to judge,

60
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,319
according to our modern ideas

61
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,600
about the times when Christ came on this Earth!

62
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,960
The whole interpretation gets twisted

63
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,920
when we use our  brains,

64
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,280
which has got a limited quality of intelligence.

65
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,960
When Christ said that, "lt is all accomplished now”,

66
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,880
it meant something much deeper than

67
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,920
anyone can understand, who just reads Bible.

68
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,319
It... He didn't say that "everything is accomplished",

69
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,600
He just  said "It is”, despite the fact He was on the cross.

70
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,760
There He said "It is all accomplished”, it.

71
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:46,880
Because Christ had a special great task to perform.

72
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,040
He had to be present in a cross

73
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,280
that we have in our brain,

74
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,240
in the Agnya chakra, as you see there.

75
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,600
Now, this Agnya chakra is the one, is a place where

76
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,280
there is no room,

77
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,200
at all, because the ego and superego are pressing each other.

78
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,720
Because Christ was just the Spirit and not the body,

79
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,560
he had to go in the place where

80
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,640
it is very difficult for any other incarnation to go.

81
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,360
And this is what He said when

82
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,640
He said that "It is all accomplished", means: ”I have now

83
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,600
established Myself in that centre,

84
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,240
which is placed at the cross roads of ego and superego”.

85
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,200
You know that Christ was born at a time

86
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,280
when there were not at all people

87
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,640
who had any open mind or understanding.

88
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,920
If they had, they would not have crucified Him.

89
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,120
On the cross, when He was there,

90
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,760
was He to tell them about Agnya chakra?

91
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,639
Could he talk to them about these

92
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,520
chakras and all that to these fishermen,

93
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,280
who were always doubting Him?

94
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,520
Till He got Realisation, they did not....

95
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,400
Resurrection, they did not believe Him!

96
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,280
Even today, people are not willing to hear Me.

97
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,080
They have such a stupid barrier,

98
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,920
today also, you can see. They don't want to hear!

99
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,240
So, what about Christ?

100
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,600
Then He did say, that "I will have to send you a Councillor".

101
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,240
He said that, "I'll send to You a Comforter,

102
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,040
who will make you know about My Father for ever".

103
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,480
So, we have to look forward to that.

104
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,920
I do not want to claim

105
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,520
that I am the Counceller or a Comforter or anything,

106
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,520
I am not such a fool to tell you anything about it!

107
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,800
I am very diplomatic about it.

108
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,320
Christ just said that, "I am the light, I am the path", which He is.

109
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,520
And He was the Son of God! Only He said the truth,

110
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,880
which was the truth and is the truth still today!

111
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,600
What wrong did He say, that the Jews crucified Him?

112
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,080
You can't understand these Jews, today even.

113
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,480
But the stage has come now

114
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,240
that we cannot understand also the people,

115
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,320
who are trying  the same tricks

116
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,520
of using a book of Bible,

117
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,240
which they used, Jews, to crucify Christ.

118
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,440
The pharisees in those days -

119
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,760
I know more Hebrew words, because

120
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,520
I've read the Bible from the Hebrew –

121
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,360
so they were, the people,

122
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,639
who opposed Christ.

123
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,480
The people who thought they were the authorities on Bible.

124
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,520
Now, we have to see in modern times what we are doing.

125
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,960
Since long, your fathers,

126
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,320
your forefathers and their forefathers

127
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,200
have been going  to church and asking God

128
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,320
to come within them and give them the second birth.

129
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,680
Christ has said very clearly

130
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,640
that you are to be born again, didn't He?

131
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,720
He talked of the future in those terms.

132
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,560
But nobody thinks about it, that we have not been able

133
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,000
to actualize the experience of second birth.

134
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,159
You will be amazed, because of my husband’s job,

135
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,959
I have to travel all over the world.

136
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,040
I have been to Russia and to China and all the communist countries.

137
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,840
And I asked the Russians:

138
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,560
"Why did You refuse Christ?

139
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,400
Why did You refuse Christianity?

140
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,080
So they laughed, they said:

141
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,280
"You are so curious, so we'll take You the place

142
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,440
where there are Christians".

143
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,960
They had their Orthodox church

144
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,000
of Greece, the Greek Orthodox church they have, in Russia.

145
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
When we went in,

146
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,280
the priest, the head priest received us,

147
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,680
and said that he is fasting these days.

148
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,560
And he doesn't eat any meat these days,

149
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,640
but he can have all kinds of vegetables and fruits.

150
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,840
But when we sat for lunch,

151
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,800
he started smoking one cigarette after another,

152
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,080
it was impossible for Me to sit there.

153
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,880
He was extremely insecure and nervous man.

154
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,879
Apart from that, he drank and drank and drank, and drank,

155
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,480
in his fasting.

156
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,280
And he lost his balance, you know. We didn’t know where to do!

157
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,960
Then we came out, he didn’t even see this us off,

158
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,680
and then the Russians started laughing; they said:

159
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,800
"Now, did you see the Orthodox Christians?"

160
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,600
He said that, "How we’ve got them here?

161
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,399
Because first the Catholic religion

162
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,080
we thought we'll have,

163
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,960
but they said that "You cannot divorce!” So, we didn’t want them.

164
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,880
Then we wanted to have Islam, they said:

165
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,080
"You cannot drink!” So, we didn’t have them.

166
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,480
So Orthodox Church came forward - they said:

167
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,080
"You can do everything as long as you give money to the church!”

168
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,720
They asked Me a question:

169
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,240
”Is this what they have learned from Christ?

170
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,640
Was there Christ living anywhere?”

171
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,960
Then in China,

172
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,480
I asked them: "Why have you denied Christ,

173
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,120
for communism, whatever you have?

174
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,560
Why have you denied Christ and Christianity?"

175
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,120
They said this:

176
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,679
"Christian nations - they came here, doped us,

177
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,440
gave us all kinds of dopes and took away all that we had

178
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,080
and You think that they are in any way good people?"

179
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,200
I had no answer to them!

180
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,800
They said: "With Bible you cannot improve your life,

181
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,680
we can see that clearly.

182
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,120
They are all aggressors,

183
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,480
very cruel people.

184
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,040
They went all the way to America

185
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,080
to kill all the inhabitants of that country,

186
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,440
completely finish them off,

187
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,520
and establish their church of Catholicism.

188
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,280
They denounced all the democracies, saying that these democracies

189
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,640
are using God, for their own purpose!

190
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,600
All the communist countries I visited

191
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,320
have great complaints against all the democracies of the world,

192
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,320
only on one point, that, they use God,

193
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,000
and they haven’t got any good qualities of God in them.

194
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,200
Americans sent some wheat to India.

195
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,040
In that they had such a horrible seed,

196
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,720
that it grew into a grass, which could not be cut

197
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,720
and killed - it starting eating all the fields in India.

198
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,120
Gregoire has seen, how they sent an acacia seed,

199
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,960
which grew into a very thorny, harmful poisonous tree.

200
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,920
If anybody touched - the villagers or children -

201
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,199
they would get blisters on their body for days together

202
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,120
and the body would rotten under that.

203
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,320
Today, Americans are sending

204
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,320
all kinds of weapons, selling them

205
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,480
to all the countries to fight nicely.

206
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,960
Is it Christianity by any chance?

207
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,440
They talk of peace and sell their weapons.

208
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,840
They are selling a medicine, which is forbidden by doctors,

209
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:12,360
to poor these Bangladeshis, who can be killed by that medicine.

210
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,880
What about England? Under the guidance of Henry VIII,

211
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,520
they came to India:

212
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,800
300 years they lived in that country like parasites!

213
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,480
My father went to jail, my mother went to jail

214
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,600
and the churches drove them out of the Church,

215
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,680
as if Christ was born in England!

216
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,160
And when he became something great, when he came out of the jail,

217
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,120
they were, they were regarded

218
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,399
as "a very great Christian community people”, you see?

219
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,960
Just tell that.

220
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,920
When he become something big in the Constituent Assembly and...

221
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,280
Was Christ born in England?

222
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,880
These are the English today - are the racists of the first waters...

223
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,840
If they were such racists, why did they go to these countries?

224
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,440
To exploit them and loot them.

225
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,000
Indians are too gracious to say anything

226
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,960
the way these people tortured them. They are too gracious

227
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,120
and forgiving.

228
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,840
Now think of France.

229
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,280
Christ has said,

230
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,440
"Thou shall not have adulterous eyes”.

231
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,440
Not only adultery, but "adulterous eyes”. He corrected

232
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,720
on what the Bible had said previously in The ten commandments.

233
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,960
"Thou shall not have adulterous eyes”!

234
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,200
What about the French, having no adultery? Imagine, French,

235
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,440
are they anywhere near Christ?

236
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,000
I´m in your land, Switzerland, as a guest,

237
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:50,000
it's not gracious to say some things which I would like to say,

238
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,799
with due apologies to all of you as Swiss people.

239
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,160
Which you should not feel bad, because the time has come

240
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,040
for Me to tell you what Swiss people are doing across.

241
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,040
It is a very subtle aggression.

242
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,399
Try to understand.

243
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,360
Say any developing country,

244
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,040
whether it is Pakistan, India or Mauritius,

245
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,720
or any African country,

246
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,880
when there are people who are dishonest

247
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,279
and take the - suck the money of these poor people,

248
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,640
who haven't got to eat

249
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,200
they come and put in your banks, and you support this.

250
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,800
All the development plans

251
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,520
of all these third world countries, are failing,

252
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,399
because there are Swiss banks,

253
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,360
which are supporting all the thugs of the world.

254
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,279
All the fake gurus, who have made money, made people weak,

255
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,680
epileptic, with cancer, all their money

256
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,840
is very nicely stored and kept account

257
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,320
in secret accounts in your great banks, here.

258
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,319
If you see a starving soul anywhere,

259
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,560
know that you are playing a part through these banks,

260
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,800
in making them to starve and die and suffer!

261
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
So, just by reading Bible,

262
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,600
what emancipation and resurrection are you going to give -

263
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,960
people which Christ preached?

264
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,920
For Me, Christ is My life

265
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,160
and Bible is the Truth.

266
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,279
But it does not mean, that in these four years,

267
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,200
Christ could talk to these

268
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,920
brainless people anything about Kundalini!

269
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,360
There is only one thing,

270
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,440
for which we should be thankful to all the democracies,

271
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,960
that they can’t crucify Me now.

272
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,400
It is you, the Christians, have to rise to the occasion,

273
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,080
and should find out, what’s wrong in the whole system,

274
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,560
that we claim something, we profess something, but we are not that.

275
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,520
Why do we compromise?

276
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,120
And why do we accept such things, which are wrong,

277
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,480
within ourselves, within our states, within our democracies?

278
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,560
One should know that falsehood will fall one day.

279
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,000
But Christ is not false and Bible is not false.

280
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,879
It will not fall, it is an eternal thing!

281
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,840
But to understand it, you have to be a subtler being.

282
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,440
Why Christ said that you should be born again,

283
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,279
because without that happening, you cannot understand Christ!

284
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,400
If your faith in Bible is

285
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,160
because  you have bought a book and you have studied and mastered it,

286
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,440
then, it is of no use.

287
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,160
Now, one must understand,

288
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,480
that if you do not open your eyes to what Christ has said,

289
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,279
that you are to be born again,

290
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,320
the young people, who are thinking, not stupid people

291
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,160
I’m saying, but young people, who are thinking,

292
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,480
will defy and deny God.

293
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,920
I’ve met many young people, who came - Christians -

294
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,480
came to Me and they said: "We have no faith in Christ.

295
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,240
Don't talk of Him, we are fed up.

296
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,200
Thousands and thousands I must say.

297
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,359
So many people got up when I started talking about Christ

298
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,560
in America.

299
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,400
So now, one has to realize, that I am here,

300
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,360
to prove the existence of Christ!

301
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,520
And to prove every word of Bible!

302
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,640
I do not have faith in Bible,

303
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,880
it is my life, it is everything to Me!

304
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,120
It’s a truth for Me.

305
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,359
But, one must know, that by reading,

306
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,200
you do not become a true Christian.

307
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,800
You are to be born again!

308
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,560
And how you do it and how it has to work out,

309
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,640
that I have come to explain on this earth.

310
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,760
Look at the attention of people.

311
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,400
When there was a funny boy who came and just said

312
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,839
"Christ, Christ, Christ", like that - everybody has said that -

313
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:28,279
there were people from the television and everyone wanted to

314
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,720
record that incident.

315
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,440
But when I told them there was a lady,

316
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,319
who got cured of her deafness,

317
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,360
a long deafness, in ten minutes, they would not record  that!

318
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,200
We have here somebody

319
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,280
who was on crutches for 45 years, and he's walking about,

320
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,520
perfectly all right - nobody would like to see that!

321
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,720
SY - The one who came to see You?
SM - No, no, our Brian.

322
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,200
In England, hundreds of

323
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,400
people have, given up their drugs addiction -

324
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,839
nobody wants to see that either.

325
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,359
In India, thousands of people gave up at their alcohol,

326
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,880
their criminal habits,

327
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,520
and they have improved their lives, have become so beautiful,

328
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,759
they are so happy citizens today - no one wants to see that either.

329
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,120
I don’t mind if they are blind, let them be blind.

330
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,840
But don’t lead others into blindness!

331
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,439
This I had to explain, because first of all,

332
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,960
I did not know, they had booked this hall,

333
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,960
these boys. They booked this hall.

334
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,840
Tell them.

335
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,080
And I felt, that so far,

336
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,480
I’ve never talked to Protestants

337
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,960
in Switzerland or anywhere,

338
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,240
except in America, who are not even

339
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,120
Christians now, because they don’t believe in Christianity.

340
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,160
So might be it is the desire of the God,

341
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,360
that I should talk to Protestants, that they should not protest

342
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,720
Christ, when He comes on this Earth.

343
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,880
A simple question I want to ask all those who believe

344
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,279
that they have faith in Christ and faith in Bible.

345
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:36,160
When Christ will come, how will you recognise Him that He's Christ?

346
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,080
Face this problem directly!

347
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,640
Because you do not know, it's not written in the Bible.

348
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,839
Even His Name is not given, in what Name He is going to come.

349
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,600
But when He will come on this Earth,

350
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,360
He is not going to council you or comfort you or redeem you.

351
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,320
He is going to just slash out the people and sort them out

352
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,560
who are useless, for the Kingdom of God!

353
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,680
All these powers are within you.

354
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,240
Your Spirit is within you.

355
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,440
Spirit is the absolute thing.

356
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,080
Unless and until you get to the Spirit,

357
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,120
you cannot live in the world of relativity, it's relative.

358
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,160
Because it is relative,

359
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,960
that’s why whatever you interpret, is manyfold.

360
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,319
The Islamic people today, who come to Sahaja Yoga - we have

361
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,400
people here from Algeria, who are Muslims -

362
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,560
have starting believing in Christ.

363
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,680
The Jews who,

364
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,720
who have denied Christ, have now starting accepting Christ.

365
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,160
And worshipping Him!

366
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,240
Hindus also accept Christ, not because I have

367
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,720
tried to give them a brainwashing or some bread.

368
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,960
Those who are not believers of God,

369
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,319
also have started  believing in Christ.

370
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,960
So, what is happening?

371
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,200
Why?

372
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,800
When there is darkness,

373
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:51,280
for you, the seat that you’re occupying is the reality.

374
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,640
Somebody is standing next to this lamp post -

375
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,480
for him this is the reality.

376
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:13,279
Because, first, they are blind, another there is darkness.

377
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,520
But when light comes in,

378
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,799
you see everything and you see the correlation of each other.

379
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,720
Now, why did they accept Christ?

380
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,560
When the Kundalini rises,

381
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:47,320
this primordial force rises through these centers,

382
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:52,040
it comes up to the point here, where you see this red mark.

383
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,520
This is just the window of that center,

384
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:08,000
which is placed between the optic chiasma,

385
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,680
controlling the pituitary and the pineal body.

386
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,279
That is "the door", "the gate", Christ has described.

387
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,439
Then the Kundalini stops - of these people.

388
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,640
And also of Christians, because they have done unauthorized work.

389
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:01,560
Then one has to open this center, by taking the name of Christ.

390
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,320
And also, Mary, His power.

391
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,680
In Sahaja Yoga, Mary is the Incarnation of the Holy Ghost.

392
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,920
My father, who was a scholar of Sanskrit and

393
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,880
fourteen languages, who translated Quran Sharif into Hindi,

394
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:50,480
told Me, that people try to deny

395
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,720
Christ’s Mother, because the Muslims would not accept.

396
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,560
When Christ was dying,

397
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,560
then He said, "Behold the Mother!”

398
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,320
He did not say: "Look after My mother".

399
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,960
He was too great a Man

400
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,720
to think of just a mother, who gave Him birth!

401
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,840
But He said " Behold the Mother!"

402
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,759
It means that "You look at Her!

403
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,520
Watch Her! See Her! Understand Her!"

404
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,880
After His death, Mary had a very, very bad time.

405
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,160
She had to go to India, where She died.

406
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,400
Because the people,

407
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,440
who were supposed to behold Her,

408
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:47,879
were missing completly and even today nobody wants to behold!

409
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:02,040
Now, this rising of the Kundalini takes place.

410
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,880
It is quite shocking for people,

411
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,360
who have never heard a word of Kundalini.

412
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,600
Much before that Christ came on this Earth,

413
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,240
as I told you yesterday,

414
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,680
He is described very well

415
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,080
fourteen thousands years back in Indian Scriptures, believe Me!

416
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,960
You don't want to believe in that,

417
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,600
because You want to use this Bible, for your purpose!

418
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,040
Anybody who writes about Christ,

419
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,399
is taken over in the Bible, isn't it ?

420
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,120
Like the disciples -

421
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,480
they wrote about Christ. Christ never wrote Bible!

422
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,640
But then why did You have St. Paul there,

423
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,640
who never even saw Christ?

424
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,400
Because he said he saw a cross?

425
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:32,160
Does that mean that he has ability to write about Christianity

426
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,440
and Christ, that he should be in the Bible?

427
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:48,120
Why people did not raise any objection to him, but they raise to Me?

428
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,920
The reason is obvious.

429
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,400
Because it helps certain purposes!

430
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,759
I am for one purpose here:

431
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,760
to give you what you have.

432
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,080
In Switzerland you’ll understand better, if I say

433
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:27,360
that I am like a banker, who has to cash your cheques.

434
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:40,080
If somebody says that to you, will you be angry with that person?

435
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,799
SY - If, if somebody says...

436
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,520
SM: that to you, that I have to cash your cheques,

437
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,480
will you be angry with that person?

438
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,360
You will not be!

439
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,480
If I say I have a diamond to offer you,

440
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:09,160
will you go and consult Bible about it?

441
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,880
No, because our attention

442
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:26,080
is more for material things, not for the spiritual.

443
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,080
But not so, I would say,

444
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,240
because I have met very, very beautiful people and seekers,

445
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:44,920
all over the world,  who are really seeking the truth!

446
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,480
And yesterday also we had such beautiful people,

447
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:05,640
sitting down here, who were just asking for the truth!

448
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,200
When you become Realized Soul,

449
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,080
you have your own powers.

450
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,120
Your power of love manifests itself!

451
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,200
It is a tremendous thing, that is a human being, do you know that?

452
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:46,240
All these centers represent your steps of evolution,

453
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,919
of your awareness.

454
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,800
And once you have come to the human level,

455
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,640
you have to just jump into,

456
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,960
into the unconscious,

457
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:19,000
where we say, it is the Kingdom of God.

458
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:28,200
You'll be amazed that Sahaja Yoga relates God to science.

459
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,720
We have many scientific people,

460
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,800
who are doing research in different areas,

461
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,960
doctors and  PHD's,

462
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:50,960
who are understanding science through Sahaja Yoga.

463
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,880
It is fantastic!

464
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,000
Because you are fantastic!

465
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,759
God has created you, with great care

466
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,520
and love and has made you a human being,

467
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,279
to give all His love and all His kingdom and all His powers to you

468
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,480
to enjoy!

469
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,359
He has not made you to suffer

470
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:53,480
and to kill each other and hate each other

471
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:01,640
and to live in the

472
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:06,200
in the perpetual insecurity from other human beings!

473
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:18,280
He has not made you to prepare the weapons of distruction!

474
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:26,600
He has made you to enjoy His construction, which is so subtle

475
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,600
and is already for you.

476
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:43,960
So give up all your fasting and sufferings and torturing,

477
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:53,279
all your fears and depressions,

478
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:57,760
all your maladies!

479
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,920
Because once the Spirit is enlighten within you,

480
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:09,560
in that light, you immediately arrive in the Kingdom of God.

481
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:17,080
I say this to you, that, "Please, listen to Me!" -

482
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:25,439
because later on, you will say that, "Mother, You never told us!"

483
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:32,160
It's going to be very serious.

484
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,680
So, please, be alert about it

485
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,240
and just take your Resurrection!

486
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:52,080
I have not to take from you anything!

487
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,720
I have come to give you something.

488
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,640
The eternal life, that is promised.

489
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,840
So why should you be angry with Me?

490
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,840
What did I say to make you angry?

491
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,040
I am not here for election,

492
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,759
that I will go on pleasing in your wrong things!

493
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:39,680
You have to elect Me in a way, that you elect your loving people.

494
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,000
Not with anger.

495
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,960
SY - Not?
SM - Not with anger,

496
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,600
but with understanding.

497
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,160
Not with barriers of conditioning, of what you have read.

498
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:08,520
Not with your ego, which is agressive.

499
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,520
But with a silent understanding.

500
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:21,839
If you have this property within you, why shoudn't you have it?

501
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,960
Already Gregoire has told you

502
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,319
about these different chakras and all that,

503
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,120
and tomorrow I will explain to you in the morning

504
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:38,400
all about the different centers and about the different...

505
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:42,759
powers within us, and how by our neglect we cause

506
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,680
maladjustment and so we get

507
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,160
emotional, physical and mental maladies.

508
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:18,759
I'll also tell you how to cure yourself and how to cure others,

509
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,800
with precise understanding, scientific understanding.

510
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,520
And day after tomorrow morning, I will tell you

511
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,920
how to achieve your detachment

512
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,520
from your physical, mental and emotional self

513
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,439
and established completely into Sahaja Yoga.

514
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:07,480
Now, today, we will have again a session of Realization.

515
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:14,200
There is no need for you to believe in Me,

516
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,440
but as long as you do not deny Me,

517
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:22,120
you can sit here and please, listen to Me what I say.

518
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:27,240
As a Mother, I request you, to do justice to yourself!

519
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,400
And don't be obstinate about anything!

520
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:53,640
I know it is a new knowledge for most of the people

521
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,480
who have not read anything else

522
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:00,640
but, I know of many young people,

523
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:03,799
of western countries,

524
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,240
who have reached the conclusion,

525
01:09:06,439 --> 01:09:08,559
that it is the Kundalini awakening, is the saving.

526
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,240
Even Gregoire did the same.

527
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:37,719
Everyone should try.

528
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,600
If do you not want it,

529
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,480
I cannot force it, otherwise it's very difficult, otherwise.

530
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,960
So you can leave!

531
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,599
Will be better for Me, if you don't want it,

532
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:52,920
it's better that you leave, and leave the rest with their work.

533
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:09,960
That...

534
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,040
That would be very civil and kind of you,

535
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,440
to leave others to have their experiences.

536
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:31,120
If you do not want to have, don’t have "dog in the manger" policy.

537
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:51,640
So...

538
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,480
thank you!
