1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:53,289
I’m very happy to 

2
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:58,539
be here with you, after such a long time and
I missed you all very much.

3
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:05,580
I know you are very far away from the rest
of them but you are always in My heart and

4
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,530
you shouldn’t worry about the distance.

5
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,520
We have to realize that we have entered into
a new, a….

6
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:24,250
This kind of hands you should [HAVE, HAND],
not to hang, if you have to sit properly.

7
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:31,890
You have to understand that we have now entered
into the Kingdom of God and our culture has

8
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:39,020
to change, our style has to change, our understanding
has to change.

9
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,660
Unless until we change, nobody’s going to
take us seriously.

10
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:50,400
Moreover it’s very difficult to trigger
things if there’s no perfect instrument.

11
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,960
As you know that I went to Russia second time
for the Yoga seminar, where we had people

12
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,730
from all over the Eastern Block.

13
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,660
That was My idea, to get them there.

14
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:09,969
And they were from every country, about two
or three people, only.

15
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:14,390
And very strong, very deep, very understanding.

16
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:23,430
I spoke hardly for 30 minutes and such a miracle,
in fifteen minutes I gave them Realization,

17
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:34,310
about ten minutes and five minutes I was just
there, and all of them got practically Realization,

18
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,310
all of them.

19
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,310
Very surprising.

20
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,459
And so deeply, when I walked out of the room,
they all came after Me.

21
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,510
That you don’t see in western countries,
that kind of a thing.

22
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,810
All of them walked after Me, ran after Me,
they wanted to give their addresses and they

23
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,230
wanted Me to go to their country and this
and that.

24
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,859
I said: “All right, I’ll come!”

25
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:57,060
We took their addresses, even from Romania,
everywhere.

26
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,620
And they went back.

27
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,819
And within 8 days one could trigger out the
thing.

28
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:19,069
It worked, because they were so deep, because
they were so much equipped to trigger the

29
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:20,069
happening.

30
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:24,129
That’s how they triggered their country
and how they worked it out.

31
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:31,760
So, if we live on a superficial level of Sahaja
Yoga, then we cannot do much for ourselves

32
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,749
nor for the country and it’s just a wasteful
life, neither here nor there.

33
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:41,999
Is like a seed, which is sprouted and has
not grown into the tree.

34
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:47,930
So first of all we have to learn that we have
to become very deep people, very deep, you

35
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,610
must teach our depth.

36
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:55,260
I’ve heard that people come to Pujas and
things and their main interest is in food.

37
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,959
As soon as the Puja is over you just rush
for food.

38
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,349
How can you?

39
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:06,969
After Puja you get into a mood, after meditation
you get into a mood of meditating nature and

40
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:11,420
you just sit down and you can’t get up,
because you were fallen into the well and

41
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,540
sort of thing happens.

42
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,139
How can you just get up and walk for cakes
or things.

43
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,319
We though can’t think about.

44
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,300
So then judge yourself, how you are, how far
you are.

45
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:33,280
You have to work out your vibrations because
you are going to create that beautiful vision

46
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,759
in this country, for your children, for yourself
and for the whole country, ultimately for

47
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,700
the whole world.

48
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,699
But if you do not take it up seriously, just
by the way, Sahaja Yoga is just by the way,

49
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,180
it doesn’t work out.

50
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,680
It has to be way of life.

51
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,250
And in everything that you do it has to be
a Sahaj culture.

52
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:59,539
And in Sahaj culture so many things are to
be understood that this is natural, this is

53
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:03,400
real and we have to accept the way it is.

54
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,570
So many things are happening the West, which
I think are just destructive, absolutely destructive

55
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,960
to the society.

56
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,590
The society is not at all looked after, here.

57
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:23,150
Maybe I would blame this to the women of Australia
and New Zealand, that women are not understanding

58
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:32,690
their responsibility and do not understand
what is their [GLORY], also they have not

59
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,840
self esteem.

60
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,830
The other day I was traveling by plane and
most of the ladies were smoking and men were

61
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,280
not smoking.

62
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,210
Men were looking after the children, the women
were busy smoking like men, you see, looking

63
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,020
like half men half women.

64
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,919
It’s surprising, this is very destructive.

65
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:54,229
Because as I have said that that men and women
are like two wheels of a chariot, one on the

66
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,600
left, one on the right.

67
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,409
The left cannot go to the right and right
cannot go to the left.

68
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:05,400
So we have to understand that our role is
much more important than of the other.

69
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,189
Like the men have an important role, as well
as the women have even more important role.

70
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:13,630
To be a mother itself is a very big thing.

71
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,520
Why God has given you the motherhood?

72
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,310
Because God thinks you are like the Mother
Earth, that you look after, nourish the child,

73
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,009
nourish the family, do all these things.

74
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:32,860
Don’t try to follow the methods of men,
like smoking, drinking, behaving like them.

75
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,100
You just see the trend, how far it is going,
the self-esteem is so low.

76
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:43,680
Now, for women, the other day I was, I was
telling you about the way they are talking

77
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,970
about sexy, sexy women.

78
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:52,240
I mean it’s…one should be ashamed of saying
such a thing for women.

79
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,860
Because one should take an objection: “We
are not prostitutes that every man should

80
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,789
look at us and enjoy us.

81
00:06:57,789 --> 00:06:58,789
Why?

82
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:04,250
Are we sold out for them or are we something
for show?”

83
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,810
The women have no self-esteem, they fight
on wrong things, they don’t fight on the

84
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,810
right things.

85
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,250
The right is that you should be respected
and you should not be treated like something

86
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,990
on the show, that any man can look at you
and any, that the men should look at you,

87
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,280
then you have some value.

88
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
It’s nonsense.

89
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:29,400
This is not the way to make great nations
and great children and great families.

90
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:37,039
So the society of any country depends on the
women, which is a very solid work, which is

91
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,800
underground, they don’t want to show off.

92
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,449
Any country, which has got good women make
good society.

93
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:47,629
And I must say the credit goes to Indian women,
in India.

94
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:51,469
They have not bothered about these things,
you see, they are not bothered about their

95
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:52,990
looks and the sexy nonsense.

96
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,860
If somebody says them: “too sexy” I mean
they will slap you, feel very hurt: “What

97
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,389
is this, what do you think us to be?”

98
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:04,389
And to be proud of what work you are doing,
of course you have to work outside and do

99
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:08,539
something else, but who will look after the
children, who will manage the households,

100
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:11,370
who will keep the peace of the house is to
be seen.

101
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:16,099
So in Sahaj culture one must understand that
women have to be women and men have to be

102
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:17,099
men.

103
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:20,080
But men must learn to respect the women as
housewives.

104
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,979
[THE AUSTRALIAN DOES] respect them very much.

105
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:29,039
If they do not respect their women then also
they will retaliate, they will get rebellier

106
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,990
and there is all this women’s [REBELLION]
that has started.

107
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,070
Is the mistake of men not the women so much,
because they have challenge their personality

108
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,510
so much that now they have started behaving
like this.

109
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,770
So in Sahaja Yoga we respect the women, we
allow them their own freedom, we trust them

110
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,029
and we treat them equal.

111
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:47,170
They have to be equal.

112
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,050
They may not be similar but they are equal.

113
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:55,440
The both the wheels have to be equal otherwise
wheel, one is smaller, one is bigger, then

114
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,010
the chariot will never move forward, it will
go round and round and round.

115
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:04,471
So that is to be understood, that’s very
much important nowadays in the West because

116
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:09,260
I find slowly the derailment is towards hell.

117
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:15,350
All these thoughts are going to take people
to nowhere because nobody takes the responsibility

118
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,490
of molding a moral, creating moral values
for children.

119
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,209
You have to give proper breeding.

120
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:26,339
These days I find children are very undisciplined
here.

121
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,639
Because we are afraid to face them.

122
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,750
You have to face them and you have to tell
them that: “This is not so, you are Sahaja

123
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,880
Yogis and you have to behave like Sahaja Yogis.”

124
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,620
They have to be modest, they have to be humble.

125
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,320
There should be a kind of an awe for parents.

126
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,010
If they don’t have that awe for their parents
how can they have awe for Me or for God?

127
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,010
They cannot.

128
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,720
Whatever you may tell them they will not have.

129
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,730
If they have no awe at all for the parents
who are Sahaja Yogis that means these children

130
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:59,860
will become very ward like other children
and that is a very big risk you are running

131
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,040
because I am depending on the children who
are born Realized and I don’t want them

132
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,779
to go haywire because the parents have not
looked after them and faced them.

133
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:14,690
So on the whole we must understand the role
of men and women and the respect that you

134
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,100
have to pay to each other.

135
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,710
Now, if husband is not respectful to woman
then the children will not be respectful to

136
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:27,600
her and the whole thing will be finished and
that’s why there is no domination of anyone

137
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,600
as such, there should not be any domination
but everybody has one’s own role and where

138
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,420
the wife is concerned she should take a decision,
where the man is concerned, he should take

139
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,060
a decision and one must respect it because
these are two different areas in which the

140
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,720
man has to live and the woman has to live.

141
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,750
Wherever this balance goes out, it has gone
out in our country also we should say, in

142
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,720
India, I must say, there are now funny things
are happening thanks to the Muslims, who lived

143
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,320
there and had such an impact that we are having
dowry system and all kinds of other things

144
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,900
there we have.

145
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,860
But also there are societies, which are trying
to work it out, they are not Sahaja Yogis

146
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,920
but work it out, they are getting improved
and they are trying to change their ways and

147
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,829
methods and this is coming before the people
to see that things should be all right.

148
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:18,579
But supposing the women would have taken some
sort of a weapon in their hands and started

149
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:20,570
beating all the men what would have happened?

150
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,440
You see, you are complementary to each other.

151
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,610
So must understand first of all, our role
in Sahaja Yoga that we have to establish our

152
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:33,240
self-esteem and we have to respect ourselves
and we have to respect others.

153
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:41,680
Because you are all saints and saints have
to respect people…

154
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,079
I’ve been talking all the time.

155
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:53,459
So you have to respect the saints that you
are a saint and another one is a saint.

156
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,139
I always give the example of Namadeva.

157
00:11:55,139 --> 00:12:01,800
Namadeva was a tailor, the great poet and
a great saint.

158
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:09,519
And he went to see another one who’s name
was Gora Khumbar who was a potter.

159
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,449
And when he went to see him, Gora Khumbar
was busy knitting the clay to make the pots,

160
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:19,430
see, just with his feet he was knitting the
clay.

161
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,660
He looked at him.

162
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,020
When he looked at him, he just stood thoughtless.

163
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:31,300
And then the words he says so beautiful, he
said: “I have come to see the Nirakara,

164
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:37,920
the Nirguna, the thought...the formless, means
the vibrations.

165
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,620
I came to see the vibrations but here it is
in the form, standing”.

166
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:52,050
What an appreciation, what an adoration, from
one saint to another who have never seen the

167
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,050
other person.

168
00:12:53,050 --> 00:13:01,350
“But I see the whole of this Nirakara, the
Nirguna is in the form of you.”

169
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,970
Just think of it.

170
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,740
And that is what we have to be.

171
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,089
But if we cannot trust other Sahaja Yogis,
we cannot love each other, we cannot understand

172
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:14,850
each other that means we are something low,
lower than others.

173
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,250
Some people have a habit of criticizing all
the time: “This is not all right”.

174
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,779
They don’t see that there’s something
wrong with them within themselves that they

175
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:24,150
are criticizing others.

176
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:28,180
So there’s no chance for criticizing in
Sahaja Yoga, first thing is that you should

177
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:33,430
see yourself what you are and where you stand
and how you are going to help yourself first

178
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,430
of all.

179
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,899
Then you can help others.

180
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:42,230
But there is no need at all to put a critical
eye on others.

181
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:46,170
Because then you become good for nothing,
you’ve done all the bad things, you see

182
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:51,279
all the bad things in other people and what
do you develop is a non-collective personality,

183
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:57,510
which is such a headache to us and ultimately
you have to go out of Sahaja Yoga.

184
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:04,100
As I said there are two forces that are working
in Sahaja Yoga.

185
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:20,779
The first one is the one by which you are
attracted, is called as, is called as the

186
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:30,600
centripetal force, centripetal force by which
you are attracted and the another force is,

187
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,209
is called as the centrifugal force.

188
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:40,600
Supposing you have a stone attached to a string,
and you move it with a speed, you see, so

189
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,250
you can keep it moving like that but as soon
as you release it a little bit it can go as

190
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,870
a tangent.

191
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:54,110
In the same way there are two forces by which
one we are attracted towards Sahaja Yoga,

192
00:14:54,110 --> 00:15:02,920
we keep one with it, we become part and parcel
of the whole, another one is by which we go

193
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,920
out.

194
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,790
Now I find that going out has become a very
strong force.

195
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:14,470
And I get quite worried about it, not only
that you go out but you go out with very great

196
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,470
problems.

197
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:24,660
And this is what I’ve seen in 
Australia very much working out.

198
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:30,379
First of all if anybody says against Me or
Sahaja Yoga just close your eyes.

199
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:35,639
Just say: “We don’t want to hear anything
against it because we have been benefited

200
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:41,649
by, we got all the profits out of it and now
you don’t tell us anything.

201
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,970
We don’t want to hear it.”

202
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:48,410
Just close your eyes and cover your ears and
say: “We don’t want to hear it”.

203
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:53,569
But we had three cases now where people are
suffering from cancer or this or that, who

204
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:54,649
listened to this.

205
00:15:54,649 --> 00:16:00,620
The man who says may not get it, he may not,
but the one…because he’s already out,

206
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,680
but the one who’s a Sahaja Yogi if he listens
to this thing is very dangerous and should

207
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,140
not listen to anyone like that, who talks
ill about Me or about Sahaja Yoga.

208
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,339
This is one point we should understand.

209
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:19,899
And then those who find faults with other
Sahaja Yogis are also in trouble.

210
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:21,860
You shouldn’t find faults with other Sahaja
Yogis.

211
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:28,069
If you think there’s something wrong with
any Sahaja Yogi you can go and tell the leader.

212
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:33,589
If you find anything wrong with the leader
you are welcome to write to Me, immediately.

213
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:34,600
You must write to Me.

214
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,029
Is an important thing, because My relationship
with you is tide.

215
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:43,750
Leaders are just a myth in a way because I
just telephone to them and tell them because

216
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,329
I can’t telephone to all of you.

217
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:46,329
That’s all.

218
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:47,570
But it’s a myth.

219
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:55,890
So anything that you want to do, you must
try to inform Me directly, if they are very

220
00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:02,680
much hard on you, if they are arrogant, if
they are abusive, if they are taking out money,

221
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,500
anything you find that is not correct you
please let Me know.

222
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:14,760
And immediately from your letter I will know
what is the situation is like and I will let

223
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,179
you know what is wrong, whether you are wrong
or the leader is wrong.

224
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,490
But if you just don’t inform Me then I’ll
have to found out Myself.

225
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,630
And by the time I find out I find lots of
harm is done.

226
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,559
So best thing is that you should let me know.

227
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,830
Because now, today I’m here.

228
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:37,419
Now I cannot keep attention on Columbia where
I’ve been, I cannot keep attention on America,

229
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:40,150
but when I go there My attention is there.

230
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,289
But if somebody has any problem they should
write to Me.

231
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:50,409
Like this I’ve seen we have got lots of
problems and many Sahaja Yogis have left Sahaja

232
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:51,640
Yoga.

233
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,179
Because they never informed Me.

234
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:58,100
I can’t understand even now why did they
not write to Me, why did they not telephone

235
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,100
to Me.

236
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,670
But for small things they will write, somebody’s
wife is sick, or somebody’s father in law

237
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:08,330
is in the hospital, or all nonsensical things,
like that they will write.

238
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,880
But they will never tell Me that there’s
something is wrong with the leader, till I

239
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,289
discover it, till the whole Sahaja Yoga is
destroyed in that particular city.

240
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:23,669
So it’s my humble request that all of you
should know that I’m your Mother, directly.

241
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:29,690
I’ve nothing to do with the leaders, as
far as you people are concerned.

242
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:35,000
Any leader who is harsh on you, who’s troublesome
to you, who disciplines you too much, or tries

243
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,860
to put his ideas all the time on your heads,
or anything like that which you think is curving

244
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,860
your freedom of growth, you must write to
Me and you must know.

245
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:50,330
This is no excuse to say that the leader was
like this, so [UNCLEAR] or “We went away.”

246
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,330
Why did you go away?

247
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,059
What was the need?

248
00:18:54,059 --> 00:19:00,770
And this I find very common, specially in
Australians and New Zealanders.

249
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:11,070
Either they become just like complete slaves
or they become absolutely rebellious.

250
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,480
There’s nothing in between.

251
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,680
So you have to know that if there is anything
that you find which is trying to dominate

252
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,870
you, you must let us know, and I am always
going to correct and tell them on their faces,

253
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,610
all the leaders, what I think of them.

254
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:32,940
Because they also know that I’m sitting
down there to look after this.

255
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,890
Of course about leaders I’ve given them
so many times, so many lectures and things

256
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:42,480
and every time they come to Ganapatipule we
try to meet and talk about it and if there

257
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,460
is any problem you have to find it pointed
out.

258
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,730
But here I don’t know but in Australia,
specially, the thing what happened, whatever

259
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:55,510
the leaders were doing, the same thing penetrated
into many Sahaja Yogis and they became sort

260
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:04,960
of half leaders and they used to sort of dominate
people and say things which are not at all

261
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
Sahaj.

262
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:12,370
Like last year was all right, before that
they started saying Australia is great, we

263
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:18,110
are the greatest thing, this, that, then half
of the Sahaja Yogis have left them.

264
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:23,260
Talking so big and bombastically, even the
Indians were surprised, they started looking

265
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,610
at them thinking what’s gone wrong with
them.

266
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:30,340
And they reported to Me that: “They would
not listen to anyone, we told them that: ’Please,

267
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,039
better start, we have to go now’ they would
not listen.

268
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,039
They said: ‘Our leader has to tell us.’.

269
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,440
They said: “Mother has said”.

270
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,370
“Mother, no, our leader.”

271
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:44,860
So even the leaders had replaced Me completely
because of these few people who joined hands

272
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,260
with the others like.

273
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,340
We can say, like the bureaucracy of Russia.

274
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:55,890
There is no bureaucracy, there is no priesthood
in Sahaja Yoga, everybody is equally the same.

275
00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:02,390
They’re all saints, are to be respected
and all the leaders must respect you and understand

276
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,390
you.

277
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:08,870
Of course if you have any problems on chakras
that must be told, that is their job and for

278
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,559
that you should be thankful.

279
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,909
Instead of feeling bad about it you should
be thankful to them that: “Yes, that is

280
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:19,260
so and we‘ll try to correct ourselves.”

281
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,570
Now the better part of it that now suddenly
I find there’s a big explosion of Sahaja

282
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:29,980
Yoga going on in various places where are
least expected like [UNCLEAR] and we have

283
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,049
other places like Turkey and Russia.

284
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:35,419
It’s something so remarkable is happening.

285
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:42,200
So Sahaja Yoga is taking its fruits well and
maybe these people might grow much faster

286
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,230
so you have to be careful, you should not
be left behind.

287
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:50,060
Because there is one thing I’ve given an
indication, I don’t know if you have told

288
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:57,690
them, last, this Ganapatipule that there is
going to be another jump, another triggering.

289
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:08,570
I always give the analogy of a air space,
you see, space craft, like we can say the

290
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:16,820
Sputnik or something, the principle of that,
same is applied to our evolution.

291
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:21,970
Like first is one container, which has three,
four containers in it.

292
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:29,810
So the first container goes half way and then
an explosion takes place and then the rest

293
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,309
of it is thrown out.

294
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:37,640
So the first speed, that is the velocity that
it has, gets absolutely accelerated and goes

295
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,730
with a much greater speed.

296
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,309
Then the second one explodes and then the
same thing happens, that’s how the speed

297
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:47,159
they ultimately they achieve is very high
up.

298
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:55,360
In the same way I feel that in Sahaja Yoga
is now happening and is the time for you to

299
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,160
know there is going to be another triggering.

300
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,210
And that triggering you have to catch up with.

301
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:07,490
For that you should be prepared, otherwise
you will be left in the container which is

302
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,630
just not to be used to it.

303
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:15,500
So a new triggering, a new jumping out has
to be done and for that you have to hurry

304
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,950
up and there’s no time to be lost.

305
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:24,470
So the most important thing is that we should
develop ourselves into that capacity that

306
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:29,929
we can jump on to the new triggering that
is going to take place in Sahaja Yoga.

307
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:34,529
So I have to warn you though you are few you
have to have a quality, quantity does not

308
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:37,960
matter, because so much of quantity might
drop out.

309
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,630
So the thing is those who really want to ascent
must understand that we must meditate morning,

310
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:48,480
evening and we must be absolutely collective.

311
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,850
If we are not collective then there’s something
serious with us, something wrong with us and

312
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,500
we have to correct it.

313
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:01,230
So these are the things I wanted to tell you
and I must say that the collective here will

314
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:07,940
now grow very much because of what we did,
today’s miracle that has taken place.

315
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:13,590
Yesterday we had lots of people, every time
I come there are at least three hundred people

316
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,720
and I knew there will be this time also.

317
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:25,770
But what is the difference, when I come they
are there and then they don’t come or even

318
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,700
if they come they disappear.

319
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,130
They must have confidence in you.

320
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,659
First you must have confidence in yourself.

321
00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:38,750
You must approach them in a way that they
feel confident.

322
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:43,559
They shouldn’t feel that: “Some silly
stupid people are sitting here just telling

323
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,150
us about these things”.

324
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:54,800
But you must have that dignity, you must have
that approach, you must have that understanding,

325
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,600
then only it will work out, otherwise you
cannot work it out.

326
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:09,760
My own idea is that wherever there are very
good deep Sahaja Yogis people stick on.

327
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,309
Like Austria, I would say.

328
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:19,230
In Austria we have quite a lot of [NEW] people
now, [MILAN] we have quite a lot of people.

329
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:26,809
The reason is both the places, I’ve noticed,
the Sahaja Yogis are of a very great quality.

330
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:29,429
They are all working it out.

331
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:36,809
Like there’s one boy who has fished out
lots of things from Quran, in German, from

332
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:39,480
Quran, what it has to say for Sahaj.

333
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:46,799
And they said there is a Sura called Shasta
Yoga, Shasta Yoga and that Sura is dealing

334
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:47,799
with Me.

335
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:52,390
Because we will be…it is said that: “We
are going to send and the sent, the One who

336
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,010
is sent will not be acceptable to you.

337
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,020
You will deny, you will defy”.

338
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:03,090
Everything is described, even that your hands
will speak at the time of Resurrection, all

339
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,770
that in that Sura is given.

340
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,029
It’s very interesting that Sura is.

341
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:10,210
So, what I’m saying they are trying to locate
it.

342
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,510
So many things in different things they are
moving now, also they are trying to make very

343
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:22,700
beautiful paintings and drawings and things,
to be able to explain.

344
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,840
Also they had TV programs.

345
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,400
So on the TV they told whatever their experience
is, this and that.

346
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,899
But if you yourself are not capable, you are
not going to influence anyone even if you

347
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:35,440
go to the TV or anywhere.

348
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,990
Nobody’s going to take you seriously.

349
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:46,409
So you have to be more serious about it and
to be more earnest to do your meditation.

350
00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:52,260
Now, there’s another aspect of Sahaja Yoga
that we want people to be married.

351
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,360
Married but married is not the last thing,
is not the last thing, is just an assistance,

352
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:05,840
we can say, a complement from the another
side so that you develop yourself better.

353
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,950
But any kind of hindrance in the marriage
can be a great hindrance for your ascent.

354
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:15,940
So don’t pay any attention to such hindrances,
just get out of it and try to remain your

355
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:23,159
Self because only it is your Self which is
going to give you joy and ascent, not anybody

356
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:24,159
else.

357
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,610
It will all work out when if you just keep
to your Self and understand that you are important,

358
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:35,919
you have to look after your ascent, also that
the collective of Sahaja Yoga is important.

359
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:41,990
It is very important for all of you because
you are so very few and it has to be worked

360
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,890
out in this country in a big way.

361
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:49,779
And everybody was asking why is it that in
New Zealand the people are the same, there’s

362
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:52,049
not much changing, why not progressing.

363
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:58,130
But I’m sure now more will happen and things
the way have triggered out today it might

364
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,130
work out.

365
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:05,029
So now this is my own submission about it
and if you think that there’s something

366
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:09,900
more I should say about it or something you
want to know you can write to Me, I will definitely

367
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,900
answer such letters.

368
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:15,649
But I don’t know what to answer to such
letters that: “My husband has run away with

369
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:16,929
another woman this thing, that thing”.

370
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:20,870
It’s not important, you have been married
so many times in life before.

371
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:26,610
So what does it matter if he runs away, let
him run away, what to do.

372
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:36,140
You are a Sahaja Yogi, how many women or how
many men have become Sahaja Yogis in this

373
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,140
world?

374
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,690
So you are so exceptional.

375
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:45,960
And such exceptional people should not bother
about mundane things and useless things.

376
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,640
They should know their responsibility.

377
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,690
It is you who will be responsible for the
emancipation of all the New Zealanders.

378
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,779
And this you must understand.

379
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:58,549
You should not try to put your esteem down.

380
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:01,210
Try to come up and work it out.

381
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,910
For every nation is important.

382
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,649
Some people are extremely alert and some people
are not.

383
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:11,059
But now I’m sure it will work out faster.

384
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:17,519
We have lots of people and now try to give
them, give them some tea, something to begin

385
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,880
with because their attention is on food but
you just don’t start eating [UNCLEAR] otherwise

386
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:29,780
they’ll think useless people, they are just
trying to…You should show all dignity or

387
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,070
a hospitality.

388
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,450
Hospitality helps a lot.

389
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:36,240
That’s a very important thing one should
understand.

390
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,650
Like in India if you come, they’ll see ten
times that you have taken your food, they’ll

391
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:45,120
call you, somebody’s not there, where are
you, must come and take.

392
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,730
But what I hear is that here nobody calls
anyone, anybody [UNCLEAR] you have your own

393
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:50,730
food.

394
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,450
Till the guests come outside so nobody says:
“All right.

395
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,450
Will you like…?

396
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,470
Did you have your food or not?

397
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,649
Did you have your breakfast?”

398
00:29:56,649 --> 00:30:01,280
That’s not the way, we have to be concerned
and we should have those mannerisms, which

399
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,200
are very beautiful of being hospitable to
people, see that they are…

400
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,200
I mean the guests are to be treated in a different
way and the inmates are of a different way

401
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,179
and that’s what whatever you do your children
are going to learn and behave in the same

402
00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:17,179
manner.

403
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:26,450
So we have to get this culture into us by
which we understand the value of other person,

404
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:33,860
of guests who have come, those who are not
yet Sahaja Yogis, who have yet to become Sahaja

405
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,450
Yogis, who have just got Realization.

406
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:44,470
They are to be treated with very great care,
like we can say a seed, which is just sprouted.

407
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,309
It’s so delicate.

408
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:49,309
The plant is in such a delicate way.

409
00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:54,120
Now you have to replant it properly into Sahaj
field.

410
00:30:54,120 --> 00:31:01,080
So what do you do is to take out all the sprouted
ones, slowly one by one, keeping proper distance

411
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,649
between them and try to plant them nicely
into the field of Sahaja Yoga.

412
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:12,460
But if you have certain value system, if you
have achieved something, then you shouldn’t

413
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,960
look down upon them or you should not all
the time make fun of them, because some people

414
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,039
are sarcastic, some are all the time smiling,
so they think that: “What is wrong with

415
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,630
us, why are they smiling, all the time?”.

416
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:30,279
So there is no need to have artificial smiles,
nor do there’s any need to sort of criticize

417
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:37,549
in a way or sometimes [IF] the smile could
be a ridicule, you know people think, they

418
00:31:37,549 --> 00:31:38,549
misunderstand.

419
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:42,470
Or to say that: “Your this bhoot is catching,
that bhoot is catching “ sometimes people

420
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,240
say: “This chakra is catching”.

421
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,240
Not necessary.

422
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,590
“Gradually, you should say, everything is
going to work out.

423
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:51,870
If you are not feeling the cool breeze, all
right, let’s see what is the problem is

424
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,870
like.”

425
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,929
But you need not tell them all these things,
this language, this should not be exposed

426
00:31:56,929 --> 00:32:02,270
to the first comers that they get frightened,
that our this center is catching, that center

427
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,809
is catching, create a big fright.

428
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:08,260
So we have to built up their confidence, that’s
very important.

429
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:13,020
Once you have built up their confidence and
once they start feeling the vibrations and

430
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,179
everything, they have to trust you, they have
to believe in you.

431
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:26,409
So this is the very small outline of the way
I would like New Zealand to come up and to

432
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:31,710
act in a sensible way so that people should
say that New Zealanders are the wisest in

433
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,710
Sahaja Yoga.

434
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,710
May God bless you all.

435
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,710
Imagine Greece Sahaja Yoga is only two years
old.

436
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,710
Only two years old.

437
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,710
Greece.

438
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,710
But that’s a traditional country, see, it’s
an ancient country, and the way the Greeks

439
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,129
have really fallen into Sahaja Yoga is beyond…
