1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:14,060
This program has been arranged by Vaitharna 
and Bombay Sahaja Yogis to welcome you all

2
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,730
to India.

3
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:28,079
Give them a hand.

4
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,419
(Applause)

5
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:55,260
All the way you all have travelled to come 
to this Holy Land, I should say, for your

6
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,360
spiritual growth.

7
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:10,520
Every country has been blessed by God Almighty, 
it's not only that India is a specially blessed

8
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
one.

9
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:22,909
But the people in India are definitely are 
very much blessed that they are even blind

10
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:25,020
to seeking.

11
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,320
They are not seeking as you people are seeking.

12
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,640
This is their big problem.

13
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:41,920
Because they think that they know everything 
about God and they don't have to bother, while

14
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,820
you are really seekers of Truth - no doubt 
about it.

15
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:54,749
And the way you are seeking, the way you have 
jumped into the ocean of joy and the way you

16
00:01:54,749 --> 00:02:01,950
are dancing today has really filled My heart 
with tremendous gratitude towards you.

17
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:12,400
Even to receive the blessings, you have to 
have people with open hearts, with wisdom,

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,470
with love, with feeling of collectivity and 
humanity.

19
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:36,340
Unless and until you are of that quality, 
it's impossible to make you work-out Sahaja

20
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,350
Yoga in this way.

21
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:45,450
My own experience of you all is this that 
you people are growing very fast.

22
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:52,810
And that's how Sahaja Yoga is manifesting 
even faster sometimes through you, people.

23
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:59,530
And when you tell Me what miracles you have 
met and what all the good things have happened

24
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:10,410
to you, I feel that you deserve much more 
and should happen to you many, many good things.

25
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:25,970
I hope, this tour will bring forth deeper, 
sweeter qualities that are inside, hidden

26
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:32,989
for so many years - ages - and that you will 
feel very much satisfied with yourself.

27
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:41,260
That you are born as a human being and now 
you are reborn as a Sahaja Yogi.

28
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:48,540
I'm sure it will happen in this tour, most 
of you, that you will feel your depth and

29
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,370
that you will develop real respect for the 
glory that you are.

30
00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:04,050
Sahaja Yogi has no business to feel guilty, 
nor does he have anything to do with condemning

31
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:09,870
himself . You must know that if you were not 
a Sahaja Yogi, I could not have talked to

32
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,120
you, you could not have come to India, you 
could not have known what is the Spirit. and

33
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,060
also know the amount of knowledge you know.

34
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:25,970
Nobody, so far, in the whole history of spirituality 
knew - except for the Incarnations.

35
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,820
So you are put quite close to Incarnations.

36
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:38,760
So you have to be very proud, not vain, but 
proud, because what you know is the Truth.

37
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:50,470
Despite of this beautiful awareness that you 
have about yourself should really mould you

38
00:04:50,470 --> 00:05:00,260
into beautiful people, into an image of that 
collectivity about what we have thought of.

39
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:09,290
And in the future we have to think of Ram-Raj, 
is the Kingdom of God being brought on this

40
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,290
earth.

41
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:18,660
Instead of we going into the Kingdom of God, 
let us bring the Kingdom of God on this earth.

42
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:28,280
It's possible, but you have to look after 
your growth and the sacrifices of giving it

43
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
to others.

44
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,780
Here you don't have to sacrifice anything 
as such, you don't have to surrender anything.

45
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:42,190
What you have to surrender is your ego and 
your super-ego.

46
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,910
Then you become free people.

47
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:52,860
And this freedom will take you very much higher 
and higher in your spiritual Ascent.

48
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,980
There's only one thing I have to be apologetic 
about, that the arrangements we make for you,

49
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:04,810
are all in the surroundings of nature, because 
you yourself do not want to live in cement

50
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,810
houses.

51
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:15,730
As a result, we have to organize other facilities 
in a little Spartan way and sometimes could

52
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,470
be inconvenient to you.

53
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:25,210
But I hope, you will go through all that, 
with joy and happiness, and will understand

54
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,180
that that's the maximum one can do in a far-fetched 
places of this kind.

55
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:37,840
The nature is surrounding you and nature is 
so beautiful and it sings the praise of God

56
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:50,460
in every way - the leaves, the flowers, the 
trees, the ripples of the rivers - and the

57
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:57,500
great mountains, like great Sahaja Yogis, 
are meditating and emitting vibrations all

58
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
over.

59
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,750
So one has to be more receptive than to be 
more complaining, should be more enjoying

60
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:16,150
than feeling sad, should be one with Myself 
than with yourself in the sense that the Self

61
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,190
that is within you is weak.

62
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:24,630
So when you start thinking about your small, 
petty stuff, then you are not with Me at all.

63
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:30,139
So try to enjoy yourself in the most collective 
way.

64
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:36,110
We have achieved quite a lot, I think, in 
this short time.

65
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:43,040
I feel we have achieved a lot, because so 
many saints have been created, so many people

66
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,300
have been transformed.

67
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:54,600
They look like lotuses before Me and I just 
loose all control over words and cannot fill

68
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:01,100
in this joy into the cup of those poor little 
words.

69
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:06,780
They cannot carry My joy and My feelings to 
you.

70
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:14,530
But I am really overjoyed, and I think, gradually, 
I may become a person who may never get angry

71
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:22,860
with anyone and maybe a person who'll loose 
complete sense of controlling anyone whatsoever.

72
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:34,099
We have some mishaps, as you know, in every 
country something happens and it's a little

73
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:42,110
backward movement, but every backward movement 
gives you a greater push and it has to happen,

74
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:48,350
because we have people who sometimes retard 
your progress.

75
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,770
They try to create problems which are unsurmountable.

76
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,120
So they have to give up Sahaja Yoga.

77
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,450
And doesn't matter - as long as we all are 
progressing - one or two persons here and

78
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,860
there, doesn't matter at all.

79
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:07,550
On the contrary, we should be thankful, that 
all such people, who were responsible for

80
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,710
retarding our growth, have left us and have 
left us in peace.

81
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,930
So, all these attachments should be given 
up.

82
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:21,520
I have an experience, which I must tell you 
so far, that if, say, one Mr.X - supposing

83
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,490
he was a leader or he was something - and 
he leaves, because - or he has to leave, because

84
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:34,070
of certain problems that he has and he cannot 
continue or I have to ask him to leave, then

85
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:41,690
some people still get worried about that person 
and get attached to that person or think about

86
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,279
that person.

87
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:50,250
This is a common experience I've had and such 
people also gradually get lost.

88
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,770
So, now you have to know that you are not 
more compassionate than I am.

89
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:03,540
If I have asked somebody to go out of Sahaja 
Yoga, it is out of compassion to you all that

90
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,370
I have asked him to get out.

91
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:11,310
And you should be compassionate to yourself 
not to bother about such people who have left

92
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,660
Sahaja Yoga.

93
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,120
Just give them up, we have to give them up, 
because they are on the periphery and they

94
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,100
are trying to move towards the periphery.

95
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,880
So, let them get out.

96
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,940
We cannot waste our energy for them.

97
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,710
Those people who are problematic should know 
that they should improve their problems and

98
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:36,430
must get into the centre and keep their pace 
onward.

99
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:42,550
Instead of, if they try to go down and down 
and down and all the time threaten that we

100
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,950
have to leave Sahaja Yoga, you better tell 
them that once for all, "Get out!"

101
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,870
That's the only way we can save others.

102
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:57,490
As I've told you many-a-times that one bad 
apple can spoil all the rest of them though

103
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,700
they may be good.

104
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,900
So you have to be very kind to yourself and 
very compassionate and should thank yourself

105
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,190
that you are in Sahaja Yoga and that you can 
progress very well.

106
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,460
This is a new dimension into which we are 
moving.

107
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:19,529
Here we don't have to see what is our progress 
materially, physically or also intellectually.

108
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:21,880
You have to see what is our progress spiritually.

109
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:32,430
Because spiritual progress is complete knowledge, 
absolute knowledge, is complete joy, absolute

110
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:44,050
joy and it is a complete power, absolute power.

111
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:49,440
That's what we have to aim at.

112
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,490
May God bless you all.
