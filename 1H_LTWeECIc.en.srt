1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,804
Today we have decided to have Krishna Puja

2
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:13,629
because America is the Krishna bhoomi.

3
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:24,780
It’s very surprising that such a great
 incarnation of Shri Krishna

4
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:36,558
came even much later than Rama and has
sent His special people to live in America.

5
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:44,422
Of course, there are many who are seeking
in this country, no doubt.

6
00:00:44,623 --> 00:00:48,948
But there are many who are also misleading
them.

7
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:58,257
That’s how you find, despite all our
effort, we have not been able

8
00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:03,769
to expand Sahaja Yoga very much.

9
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:13,683
What one has to learn from His life
is very, very important.

10
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:20,397
The first and foremost thing He taught
was collectivity.

11
00:01:21,622 --> 00:01:26,770
He used to get hold of small boys

12
00:01:29,137 --> 00:01:33,500
and play with them together.

13
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:39,546
Rama didn't do that.

14
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:45,544
He used to get hold of ladies

15
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:55,014
who were selling milk and also butter,

16
00:01:55,226 --> 00:02:03,261
those who used to go to fill their waters -
water in the pitcher.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:16,386
He is the one who collected all such people
in the village of Gokul.

18
00:02:18,224 --> 00:02:27,646
He played all kinds of pranks on His
friends

19
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:34,192
and His mother and the mother’s friends.

20
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:39,690
Behaved just like a very naughty child,

21
00:02:40,723 --> 00:02:48,310
just to show that He was just like
all of us.

22
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:54,715
As you know, He was the incarnation
of Shri Vishnu.

23
00:02:54,916 --> 00:03:05,334
First Shri Rama was born, took incarnation
as Shri Rama,

24
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:14,215
which was in the Aryan race, means that
time we had

25
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:23,763
an Aryan race which was sort of superior,
superior race than others.

26
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:30,948
But when He came as Krishna, He took
His birth

27
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:38,407
in Yadav dynasty, you can call it.

28
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:46,876
They were not superior, they were selling
milk, having cowherds

29
00:03:47,077 --> 00:03:57,024
and doing work not of any religious style.

30
00:03:57,422 --> 00:04:03,220
But they were innocent simple people
living in the villages,

31
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:11,897
and they saw the great miracles
of Shri Krishna’s childhood.

32
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:16,913
He killed demons. He killed Pootana.

33
00:04:17,114 --> 00:04:23,989
All these people were sent by His uncle
Kamsa to kill him.

34
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,261
It was to be, because He had to prove that
He was the incarnation

35
00:04:32,462 --> 00:04:35,794
of Shri Vishnu and He did it.

36
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:41,474
As a child, how He killed those people
is remarkable.

37
00:04:41,675 --> 00:04:47,180
And how He made them out though they were
all camouflaged.

38
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:55,126
In these modern times, difficult for people
to believe

39
00:04:55,327 --> 00:05:01,450
that there could have been any incarnation
like Shri Krishna.

40
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:12,635
But in Sahaja Yoga, we have method
of absolutely establishing the truth

41
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:18,451
that Shri Krishna was there ruling
on the Vishuddhi chakra.

42
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:23,926
From His childhood, you can see He was
fond of collectivity.

43
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,015
And He tried to create collectivity
of people

44
00:05:29,216 --> 00:05:35,669
who were very simple, uneducated,
good-hearted people.

45
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:39,948
And that is His special quality.

46
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:48,339
And all the people of that village knew Him
very well, all cared for Him.

47
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,060
And when He had to go,

48
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:59,786
they felt very sad and all of them came
running and crying for Him.

49
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:03,792
It was a small boy who was going.

50
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:10,187
After all, what is there? A little boy
from the village is going.

51
00:06:10,388 --> 00:06:15,028
The whole village had gathered
to cry for Him.

52
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:26,213
That is what we all Sahaja Yogis have
to know.

53
00:06:26,414 --> 00:06:33,403
As a child also, He was a very collective
personality.

54
00:06:33,604 --> 00:06:36,232
He actually emits collectiveness.

55
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:42,246
The collective consciousness that you enjoy
is because of His bliss.

56
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:54,311
I find that Americans are very collective
in the sense,

57
00:06:54,518 --> 00:06:59,020
they are more bothered about other
countries than about their own.

58
00:06:59,221 --> 00:07:07,390
They want to go all the way to Vietnam,
now to Iraq, now to some other place.

59
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:13,071
Going all over the world, they try
to correct.

60
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:21,432
But their own country they do not see
what's wrong. It's so divided.

61
00:07:22,265 --> 00:07:29,885
Mainly divided on race, racial
discrimination,

62
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:39,449
is divided by religions and all of these
are just concepts

63
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:45,036
which they have accepted and are fighting
among themselves.

64
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:51,502
Now after all these,

65
00:07:53,212 --> 00:08:02,355
there are people who believe they are born
criminals and they should be criminals.

66
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:09,537
And their criminality is going very far.

67
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:17,561
They are gangsters. Even small children
have become gangsters.

68
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:23,241
But the worst part is that the, these
little boys also,

69
00:08:23,442 --> 00:08:31,084
including others, all these criminals are
regarded as big heroes.

70
00:08:34,178 --> 00:08:42,221
I have seen once, a young boy wearing
a shirt

71
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:46,512
with another young boy’s photograph
over it.

72
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:50,422
So he told Me - I said, “Who is this?”
“You don’t know?

73
00:08:50,623 --> 00:08:53,818
Very famous gangster is he”, he said.

74
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:57,737
At the age of thirteen years he is
a very famous gangster

75
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:02,732
and this boy is very proudly putting up
that -

76
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:09,488
like a big hero, or you can call it
like a God there.

77
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:21,581
So see the perversion to what limit
Shri Krishna's blessings have been used.

78
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:26,173
That's why this country is very difficult.

79
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:35,443
One after another there has been attack
of negativity.

80
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:40,603
For example, first thing started
by Christians,

81
00:09:40,804 --> 00:09:44,134
who said that Jews killed Christ.

82
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:49,973
He never - It’s not true, it’s not true.
He was never killed by Jews.

83
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:56,686
“Christ was killed by Jews”, is a false
statement, absolutely.

84
00:09:56,887 --> 00:10:04,905
Christ was not killed by Jews. How can
a multitude kill a man?

85
00:10:05,113 --> 00:10:15,970
It’s the law there. The Romans, or we can
call the Roman law crucified Him.

86
00:10:16,876 --> 00:10:23,784
So the Christians started nicely torturing
the Jews, because Christ was killed.

87
00:10:23,985 --> 00:10:30,101
I don’t know how to explain this such
absurd idea.

88
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:36,863
Now somebody was killed so many years back,
and now what’s the use of killing

89
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:42,834
some grandchildren of those people or great
grandchildren of those people?

90
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:46,788
But they did not, the Jews did not.

91
00:10:48,664 --> 00:10:54,669
Still this concept was there that
the Jews killed.

92
00:10:55,082 --> 00:11:04,956
And the Christians felt they have a right
to torture the Jews.

93
00:11:05,157 --> 00:11:09,167
So when the Jews came here, they were
never given a good position,

94
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:13,512
they were tortured very much and troubled
very much.

95
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:18,322
It happened everywhere but very much
more here.

96
00:11:18,523 --> 00:11:24,996
So among Jews now came out some devils,
like Freud.

97
00:11:25,492 --> 00:11:37,307
And he said, “All right. We must shatter
these Christians absolutely.

98
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:40,629
Their moral roots must be finished.”

99
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:50,513
So he started his own psychology to destroy
the Christians.

100
00:11:50,714 --> 00:11:54,749
And Christians stupidly accepted.

101
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:08,509
They did whatever he said, experimented
whatever he did.

102
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:16,803
When I was once in Switzerland, two girls
came and they were shaking in the program.

103
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:21,384
I couldn't understand. I called them.
I said, "Why are you shaking?"

104
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:35,512
So they said that, "Actually we are very
much degree holders in Freudian knowledge

105
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,707
and we have done all experiments of Freud."

106
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:46,858
“And then why are you shaking?” “Because
we have power to shake!” How about that?

107
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:56,716
So they followed this Freud and this
vindictiveness that was there

108
00:12:56,917 --> 00:13:01,606
was not seen by anyone, even by Jews.

109
00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:14,314
As a result we had people who were deadly
against each other

110
00:13:14,515 --> 00:13:18,798
and ruining each other, destroying
each other.

111
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:27,460
Then this Black and White business started.

112
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:32,921
All kinds of theories people are putting up

113
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:39,798
to show that the Blacks are bad or
the Whites are bad.

114
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:44,424
The difference is only skin-deep.

115
00:13:44,938 --> 00:13:49,220
If you want you can cut the skin and see
for yourself.

116
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:55,278
Inside body is the same. But it was so.

117
00:13:55,479 --> 00:14:03,839
This divisive method started and it's still
going on.

118
00:14:05,456 --> 00:14:15,645
I always say, without Blacks, Americans
will be left high and dry.

119
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,482
Look at the talent they have.

120
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:24,192
Not only music. Atlanta, I saw,

121
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:30,421
all the Blacks were winning and Whites
were not anywhere. Just imagine.

122
00:14:30,622 --> 00:14:38,413
Very nicely they used to run, very swiftly
at the end of it, you see.

123
00:14:38,614 --> 00:14:40,978
And all the Whites were saying,
"Ha, ha, ha."

124
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:44,985
They were nicely enjoying their position.

125
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:49,775
You don't have the stamina of the Blacks
also.

126
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:55,059
So in games also, same thing.

127
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:59,571
With all this what is going to happen
to America?

128
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:05,252
It's a country which has to be collective
because of Shri Krishna.

129
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:11,075
All of them are immigrants here. Who is
not an immigrant?

130
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:15,118
Whether they came earlier or later
doesn't matter.

131
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:18,766
Thank God, I have told you many-a-times
that Columbus lost his way

132
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:23,898
and came here, not to India. Otherwise,
there would have been no Indians left

133
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:26,775
and no Sahaja Yoga.

134
00:15:28,418 --> 00:15:33,270
I think, it was the trick of Hanumana.

135
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:39,577
He misled him and Columbus came here.
Thank God.

136
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:50,881
Now, you are in a country where you have
to be collective.

137
00:15:51,722 --> 00:15:55,587
Krishna won't spare you unless and until
you are collective

138
00:15:55,788 --> 00:16:02,218
or you give up this nonsense of skin-deep
differences.

139
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:13,943
Then religious differences. He had a friend
who was lame by one leg.

140
00:16:14,152 --> 00:16:17,809
He had some friends who were very black.

141
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:23,107
He had some friends who were quite
Indian white, I should say.

142
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:27,269
I shouldn’t say white like you people,
but Indian white.

143
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,546
He had all kinds of colors.

144
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:34,279
And He took His own birth in the Yadav
vansha.

145
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:44,738
Though they were milk sellers, milkmen
who used to sell milk to people.

146
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:52,204
He didn't take His birth in a very royal
family like Shri Rama.

147
00:16:52,405 --> 00:17:00,985
Though He was, because later on He became
the king of Dwarika.

148
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:09,296
But in His style, in His behavior,
in His life,

149
00:17:09,598 --> 00:17:16,216
nobody could see that He was a royal
personality.

150
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,848
He could sleep under a tree.

151
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:24,745
He could eat anything that He could get.

152
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:28,925
All kinds of sweet, sweet stories you can
read in His life,

153
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:38,984
showing how He was enjoying His
collectivity, never showing off.

154
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:47,380
And His collectivity has to be worked out
in this country.

155
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:57,464
Unless and until it is done from your
heart, it's not going to work out.

156
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:04,445
We had problems like this always with
our collectivity here.

157
00:18:04,646 --> 00:18:09,196
For example, a lady, you know, she is
a big lady, I think.

158
00:18:09,397 --> 00:18:12,290
She started correcting people: “Why do
you put here?

159
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:16,435
This thing is getting dirty. That thing
is this and that.”

160
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:23,720
Such a woman should be sometimes sent
to some stable to clean it.

161
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:29,046
Then she will give up these nonsensical
ideas that she has.

162
00:18:29,347 --> 00:18:34,497
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you cannot behave
like this.

163
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:39,739
And this kind of behavior can destroy
Sahaja Yoga.

164
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:43,727
Have you ever heard Me saying that,
“This is dirty,

165
00:18:43,928 --> 00:18:49,464
this is not good, I don’t like this?”.
Did I say, ever?

166
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:59,149
First of all, we have to understand,
if we have to be collective,

167
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:04,154
we should give up these stupid ideas
about ourselves.

168
00:19:08,587 --> 00:19:14,088
Some people get some position, may be
some money,

169
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:18,728
maybe, I would say, have a background.

170
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:23,588
If you are sticking on to it then you are
not a Sahaja Yogi.

171
00:19:24,147 --> 00:19:26,916
You are saints!

172
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,765
You cannot be demanding.

173
00:19:33,494 --> 00:19:38,993
You have to give, and give, and give.

174
00:19:39,364 --> 00:19:42,703
Whatever may be your position in life,

175
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:48,986
if that can overpower you then you are
not a Sahaja Yogi at all.

176
00:19:54,062 --> 00:20:02,915
Shri Krishna, who is the Virat, who is
the great primordial personality,

177
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:11,400
didn't show any such signs of His
greatness.

178
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:16,483
But Americans have a speciality to show

179
00:20:16,684 --> 00:20:21,778
that they are something outstandingly
great.

180
00:20:22,685 --> 00:20:26,894
But Sahaja Yogis, please don't learn
those things.

181
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:30,809
You have to make others unlearn.

182
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:41,352
If that cannot happen, it's better to leave
Sahaja Yoga for ever.

183
00:20:43,591 --> 00:20:51,856
Such people will make everyone miserable
and destroy Sahaja Yoga in America.

184
00:20:53,278 --> 00:21:00,874
Even about protocol, you should become
timeless.

185
00:21:03,004 --> 00:21:06,149
Absolutely timeless.

186
00:21:06,357 --> 00:21:11,037
Now, if you are particular about time,

187
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:16,347
Shri Krishna will play His tricks and your
timing will be finished.

188
00:21:16,548 --> 00:21:19,217
Happened yesterday.

189
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:31,771
So, one has to know that time is your slave

190
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:38,720
and you don't have to be the slave
of time - if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

191
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:45,857
Otherwise, you are not. That means
you are guided not by the Divine.

192
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:52,711
The Divine works out everything very well.
But for whom? For Sahaja Yogis.

193
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:57,465
But if you are not Sahaja Yogis,
you'll topple down.

194
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:09,899
In every way we should find out what things
we have accumulated among ourselves

195
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:13,505
which is not Shri Krishna's quality.

196
00:22:15,118 --> 00:22:24,889
Now, Shri Krishna used to steal as a child,
the butter from the ladies, why?

197
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:31,808
Why did He steal the butter? Because
they were selling it

198
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:39,923
to the military of Kamsa, His uncle,
who was a devil.

199
00:22:41,337 --> 00:22:46,255
They used to go all the way to sell him
in Mathura.

200
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:52,656
So He used to steal it, because children
needed it, and giving it to children.

201
00:22:52,857 --> 00:22:57,700
He didn’t like this idea – why should it go

202
00:22:58,261 --> 00:23:06,506
to these horrible rakshasas of Mathura.

203
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:11,106
Just the opposite in is America.

204
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:18,669
All the false gurus, all the rakshasas come
here and they get all the butter.

205
00:23:22,591 --> 00:23:31,692
As if people have no brains to understand,

206
00:23:32,253 --> 00:23:38,324
while Shri Krishna is the brain
of the Virat.

207
00:23:39,046 --> 00:23:41,752
But here you find that people have
no brains.

208
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:47,263
Anybody comes, says something, they:
“Ah, ha, ha, great.”

209
00:23:47,878 --> 00:23:50,408
Somebody talks big - all right.

210
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:53,668
They’ll give away their money. They’ll give
away their houses.

211
00:23:53,869 --> 00:24:00,252
Their children they’ll remove from the
school – for something extremely stupid.

212
00:24:02,448 --> 00:24:09,469
While He is the brain in the body
of Virata.

213
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:14,865
So this kind of brainlessness comes

214
00:24:15,571 --> 00:24:20,715
and we really start, even Sahaja Yogis
start behaving in a manner

215
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:24,271
that shows they are really brainless.

216
00:24:30,532 --> 00:24:36,780
Apart from that, He is Kubera. He is
the God of wealth.

217
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:40,828
That's why there is wealth in this country.

218
00:24:41,454 --> 00:24:44,446
But this wealth is all becoming debts,
you see,

219
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:48,813
because of the special brains of Americans.

220
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:54,678
They are so stupid that whatever is selling
in the market,

221
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:57,098
whether they need it or not, they'll buy.

222
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:05,531
Take loan, again take loan, take loan
till they are absolutely indebted.

223
00:25:05,732 --> 00:25:13,016
Now here in the country of Kubera you
should be really rich.

224
00:25:13,217 --> 00:25:20,131
Rich doesn't mean just to have bank
balance, but means by temperament.

225
00:25:23,093 --> 00:25:26,059
Now it's much better but once upon a time,

226
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:32,399
Americans were the most miserly
Sahaja Yogis.

227
00:25:32,896 --> 00:25:39,302
They used to send Me candles as present
and I used to hide that.

228
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:45,482
I said, "Baba why do you send candles,
even? Don't send anything,

229
00:25:45,683 --> 00:25:48,817
because everybody is going to see
those candles

230
00:25:49,018 --> 00:25:53,396
and what are they going to say about it,
that candles have been sent."

231
00:25:55,061 --> 00:25:59,642
Now, this I am talking for introspection.

232
00:25:59,895 --> 00:26:09,866
Are we collective? Are we willing to share
everything that we have?

233
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:18,590
Do we look down upon people who come
from other countries?

234
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:22,292
Do we have racialism in us?

235
00:26:22,785 --> 00:26:25,650
Thirty-five Sahaja Yogis came from
Australia

236
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:30,312
to America as if this is some Hajj.

237
00:26:30,513 --> 00:26:34,251
They went back with very bad vibrations.

238
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,185
Out of them half were thrown out
of Sahaja Yoga.

239
00:26:38,386 --> 00:26:45,011
Imagine, Australia is the country where
they used to send all the criminals.

240
00:26:47,627 --> 00:26:54,370
So first and foremost, to judge yourself
is to see your vibrations.

241
00:26:55,212 --> 00:26:58,693
That you should meditate and judge
your vibrations

242
00:26:58,894 --> 00:27:02,933
if you are really collective or not.

243
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:10,355
Because you are not like that, Sahaja Yoga
does not spread.

244
00:27:11,434 --> 00:27:16,560
I have seen people from Hare Rama
Hare Krishna.

245
00:27:20,811 --> 00:27:25,623
Poor things have found nothing. They get up
at four o'clock,

246
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:31,613
start their Hare Rama Hare Krishna bhajan -
four o'clock. Alright.

247
00:27:31,814 --> 00:27:37,778
Then the whole day they wear a very thin
dhoti in which they are shivering.

248
00:27:37,979 --> 00:27:42,525
They shave their heads and put a very…

249
00:27:42,726 --> 00:27:47,164
pig’s tail here which is bought
in the market.

250
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:53,958
If you see their dedication you'll be
surprised.

251
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:01,529
How they are so much dedicated, when they
haven't found anything whatsoever?

252
00:28:02,008 --> 00:28:06,929
What about the nuns? You see them,
you’ll be amazed.

253
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:13,044
One fellow came from the Catholic Church
to us.

254
00:28:13,245 --> 00:28:20,268
He was trying to be a priest. He said,
“Mother, Sahaja Yog –

255
00:28:20,469 --> 00:28:23,262
you don’t do anything, anything.” I said,
“What do you want to do?”

256
00:28:23,463 --> 00:28:30,007
“You know, there we could not eat any
meat on Fridays.

257
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:34,782
On Saturdays, we could not drink anything.

258
00:28:34,983 --> 00:28:41,835
Then on Sundays, the whole day we had
to fast and pray to God."

259
00:28:42,036 --> 00:28:44,668
"Then - what about the rest of the time?"

260
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:53,479
"The rest of the time, we had to remember
Bible by heart and then recite it.

261
00:28:53,680 --> 00:29:01,083
And if we made even one mistake, the father
would give us a nice beating.”

262
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:11,067
That's another problem with Sahaja Yoga
because it is Shri Krishna's play.

263
00:29:11,924 --> 00:29:17,998
It's so simple. You don't have to do
anything of the kind.

264
00:29:18,855 --> 00:29:24,263
No disciplining, nothing. Left to you,
you are your own master.

265
00:29:24,464 --> 00:29:27,467
You are your own guru.

266
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:32,384
But these things which are lingering
in your mind,

267
00:29:32,593 --> 00:29:36,065
which are just the opposite of Shri
Krishna’s life,

268
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:39,413
which you have acquired in this country,

269
00:29:39,614 --> 00:29:44,034
are still there, here and there, here
and there left.

270
00:29:46,846 --> 00:29:54,710
Some of the people are really still
so much busy with themselves.

271
00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:00,868
They look so pale, thin – I tell you,
I can’t believe they are Sahaja Yogis.

272
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:09,632
So when we see Shri Krishna's life,
the way He lived.

273
00:30:10,711 --> 00:30:17,839
And then He went to help the Pandavas.

274
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:25,739
He told Arjuna that, "I can be your
charioteer.

275
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:31,076
I can drive your chariot. But I will
not fight."

276
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:37,933
Arjuna knew that He was all-powerful,
if He is there everything will work out.

277
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:43,652
“And all My army I’ll give to Kauravas,
to seek the balance.”

278
00:30:44,377 --> 00:30:46,536
He said, "All right."

279
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:53,508
He didn't fight to show off, I am this,
I am that.

280
00:30:53,709 --> 00:30:59,120
Like here: “Mother, I am the leader”.
Eh?

281
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:04,681
“I am the leader.” “Can’t hear, I can’t
hear you.”

282
00:31:07,688 --> 00:31:10,942
"Mother, I am this."

283
00:31:11,628 --> 00:31:14,398
You are a Sahaja Yogi.

284
00:31:16,219 --> 00:31:20,276
It's a very great name that you have
achieved.

285
00:31:20,477 --> 00:31:28,412
The highest position you have achieved.
There’s nothing more to be achieved.

286
00:31:30,003 --> 00:31:34,094
Like somebody asked Me, “Mother,
the Indians in India never catch.

287
00:31:34,295 --> 00:31:39,086
Why do we go on catching all the time?”
I said, “Because Indians in India

288
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:42,253
know they have achieved it now.
Nothing to be achieved.

289
00:31:42,454 --> 00:31:46,891
And you want to have God’s Realization –
I don’t know what other Realization.”

290
00:31:47,092 --> 00:31:49,625
They don't think like that.

291
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:56,591
They say, "We have achieved now. We are
in the sea. It's for us to swim over."

292
00:32:01,082 --> 00:32:06,220
All these things some of you have crossed
over, some of you

293
00:32:06,421 --> 00:32:10,581
have absolutely lost them. But some of you
are still there.

294
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:13,798
They are the most dangerous thing
as Christ has said,

295
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:17,709
"Be careful of the murmuring souls."

296
00:32:23,033 --> 00:32:28,723
I don't know how to stop this little
rat-like people,

297
00:32:28,924 --> 00:32:32,631
who are cutting the nest of Sahaja Yoga.

298
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:40,099
I've been reported about many and I am
really shocked.

299
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:47,384
After so many years of My visit how can
people talk ill of each other

300
00:32:47,585 --> 00:32:50,769
and can create these problems?

301
00:32:53,401 --> 00:33:01,264
Shri Krishna's friendship is well known,
you know with Sudama how He behaved.

302
00:33:02,417 --> 00:33:11,327
All His beautiful manifestations must show
in your character.

303
00:33:11,528 --> 00:33:15,511
Then only this country can be saved.

304
00:33:15,712 --> 00:33:22,483
I must say it’s – now here we have Canada,
we have people also,

305
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:32,225
I am told from Austria. From all over,
from England.

306
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:38,987
But still, we are not so many people
as we should have been.

307
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:44,955
If you just take Austrians, they must be
double of this.

308
00:33:46,488 --> 00:33:50,618
If they could do it, why can't we do it?

309
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:58,977
Because we do not introspect and we do
not grow out of our egos.

310
00:34:00,044 --> 00:34:04,163
They will say that, "Why didn't Krishna
meditate?"

311
00:34:04,551 --> 00:34:07,969
You have to meditate on Shri Krishna.

312
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:11,941
If He meditates what will happen
to you all?

313
00:34:18,647 --> 00:34:20,723
On the whole, I was very happy with
yesterday -

314
00:34:20,924 --> 00:34:29,150
the other day’s program, somehow.
Despite, as usual, in New York,

315
00:34:29,363 --> 00:34:38,709
our inability to really do good
advertising, unsystematic everything.

316
00:34:39,748 --> 00:34:45,436
Despite that we had so many people and
I put the responsibility on them.

317
00:34:45,637 --> 00:34:51,722
Because that's the thing - it is Shri
Krishna's responsibility.

318
00:34:53,922 --> 00:34:58,633
And that is what is your responsibility
now.

319
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:09,199
You are responsible for America and Canada,
South America.

320
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,805
You all are responsible and you people
should be such

321
00:35:15,006 --> 00:35:22,599
that people who see you, listen to you,
are with you,

322
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:29,032
should know that these are the Gopa
and Gopis of Shri Krishna.

323
00:35:30,655 --> 00:35:36,462
Unless and until that thing happens, this
America is the most difficult place.

324
00:35:36,663 --> 00:35:41,012
Sometimes I feel it's not Gokul but
Mathura.

325
00:35:42,952 --> 00:35:47,453
So it is for you - and otherwise you cannot
enjoy.

326
00:35:47,654 --> 00:35:53,509
If you live with your all old clothes,
you can't enjoy.

327
00:35:55,281 --> 00:36:01,146
I must say this time there were so many
people and I have asked them to promise,

328
00:36:01,347 --> 00:36:10,667
and asked to put a bandhan on them, and I’m
sure they will try to keep My promise.

329
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:15,914
I am sure. But it is you people who
disappoint them.

330
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:20,698
When they see you, they are disappointed.

331
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:25,678
Actually, here is the first time, Vishwa
Nirmala Dharm

332
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:31,915
has been established as a religion.

333
00:36:34,187 --> 00:36:41,951
It is. But the rest of it is zero.

334
00:36:44,438 --> 00:36:51,307
So all these differences and divisiveness
has to finish

335
00:36:51,508 --> 00:36:57,823
and we should be one in the collective
nature of Shri Krishna.

336
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:09,638
First, meditation is very important.
Introspection is very important.

337
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,525
And also, meeting each other, talking
to each other,

338
00:37:16,726 --> 00:37:20,221
knowing each other is very important.

339
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:28,545
It has worked all over. It’s worked out
in India tremendously,

340
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:35,605
Russia tremendously, Bulgaria tremendously,
so why not here?

341
00:37:36,431 --> 00:37:41,617
It's no fashion for brainless people.

342
00:37:43,392 --> 00:37:51,921
It is a living process which has to take
place where you must mature.

343
00:37:52,122 --> 00:37:57,244
And what I find that Americans are
not matured.

344
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:04,576
But you are now mature. You are now
mature people.

345
00:38:04,777 --> 00:38:10,704
And I hope you will all behave like mature
people henceforth.

346
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:14,984
So may God bless you!
