1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,800
now

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:20,000
this left hand side of the heart

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,400
is concerned with your mother

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,880
and with shiva

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,199
the existence you get your existence

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,559
through your mind

7
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:36,399
and shiva and power they are your

8
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:40,800
parents both are your parents

9
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,800
as far as your existence

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:49,520
and it is such a beautiful

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,360
center is your heart center

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,920
you want somebody to do something for

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,120
you twice

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,879
they want that somebody should need

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,480
or something you find somebody very

16
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,559
obsessed like i have

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,159
told you that you can beat them with you

18
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,320
do all those things but there's a very

19
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,760
simple way if you know how to do it

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,439
you see you just think of their

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,479
their heart and put a bandhan to that

22
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:20,000
and you can do it so beautifully

23
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:22,320
you can melt a person without any

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,360
difficulties if you know how to handle

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,560
their heart you have to appeal

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,360
to their heart and that's the best

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,880
attraction

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,079
at all and the best

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,560
secret method by which you can bring

30
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,200
good india when you are talking to

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,000
somebody

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,560
supposing i now intellectually if i

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,720
start

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,759
quarreling with you you'll give me up in

35
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,119
no time but

36
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,159
i have to use your power and i have to

37
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,759
enter into your

38
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,000
heart and that is how it works so always

39
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,159
when

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,759
you want to do something like that just

41
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,560
humble down yourself

42
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,399
in your heart that is first first of all

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,439
you must tumble down yourself in your

44
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,680
heart

45
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,600
and from there work on the heart of

46
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,959
others just put

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,920
a bundle and you will see a person will

48
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,360
melt away

49
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,760
we melt our intelligence our ego

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,560
everything even your superego in your

51
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,959
heart

52
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,239
so it's a very thing if you know how to

53
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,599
approach people

54
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:30,720
through their heart and

55
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:33,840
that is only possible if you are genuine

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,000
because genuineness is something that a

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,840
heart recognizes

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,040
you can be fool a person with your

59
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,599
cunning methods

60
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,640
but the heart will recognize it later

61
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,200
and the person will

62
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,160
hate you even if you talk to someone oh

63
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,920
very much very good thank you very much

64
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,160
and the heart knows so he's trying to

65
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,959
before me and he is very funny

66
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,840
the heart is going to hate such a person

67
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,239
and

68
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,959
heart has the utterance and feel the

69
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,959
person

70
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,800
so if you could appeal to somebody's

71
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,480
heart and put a bundle

72
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,120
on the heart you can melt that person

73
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,959
and if you love someone and if you want

74
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,840
that person should be corrected

75
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,200
supposing such a person is a drunkard or

76
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,599
a person who beats you

77
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,879
and is torturing you because he's under

78
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,040
the spell of

79
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,000
some drugs or some sort of a foreign

80
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,080
thing

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,120
then you just put bandhan to his heart

82
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,680
and you see

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,480
they'll be changing they'll be changing

84
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,480
very fast

85
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,760
and that's why you say change of heart

86
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,080
everywhere you find

87
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,920
in every scripture it is written change

88
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,959
of heart is needed not the change of

89
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,560
clothes

90
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,280
so it's not intellectual but a rational

91
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,360
change

92
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,720
but it is the change of heart and that

93
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,840
is brought about

94
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,120
by moving

95
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,239
the heart chakra on the right hand side

96
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,159
in the clockwise moment

97
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,040
that is the heart itself in the

98
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,640
clockwise mind if you can do that

99
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:08,159
you can really do marvels and that's how

100
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:12,840
on a collective basis the heart

101
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:16,720
is sort of the innermost innermost

102
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,560
string of the collective

103
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,759
one string that is passing through

104
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,759
alliance so

105
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,960
if you put strike at the innermost

106
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,520
because in

107
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,800
a three and a half circle that's the

108
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,160
innermost point

109
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,320
if you touch there it passes over this

110
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,680
supposing you touch somewhere else then

111
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,440
it might break

112
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,120
but at the beginning if you start

113
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,840
striking it it goes

114
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,440
very nicely and passes into complete

115
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,759
circumference

116
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,639
now the center one i have told you is

117
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,759
the

118
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,320
heart nexus which we call as cardiac

119
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,280
plexus

120
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,120
and it has got tens of plexuses and the

121
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,800
english names for that i will

122
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,160
again i'm going to give you the complete

123
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,120
list i don't know when will i have time

124
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,120
to go to the

125
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,560
medical journal but i'll find out all of

126
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,199
them and i'm going to tell you what they

127
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,400
call it

128
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,639
in the medical terminology but they know

129
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,639
that very there are tens of plexuses

130
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,360
which are supplying to the muscles of

131
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,600
the heart

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,800
to the lungs iron to the right side

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,120
lungs and

134
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,320
that's how we divide it but they do not

135
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,720
know that it is already

136
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,520
three parts and then there are 10 petals

137
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,360
which are working

138
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,639
down i'm sorry 12 30 saturn what moved

139
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:33,759
up so 3 divided into 12 is

140
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:36,639
4 each side but actually it is not true

141
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,639
it is uh

142
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,360
the ten petals are together in the

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,199
center

144
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,960
and the center one is known as the

145
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,639
sacred heart in the bible it is called

146
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:56,639
as sakura

147
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,639
and this the sacredness of that heart

148
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:03,600
in the abstract form is the

149
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,000
motherly love of god

150
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,120
that's why the the mother of the

151
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,479
universe decides

152
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:14,400
that and these those

153
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,360
12 petals act according to the mother of

154
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,280
the heart

155
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,560
and that's why we cannot allow them to

156
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,000
this side or that side

157
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,039
because it is he who actually makes them

158
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,240
pulsate

159
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,600
so here she becomes the dominant person

160
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,400
and not the heart they are the

161
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,440
spirituals so spirit has

162
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,520
rules by itself and it is ruled

163
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,720
with the help of the

164
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:44,080
reflection of god almighty himself

165
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,199
it is on its own it is arbit it sees

166
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,960
it watches it is the witness it watches

167
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,319
the play of these ten pet

168
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,440
twelve petals here but if it finds that

169
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,800
there's too much of stain on the

170
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,120
center one it just

171
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,880
switches off and when it's switched off

172
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,599
the whole thing

173
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,639
you see so you must understand the

174
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,759
difference between

175
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:13,199
the other other chakras and this one

176
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,400
is that there is a

177
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,840
pivot and the on the other side

178
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,039
third is a human

179
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,599
perfect personality

180
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,800
three things together now if you reduce

181
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,000
into our three powers

182
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,759
you'll understand on one side is

183
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,720
the instrument or you can say the

184
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,720
nucleus for the left hand side working

185
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,120
in the center it is or you can say left

186
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,720
hand side working you can say the

187
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,120
mahakali is working

188
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,720
in the center you can say it is for the

189
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,680
mahalakshmi working

190
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:57,520
and the nucleus for the working of the

191
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,360
right hand side is in the heart

192
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,120
on the right hand side where rama

193
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,080
recites because we can call it a

194
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,039
nucleophilicist he was active

195
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,759
he was active without feeling without

196
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,800
feeling

197
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:15,599
they witnessed it now they combine here

198
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,039
where krishna came and he felt the

199
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,520
witness state

200
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,479
and he called it as diya is the whole

201
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,039
prayer brahma never called it as plain

202
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,080
but he called it as play so that's why

203
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,160
krishna here

204
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:33,919
is completed and that's why we call him

205
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,919
he's a complete incarnation

206
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,599
but now this coming back to the heart

207
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,959
again on the right hand side we have got

208
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:46,240
rama's place now rama was known for

209
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,800
his obedience to his father if you know

210
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,160
his story

211
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,240
his father was in

212
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,440
ahirtha he was there and he had three

213
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,279
wives

214
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,320
the third wife had no

215
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,440
i mean he she had two sons but she could

216
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,880
not

217
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,880
see rama getting the throne

218
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,880
she was a very nice mother but somebody

219
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,720
you see some lady went and told

220
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,320
something to her and she listened to her

221
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,519
and she told

222
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,640
her husband that if you want

223
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,680
to give me my boon the promised boom you

224
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,800
have to

225
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,279
make rama go into the jungle for 14

226
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,399
years

227
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,399
and give the throne to my son birth

228
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:39,519
and when the heard this he

229
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,720
he fainted he fainted with this request

230
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,360
but rama was there

231
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,720
he heard it and he immediately told her

232
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,800
that i'm going to

233
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,320
the forest and i've accepted it and your

234
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,839
point your son

235
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,519
has the bharat for me it's all right and

236
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,240
that's how he went you see

237
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,600
just to obey the order of his father

238
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,000
because father had not even

239
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,360
ordered but because he was compelled he

240
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,240
had given his wife

241
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,519
two goons that once you see an award she

242
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,519
saved his life so she

243
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,040
he said that whenever you want you can

244
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,120
ask for these two goals

245
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,800
and they were she she never knew that

246
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,720
she would use them in such a funny way

247
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,880
later on she repented because bharata

248
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,320
came and he refused to accept the throne

249
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,240
and he put only rama's

250
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,720
slippers there and ruled there and

251
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,600
everything was different but

252
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,440
died in because when rama went away he

253
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,399
just died

254
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,399
so you see

255
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:36,480
rama's life shows how he was obedient

256
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,360
to his parents he suffered so much

257
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,120
anyone who has not been respectful to

258
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,839
his parents

259
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,680
you see if your parents have been

260
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,320
unkind

261
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,839
you have every right to tell them that

262
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,040
they should not be unkind to you

263
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:58,560
and that you feel hurt but

264
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,440
you have no business to answer them back

265
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,760
and you have to be respectful you have

266
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,200
to be respectful because they represent

267
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,440
your primordial parents you are not to

268
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,920
shout at them and misbehave

269
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,680
you have to be really respectful to them

270
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,160
they may be bad people

271
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,279
but you have to respect them because you

272
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,920
have chosen them

273
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,920
when you were born you chose them you

274
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,640
could not have been born to them

275
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,120
you have really chosen them and you said

276
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,000
these are going to be my parents

277
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,000
so if they are your parents they are

278
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,839
there because of certain reasons

279
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,519
because you have been seeking them in

280
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,200
their previous lives and that's how you

281
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,519
are there

282
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,360
you are not to boss over them it's real

283
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,320
i'm telling you the secret

284
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,079
it's not for anything for you see to

285
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,680
make you change your ways or anything

286
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,360
but i'm just telling you the secret

287
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,639
because you have lost the idea of the

288
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,240
secretive methods

289
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,160
of winning over people and understanding

290
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,320
them and managing them and

291
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,320
really you will have your way only thing

292
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,600
is
