1
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:51,470
Today is a sad day because such a great man
like Sadat is dead.

2
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:57,552
He is not great to Me because he was a great
politician or he was president, but he was

3
00:06:57,577 --> 00:07:02,760
a saint, he was a realized soul, I knew all
about him.

4
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:15,801
The attack of the negativity is on but no
more they will crucify a saint this way and

5
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:20,115
will not face the punishment.

6
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:23,600
They will be punished now.

7
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:33,939
All those who tried to do such things will
be punished because the new age has started.

8
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:45,459
Today I wanted to tell you about the Agya
chakra, about Jesus Christ who adorns this

9
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:51,809
center of Agya chakra, where you see the red
mark.

10
00:07:51,809 --> 00:08:03,691
Behind that, inside, in the brain on the crossing
of the optic chiasm is this subtle center

11
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:14,950
where this great Deity is placed through His
crucifixion and through His Resurrection.

12
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:20,724
He has created this space for us to enter
into the Kingdom of God,

13
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:22,104
which is placed within us.

14
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:35,510
Is not in without, is the limbic area that
surrounds your ego and superego.

15
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:42,400
In the Puranas, in the ancient scriptures
of India, Christ is described so very clearly.

16
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:50,829
Actually in the Bible what they saw of Him
when He was on this Earth was written down.

17
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:57,900
But nothing what created Him, how He came
on this Earth what is the spirit of Christ,

18
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:03,320
what is the seat of Christ and how He came
and what is His purpose and where does He

19
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,672
stand within us.

20
00:09:04,697 --> 00:09:11,401
All these things are not described in the
Bible as I told you the people at that time

21
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:20,600
were not at all aware of His greatness, of
His special Incarnation.

22
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:30,550
But if you read some of these ancient books
you’ll find that He was called as Mahavishnu

23
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:37,380
in the Devi Purana, in the Goddess Purana,
is the ancient scripture of the Goddess.

24
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:43,686
Mahavishnu was created immaculately.

25
00:09:44,998 --> 00:09:57,570
Now when we say that Christ always pointed
out this pick is very significant.

26
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:07,090
Actually this, this means Vishuddhi chakra
and means also America.

27
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:13,210
But this also means Vishuddhi chakra stands
for Shri Krishna as I told you and He is the

28
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:23,700
Primordial Being, and He is the epitome of
our evolution in the sense that He is the

29
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:31,510
Primordial Being who is the Father, who is
the preserver.

30
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:38,640
Now in the Puranas He is described that His
power was Radha, Radha.

31
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:46,006
Sanskrit language is absolutely very scientific
as far as the Divine Laws are concerned.

32
00:10:46,053 --> 00:10:49,194
Ra means the energy, dha means the one that
sustains.

33
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:56,969
[SANSKRIT TALK] She is the one who sustains
the energy and She was His power.

34
00:10:56,969 --> 00:11:03,959
But in India Krishna is never taken as Krishna
Radha but Radha Krishna.

35
00:11:03,984 --> 00:11:09,250
The energy is before the deity.

36
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,620
The lady is before the gentleman, we can say.

37
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,979
Radha Krishna.

38
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:23,478
Now this special happening took place long
time back.

39
00:11:24,056 --> 00:11:33,160
This is at the stage of Vaikunta as we call
it, at the stage where nothing existed as

40
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:36,250
far as this world was concerned.

41
00:11:36,687 --> 00:11:39,114
At different stages it came up.

42
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:46,170
We see the world in such a way that it was
created in seven days, but actually these

43
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:52,505
are seven stages in when this whole Universe
was created and we are at the seventh stage,

44
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,764
we can say.

45
00:11:54,077 --> 00:12:00,830
Now at the first Vaikunta stage where it was
all decided, how to work it out the creation

46
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:09,810
of this great personality, of the Son of God,
the greatest of all, the Adhara, the support

47
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,230
of the universe, this Mahavishnu.

48
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:21,070
So Radha, She’s Mahalakshmi, She is the
central path.

49
00:12:23,413 --> 00:12:29,353
First She created Him in the Vaikunta stage.

50
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:42,588
And at that stage She decided that She’ll
create It by Herself this great Incarnation

51
00:12:42,713 --> 00:12:45,900
and She created this Mahavishnu.

52
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:55,020
I would like you to get the translation of
the description of Mahavishnu and also the

53
00:12:55,045 --> 00:13:03,650
description of Ganesha who is the Spirit of
Christ and who incarnated in this, on this

54
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:10,170
earth as our Lord Jesus Christ.

55
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:26,370
So we have here an Incarnation, a very special
one, which was conceived thousands and thousands

56
00:13:26,395 --> 00:13:34,810
of years back at this level where it’s only
the activity of the God’s mind was there,

57
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:45,070
Vaikunta stage, where it was decided that
this power called Radha will conceive Him

58
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,210
in Her heart.

59
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:53,470
And She conceived Him in Her heart.

60
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:58,831
And then He was made like an egg.

61
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:03,210
See the symbolism of Easter, like an egg.

62
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,560
Can you recognize it?

63
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,750
People knew about it somehow.

64
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:12,827
Why do we have Easter, eggs?

65
00:14:12,927 --> 00:14:16,370
We never think about it.

66
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:27,180
He was created like an egg out of which the
half of it was kept as the seed, as Shri Ganesha,

67
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:34,257
as the Spirit, and a half of it was created
as Jesus Christ.

68
00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:45,560
The whole egg was nothing but the egg of this
Divine power, which has to manifest this Divine

69
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,410
power on this Earth.

70
00:14:49,410 --> 00:15:00,149
This story is very beautiful, how She created
and then He asked: “Who is my Father?”

71
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:04,060
Radha is nobody else but Mother Mary Herself.

72
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,670
She is Mahalakshmi.

73
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,669
People may say that they can’t believe in
immaculate birth of Christ.

74
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:13,140
They cannot believe in the conception of Christ.

75
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:18,539
I mean you it’s easy for people to say:”
We don’t believe.”

76
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:21,099
What do they know about God?

77
00:15:21,124 --> 00:15:24,560
What do they know about His mysterious ways
of doing it?

78
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:31,389
Can you say how you convert or you transform
a flower into a fruit?

79
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:41,411
You don’t know anything about living miracles
and you start doubting the Immaculate Conception.

80
00:15:41,598 --> 00:15:47,941
Here, when you got your Realization I conceived
you in My heart and gave you Realization through

81
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:50,620
My Sahasrara.

82
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,730
How did you get your Realization?

83
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,899
You never thought of it.

84
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:56,209
Is an impossibility.

85
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:58,846
Thousands of people are getting Realization.

86
00:15:58,871 --> 00:16:00,162
How is it possible?

87
00:16:00,187 --> 00:16:05,160
There must be something special about Me and
about the way it is done.

88
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:15,545
In the same way She conceived and gave Him
the birth through Her uterus.

89
00:16:15,765 --> 00:16:20,171
You can move it anywhere on your central system.

90
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:35,180
And this great Incarnation came on this Earth
with such a special purpose that He was nothing

91
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:45,389
but Pranava, is the, this integrated power,
this great power which has all the powers

92
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:49,920
in it: the Iccha Shakti, the Prana Shakti
and the Dharma Shakti is the central path,

93
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,829
all of these put together.

94
00:16:54,829 --> 00:17:11,029
He was nothing but energy, energy put into
an egg because He had to do a very great job.

95
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:26,410
So this Radha Herself, this Mahalakshmi, this
Mother Mary conceived this child and to name

96
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:31,360
Him after Krishna who was the Father.

97
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,519
She called Him Christ.

98
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:40,119
Christ come from the word ... In Indian language
is, we call Him Krist, Krishna.

99
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:46,040
Krishna means the one who has sown the seed.

100
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
He is the Father.

101
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,460
He points out always to the Father.

102
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:55,660
But in the Puranas it is described that Krishna
said: “You are higher than Me.

103
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,019
I placed You higher than Me”.

104
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:09,279
He placed Him, you can imagine that Christ
is at this point and Krishna is at this point.

105
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:16,500
He placed higher Him than Him and He said:
“In anywhere people worship Me – Shri

106
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,019
Krishna said – automatically You are worshipped.

107
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:27,259
You will be the support, Adhara, of the whole
world.”

108
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:35,201
Is wonderful to say that about I think 14000
years or 12000 years back, Markandeya, such

109
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:37,969
a great saint was born in India.

110
00:18:37,969 --> 00:18:45,240
And he has written the complete Ganesha Stotram,
means the complete praise of Ganesha.

111
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:52,920
You can see the translation is so beautiful
and that he said: ”You’ll be so humble”.

112
00:18:52,920 --> 00:19:04,209
He is the one who is the ninth Incarnation
called as [BAUTHA] among the ten Incarnations.

113
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:14,509
That He will be so humble that He will wash
the feet of His disciples.

114
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:18,170
All the miracles of Christ are described in
these books.

115
00:19:18,217 --> 00:19:21,309
But these books are not translated.

116
00:19:24,085 --> 00:19:32,834
And that He will be the one, when enlightened
within you with the Kundalini, He will take

117
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:42,743
away all your karmas and all your conditionings
because He will die for your sins,

118
00:19:42,768 --> 00:19:44,510
for your karmas.

119
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:55,879
The world will not have to suffer anymore,
if He is awaken within you.

120
00:19:55,879 --> 00:20:00,680
These are all the things already written,
thousands of years back.

121
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,630
Can you imagine?

122
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:11,474
I wish the Christians who went from here to
take, explain Christianity to Indians told

123
00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:18,529
them that Mahavishnu is already born and we
are preaching about Him, the One who is going

124
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:25,689
to suck your conditioning, the One who is
going to suck all your problems of karmas.

125
00:20:26,484 --> 00:20:28,298
They never told.

126
00:20:28,323 --> 00:20:34,499
On the contrary, they were so stupid, I must
tell you, that they would put a loaf in a

127
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:40,740
well and say that: “You all have become
Christians because we have put the meat of

128
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,216
the beef, the beef inside the well”.

129
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:45,943
Indians don’t eat beef, you see.

130
00:20:45,968 --> 00:20:47,752
“So you all have become Christians”.

131
00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:50,734
Villages after villages they converted into
Christianity.

132
00:20:50,906 --> 00:20:53,579
They started branding them as Christians.

133
00:20:54,293 --> 00:20:56,222
This was absurd.

134
00:20:56,301 --> 00:21:03,706
And that’s why the people were waiting and
waiting for the Advent of Christ.

135
00:21:03,815 --> 00:21:13,339
His name Christ comes from the word Krishna,
Krist, and the second one is Jesus.

136
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:18,897
Krishna had a foster mother whom Radha loved
very much.

137
00:21:19,116 --> 00:21:25,680
Her name was Yeshoda, we also call her as
[Jesoda, Jeshoda].

138
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:29,127
Christ is called also as [Yesu, Yeshu] in
India.

139
00:21:29,152 --> 00:21:35,199
The short form of [Jesoda, Jeshoda] is [Yesu,
Yeshu] or [Jeshu, Jesu] we have both the things.

140
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:38,290
From there the name Jesus has come.

141
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:47,740
She wanted to name Her after the foster mother
because she was a lady so she was called as

142
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:54,829
[Jeshoda, Jesoda] but for a man She selected
the name [Yesu, Yeshu] and [Jeshu, Jesu].

143
00:21:54,829 --> 00:22:03,480
Moreover the word [Jeshu, Jesu] or [Yeshu,
Yesu] is very important.

144
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:10,290
“J” in Sanskrit language means, every
word has a meaning in Sanskrit language, means

145
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:15,800
to know, is to know, the knowledge, Gyana.

146
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,719
[SANSKRIT TALK].

147
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:20,839
The one who knows.

148
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:25,389
But [Jeshu, Jesu] [“shu”, “su”] means
auspicious.

149
00:22:25,389 --> 00:22:31,870
[“Shu”, “Su”] means “that brings
auspiciousness, that brings blessings”.

150
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:38,761
Jeshu is the one who knows how to bring auspiciousness
on this Earth.

151
00:22:40,095 --> 00:22:47,094
People never told this, they never knew who
went from here with the message

152
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:50,903
 that Christ  was born.

153
00:22:52,223 --> 00:23:00,033
At the time when Christ came on this Earth
with this big message that somebody has to

154
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:04,147
pass through this special problem.

155
00:23:04,335 --> 00:23:07,041
Now let’s see why the problem was there.

156
00:23:07,283 --> 00:23:14,439
We have to understand the problem that faced
human beings at that subtle level where they

157
00:23:14,464 --> 00:23:21,440
had to work out this special, a very extraordinary
Incarnation.

158
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:28,679
The problem was that human beings had raised
their heads.

159
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:37,679
By raising their heads their ego and superego
grew up around their limbic area, making it

160
00:23:37,704 --> 00:23:45,008
a very hard shell, just like an egg.

161
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:53,259
A man developed his I-ness and only way to
transform him into a bird, like an egg breaks

162
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:59,469
up into a bird, was to make the Kundalini
rise.

163
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:09,623
But how to make that compact stuff where it
is crossing, crossable, which can be crossed

164
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:14,512
over, which can be passed through.

165
00:24:14,965 --> 00:24:22,410
So they had to create this special Incarnation,
which is nothing but Pranava, the Aum, the

166
00:24:22,435 --> 00:24:28,829
Logos as you call it, the sound of the All
Pervading Power.

167
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:40,500
To be put at a place where nothing but the
power itself can remain, because anybody else,

168
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:49,210
all other Incarnations who came on this Earth
had all the five elements within them.

169
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:55,187
But He was just the power, the energy, the
complete energy.

170
00:24:56,616 --> 00:25:02,328
He didn’t have, for example we all human
beings are made of five elements on the right

171
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:11,825
hand side as I told you, and when we die the
part that is our body, means one of the five

172
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:16,719
koshas, as they call the cocoons of the body
which is the matter, falls off.

173
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:23,080
Then the water cocoon also falls off and the
soul remains with the Spirit on your head

174
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,400
and the Kundalini also there.

175
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:33,490
But He was the only One who had no earth element
in it.

176
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:43,999
And so it was a very special type of an energy
engulfed, engulfed into a human being was

177
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:44,999
placed.

178
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:50,479
Krishna has said about the eternal life and
about the Spirit.

179
00:25:50,504 --> 00:26:01,366
In Sanskrit language is very beautiful because
it’s a mantra: [SANSKRIT].

180
00:26:01,575 --> 00:26:05,660
Means it cannot be killed by anyone, the Spirit
cannot be killed.

181
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,760
It is eternal.

182
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:09,135
You cannot press it.

183
00:26:09,463 --> 00:26:15,130
It cannot be flown out by any wind.

184
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:22,130
And He had to prove it and to prove that they
had to have somebody here, on this Earth,

185
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:29,749
with that energy to come in, with a body,
to act like a human being, live like a human

186
00:26:29,749 --> 00:26:40,140
being and go through that drama of death to
show that He overcomes the death.

187
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:47,620
The Resurrection is our message, that He resurrects
Himself.

188
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:54,601
He had to die and He had to be resurrected
because He says that it is beyond death.

189
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:57,918
Krishna has said that the Spirit is beyond
death.

190
00:26:57,943 --> 00:27:05,599
And the Spirit had to come on this Earth.

191
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:14,989
So you understand when we talk of Christ how
little we know as to how this worked out.

192
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:20,229
Is the most difficult thing that he did.

193
00:27:20,229 --> 00:27:28,032
And His Mother was the Mahalakshmi, is the
power, which is the central power of sustenance,

194
00:27:28,266 --> 00:27:34,153
pure sustenance, pure holiness, pure innocence.

195
00:27:34,411 --> 00:27:40,124
Such a powerful woman She was, very powerful.

196
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:51,057
And Himself is endowed with, you won’t believe,
with eleven powers of Rudra, means of destruction,

197
00:27:51,082 --> 00:27:52,412
eleven powers of Rudra.

198
00:27:52,857 --> 00:27:54,147
He’s Ekadesha Rudra.

199
00:27:54,147 --> 00:27:57,904
Is described, all that is described, I’m
not telling it as My own.

200
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:01,099
You can see for yourself.

201
00:28:01,124 --> 00:28:08,271
He was endowed with eleven powers of destruction.

202
00:28:10,365 --> 00:28:16,254
But He was to go through all this, with all
the humility.

203
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:22,559
When you have all these powers with you and
when egoistical people behave like this, these

204
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:31,889
donkeys, you see, who could not understand
Him, these brainless people in those days,

205
00:28:32,092 --> 00:28:41,558
who could not believe Him, He could have destroyed
all of them in one [SHOT, SHUT].

206
00:28:42,027 --> 00:28:44,996
Absolutely He has got eleven Rudras.

207
00:28:44,996 --> 00:28:51,376
You can imagine His destructive powers, with
which He is going to come back.

208
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:55,667
And He had to keep them in control.

209
00:28:55,667 --> 00:29:04,907
But He didn’t say about His Mother much,
because She was the power and if He had said

210
00:29:04,907 --> 00:29:11,415
so, then they would have directed, these negative
forces would have directed all their attention

211
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:18,356
towards Her and then He would have used all
these eleven powers and the whole drama would

212
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:19,427
have been failed.

213
00:29:19,427 --> 00:29:21,576
So He kept quiet on that.

214
00:29:21,576 --> 00:29:27,267
My father, as I told you, was a learned man
and a very great soul and [WE] used to discuss

215
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:35,497
about these things and I said: “Martin Luther,
who was a Realized soul, when he started his

216
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:47,667
new movement of Protestants, why did he not
enhance the glory of the Mother?”

217
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:54,777
As the Catholics knew, because Catholics just
followed after Christ so it linked about with

218
00:29:54,777 --> 00:29:55,907
them.

219
00:29:55,907 --> 00:30:03,277
My father told Me that at that time Martin
Luther faced three forces against him.

220
00:30:03,277 --> 00:30:10,057
First one was the Christians themselves, the
Catholics, who believed in nunneries and all

221
00:30:10,057 --> 00:30:19,517
kinds of ritualism and all kinds of nonsense,
which he wanted to flout, then he had another

222
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:27,297
force, which was facing and that one was the
one that came from the Jews because they would

223
00:30:27,297 --> 00:30:28,777
not accept Him.

224
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:33,928
Even today they don’t accept Him.

225
00:30:34,444 --> 00:30:36,644
They are very adamant.

226
00:30:36,644 --> 00:30:45,914
And the third force that he had to face was
the Islam, Islamic.

227
00:30:45,914 --> 00:30:53,510
And the Islam pleaded down the role of a woman
though Fatima Herself was the Holy Ghost,

228
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:58,486
is the Mahakali power, the daughter of Mohammad.

229
00:30:59,476 --> 00:31:07,235
But he pleaded down just because the Islam
had pleaded down he thought gradually as Protestants

230
00:31:07,235 --> 00:31:17,485
will grow up, he will start introducing the
greatness of His Mother.

231
00:31:17,485 --> 00:31:27,576
As it is Jews even today are after the Immaculate
Conception.

232
00:31:27,576 --> 00:31:33,285
In London, very recently, I think about two
years back, as they have money they paid some

233
00:31:33,285 --> 00:31:37,176
of the newspapers and published something
nonsensical about Christ.

234
00:31:37,176 --> 00:31:48,456
They said that it was predicted in the Bible
that a child will be born to a girl, but it

235
00:31:48,456 --> 00:31:55,816
was not a virgin, the Hebrew word, as it is,
is for the girl and not a virgin.

236
00:31:55,816 --> 00:32:04,516
I said: “In those days, we didn’t have
girls of 18 years as we have today”.

237
00:32:04,516 --> 00:32:09,856
Even in India today if you say a girl, a [KANYA,]
means a virgin, [KANYA] and virgin is the

238
00:32:09,856 --> 00:32:14,446
same, means the Virgo.

239
00:32:14,446 --> 00:32:15,605
Modern times are funny.

240
00:32:15,605 --> 00:32:18,516
We can’t judge Christ style according to
modern times.

241
00:32:18,516 --> 00:32:25,456
Even you find a woman who is married ten times
they’ll call her a girl here.

242
00:32:25,456 --> 00:32:28,726
But one should logically understand this point.

243
00:32:28,726 --> 00:32:30,576
Is very logical.

244
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:38,586
But if it was to be said that a prophecy means
something special, that a child would be born

245
00:32:38,586 --> 00:32:44,135
to a girl, of course it is going to be born
to a girl and not to a boy.

246
00:32:44,135 --> 00:32:47,696
And why was the girl word?

247
00:32:47,696 --> 00:32:48,905
It is going to be born to a boy.

248
00:32:48,905 --> 00:32:51,615
If it is to a woman it is nothing special.

249
00:32:51,615 --> 00:32:53,836
What is there to prophesize and say about
it?

250
00:32:53,836 --> 00:33:04,855
Is so logical that when the word girl came
in it meant the virgin.

251
00:33:04,855 --> 00:33:07,365
All kind of things they are talking, doesn’t
matter.

252
00:33:07,365 --> 00:33:12,486
First of all they say that our, we have to
suffer till our Savior comes because Christ

253
00:33:12,486 --> 00:33:15,496
didn’t suffer for them.

254
00:33:15,496 --> 00:33:20,096
So they are suffering.

255
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:30,226
Now, we have to know that Christ has suffered
for us absolutely to the brim.

256
00:33:31,395 --> 00:33:34,510
We don’t have to suffer anymore.

257
00:33:34,535 --> 00:33:47,245
Is a nonsensical idea coming from people who
are sadistic, who have no joy in themselves.

258
00:33:47,245 --> 00:33:49,226
They cannot see you happy.

259
00:33:51,730 --> 00:34:01,035
And that’s why also they make Christ look
like a TB patient, I should say.

260
00:34:01,035 --> 00:34:11,066
I went to the Sistine Chapel and Michelangelo
was a realized soul, a great person.

261
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:15,905
He has done complete justice to the image
of Christ.

262
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:27,157
Huge big thing like a, we can say, a Texas
fellow standing with a lambodara, with a big

263
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:28,766
stomach of this kind.

264
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:30,888
Ganesha is lambodara.

265
00:34:30,913 --> 00:34:35,525
Standing there throwing people right and left.

266
00:34:35,525 --> 00:34:39,695
Just see the words, how He has spoken.

267
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:48,145
He was not a cabbage like person, He was extremely
dynamic, He was full of vigor,

268
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,614
He was absolutely fearless.

269
00:34:50,794 --> 00:34:52,826
He had nothing to fear.

270
00:34:53,916 --> 00:35:00,196
And He’s standing there and throwing people
to the left and the right and the right ones

271
00:35:00,196 --> 00:35:04,816
is accepting them and putting them in the
Kingdom of Heaven.

272
00:35:04,816 --> 00:35:06,253
Just imagine!

273
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:10,625
It is Michelangelo is the only person who
has really done justice to Him and I would

274
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:15,163
say Rubens because of his habits of painting
the muscles, he’s done a very beautiful

275
00:35:15,188 --> 00:35:21,781
painting, I saw, is in the place where he
lives, of the ascent and descent of Christ.

276
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:25,816
Beautiful, one of the best one could think.

277
00:35:26,312 --> 00:35:29,722
Nowhere miseries written on His face.

278
00:35:29,747 --> 00:35:31,905
Such people do not feel the misery.

279
00:35:31,905 --> 00:35:35,885
They just watch the drama.

280
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:48,635
They don’t suffer because of taking up your
sufferings it took it upon Himself and He

281
00:35:48,635 --> 00:35:59,725
showed to the world that: “Now I ask forgiveness
from My Father”.

282
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:06,823
He stood as a representative of all the seekers
of the world before His Father

283
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:08,807
 who is a wrathful Father.

284
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:17,229
I told you Shri Krishna has a Samara Shakti
and worse than that is the witness God whom

285
00:36:17,254 --> 00:36:19,019
we call as Sadashiva.

286
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:22,624
He is only there when He has to destroy.

287
00:36:22,827 --> 00:36:31,452
And He asks as your representative: “O Father,
please, forgive them”.

288
00:36:31,477 --> 00:36:40,820
He asks for forgiveness, facing His own Father
as your representative that:

289
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:43,187
 “Please, forgive them”.

290
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:49,614
This is the greatest weapon He has given us,
to forgive.

291
00:36:52,887 --> 00:36:59,985
That’s one thing none of the Christian nations
are doing, is to forgive.

292
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:04,105
Perhaps people have not known the power of
love.

293
00:37:04,105 --> 00:37:05,105
They do not.

294
00:37:05,105 --> 00:37:06,105
They talk.

295
00:37:06,105 --> 00:37:07,105
God is love.

296
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:08,885
Just talk, talk, talk, talk.

297
00:37:08,885 --> 00:37:14,816
If God is love then love must be the most
powerful thing.

298
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:26,096
When I first started My work I flouted all
these fake gurus by names in India and I told

299
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:30,176
them what devils they had been and I‘ve
known them for ages.

300
00:37:30,176 --> 00:37:32,502
And people told Me that: “They will shoot
You this time”.

301
00:37:32,527 --> 00:37:34,083
I said: “Let them start shooting.

302
00:37:34,108 --> 00:37:39,606
I’ll se who can shoot Me.” [AND ALL THOSE
I HAVE] flouted them anywhere I get the chance.

303
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:42,745
I’ve told that: “These are horrible people“.

304
00:37:42,745 --> 00:37:46,673
As Christ has said: “Hot or cold.”

305
00:37:47,212 --> 00:37:51,956
He doesn’t mind, because if it is cold they
are realized, if they are hot then we’ll

306
00:37:51,956 --> 00:37:52,956
fight them.

307
00:37:52,956 --> 00:37:55,176
We can tell them how.

308
00:37:55,176 --> 00:37:59,556
But if they are one lukewarm, you see, there
are people: “O, we are in different awareness,

309
00:37:59,556 --> 00:38:04,535
they are in different awareness, we must accept
this awareness also, we must accept...”

310
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:09,845
Such people are the ones He said: “I’ll
spout them out of My mouth”.

311
00:38:09,845 --> 00:38:10,895
So clearly.

312
00:38:10,895 --> 00:38:15,966
He’s the One who whipped people who were
selling things in the temple.

313
00:38:15,966 --> 00:38:21,270
He is the One who said: “Don’t throw pearls
before the swine.”

314
00:38:22,012 --> 00:38:26,216
So far I’ve never used this word but He
has.

315
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:30,246
He was dynamic.

316
00:38:30,246 --> 00:38:32,235
He was not afraid of anyone.

317
00:38:32,235 --> 00:38:38,275
And He couldn’t bear the mediocrity and
this kind of balance: “Oh, we have them

318
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:41,655
also, we can have the devils and also the
Gods”.

319
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,936
People argue: “Why do You criticize them?

320
00:38:43,936 --> 00:38:45,666
They don’t criticize You”.

321
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:52,655
He said: “The devil, the Satan is not going
to speak against his own house”.

322
00:38:53,303 --> 00:38:55,945
This is exactly what is happening today.

323
00:38:56,124 --> 00:39:02,109
I’ve seen when I say that: “This man is
a devil”, people say: “Mother, why do

324
00:39:02,134 --> 00:39:03,241
you call him a devil?”

325
00:39:03,266 --> 00:39:04,781
“Because he’s a devil, I have to call
him a devil.

326
00:39:04,806 --> 00:39:06,206
I’m your Mother.”

327
00:39:07,376 --> 00:39:14,035
When I see a person suffering, he cannot get
his Realization because he went to this devil,

328
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:16,166
I have to say he’s a devil whether you like
it or not.

329
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:22,841
If you are a true seeker you stand up to that
and see for yourself you are a true seeker.

330
00:39:22,866 --> 00:39:28,666
And if you are a true seeker you must find
your Spirit and you must get to your Realization.

331
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:32,126
I’m not here for any elections or pampering.

332
00:39:32,126 --> 00:39:40,245
I’m here to give you your own, to have your
own Spirit, to enjoy your being.

333
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:46,535
Even if the whole world gets against Me, I’m
not bothered about it.

334
00:39:46,535 --> 00:39:54,785
I’m here of course to look after you, to
tell you in a proper way.

335
00:39:54,785 --> 00:40:03,466
But if it comes to the devils I will be the
One who will stand against them, every minute.

336
00:40:03,466 --> 00:40:08,475
Whatever may they come in, whatever guard,
it’s very easy to make them out once you

337
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,013
get your Realization.

338
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,930
It’s very easy to find out.

339
00:40:11,955 --> 00:40:14,056
He Himself has said it all these things.

340
00:40:14,056 --> 00:40:16,515
He said: “Don’t judge anyone”.

341
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:19,677
Before Realization you can’t judge anyone,
from the appearances.

342
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:25,086
They look very sweet, you know, or they talk
very sweetly.

343
00:40:25,111 --> 00:40:32,800
They come to you in a band, you see, and they
walk with such beautiful gait.

344
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:38,787
They are great dramatist, some of them play
tricks, jump like Krishna.

345
00:40:38,826 --> 00:40:42,286
Some say: “We are Incarnation of Christ.”

346
00:40:42,794 --> 00:40:48,676
There was a gentleman who said: “I’m the
Incarnation of Krishna”.

347
00:40:48,676 --> 00:40:54,546
I told him: “Why do you make the ladies
nude and naked?

348
00:40:54,546 --> 00:40:59,476
What religion has taught you this, to make
the ladies nude and naked, take out their

349
00:40:59,476 --> 00:41:02,036
clothes and make them dance?

350
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:03,036
What is this?”

351
00:41:03,036 --> 00:41:04,606
“O, he said, I’m Shri Krishna!”

352
00:41:04,606 --> 00:41:05,666
I said: “Really?

353
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:08,135
I never knew Shri Krishna did that.”

354
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:09,895
He said: “No, He did.”

355
00:41:09,896 --> 00:41:15,820
Once Krishna was a small child of four years,
you can imagine, a naughty little thing.

356
00:41:15,845 --> 00:41:18,686
What did He understand of nudity or that?

357
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:19,686
Innocent.

358
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:26,156
And the gopis, you see, were having their
bath in the river Yamuna where Radha was putting

359
00:41:26,181 --> 00:41:28,586
Her feet, so the water was all vibrated.

360
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:38,038
And He climbed up onto a tree and they had
put their clothes on a tree and He hid them.

361
00:41:38,406 --> 00:41:41,236
So they were asking for His clothes: “Now
what are you doing?

362
00:41:41,236 --> 00:41:42,426
Why have you hidden?”

363
00:41:42,426 --> 00:41:43,426
It’s a mischief.

364
00:41:43,426 --> 00:41:45,216
It’s the fun.

365
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:48,066
But in that fun what He was doing?

366
00:41:48,066 --> 00:41:52,806
Was to give them Realization because He could
see their Kundalini at the back.

367
00:41:52,806 --> 00:41:54,186
[AS, AND] a child of four years...

368
00:41:54,186 --> 00:41:58,109
What does a child of four years know about
nudity, or dress or anything?

369
00:41:58,134 --> 00:41:59,134
Innocent.

370
00:41:59,857 --> 00:42:03,986
Modern children may be very precautious, but
not in those days.

371
00:42:03,986 --> 00:42:08,406
But when He was the king in Dwarika – I
asked this nonsensical fellow who says he

372
00:42:08,406 --> 00:42:15,736
is the Bhagavanan, and the Shri Krishna – I
said when He was a grown up man and a king

373
00:42:15,736 --> 00:42:23,236
in Dwarika, which is at least two thousand
miles away from Hastinapur Delhi, and a lady

374
00:42:23,236 --> 00:42:30,226
called Draupadi, who called Him as a brother,
was troubled because she was pound and all

375
00:42:30,226 --> 00:42:36,776
that, a big story of Mahabharata, you might
be knowing Draupadi, and a devil of a man

376
00:42:36,776 --> 00:42:42,076
called Dhuriodhana said that: ” I’ll make
you nude”, tried to pull Her sari.

377
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:46,816
It’s a beautiful description of the whole
thing.

378
00:42:46,816 --> 00:42:55,216
He, He was worried that she will lose her
chastity by removing her..., this is called

379
00:42:55,216 --> 00:42:56,746
as [SANSKRIT WORD].

380
00:42:56,746 --> 00:43:04,038
So she put it in her mouth like this and she
was to call Krishna.

381
00:43:04,038 --> 00:43:09,026
She says: “Kri”, and she was holding because
Krishna means “falls down”.

382
00:43:09,026 --> 00:43:15,876
And as soon as she found that the sari is
going, she said: ”shna”, and the description

383
00:43:15,876 --> 00:43:20,804
is so great: “[SANSKRIT TALK]”.

384
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:26,189
When she did that “shna” it echoed in
Dwarika where He was ruling.

385
00:43:26,214 --> 00:43:27,504
He was the king there.

386
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:36,313
And with shanka, chakra, gada, padma, these
are four weapons, one better that the other.

387
00:43:36,338 --> 00:43:44,962
One is sufficient, the chakra, I told you,
all up on to on the Garuda, on the condor

388
00:43:44,987 --> 00:43:48,957
He arrived there to save the chastity of His
sister.

389
00:43:49,584 --> 00:43:55,358
If He was fond of removing the clothes of
women, why did He all the way

390
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:56,751
come and save that?

391
00:43:56,803 --> 00:44:00,163
And this fellow didn’t know how to answer
Me.

392
00:44:00,677 --> 00:44:03,554
I told him: “One day your clothes will be
taken out like this”.

393
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:05,523
Within eight days it happened.

394
00:44:05,523 --> 00:44:09,253
Somebody took out all his clothes and he was
dancing on the street and nowadays he’s

395
00:44:09,253 --> 00:44:13,773
backing America with a paralysis.

396
00:44:16,074 --> 00:44:18,443
He couldn’t smell flowers.

397
00:44:18,443 --> 00:44:20,433
One better that the other.

398
00:44:20,433 --> 00:44:23,833
But his disciples, if you tell them: “O,
don’t say, Mother.

399
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:25,233
We love him.”

400
00:44:25,233 --> 00:44:31,423
This kind of a funny mesmerism it’s stupidity.

401
00:44:31,423 --> 00:44:33,813
Awake yourself!

402
00:44:33,813 --> 00:44:39,593
This kind of emotional nonsensical attachment
to one person is not going to give you Realization.

403
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:42,481
You have to become your Spirit.

404
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:49,878
You have to be actually reborn.

405
00:44:52,403 --> 00:44:55,708
There is no place for devilish people.

406
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,433
If they are from hell they will go back to
that, but many of their disciples are also

407
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:03,051
walking through.

408
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,740
[WHILE, WHY] they are My children, I would
say?

409
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:17,553
They are the children of God, they are the
men of God, as described as William Blake.

410
00:45:17,553 --> 00:45:23,951
They have been born on this earth for seeking
because they know this is the time they are

411
00:45:23,976 --> 00:45:28,223
going to achieve their Realization and these
horrible people have mesmerized them.

412
00:45:28,223 --> 00:45:35,523
At this time should I go and garland them
and say: “You are very nice people”?

413
00:45:35,523 --> 00:45:40,533
If you expect Me to do that, then you have
not understood Me at all.

414
00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:44,554
No use telling Me: “O, their awareness is
different.”

415
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:50,183
I see that your Kundalini is ruined, you are
up to get a blood cancer or some sort of a

416
00:45:50,183 --> 00:45:54,923
cancer or you are going to get into the lunatic
asylum.

417
00:45:54,923 --> 00:45:59,670
Something horrible is going to happen to you
and when I see that am I to say “Yes”

418
00:45:59,741 --> 00:46:02,233
the one who has done, go and fall at his feet?

419
00:46:02,233 --> 00:46:06,663
But if there’s a real guru I would go and
meet him Myself.

420
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:11,613
There are many, but they are hiding.

421
00:46:11,613 --> 00:46:16,993
I sent one fellow to New York, he ran away
within two days, within two days.

422
00:46:16,993 --> 00:46:20,353
He said: “O, these New York people are different”.

423
00:46:21,899 --> 00:46:24,519
He said: “I have to take a circus with me.

424
00:46:26,177 --> 00:46:29,119
They like a circus.”

425
00:46:31,573 --> 00:46:34,373
But Houston people are different.

426
00:46:35,987 --> 00:46:45,354
Now, so this was the great Incarnation of
Christ who came on this Earth, a very dynamic.

427
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:51,643
Those who say that: “I’m the Christ”,
there’s many, you see, self certified people:

428
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:53,173
“I’m the Christ”.

429
00:46:53,173 --> 00:47:02,157
Now the kind of a Christ they do, He was never
like that, He was a healthy man and He was

430
00:47:02,182 --> 00:47:08,289
not one of these people who’s these cheeks
have gone inside, who looks like a miserable,

431
00:47:08,314 --> 00:47:12,275
hungry, pitiable man.

432
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,074
Anyone of this would say´s that:" I´m the Christ"

433
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:17,098
Ask them to walk on the water

434
00:47:17,419 --> 00:47:21,216
Immediately on foot up and one foot down

435
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:27,537
Ask them to walk on the water, if
they can walk, is alright.

436
00:47:27,561 --> 00:47:30,551
Supposing I said I'm the Holy ghost

437
00:47:30,977 --> 00:47:32,977
If I say so

438
00:47:33,526 --> 00:47:35,603
then is a significance of that

439
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:38,527
That in the presence of Holy Ghost, 
the Kundalini rises.

440
00:47:38,824 --> 00:47:40,369
Is written down.

441
00:47:40,394 --> 00:47:45,924
There are thousand things written and every
word has to be tallied with that person otherwise

442
00:47:45,949 --> 00:47:47,319
you just don’t believe.

443
00:47:47,758 --> 00:47:54,762
Let them go and walk on the water, is not
far away from you, seventeen miles only, and

444
00:47:54,787 --> 00:47:56,689
see how far they go.

445
00:47:58,252 --> 00:48:00,734
Is the best way to judge these people.

446
00:48:00,759 --> 00:48:04,119
We have got a method to judge these people.

447
00:48:04,346 --> 00:48:10,249
Thank God, we are born in modern times when
we are not [ILLITERATE], we have had Christ,

448
00:48:10,351 --> 00:48:16,312
we have had so many people, we can read and
we can understand, we should logically reach

449
00:48:16,312 --> 00:48:22,322
the position to understand what do we have
to expect from a Realized Soul.

450
00:48:22,322 --> 00:48:28,622
If he talks like a politician who wants to
have votes, how can you believe that such

451
00:48:28,622 --> 00:48:32,782
a person could be an Incarnation?

452
00:48:32,782 --> 00:48:39,552
An Incarnation has not only to be a fearless
person, but has to be a holy person.

453
00:48:39,552 --> 00:48:42,842
Not the one who is like a parasite living
on other people.

454
00:48:42,842 --> 00:48:45,332
Like these lamas [ARE].

455
00:48:45,332 --> 00:48:56,942
They live like parasites in Nepal and also
in Lhasa [UNCLEAR] were suffering.

456
00:48:57,083 --> 00:49:04,362
They had no food but these lamas were living
and taking their special Ambrose, they call

457
00:49:04,362 --> 00:49:07,072
it, in golden cups.

458
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:11,281
Today they are driven out so they are on our
head in India.

459
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:15,822
We have to support these nonsensical people
sitting down there as lamas, these parasites

460
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:17,452
of the worst type.

461
00:49:17,452 --> 00:49:23,252
And those who could not get a place there
are now moving about and now they want to

462
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:27,356
live on a marble flooring.

463
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,981
They can’t live on a carpet flooring.

464
00:49:29,981 --> 00:49:32,948
They must have a marble flooring.

465
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:41,095
And people have to starve themselves to create
a marble flooring for these horrible parasites.

466
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,701
Why should a saint ask for anything?

467
00:49:44,701 --> 00:49:46,811
A saint is a king.

468
00:49:46,811 --> 00:49:50,131
He’s above all these comforts of life.

469
00:49:50,131 --> 00:49:51,731
He’s not bothered.

470
00:49:51,731 --> 00:49:58,031
I mean, if you ask, I can sleep on the street,
I’ve no problem, no problem, because I’m

471
00:49:58,031 --> 00:49:59,988
above the want, I’m above greed.

472
00:50:00,013 --> 00:50:04,423
I don’t know what sort of a thing is temptation.

473
00:50:04,448 --> 00:50:16,841
If they call themselves as Godly people, look
at their faces, worn out, biscuity, serious,

474
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:17,841
nonsensical people.

475
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:20,402
They have no sense of humor of any kind.

476
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:27,171
Not only but I’ve seen some disciple who
came to Me, all their bone was broken, all

477
00:50:27,171 --> 00:50:30,794
their back bone was broken, every bone was
broken by these people.

478
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:33,981
They use to beat them [THESE SADISTS].

479
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:39,978
They take money from you and finish your Kundalini.

480
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:44,808
Their days have come now.

481
00:50:44,866 --> 00:50:49,324
Because they talk well don’t believe them.

482
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:51,172
What have they given you?

483
00:50:51,584 --> 00:50:54,372
Somebody says: “They have given us the knowledge”.

484
00:50:54,397 --> 00:50:56,090
All right, what knowledge?

485
00:50:56,115 --> 00:50:58,173
What knowledge have they given you?

486
00:50:58,782 --> 00:51:01,236
Knowledge, is all mental.

487
00:51:01,261 --> 00:51:07,671
What have you got it in your awareness, where
you have to evolve, when you rise.

488
00:51:07,671 --> 00:51:16,050
Christ has described it so clearly, I did
not say what a Realized soul should be.

489
00:51:16,082 --> 00:51:24,268
You become a witness, you become a witness
of the whole drama, of the whole show.

490
00:51:24,293 --> 00:51:26,557
And this should happen to you.

491
00:51:26,582 --> 00:51:31,202
Not only, but you are empowered with the powers
of your Spirit.

492
00:51:31,896 --> 00:51:34,717
At least your health should be all right.

493
00:51:34,742 --> 00:51:41,781
People are suffering from stresses and strain,
having a headache all the time, jumping on

494
00:51:41,781 --> 00:51:44,682
their sits and they say: “We get very positive
results”.

495
00:51:44,707 --> 00:51:47,801
What are positive results?

496
00:51:47,801 --> 00:51:54,905
These make believes if you carry on with them
you will have no way of judging

497
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:57,211
as to where you are.

498
00:51:57,211 --> 00:52:00,476
First of all get your Realization.

499
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:07,752
Get to your discretion power and realize that
it is you can judge them after Realization,

500
00:52:07,777 --> 00:52:09,210
not before.

501
00:52:10,061 --> 00:52:11,771
Christ has said “right discretion”.

502
00:52:11,771 --> 00:52:15,857
He has used the word: “right discretion”.

503
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:21,517
How do you get “right discretion” unless
and until you are realized?

504
00:52:22,501 --> 00:52:27,341
And this is not to be self-certified.

505
00:52:27,341 --> 00:52:30,951
As Christ has said: “You’ll be calling
Me Christ, Christ.

506
00:52:30,951 --> 00:52:32,651
I will not recognize you”.

507
00:52:33,229 --> 00:52:34,720
Meaning what?

508
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:40,801
Those who say: “We are Christians”, you
see, going about with the label: “We are

509
00:52:40,801 --> 00:52:46,917
Christians, we go to church, sing our hymns
and come back home and quarrel,

510
00:52:46,942 --> 00:52:49,034
going to wars, fight.

511
00:52:49,911 --> 00:52:54,831
We are the people who drink on a Christmas
day.

512
00:52:54,831 --> 00:53:00,111
On a Christmas day, we drink!”

513
00:53:00,111 --> 00:53:05,574
Now, when Christ said that, they said at the
time of Christ, He went to a wedding and

514
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,999
 He blessed the wine.

515
00:53:07,186 --> 00:53:08,387
Is not true.

516
00:53:08,412 --> 00:53:15,471
That wine, at that time never meant, even
in India today, wine never means an alcohol.

517
00:53:15,496 --> 00:53:21,421
But Moses has talked about it very clearly
and Abraham has talked about it because they

518
00:53:21,421 --> 00:53:27,781
had to deal with this Void which I told you,
the Primordial Masters, they had to deal with

519
00:53:27,781 --> 00:53:34,191
the liver, so they talked about it, they called
it the “strong drink” and “fermented

520
00:53:34,191 --> 00:53:36,934
drink”, so clearly.

521
00:53:36,959 --> 00:53:41,512
But everything happens if somebody dies, you
must have champagne to celebrate his death

522
00:53:41,537 --> 00:53:42,512
perhaps.

523
00:53:42,537 --> 00:53:45,539
If Christ is born we must have champagne.

524
00:53:45,564 --> 00:53:54,005
If Christ is born that is the day we should
dedicate ourselves to our Spirit, not to get

525
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,661
out of your awareness.

526
00:53:56,202 --> 00:54:01,650
Anyone of these fermented things take you
away from your attention.

527
00:54:01,675 --> 00:54:05,840
Your attention is in a way empathized.

528
00:54:05,865 --> 00:54:09,685
I don’t say: “You don’t drink!” at
this stage but after Realization

529
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:10,771
 you will not.

530
00:54:11,155 --> 00:54:14,271
You will not, even if you want to.

531
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:21,030
You will not drink, because you get drunk.

532
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:26,651
Like Me, if I go to a party, you see, they
will always say: “Please, have something.

533
00:54:26,651 --> 00:54:27,721
O, You must have, please.

534
00:54:27,721 --> 00:54:28,961
You have not tested this.

535
00:54:28,961 --> 00:54:30,191
You better have”.

536
00:54:30,191 --> 00:54:32,451
I said: “No, sir, I’m sorry, I’m over
drunk already.

537
00:54:32,451 --> 00:54:35,471
If I drink more, I don’t know what will
happen to Me”.

538
00:54:35,471 --> 00:54:38,261
I mean you can’t tell them: “You don’t
drink”.

539
00:54:38,261 --> 00:54:43,441
You see, that would be absolutely [UNLIARLY]
to tell them: “Please, don’t drink today”.

540
00:54:43,441 --> 00:54:47,541
But they’ll go on forcing you and if you
say anything against it then absolutely you

541
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:50,621
are no eliteness about you.

542
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:54,711
You are absolutely unsophisticated.

543
00:54:54,711 --> 00:54:58,971
This is the thing in this world.

544
00:54:58,971 --> 00:55:00,570
Virtue has no meaning.

545
00:55:00,595 --> 00:55:03,628
If you are virtuous, you better hide yourself.

546
00:55:03,653 --> 00:55:05,245
Not in Sahaja Yoga.

547
00:55:05,341 --> 00:55:08,417
You enjoy your virtues in Sahaja Yoga.

548
00:55:08,495 --> 00:55:11,666
You really enjoy yours and others virtues.

549
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:16,776
Is a very different thing as in the unity
church you call it, a New Age is coming, is

550
00:55:16,825 --> 00:55:18,394
absolutely true.

551
00:55:18,996 --> 00:55:30,741
I find, as I told you the principles of this
church are very, very close to that which

552
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:33,901
is the stage on to which you have to jump.

553
00:55:33,926 --> 00:55:44,537
And that’s why the right conclusion that
is reached is absolutely the way to understand

554
00:55:44,568 --> 00:55:47,332
where you have to reach logically.

555
00:55:49,254 --> 00:55:56,734
But you must know, you have to take a stand.

556
00:55:56,759 --> 00:56:04,901
You cannot be a person who’s apologetic.

557
00:56:04,926 --> 00:56:08,622
There is no place for apologies.

558
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:11,603
If you are a realized soul, you are a realized
soul.

559
00:56:11,628 --> 00:56:14,761
You are not dominating it by that to anyone.

560
00:56:14,761 --> 00:56:16,841
You are not dominating.

561
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:25,006
By that you accept your situation with glory
and with pride.

562
00:56:26,748 --> 00:56:33,198
But I’ve seen many Sahaja Yogis also feel
shy to accept that they are realized.

563
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,206
They understand what’s happening.

564
00:56:35,231 --> 00:56:40,645
They are giggling, they are laughing at the
way people are, but they find it impossible

565
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:47,231
to talk to them about their Realization, that
other should get their Realization.

566
00:56:47,231 --> 00:56:54,351
You have to take a stand in your family, in
your surroundings, with your friends and you

567
00:56:54,376 --> 00:56:58,903
have to tell them that: “You better all
get realized”.

568
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:07,631
The reason for that is that the Christ who
crucified Himself, He is going to come back,

569
00:57:07,631 --> 00:57:13,528
with his eleven forces of destruction.

570
00:57:13,614 --> 00:57:21,081
And then He’s not going to tell you anything,
not going to ask you to take any Realization,

571
00:57:21,081 --> 00:57:26,161
nor He is bothered whether you go to hell.

572
00:57:26,161 --> 00:57:30,664
He will just sort out.

573
00:57:30,773 --> 00:57:38,299
But those who have got Realization will enter
into the Kingdom of God.

574
00:57:38,324 --> 00:57:41,481
You have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

575
00:57:41,481 --> 00:57:45,198
Here, as I say, is the seventh chakra.

576
00:57:45,223 --> 00:57:54,851
I told you about the sixth chakra, which is
adorned by Jesus Christ and the mantra of

577
00:57:54,876 --> 00:58:00,095
the (seventh chakra), sixth chakra is our
Lord’s Prayer.

578
00:58:00,163 --> 00:58:03,591
That’s the way you can solve both the things.

579
00:58:03,591 --> 00:58:07,142
But the bija mantra is Ham Ksham.

580
00:58:07,167 --> 00:58:09,107
Ham Ksham.

581
00:58:09,842 --> 00:58:21,251
It means that when you are infested with negativity,
with depression, with the attack of the superego,

582
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:27,286
as shown here, then you have to say: “I
am, I’m going to fight you”.

583
00:58:27,311 --> 00:58:34,981
If you go to a guru who makes you a negative
person, who makes you feel very shy, who says:

584
00:58:34,981 --> 00:58:39,655
“You are all the ego and you are good for
nothing, you must pay me more and pay me more”.

585
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,816
And you all the time say that: “Oh, must
be something wrong with me, nothing wrong

586
00:58:43,841 --> 00:58:46,355
with this man”.

587
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:53,597
If there is self-pity and also there is guilt,
then you have to say: “I am not guilty”.

588
00:58:53,722 --> 00:58:59,298
Then you have to say that: “I’m my own
guru”, if you have left side problems.

589
00:58:59,338 --> 00:59:07,521
But if you have right side problems, then
you have to say: “I forgive, Ham Ksham”.

590
00:59:07,521 --> 00:59:15,161
These are the bija mantras of this two, which
you have got, your symbol is of these two

591
00:59:15,161 --> 00:59:17,761
wings, is actually the Agya chakra.

592
00:59:17,761 --> 00:59:20,421
It is just like that.

593
00:59:20,421 --> 00:59:23,611
Agya chakra is just like that.

594
00:59:23,611 --> 00:59:27,441
But they call it the, what Egyptian, what...
no, is not that.

595
00:59:27,441 --> 00:59:34,631
You see, this symbol has come to you from
unconscious, is the Agya chakra, is this center.

596
00:59:34,631 --> 00:59:39,173
Egyptians didn’t know much about God, I
must tell you.

597
00:59:39,198 --> 00:59:43,737
Of course pyramid is, pyramid is, pyramid
is all vibrated.

598
00:59:43,762 --> 00:59:48,541
But the way they were so much worried about
their dead is horrifying.

599
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:56,812
Imagine these bones buried in the one box
of gold, then one box of silver, then one

600
00:59:56,812 --> 01:00:00,051
box of this and all the ornaments kept with
the dead.

601
01:00:00,051 --> 01:00:02,621
The dead is finished into bones, the ornaments
are there.

602
01:00:02,621 --> 01:00:03,725
I’ve seen that in Egypt.

603
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:05,826
Mad people, I must say.

604
01:00:07,748 --> 01:00:11,661
It’s Sadat who would have brought it round.

605
01:00:11,661 --> 01:00:16,261
But lets see something new will happen there,
in that country.

606
01:00:16,261 --> 01:00:22,191
Traditional countries have wisdom, inbuilt
wisdom and they go on improving because they

607
01:00:22,191 --> 01:00:25,211
have tried all these methods and they know
[WHERE TO GO].

608
01:00:25,211 --> 01:00:26,601
He didn’t talk of death.

609
01:00:26,601 --> 01:00:32,091
They know it from the people, pharaohs and
all that who had all these kinds of a funny

610
01:00:32,091 --> 01:00:36,761
mummies going round and keeping the dead in
a silver box and as if the dead knows where

611
01:00:36,786 --> 01:00:38,206
is the silver.

612
01:00:40,526 --> 01:00:44,203
Christ has said many things, which we do not
pay attention to.

613
01:00:44,258 --> 01:00:49,041
[NONE, ONE] of them is about the dead.

614
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:56,018
In every church, I was happy to know that
in this church there is no cemetery.

615
01:00:56,043 --> 01:00:59,358
You walk into a cemetery if you want to go
to a church.

616
01:00:59,383 --> 01:01:04,475
A lady who came from India, she said: “Everything
seems to be upside down in England”.

617
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,500
I said: “What?”

618
01:01:05,525 --> 01:01:07,797
She said: “I went to see a church.

619
01:01:07,867 --> 01:01:11,171
And all the dead were laid there under my
feet.

620
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:13,091
And I was holding my sari walking like this.

621
01:01:13,091 --> 01:01:15,551
I was thinking I was going to step.

622
01:01:15,551 --> 01:01:17,831
And the lady with me said: ‘What, you should
walk straight‘.

623
01:01:17,831 --> 01:01:19,941
She said: ‘How can I, you see?

624
01:01:19,941 --> 01:01:21,141
These are dead here.

625
01:01:21,141 --> 01:01:22,351
It’s like a cemetery.”

626
01:01:22,351 --> 01:01:25,741
And she was walking carefully because they
must be respected.

627
01:01:25,741 --> 01:01:27,931
You take your children to those churches.

628
01:01:27,931 --> 01:01:37,901
I mean I don’t know, you don’t understand
that God has talked about spirits in so clear

629
01:01:37,901 --> 01:01:38,901
ways.

630
01:01:38,901 --> 01:01:44,331
Of course, maybe it’s not so much in the
Bible, maybe, but He showed that He took out

631
01:01:44,331 --> 01:01:50,751
the spirits, He talked of spirits of so many
people, and put them in the pigs and put them

632
01:01:50,751 --> 01:01:51,781
in the sea.

633
01:01:51,781 --> 01:01:58,391
All this is so clearly given, still, just
see the Christian nations.

634
01:01:58,391 --> 01:02:09,117
Today’s newspaper, was there one free newspaper,
witchcraft, devils [TEN], devils angels, this
