00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:02,480
19850705 Shri Trigunatmika

2
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,160
Are, you can open the window a little bit, I think.

3
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,999
It will be better. One window will do.

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,999
They are all closed.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,999
One window you can.

6
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,320
They are opened as much as they will, Shri Mataji.

7
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,920
Really? That's all that can be opened?

8
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,480
They have all arrived, so we'll wait for two minutes for them.

9
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,280
Tell them to come from the other side.

10
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,320
Can somebody go and tell?

11
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,480
When you are taking photographs I'll not have this.

12
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:56,000
Better, then I'll have it later.

13
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,320
You must take the right angle and right time.

14
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,480
I find, some people take exactly the wrong angle and the wrong time.

15
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:38,999
Yes, where you get the vibrations, that’s the point you must click.

16
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,960
That's it.

17
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:54,280
And because you just take it at a wrong time,

18
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,400
photographs do not come out well for some people.

19
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,999
Vibrations will tell you when to take.

20
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,240
I took photographs of some people

21
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,240
and their vibrations stated flowing.

22
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:14,840
It’s all related.

23
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:18,480
Come along, we've been waiting for you!

24
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,160
[unclear] has not come?

25
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,480
That's o.k. Shri Mother. Actually we left her

26
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,480
or otherwise we would have been too late.

27
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:28,840
Oh, God !

28
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:32,480
But she will do a little Puja at home by herself, she said.

29
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:35,240
S.M. - But where is she?
Y - At home.

30
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,440
And I had to go to fetch Warren in Gent and

31
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,320
I learned the Puja was earlier...

32
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,999
Why didn't you take with you? Take her...

33
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:47,280
Poor thing, she'll feel very bad.

34
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,480
We came straight away, to be here faster.

35
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,240
Now the people from Brussels and from Gent

36
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:15,999
and from Holland should come forward.

37
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,480
Can you move this side a little?

38
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,160
So she can sit there.

39
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:14,840
They are so beautiful Shri Mataji in these saris.

40
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:17,280
Looking very beautifully.

41
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,999
This is the sari you had in Venice, Shri Mataji.

42
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,999
I gave them to ware as a present but I am left

43
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,280
with no sari to give them. So i don't know what to do...

44
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,440
Well I have only white saris left,

45
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,999
so I thought I'll send them some nice saris.

46
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:41,400
All right.

47
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,480
You want to take, take photograph now.

48
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,840
You see, the thing is, in between you should not.

49
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:58,480
Just a minute she is taking.

50
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:03,840
You must take the photograph at a particular time, you see?

51
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,999
Now, say supposing I am talking, that time you should not.

52
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,400
Or I am treating somebody, then you should not.

53
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,999
So we are in Holland,

54
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,920
which is the holy land of Europe.

55
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,280
And the holy land of Europe

56
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,840
has got lots of water in it, flowing.

57
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,480
It's at a lower level than the Mother Earth

58
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,999
and the sea flows through it.

59
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,320
So it's a good combination of the sea and the earth here.

60
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:20,480
So sea cleanses

61
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:27,999
and the Mother Earth blesses the people of Holland,

62
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:35,000
But if they have lost their moorings

63
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,840
and they are flying in the wrong direction,

64
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:45,440
then the same holy land can become a hell land.

65
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,999
So we have to be very careful

66
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,480
to see that we create more and more Sahaja Yogis in this place.

67
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:02,400
In My reading of the character of the western people

68
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,320
I find they are extremely aggressive by nature

69
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,999
and very egoistical on the whole.

70
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,240
One should not feel that I am saying about you, but I'm saying.

71
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,000
You are Sahaja yogis, you belong to the Kingdom of God

72
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,999
but I'm telling about in general now.

73
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:25,840
While I'm talking keep your eyes open.

74
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:30,480
I don't know why people close the eyes, this I can't understand.

75
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,200
Now when we are in the holy land,

76
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:45,999
we find that the Mother Earth has allowed the sea to flow in,

77
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:52,200
and is a very good place for Me to say something to you.

78
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:59,320
Here the sea has taken refuge in the Mother.

79
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:06,480
The guru has bound itself with the motherly qualities.

80
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,480
A person feels more safe on the ground

81
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:15,999
than on the sea or in the air.

82
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,480
So today is the best opportunity for Me to say

83
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:24,320
that after the Guru Puja,

84
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:28,999
we have to understand that to be holy means

85
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,240
you must allow

86
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,840
the guru tattwa to circulate

87
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,200
in the Mother principle.

88
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:45,480
Or the guru tattwa is to be controlled and guided and beautified

89
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:49,999
by the Mother principle.

90
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,960
It's only the Mother Earth that is beautiful

91
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,999
because it can create so many varieties,

92
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,480
so many dramas, so many places.

93
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:04,999
Any other element, if you see, has nothing in it.

94
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,320
So it is She who can create.

95
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,360
So we should take to the motherly quality more

96
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:18,999
and try to bind our guru principle

97
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,400
through that Motherly, beautiful, creative power,

98
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:31,440
so that we make our presence very agreeable,

99
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,840
very congenial, very beautiful,

100
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:40,000
full of interest and varieties;

101
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,840
every time new flowers, every time new fruits,

102
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:48,480
every time a new, new design.

103
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,160
As Kundalini is made of Mother Earth,

104
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,240
we are quite capable of doing that.

105
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,320
There are gurus and gurus and gurus but no one so far

106
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,480
is such a master as you are of the Kundalini.

107
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,240
If they were they would have given Realization to thousands.

108
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:17,999
Why? Because your Mother has penetrated into your guru principle.

109
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:22,840
And has risen your Kundalini,

110
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:24,999
has given you powers to raise Kundalini,

111
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,999
breaking your seventh chakra, so clearly.

112
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:32,480
That never happened with anyone.

113
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:37,999
Even incarnations could not do that to the masses, as you are doing.

114
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,999
Kundalini is flowing from your hand;

115
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,440
the Ganesha is active in you,

116
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:49,840
but it should never give you the ego,

117
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:56,240
or the sternness or the heaviness of the sea.

118
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,999
But it should give you the beauty of the Mother Earth.

119
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,999
Mother Earth is always bigger than the sea,

120
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,840
because She has to contain the sea.

121
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:13,480
Sea can never be bigger than the Mother Earth.

122
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,840
Sometimes it looks, sea, bigger

123
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:19,240
but sea is contained in the Mother Earth.

124
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,960
It cannot go beyond.

125
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,999
So Mother Earth is always greater, bigger, wider than the sea.

126
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,999
So one has to understand that when Kundalini has risen,

127
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,200
you have become all of the seven chakras

128
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,999
and not only the guru chakra.

129
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:41,840
And when you have become the guru chakra

130
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:47,320
it is also bounded on all sides by the Mother Earth.

131
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,999
Under these circumstances,

132
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,480
when we are so capable,

133
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,480
we are giving Realization to so many people,

134
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:00,840
when we are achieving so many things,

135
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:07,480
if we could just become humble, congenial, beautiful,

136
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,480
we can master the whole world.

137
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:16,440
But I find in the styles of Sahaja yogis, especially in the west,

138
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,000
and westernized Indians,

139
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,999
there is so much of ego still expressed

140
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,999
in their talks, in their behavior.

141
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:30,480
They are not capable of it, to see I think sometimes,

142
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:33,999
but better see it.

143
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:38,999
First you may have to act as sweet people, maybe,

144
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,920
but you must learn that way.

145
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,320
If you do not understand that all your leadership,

146
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,440
all your guru tattwa depends entirely

147
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,480
on the loving capacity of your Mother, Her patience.

148
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,999
I get angry but perhaps once in a ten years or twelve years,

149
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,000
something like that, seldom.

150
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,320
That's better, then the anger has some meaning.

151
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,840
But all the time if you are in a temper or you try to show off

152
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:15,840
or if you have so much of ego

153
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:18,840
that you go on asserting on wrong things,

154
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:21,240
then you cannot be effective.

155
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,240
Another thing I've seen, that ego has no discretion.

156
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,840
Ego has no discretion of any kind.

157
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:34,999
If you are egoistical, first thing you lose is discretion.

158
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,200
Then what's the use of having this nonsense of a ego?

159
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,960
which doesn't give you discretion?

160
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,999
And people who have greater ego always then assert

161
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,000
and you have to agree to that.

162
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:51,320
You are more impressed by the people

163
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,999
who have greater ego than yours.

164
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,840
And you like the people who are without any ego

165
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,480
so you can oppress on them.

166
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:05,840
But the discretion part is very poor, that you can see.

167
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:09,320
The other day one guru had come, the one gentleman had come,

168
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,920
and he has given some mantra by his guru.

169
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,840
Now, he can't hear anything against his guru.  Why?

170
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,480
Because his ego has chosen that guru.

171
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:23,320
Because the ego has chosen how can the ego be wrong?

172
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,999
And ego is always wrong, invariably it is wrong.

173
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,999
Everything is upside down with the ego-orientation.

174
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,280
Gradually you will learn that in the west

175
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,000
people lack common sense,

176
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,320
completely they lack common sense, in everything.

177
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,999
I mean if they had common sense

178
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,000
there would have been much less problems.

179
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,840
But common sense is lacking

180
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:52,840
and also I find the same thing in Sahaja yogis.

181
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:54,840
They lack common sense.

182
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:59,840
You have to become so wise, that common sense should be your nature.

183
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,200
But common sense we lack.

184
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,840
Like today, (I`ll have some water)

185
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:11,999
today I was discussing about say, the labor problem,

186
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,960
which is a very general problem,

187
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:26,120
which is a very general problem.

188
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,240
You have a labor problem.  For example you have unemployment.

189
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:33,480
Now the whole system that is built in here

190
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,280
and we too have adopted some of it but not to that extent,

191
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,999
of working hours, is very absurd.

192
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,440
For example, supposing you get up at four o'clock.

193
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,999
I mean that's very big supposition, of course, but

194
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,999
supposing we get up at four and we take our bath.

195
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,000
Morning time is very peaceful, we can meditate,

196
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,480
we can do what we like.

197
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,200
Then we finish all the other work we have to do,

198
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,320
get yourself ready, have yourself ready,

199
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,320
have your breakfast or tea or whatever you want to have.

200
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,840
Then by eight o'clock you are ready for work.

201
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:18,400
Supposing you go at eight o'clock for your work.

202
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:27,400
So you can work from eight up to one o'clock very easily,

203
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,999
very easily, no problem.

204
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,320
Then one o'clock you come back home,

205
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,999
have your lunch and have a siesta.

206
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,480
If you can have siesta for about two hours,

207
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:50,400
say three, till four o'clock , by five o'clock you again go to work.

208
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,280
Then you can work from five to eleven without feeling tired at all.

209
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,480
After eleven you might be.

210
00:17:57,999 --> 00:18:00,999
So you put in much more work,

211
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:07,280
much less sleep and you keep fresh and young.

212
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,999
But it is, it requires common sense.

213
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,000
Now the, how unemployment can be solved;

214
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,920
some people can work in the morning, some can work in the evening.

215
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,320
Now those who are working in the morning,

216
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,480
the ladies could be in the house, men could be outside.

217
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:29,320
Then the men come out in the evening,

218
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,999
they can do the household work.

219
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,440
Ladies can do in their house

220
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,360
or when they are in the house, men can do creative work,

221
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,999
like making statutes, hand work,

222
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:46,440
hand-made things.

223
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,200
So everybody gets employment.

224
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:55,999
They became more creative,  much happier people

225
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,999
and so easy to solve the problem.

226
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:04,840
But there is unemployment;

227
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:07,480
Because of unemployment there are so many problems.

228
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,840
Very easy to solve the problem of unemployment.

229
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,840
You don't give any social security or anything.

230
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:18,999
You give them their pay and let them work for shorter time.

231
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,840
If you make them create things and sell them,

232
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,480
they have more money

233
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,999
or they can have nice things around them.

234
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,999
Otherwise you can have horrid things like that.

235
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:42,200
So you can have lots of things which are hand-made,

236
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:45,080
plus machine-made things, whatever you want to have.

237
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,320
There should be a balance. With common sense we should know

238
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,480
how far to go, how far to have balance.

239
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:56,480
Like machine goes on like mad; we cannot control machines.

240
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,840
Because we think we get money, we do not.

241
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,200
After some time machines have to stop.

242
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,480
So you have to go up to...

243
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:14,240
This, I'm trying to put the guru tattwa into the Mother tattwa,

244
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,480
as practical.

245
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,120
So common sense should be applied

246
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,480
and that can only come when there is no ego.

247
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,000
With ego that cannot be common sense

248
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,400
"Because I like it, I do it".  But this "I" is a ego who is blind,

249
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,480
who is indiscreet, who is stupid.

250
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,999
So ultimately we do stupid things.

251
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:55,320
There should be common sense,

252
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,000
which one can learn by getting rid of this ego.

253
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:06,999
Now people say, "Mother, how to get rid of ego?"

254
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,840
It's very simple, you have to move left to the right 108 times,

255
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,240
in Sahaja yoga.

256
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,440
You have to forgive people, in Sahaja Yoga.

257
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:21,840
And you can watch yourself.  First of all, see,

258
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:25,400
do you watch others or you watch yourself?  First of all.

259
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,200
Like there was a lady traveling with Me, very old lady.

260
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,840
And she said, "This man is handsome.

261
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,480
This man is not handsome.

262
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,480
This woman is good looking, she is pretty", that way.

263
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:47,480
I was looking at her.  I said "This mad woman,

264
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:50,960
she will go really crazy by the time we get down.

265
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,240
She goes on looking into every person, judging everyone,

266
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,200
who is handsome, who is not."

267
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,000
And everybody whom she called handsome I found him ugly.

268
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,480
So I gave up. I said "You better decide I never tried these things".

269
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,840
Then, "That man is not good, he is very hot tempered,

270
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,320
he is this thing, he is that,

271
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,999
he talks like that, he walks like that,

272
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,280
he shouldn't do, look like that",

273
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,000
worried about other people.

274
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:26,240
You tell them anything, they'll go on shaking their neck like that,

275
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,240
"Oh, how could you do it?"  But you do it yourselves.

276
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,999
If they have to say yes, they'll do it ten times, "yes, yes, yes".

277
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,999
If they have to say no, they'll go on saying: "no, no, no, no, no".

278
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:46,999
There is no common sense.

279
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,840
Why to move your neck so many times.

280
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
See if somebody is saying that, you need not react all the time.

281
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,240
So this is another thing, is internal reaction.

282
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,840
First is external, seeing everyone, judging everyone,

283
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,320
"Oh, I don't like this station; this is too much dusty".

284
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,320
"This bathroom is not good, that room is not good,

285
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,160
that thing is not good", like that go on,

286
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:18,000
as if you are the Queen of England.

287
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:21,999
Even that could be even more than that

288
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,320
because she is not even allowed to choose her dress;

289
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,999
Parliament has to decide.

290
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:37,960
Poor thing cannot have any ego at all, poor thing.

291
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
She has to choose what dress she has to wear

292
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
for a particular occasion;

293
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:47,480
If the Parliament says yes, she wears.  She says no, no.

294
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,840
big problem, for them.

295
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:57,320
But for us, who are free people, we must have common sense

296
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,840
to understand what to do, where to do, what to talk, how to talk.

297
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:04,999
But when there is ego, you cannot have common sense.

298
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,200
And this is the reason I think

299
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,440
the western people have become so stupid in so many things.

300
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,240
Whatever I see, I see it's upside down.

301
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,320
Indians, we may be poor people, in the villages.

302
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,840
They are not so educated. You are all very well educated people,

303
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:25,999
everything is there, but all has come out of ego.

304
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,999
So the common sense is lacking.

305
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,320
So those who deal with the Mother Earth, like farmers are,

306
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,400
have tremendous common sense.

307
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,320
Now in Holland I used to think people will have

308
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,480
lot of common sense, because they are farmers you see.

309
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,960
When I had come in '65, they were better off, much better people,

310
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,400
not so nonsensical.

311
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:57,240
They were well dressed, nice, sensible, solid people.

312
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,999
Of course I met quite elderly people also, I should say,

313
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,320
but I was surprised that in the market

314
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,999
you could not get a transistor made in Holland ,

315
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,999
could not get anything made in Holland.

316
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,320
So I said, "How is it? You don't make anything, machines?"

317
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,000
They said, "Why should we? For our twenty-five bulbs of tulips,

318
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,840
- in those days - we get one transistor from Japan.

319
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:24,999
So why should we make a transistor?"  Common sense.

320
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:28,240
"We send from here twenty five bulbs".

321
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,960
And they had fields and fields of all kinds of tulips,

322
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,840
all over, I mean when I came here. So they said,

323
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,320
"For twenty-five bulbs we get one transistor so why should we?

324
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,999
We export our bulbs to them and get their transistors.

325
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,999
Why should we make transistors?"

326
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:53,000
Then they said "We export our cheese to a particular country,

327
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,320
our eggs to Italy , our chicken to this country

328
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,999
and we get all that we need."

329
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,840
I was amazed you see. They are so, so proud of their agriculture

330
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:07,840
and so much doing that way,

331
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,240
which was a very sensible thing and because

332
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,999
they were dealing with the land I thought I'll find

333
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,960
Holland people to be the best.

334
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,320
But then I got reports that people are

335
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,000
absolutely gone off their heads.

336
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,999
They have become like bullocks now

337
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,120
Working with the land they have become

338
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,999
like bullocks who plough the land.

339
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,999
I was surprised "How have they become like bulls?"

340
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:43,400
They were very sensible people, very sensible.

341
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,999
Farmers, sensibly dealing with things

342
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:52,480
and working out things

343
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,999
in such a beautiful manner,

344
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,960
very innocent and simple people and naive,

345
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,320
up to a point of sweetness, very sweet.

346
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,320
When we came here they wanted to please us,

347
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,480
so they wanted to put a flag for us or for our country.

348
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:15,999
And they put Pakistan's flag in front of us.

349
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:28,840
So I was very happy to see that.

350
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:31,280
And they were talking of vegetarianism.

351
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,280
But when we came, my daughter had suddenly become vegetarian

352
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,320
because she had developed a funny nausea

353
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,960
in the, in the ship, you see.

354
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,000
So she was not eating any meat or like that.

355
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,840
So she said "We are, I am vegetarian".

356
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,999
So they said, "All right, then will you have chicken?"

357
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,999
They were that simple you know, very simple people.

358
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,840
And now they are talking about vegetarianism.

359
00:27:54,999 --> 00:27:58,280
I am surprised. Since '65 and '85 only,

360
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,480
these twenty years, how much they are changed.

361
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,960
Very nice. And they were not busy doing all these exercises,

362
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,840
and reducing weight or increasing weight and jogging on the road.

363
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:16,840
Just now, yesterday, I was walking, everybody was jogging like mad.

364
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:22,999
Very sensible, but they have lost their common sense.

365
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:26,840
Because perhaps they do not come in contact with Mother Earth,

366
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:30,960
they are using machines too much, maybe that is one of the reasons.

367
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,240
And must be the air from other outside countries coming

368
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,999
and they think "They are rustic", so they must accept

369
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,480
that is all that is modern, sophisticated, perhaps, maybe.

370
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,999
There is a story about a farmer, who was traveling by train.

371
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,320
And there were some naughty boys who came from the city

372
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,999
so they wanted to pull the legs of the farmer.

373
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,840
So one of the boys asked him that "If the eggs

374
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,440
are selling here

375
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,480
in this station for 20 p

376
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,960
and in the next station the chicken is selling for one pound,

377
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,320
what is my age?"

378
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,960
Just to tease him.

379
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,480
So immediately the fellow says "You must be twenty-two".

380
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,320
He said "How do you know exactly if I am twenty-two?"

381
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,200
He said "Because my brother who is full mad, is forty-four."

382
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:51,840
Can you see? They are so practical, so "brass".

383
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,840
You see, as you call in American language "brass tacks", you see.

384
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:59,480
They know what is it. He looked at him and he said, "Twenty-two".

385
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:06,240
He said, "How? Why?" "My brother, who is 44, is full mad".

386
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,999
And these boys didn't know where to look, you see,

387
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,999
because they wanted to tease him.

388
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,999
And the farmers have great sense.

389
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,480
Like we had one minister who had developed a bad neck, you see,

390
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,240
wild Vishuddhi. He was Chief Minister.

391
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,960
He used to go on like this, his head used to go like this.

392
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,840
So some farmers came to see him.

393
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,240
They saw him and they looked at him.

394
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,840
They said, "Oh, he's saying no already,

395
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:42,240
what's the use of telling him anything?"

396
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,480
We have lots of stories of farmers in India,

397
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:48,999
which shows how much they understand life.

398
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,840
I had a very nice gardener.

399
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:53,840
He was from a village.

400
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:58,280
So there was one fellow, old fellow,

401
00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:00,840
another gardener.

402
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,480
He says, "No use talking to this old fellow". I said, "Why?"

403
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:08,160
He said "If he is a Hindu,

404
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,920
then an old man is a gone case."
I said "Why?"

405
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,920
"Because in young age they live like

406
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,480
ascetics and in old age they become like bhoots.

407
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:21,840
But if he is a Muslim, they don't live like ascetics in young age.

408
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:24,840
They enjoy life and in old age they are satisfied souls.

409
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:29,480
So you better talk to a Muslim old man than to a Hindu old man."

410
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,200
I mean their reading is so correct about things, you know.

411
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:41,200
Everything that he said was so practical and so sensible.

412
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:44,999
I was really surprised how he could say these things

413
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,120
with such sweetness and with such goodness

414
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,999
and how he understood so many things so well.

415
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,840
And he was a very young fellow;

416
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:58,999
about I would say thirty, thirty-two years of age.

417
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,999
So he came to, he came to Bombay to see us.

418
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,360
He didn't know our full address, he only knew Marine Drive.

419
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,840
So he told the fellow, his taxi fellow,

420
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:12,840
"You drive me at Marine Drive ".

421
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:14,320
He said "Marine Drive is a big place".

422
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,840
He said, "Drive me anywhere in Marine Drive "; he drove.

423
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,840
So he went and asked "Is there a very tall

424
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:22,840
gentleman staying in Marine Drive somewhere?"

425
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:26,840
And you see, my husband is one of the tallest in Indians, you see.

426
00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:28,840
So he went to the servants, asked

427
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:30,840
"Have you seen any tall sahib anywhere?"

428
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:33,120
He said "There's one tallest staying there, you see".

429
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,840
So that's how he came to our house.

430
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,840
And he showed them his shoes, "These shoes

431
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:39,480
given to me by my sahib. He is also very tall, you see".

432
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,840
So he said "This shoe, he has given me,

433
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:43,999
and he wears the same style of shoes".

434
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,280
So servants noticed all these things and they were practical people.

435
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,480
So another gardener who met him, he said

436
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:52,920
"Yes, there's a tall fellow and he wears the same type of shoes".

437
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,000
So he came to our house.

438
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,840
How they are sharp and how their eyes are so penetrating,

439
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:04,920
how they know everything about everything.

440
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,840
It is remarkable,

441
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:11,480
very remarkable and that is what we have to be.

442
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:17,400
We have to be gurus with the Mother's influence on us.

443
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:20,840
All the time the Mother controlling us, the Mother guiding us,

444
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,840
the Mother making our banks, Mother making our maryadas.

445
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:26,480
So the motherliness is your blessing.

446
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:29,999
Today you are raising your Kundalini because your guru is a Mother.

447
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,480
Otherwise you could never have done it.

448
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,280
And that is why motherliness is so important.

449
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,360
One of the reasons, perhaps, why the Sahaja yogis run away

450
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,840
from the leaders and sometimes from the people

451
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:50,840
who want to have follow-on may be that we do not know

452
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:54,360
that they are just entering in, just opening out.

453
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,999
So try to be kind, just hatching

454
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,960
The little chicks, you see, will die very fast.

455
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,320
You have to handle them very, very carefully.

456
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:09,400
I am saying this after so many years of not saying this,

457
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:13,400
and I am requesting all of you, try to develop.

458
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,320
Sit before the mirror and try to act like a Mother.

459
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:23,920
Let us see, practice it, try to be nice, kindly, gentle, patient.

460
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,200
If you want to spread Sahaja Yoga in the west,

461
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,000
we have to do that way. Not in Maharashtra,

462
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,320
Maharashtra 's mothers are quite strict

463
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,840
and they are straightforward, and children are used to it.

464
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:39,840
You might find that our, you will say that My,

465
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:42,999
My Mother was a very strict lady but I think I like her very much

466
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,999
because she's taught me so many things.

467
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:50,120
Other my sisters are expert cooks, we are very good in the life,

468
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,240
we are doing so well in life, we don't trouble anyone".

469
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,480
All these things have come from our mother,

470
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:57,200
because She was a strict lady

471
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,840
as she would not tolerate any nonsense.

472
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:02,120
She would never tell a lie herself and if you tell her

473
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
"All right, if this gentleman is coming,

474
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,480
you tell that I am not in the house", "Don't tell me to tell lies.

475
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,000
I'll tell him that you told me to tell the lies".

476
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,840
That's how she was

477
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:15,999
and that's how she treated us.

478
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,840
And we lived with that but we didn't mind it

479
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,840
because what she did was for our good.

480
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:24,999
We knew that she was doing it for our good.  Not in this country;

481
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,840
people don't understand this fact.  They have ego.

482
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:30,320
They never understand that this is for your good.

483
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,840
They will always understand this is aggressiveness

484
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:35,999
because they themselves are aggressed or they are aggressive.

485
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,440
If they are aggressed, they are even worse.

486
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,400
So try to understand what is the situation is in this country.

487
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,440
I have adjusted Myself; you also should adjust yourself here,

488
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:49,999
to the way it is. And that's how I should not hear

489
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,440
any more any complaints about.

490
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,960
Now, again the guru tattwa has to go inside, the mother tattwa.

491
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,440
So next time I will not have any complaints

492
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,400
but they should all say "Oh, Mother, what a nice man,

493
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,440
he's so kind, he's so gentle, he's so very sweet".

494
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,999
It doesn't take at all, anything, to be that.

495
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,999
Now in this good atmosphere when the nature is so abundant

496
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:29,000
and the sun also is hiding its own sharpness,

497
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,840
where everything is so beautiful,

498
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:35,240
we should decide that we will behave in a manner

499
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,960
that will behoove our Mother.

500
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,000
and not fight, not quarrel, not say things.

501
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,999
Like somebody in the train now, supposing going,

502
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,320
will go and quarrel with the ticket collector?

503
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,480
"This is my seat, that is mine". A Sahaja Yogi does not do that.

504
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:56,200
A Sahaj Yogi, "All right you don't want? All right, I'll sit here.

505
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,999
All right, whatever is legal I'll do that, whatever is proper I do.

506
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,480
You want it? All right, doesn't matter. You don't allow? All right".

507
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:05,999
Immediately the person melts away.

508
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:10,999
But if you, "No, this is my seat.  I've booked it, this, that".

509
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,320
And then your Mother plays tricks there, on top of that.

510
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:20,400
So ultimately you find that the seat was not yours.

511
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,320
And you, you feel very upset about it,

512
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,999
"how a Sahaja yogi is insulted"?

513
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:46,999
So that is how it is going to work out

514
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,080
in this beautiful manner

515
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,320
if we understand the beauty of sweetness

516
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,840
and beauty of your Mother Earth,

517
00:37:58,999 --> 00:38:02,920
how She beautifully creates everything.

518
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,999
And even She is so sweet, I tell you

519
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,999
that if you are sleeping under a coconut tree, can you imagine now?

520
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,999
A coconut is so big, if it falls on anybody's head, finished;

521
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,320
stomach, also, terrible.

522
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,120
It can break your bone. But it will never fall

523
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:27,200
on any human being or any animal. Can you believe it?

524
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:30,840
It's a fact. That is the  ritambhara pragya.

525
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,320
That's the quality of the Mother Earth.

526
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:38,999
It never falls on any human being or animal.

527
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:43,920
How does She manage that?

528
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,999
And you have seen how the flowers also form gentle.

529
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,240
You never see the flowers growing,

530
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,240
How the Mother does that? Otherwise we'll have problems, you see.

531
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,480
Suddenly, you see a flower....

532
00:39:00,999 --> 00:39:06,240
So She, slowly She does it and suddenly you find oh!

533
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:10,840
She makes the leaves so beautifully arranged

534
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:14,999
that they all get the sun.

535
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,960
How She manages?

536
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,840
Then She creates a beautiful shade for you,

537
00:39:22,999 --> 00:39:26,320
the color scheme, everything so beautiful.

538
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,440
And then how She nourishes that

539
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,999
because all the leaves drop down

540
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,840
and they give nitrogen again to the Mother Earth

541
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,480
and then She again nourishes them up and they will...

542
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:40,280
But the leaves have to fall down

543
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,999
if the Sun has to come to the Mother Earth.

544
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,840
It is all Her doing but She does it so beautifully

545
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:51,440
that we are not even aware of what She is doing to us.

546
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,840
We don't know.  If you notice it, the one thing

547
00:39:55,999 --> 00:39:59,960
about the Mother Earth's beauty that She creates

548
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,480
and how sweetly She does it,

549
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:07,999
you will say that even one billionth of that, if we have,

550
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:14,480
we could be somewhere, already, ruling,

551
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:19,280
in the Kingdom of heaven, this is what it is.

552
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,920
So as you have got your Kundalini,

553
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,999
you must develop that sweetness in you,

554
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,480
in such a manner that people see you and think

555
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:35,999
that you are great mothers.

556
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:41,000
But as you know in the west the mothers are so horrible,

557
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,840
the women are so dominating,

558
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:49,999
that people do not have a proper image of a mother also.

559
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,480
Women are extremely dominating.

560
00:40:52,999 --> 00:40:55,840
Women must learn to dominate, it's so easy.

561
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,999
A bull can dominate anybody, but can they be like Mother Earth,

562
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,840
which can bear up all kinds of troubles,

563
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:10,480
all kinds of problems.

564
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,480
Can we do that way?

565
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:20,320
Especially that's why I request women of this country

566
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,320
to develop those beautiful qualities and not of domination.

567
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:27,840
Domination, it doesn't behove a woman,

568
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:30,480
it doesn't look nice on her.

569
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,320
It's like a bull, she is wearing as a

570
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,240
diamond piece around her neck.

571
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,240
It's not beautifying.

572
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,999
So we must give up that idea of dominating

573
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,840
or trying to oppress the husband.

574
00:41:46,999 --> 00:41:50,999
He says something, we'll say "no", to children we say "no",

575
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,960
to everyone we try to dominate.

576
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,080
That's not our character.

577
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,320
Even, I think Roosevelt once said that -

578
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,360
of course he must have met real Indian women -

579
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,840
that an Indian woman, she is like a magnolia in an Indian forest.

580
00:42:10,999 --> 00:42:14,440
Of course, here the magnolias are useless but in Indian forest,

581
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,960
even one flower in the forest,

582
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,480
it is hidden, you can't see it.

583
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:25,999
But you can smell it. The whole forest is fragrant.

584
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,400
you can't see it anywhere, it's hidden, a one flower,

585
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,999
you can know there is magnolia.

586
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:36,480
And this is the greatest quality

587
00:42:36,999 --> 00:42:40,400
because love is the most attractive thing in the world.

588
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,999
Why do you hang around Me?

589
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,200
Just ask yourself.

590
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,480
Because I have vibrations, My photograph has got.

591
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,999
No. You feel that you are loved, that I love you.

592
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,999
It's a very great quality but I have that innate within Me,

593
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,480
I don't have to have it from anywhere.

594
00:43:10,999 --> 00:43:14,960
And you too have it.  Just expose it and manifest it.

595
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,120
May God bless you.

596
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,480
So today we should do actually the Puja of the Bhoomi,

597
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,840
would be a better idea.  We'll do the Ganesha's Puja

598
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:31,840
and then you worship Me as the Mother Earth,

599
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,480
as the ritambhara pragya, which we have not done so far

600
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,480
in the holy land. All right?

601
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,440
And we have to thank all these Sahaja yogis

602
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:47,840
who are so few here, who have arranged all this

603
00:43:47,999 --> 00:43:50,480
and have done such good work.

604
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,320
We are thanking you, we are thanking Patricia,

605
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,840
and we are thanking these girls, Dominique,

606
00:44:12,999 --> 00:44:16,440
and we are thanking these two and we are thanking this gentleman.

607
00:44:16,999 --> 00:44:19,999
We are thanking you people. All right?

608
00:44:30,999 --> 00:44:33,840
And also Natalie, who is not here.

609
00:44:33,999 --> 00:44:35,999
She is a very solid Sahaja Yogini.

610
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,999
I hope she will choose her fiancé also with that understanding.

611
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,480
And Robert is here who is another Sahaja Yogi,

612
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:49,840
who has done, I mean who is the one who brought me here.

613
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,480
Now, of course, she has some problems, he had some problems,

614
00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:55,840
which are to be cured, which can be cured,

615
00:44:55,999 --> 00:44:58,840
and everything can be done very well.

616
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,080
All of you have to work hard because if you people have problems,

617
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,999
other people won't accept it.

618
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:10,080
So try to be aware of yourself, that's all.

619
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,840
Otherwise everything is fine. May God bless you very much.

620
00:45:13,999 --> 00:45:18,000
You have more and more Sahaja Yogis, and you enjoy their company,

621
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,840
live with harmony, do not fight with each other.

622
00:45:20,999 --> 00:45:23,840
If you have to fight, fight with non Sahaja Yogis

623
00:45:23,999 --> 00:45:26,999
but not with Sahaja Yogis.

624
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,200
Now,

625
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:42,999
so, first thing should be to wash My Feet, which they can wash.

626
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,160
Somebody should read and somebody should do [jadab].

627
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,080
Now, you can come and help them.

628
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,480
And now you can start reading the Ganesha tattwa, this thing.

629
00:45:55,999 --> 00:46:02,080
I would like to know what things you have got for your Puja

630
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,080
because I would like to give you the things you don't have.

631
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:10,040
All right.

632
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,200
Y: Let's take the mantra of Shri Ganesha.
S.M.: Yes.

633
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,840
Two, two of you should come. Come along, you come.

634
00:46:27,999 --> 00:46:30,999
Two, two each, yes.

635
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,040
Wash it.

636
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,440
Here.

637
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,840
Let our ears hear that which is truth.

638
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Let our eyes see that which is pure.

639
00:51:49,999 --> 00:51:52,280
Let our beings praise that which is divine,

640
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:57,240
and let those who listen hear not my voice

641
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,400
but the wisdom of God.

642
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,840
Let us worship with the same song, the same strength

643
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,040
and the same knowledge.

644
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,920
And let our meditation enlighten and enrich.

645
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,999
Let there be among us compassion and peace.

646
00:52:18,999 --> 00:52:21,160
And now the prayer.

647
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:25,160
Salutation Shri Ganesha, sakshat Shri Jesus.

648
00:52:25,999 --> 00:52:29,480
Sakshat Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha.

649
00:52:30,999 --> 00:52:34,920
It is You who is the beginning of all the beginnings.

650
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,480
It is You who is the doer of all deeds that have been done,

651
00:52:38,999 --> 00:52:41,480
are being done and will be done.

652
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,999
It is You who supports all things that are supported.

653
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,240
It is You who protects all things that are protected.

654
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,840
It is You who is the complete, all-pervading Spirit,

655
00:52:54,999 --> 00:52:57,960
God's divine energy.

656
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,999
Think clearly brain; speak only the truth.

657
00:53:02,999 --> 00:53:05,999
Let Your presence in us speak.

658
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,200
Let Your presence in us listen.

659
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,880
Let Your presence in us bless.

660
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,999
Let Your presence in us protect.

661
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:19,240
Let Your presence in us, Your disciple, be the disciple.

662
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:22,960
You are all the literature

663
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,400
and You are the ability to understand the literature.

664
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,480
You are the divine combination of complete truth,

665
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:34,400
complete happiness and complete energy. And You are more.

666
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,080
You are all the knowledge

667
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,999
and You are the use to which the knowledge is put.

668
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,080
You exist until the end of all things,

669
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,999
and after the end of all things You are.

670
00:53:47,999 --> 00:53:49,960
You create the end of all things,

671
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:54,240
and after the end of all things You remain indifferent.

672
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,400
You are the earth and You are the water.

673
00:53:58,999 --> 00:54:01,160
You are the fire and You are the air,

674
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,000
and You are the space above the air.

675
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,840
You are the gunas and You are beyond the gunas.

676
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,840
You are the body and You are beyond the body.

677
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:14,040
You are the essence of time and You are beyond time.

678
00:54:14,999 --> 00:54:18,999
You and only You exist at the Mooladhara chakra.

679
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,120
You are the Spirit and You are beyond the Spirit.

680
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,999
All those who would join God meditate upon You.

681
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:32,400
You are Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra; You are Indra, Agni, Vayu.

682
00:54:32,999 --> 00:54:36,000
You are the sun at noon, You are the full moon

683
00:54:36,999 --> 00:54:38,840
through all these and more and more.

684
00:54:38,999 --> 00:54:42,999
You are the all-pervading energy of innocence and wisdom.

685
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,999
You are the divine servant who stops to wash the feet of saints.

686
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,480
You are the tiny core of all things without which

687
00:54:54,999 --> 00:54:57,000
the larger have no purpose.

688
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,880
You are the key to the libraries of all the Scriptures,

689
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,999
without which the truth is hidden.

690
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,040
You are the full stop which completes the sentence

691

I resort to Mahalakshmi, the destroyer of Mahishasura,

863
01:16:53,999 --> 01:16:58,160
who is seated on the lotus, is of the complexion of coral

864
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,280
Now who is this One? Is the Mother of Christ can you imagine?

865
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:03,320
She killed Mahishasura

866
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:06,960
and She allowed these people to crucify Christ.

867
01:17:09,999 --> 01:17:15,840
and who holds in Her eighteen hands rosary, axe, mace, arrow,

868
01:17:15,999 --> 01:17:20,840
thunderbolt, lotus, bow, pitcher, rod,

869
01:17:20,999 --> 01:17:26,440
shakti, sword, shield, conch, bell, wine-cup,

870
01:17:26,999 --> 01:17:30,999
trident, noose and the discus Sudarsana.

871
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,999
Now, with all that. All right?

872
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,999
The Rishi said:

873
01:17:43,999 --> 01:17:47,440
From yore when Mahisasura was the lord of asuras

874
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,999
and Indra the lord of devas,

875
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,840
there was a war between the devas and asuras

876
01:17:52,999 --> 01:17:55,040
for a full hundred years.

877
01:17:55,999 --> 01:18:00,360
In that the army of the devas was vanquished by the valorous asuras.

878
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,160
After conquering all the devas,

879
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:07,920
Mahishasura became the lord of Heaven.

880
01:18:08,999 --> 01:18:12,840
Then the vanquished devas headed by Brahma, the lord of beings,

881
01:18:12,999 --> 01:18:16,920
went to the place where Shiva and Vishnu were.

882
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:20,160
The devas described to them in detail,

883
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:25,880
as it had happened, the story of their defeat wrought by Mahisasura.

884
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:33,880
Mahisasura himself has assumed the jurisdictions of Surya,

885
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:38,960
Indra, Agni, Vayu, Chandra, Yama and Varuna and other devas.

886
01:18:39,999 --> 01:18:44,080
Thrown out from heaven by that evil-natured Mahisha,

887
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:49,320
the hosts of devas wander on the earth like mortals.

888
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,840
All that has been done by the enemy of the devas,

889
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,920
has been related to you both,

890
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:01,840
and we have sought shelter under you both.

891
01:19:01,999 --> 01:19:04,360
May both of you be pleased to think

892
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:07,999
out the means of his destruction.

893
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,200
Having thus heard the words of the devas,

894
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,080
Vishnu was angry and also Shiva,

895
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,999
and their faces became fierce with frowns.

896
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:23,240
The issued forth a great light from the face of Vishnu

897
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:26,160
who was full of intense anger,

898
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,840
and from that of Brahma and Shiva too.

899
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,240
From the bodies of Indra and other devas

900
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:35,960
also sprang forth a very great light.

901
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:40,160
And all these lights united together.

902
01:19:41,999 --> 01:19:45,040
The devas saw there a concentration of light

903
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:48,999
like a mountain blazing excessively,

904
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:52,480
pervading all the quarters with its flames.

905
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:58,400
Then that unique light, produced from the bodies of all the devas,

906
01:19:58,999 --> 01:20:01,960
pervading the three worlds with its luster,

907
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:06,280
combined into one and became a female form.

908
01:20:10,999 --> 01:20:13,840
By that which was Shiva's light,

909
01:20:13,999 --> 01:20:17,120
Her face came into being;

910
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:20,999
by Yama's light Her hair,

911
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,840
by Vishnu's light Her arms;

912
01:20:23,999 --> 01:20:25,400
You just draw the line, and tell them.

913
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,360
and by Candra's light her two breasts.

914
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:34,000
By Indra's light her waist,

915
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:38,840
by Varuna's light her shanks and thighs

916
01:20:38,999 --> 01:20:39,920
Varuna's?

917
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:44,160
by Varuna's light her shanks, shanks.

918
01:20:44,999 --> 01:20:47,840
Varuna's light. The light of Varuna.

919
01:20:47,999 --> 01:20:50,999
SM: What, what is it?
SY: It creates shanks.

920
01:20:53,999 --> 01:20:56,160
The upper part of the leg, that [binds].

921
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:59,240
SM: Shanks.
SY:  Shanks.

922
01:21:00,999 --> 01:21:05,240
Varuna is, is the Lord of the sea.

923
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,840
and thighs

924
01:21:15,999 --> 01:21:20,999
and by earth's light Her hips.

925
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:25,999
By Brahma's light her feet came into being;

926
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:29,240
by Surya's light Her toes,

927
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:34,999
by Vasus's Her fingers, by Kubera's light Her nose;

928
01:21:35,999 --> 01:21:39,999
by Prajapati's light Her teeth came into being

929
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:45,000
and similarly by Agni's light Her three eyes were formed.

930
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:50,840
The light of the two sandhyas became her eye-brows,

931
01:21:50,999 --> 01:21:54,400
the light of Vayu her ears;

932
01:21:54,999 --> 01:21:58,960
the manifestation of the lights of other devas too

933
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:03,080
contributed to the being of the auspicious Devi.

934
01:22:04,999 --> 01:22:08,160
Then looking at Her, who had come into being

935
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:11,040
from the assembled lights of all the devas,

936
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:16,440
the immortals who were oppressed by Mahisasura experienced joy.

937
01:22:18,999 --> 01:22:21,999
The bearer of Pinaka

938
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:27,440
drawing forth a trident from his own trident presented it to Her;

939
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:33,999
and Vishnu bringing forth a discus out of his own discus gave Her.

940
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:39,480
Varuna gave Her a conch, Agni a spear;

941
01:22:39,999 --> 01:22:45,920
and Maruta gave a bow as well as two quivers full of arrows.

942
01:22:47,999 --> 01:22:51,999
Indra, lord of devas, bringing forth a thunderbolt

943
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:54,840
out of his own thunderbolt

944
01:22:54,999 --> 01:22:58,999
and a bell from that of His elephant Airavata, gave Her.

945
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:04,360
Yama gave a staff from his own staff of Death

946
01:23:04,999 --> 01:23:08,999
and Varuna, the lord of waters, a noose;

947
01:23:09,999 --> 01:23:12,360
and Brahma, the lord of beings,

948
01:23:12,999 --> 01:23:17,999
gave a string of beads and a water-pot.

949
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:25,200
Surya bestowed His own rays on all the pores of Her skin

950
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:31,240
and Kala gave a spotless sword and a shield.

951
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:37,999
The milk-ocean gave a pure necklace,

952
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:45,200
a pair of garments, a divine crest-jewel, a pair of ear-rings,

953
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:49,120
bracelets, a brilliant half-moon

954
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:53,840
armlets on all arms, a pair of shining anklets,

955
01:23:53,999 --> 01:23:58,880
a unique necklace and excellent rings on all the fingers.

956
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:03,840
Visvakarman gave her a very brilliant axe,

957
01:24:03,999 --> 01:24:09,280
weapons of various forms and also an impenetrable armour.

958
01:24:09,999 --> 01:24:15,040
The ocean gave her a garland of unfading lotuses for Her head,

959
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,360
and another for her breast,

960
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:22,240
besides a very beautiful lotus in her hand.

961
01:24:22,999 --> 01:24:30,320
The mountain Himavat gave her a lion to ride on a various jewels.

962
01:24:31,999 --> 01:24:34,160
The lord of wealth Kubera

963
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:38,360
gave Her a drinking cup ever full of wine.

964
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:42,840
Sesha, the lord of all serpents,

965
01:24:42,999 --> 01:24:47,440
who supports this earth, gave Her a serpent-necklace

966
01:24:47,999 --> 01:24:51,120
bedecked with best jewels.

967
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:58,080
Rustom has given Me something, bracelet but I haven't brought it.

968
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:06,480
Brought it from, he's brought it from Riad.

969
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,960
From the Arab countries.

970
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,400
All right.

971
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:21,000
Honored likewise by other devas also with ornaments and weapons,

972
01:25:21,999 --> 01:25:28,000
the Devi gave out a loud roar with a defying laugh again and again.

973
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,999
What's that?

974
01:25:32,999 --> 01:25:34,999
[Weakening].

975
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:40,280
Honored likewise by other devas

976
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,480
also with ornaments and weapons,

977
01:25:43,999 --> 01:25:46,999
the Devi gave out a loud roar

978
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:50,999
with a defying laugh again and again.

979
01:25:53,999 --> 01:25:58,400
By her unending, exceedingly great, terrible roar

980
01:25:58,999 --> 01:26:01,840
the entire sky was filled,

981
01:26:01,999 --> 01:26:03,000
What are you saying?

982
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:08,120
The entire sky was filled by Her roar.

983
01:26:08,999 --> 01:26:12,200
and there was great reverberation.

984
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,999
All worlds shook, the seas trembled.

985
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:22,360
The earth quaked and all the mountains rocked.

986
01:26:22,999 --> 01:26:29,999
"Victory to you", exclaimed the devas in joy to Her, the lion-rider.

987
01:26:30,999 --> 01:26:35,999
The sages, who bowed their bodies in devotion, extolled her.

988
01:26:36,999 --> 01:26:41,840
Seeing the three worlds agitated, the foes of devas,

989
01:26:41,999 --> 01:26:45,840
mobilized all their armies and rose up together

990
01:26:45,999 --> 01:26:49,400
with uplifted weapons.

991
01:26:50,999 --> 01:26:55,160
Mahishasura, exclaiming in wrath, 'Ha! What is this?'

992
01:26:55,999 --> 01:27:01,160
rushed towards that roar, surrounded by the innumerable asuras.

993
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:06,240
Then he saw the Devi pervading the three worlds with her lustre.

994
01:27:06,999 --> 01:27:09,040
Lustre? I don't know.

995
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:18,880
Making the earth bend with Her footstep,

996
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:23,999
scraping the sky with Her diadem,

997
01:27:24,999 --> 01:27:29,480
shaking the nether worlds with the twang of Her bowstring,

998
01:27:29,999 --> 01:27:32,960
and standing there pervading all the quarters around

999
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,240
with her thousand arms.

1000
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:41,840
Then began a battle between that Devi and the enemies of the devas,

1001
01:27:41,999 --> 01:27:45,360
in which the quarters of the sky were illumined

1002
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,960
by the weapons and arms hurled diversely.

1003
01:27:51,999 --> 01:27:57,840
Mahisasura's general, a great asura named Chiksura and Chamara,

1004
01:27:57,999 --> 01:28:03,240
attended by forces comprising four parts, and other asuras fought.

1005
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:09,200
A great asura named Udagraha with sixty thousand chariots,

1006
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,999
and Mahahanu with ten millions

1007
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:14,999
Must be the one with so many Rolls Royces.

1008
01:28:19,999 --> 01:28:22,160
Can be.

1009
01:28:29,999 --> 01:28:35,400
and Mahahanu with ten millions of chariots gave battle.

1010
01:28:36,999 --> 01:28:41,840
Asiloman, another great asura, with fifteen millions of chariots,

1011
01:28:41,999 --> 01:28:47,160
and Bashkala with six millions fought in that battle.

1012
01:28:48,999 --> 01:28:53,000
Privarita with many thousands of elephants and horses,

1013
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:56,920
and surrounded by ten millions of chariots, fought in that battle.

1014
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:01,280
Just imagine. So you can understand these rakshasas

1015
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:05,000
in modern times also are having so many Rolls Royces,

1016
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,840
so many people following them,

1017
01:29:06,999 --> 01:29:08,800
thousands and thousands, look at that.

1018
01:29:08,999 --> 01:29:10,960
And only one Goddess to fight.

1019
01:29:19,999 --> 01:29:22,920
An asura named Bidala

1020
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:29,200
fought in that battle surrounded by five crores of chariots.

1021
01:29:29,999 --> 01:29:32,920
Crores.

1022
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:40,960
I mean a chariot I think is equal to the price of a one hundred

1023
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:46,880
or maybe one thousand of Rolls Royces. So it's all right.

1024
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:50,480
They have completed their amount.

1025
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:57,920
And other great asuras, thousands in number,

1026
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:01,280
surrounded with chariots, elephants and horses

1027
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:03,400
fought with the Devi in that battle.

1028
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:08,840
Now you should understand how the asuras had such a powerful army,

1029
01:30:08,999 --> 01:30:10,440
had so many people to fight,

1030
01:30:10,999 --> 01:30:14,840
had such big elephants and all those things

1031
01:30:14,999 --> 01:30:18,040
showing how much money they must be having.

1032
01:30:18,999 --> 01:30:22,320
And that's what you see today also, same thing.

1033
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:25,840
They have all the money, they have all the chariots,

1034
01:30:25,999 --> 01:30:29,400
they have everything, elephants and everything to fight,

1035
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:32,840
but they are not successful.

1036
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,840
Mahishasura was surrounded in the battle

1037
01:30:48,999 --> 01:30:53,960
with thousands or crores of hordes, horses, elephants and chariots.

1038
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:59,480
Other asuras fought in the battle against the Devi

1039
01:30:59,999 --> 01:31:04,240
with iron maces and javelins, with spears and clubs,

1040
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:08,999
with swords, axes and halberds.

1041
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,999
Some hurled spears and others nooses.

1042
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:19,999
They began to strike Her with swords in order to kill Her.

1043
01:31:20,999 --> 01:31:25,160
Showering Her own weapons and arms, that Devi Chandika

1044
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:30,440
very easily cut into pieces all those weapons and arms.

1045
01:31:33,999 --> 01:31:36,880
Without any strain on Her face

1046
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:40,280
and with gods and sages extolling her,

1047
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:45,999
the Ishvari threw Her weapons and arms at the bodies of the asuras.

1048
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:50,920
And the lion also which carried the Devi

1049
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,920
shaking its mane in rage,

1050
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:56,920
stalked among the hordes of the asuras

1051
01:31:57,080 --> 01:32:00,480
like a conflagration amidst the forest.

1052
01:32:01,999 --> 01:32:05,960
The side which Ambika, engaged in the battle,

1053
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:10,999
heaved became at once her battalions by hundreds and thousands.

1054
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:15,160
Energized by the power of the Devi,

1055
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:19,240
these battalions fought with battle-axes, javelins, swords

1056
01:32:19,999 --> 01:32:22,920
and destroyed the asuras.

1057
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:27,840
All these battalions, some beat drums,

1058
01:32:27,999 --> 01:32:31,920
some blew conches and others played on tabors

1059
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:35,400
in that great martial festival.

1060
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:41,160
Then the Devi killed hundreds of asuras with Her trident, club,

1061
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:45,840
showers of spears, swords and the like,

1062
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:51,400
and threw down others who were stupefied by the noise of Her bell;

1063
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:58,080
and binding others with Her noose, She dragged them on the ground.

1064
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:04,240
Some were split into two by the sharp slashes of Her sword,

1065
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,840
and others, smashed by the blows of Her mace,

1066
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:09,960
lay down on the ground;

1067
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:15,920
and some severely hammered by Her club vomited forth blood.

1068
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:24,880
Pierced in the breast by her trident, some fell on the ground.

1069
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:29,840
Pierced all over by Her arrows and resembling porcupines,

1070
01:33:29,999 --> 01:33:33,160
some of the enemies of devas gave up their lives

1071
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,960
on that field of battle.

1072
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:41,320
Some had their arms cut off, some, their necks broken

1073
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:44,920
the heads of others rolled down;

1074
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:50,880
some others were torn asunder in the middle of their trunks,

1075
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:57,280
and some great asuras fell on the ground with their legs severed.

1076
01:33:59,999 --> 01:34:03,320
Some rendered one-armed, one-eyed,

1077
01:34:03,999 --> 01:34:07,999
and one-legged were again clove in twain by the Devi.

1078
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:14,920
And others, though rendered headless, fell and rose again.

1079
01:34:15,999 --> 01:34:18,320
Headless trunks fought with the Devi

1080
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:21,400
with best weapons in their hands.

1081
01:34:21,999 --> 01:34:26,000
Some of these headless trunks danced there in the battle

1082
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:29,120
to the rhythm of the musical instruments.

1083
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,840
The trunks of some other great asuras, with their swords,

1084
01:34:34,999 --> 01:34:37,840
spears and lances still in their hands,

1085
01:34:37,999 --> 01:34:43,840
shouted at the Devi with their just severed heads, 'Stop, stop'.

1086
01:34:43,999 --> 01:34:46,920
That part of earth where the battle was fought

1087
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:48,999
became impassable with the asuras,

1088
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:53,120
elephants and horses and chariots that had been felled.

1089
01:34:55,999 --> 01:35:00,400
The profuse blood from the asuras, elephants and horses

1090
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:05,999
flowed immediately like large rivers amidst that army of the asuras.

1091
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:12,280
As fire consumes a huge heap of straw and wood,

1092
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:18,920
so did Ambika destroy that vast army of asuras in no time.

1093
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:28,080
And her carrier-lion, thundering aloud with quivering mane,

1094
01:35:28,999 --> 01:35:32,840
prowled about in the battlefield,

1095
01:35:32,999 --> 01:35:35,200
appearing to search out the vital breaths

1096
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:38,480
from the bodies of the enemies of devas.

1097
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:42,240
In that battlefield the battalions of the Devi

1098
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:44,880
fought in such a manner with the asuras

1099
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:50,999
that the devas in heaven, showering flowers, extolled them.

1100
01:36:06,999 --> 01:36:10,160
Now, you may say hundred and eight names.

1101
01:36:22,999 --> 01:36:25,160
And the translation?

1102
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:33,999
I have the translation only in German, Shri Mataji.

1103
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:06,000
Get seven married ladies.

1104
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,960
Married ladies, seven.

1105
01:37:12,999 --> 01:37:15,880
Two are there. Five more.

1106
01:37:33,999 --> 01:37:36,840
She is the Holy Mother.

1107
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:42,440
She does not only give what a loving Mother gives to Her children,

1108
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,440
but She also gives the highest knowledge,

1109
01:37:45,999 --> 01:37:48,840
the purest knowledge, the Brahma vidya,

1110
01:37:48,999 --> 01:37:53,920
the knowledge about the holy, divine vibrations to Her devotees.

1111
01:37:59,999 --> 01:38:02,400
She is the Great Empress.

1112
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:10,999
She appears for a divine purpose.

1113
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:20,360
She is beyond kula, which is the

1114
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,960
countable dimension in us.

1115
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:28,999
She resides in the Sahasrara.

1116
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:37,999
She cuts the knots of the maya, the granthis.

1117
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:41,200
All of them have to say.

1118
01:38:42,999 --> 01:38:45,360
You take the name.

1119
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,120
You say the name first.

1120
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:05,999
Married lady, one more.

1121
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,880
One minute. There are three saris now, because last time

1122
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:34,960
I didn't take a Mother's sari from the French Sahaja Yogis.

1123
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:38,840
and the Guru's sari also so they have now said that

1124
01:41:38,999 --> 01:41:43,160
"Mother in this Puja, we'd like to give you".

1125
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:47,360
So that's how we have now three saris for Trigunatmika.

1126
01:41:47,999 --> 01:41:53,800
So the first one is for the Mahakali Shakti.

1127
01:41:53,999 --> 01:41:55,400
This is the Bhoomi.

1128
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:00,040
See how correctly it has come the colour of the Bhoomi.

1129
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:07,240
That's Mahakali. Then you have got the Mahasarawati sari,

1130
01:42:07,999 --> 01:42:11,960
which is the color of the

1131
01:42:13,999 --> 01:42:16,880
what we call the actual color of the prithvi tattwa

1132
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:19,840
because matter, of the matter.

1133
01:42:19,999 --> 01:42:23,160
The second, third one is the Mahalakshmi's color

1134
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,840
which Mary used to wear very much

1135
01:42:25,999 --> 01:42:27,960
So that's how we have got three colors.

1136
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:30,400
But I was amazed when I was coming from the program

1137
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:33,080
the whole sky was filled Mahalakshmi's color.

1138
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:35,840
I saw it myself, everybody saw the sky.

1139
01:42:35,999 --> 01:42:39,080
So this is what it is that we have now got,

1140
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:41,960
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati,  in this place

1141
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:46,400
because it's a holy land, and we got all the three centers,

1142
01:42:46,999 --> 01:42:51,240
three nadis being represented. This is the first time

1143
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:55,800
we have got three nadis represented in a place.

1144
01:42:56,920 --> 01:43:00,800
But that happened because I didn't accept it for the Guru Puja,

1145
01:43:00,999 --> 01:43:04,840
so they have sent it here. See this one.

1146
01:43:04,999 --> 01:43:06,920
Now, open this out.

1147
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:09,040
Seven or four. Just tell them to get up.

1148
01:43:35,999 --> 01:43:37,999
Show it to everyone.

1149
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:49,080
Here, Mr.[Vadha's] sari is containing the guru sat.

1150
01:44:49,999 --> 01:44:53,480
Here also. This is the guru sari has come.

1151
01:44:53,999 --> 01:44:56,999
Guru is the Brahmadeva, is the One, the Creator

1152
01:44:57,160 --> 01:45:02,040
and His power is that of Mahasaraswati. And this is what is the sari

1153
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:05,840
they were going to give Me for Guru Puja. Now it has come.

1154
01:45:05,999 --> 01:45:09,240
It has got five lines, which shows the five

1155
01:45:11,999 --> 01:45:15,240
elements that the Brahmadeva has.

1156
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:18,840
So this is the Mahasaraswati's. How correct it is, see.

1157
01:45:18,999 --> 01:45:21,240
Now, open it.

1158
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:25,240
And five and five makes ten.

1159
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:28,080
That's how the guru has got ten principles,

1160
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:31,999
five on the right and five on the left.

1161
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:30,840
Now, this is Mahalakshmi.

1162
01:46:30,999 --> 01:46:36,120
This is the color I saw in the sky which I had never seen before.

1163
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:47,240
This is the sari from Holland.

1164
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:21,800
Mangalasutra is not there?

1165
02:05:02,999 --> 02:05:05,999
Now you take the photographs.

1166
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:35,840
O Devi, you who remove the sufferings of your suppliants,

1167
02:05:35,999 --> 02:05:37,999
be gracious.

1168
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:41,999
Be propitious, oh Mother of the whole world.

1169
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:48,160
Be gracious, oh Mother of the universe. Protect the universe.

1170
02:05:48,999 --> 02:05:54,360
You are, oh Devi, the ruler of all that is moving and unmoving.

1171
02:05:55,400 --> 02:05:58,840
You are the sole substratum of all the world,

1172
02:05:58,999 --> 02:06:02,400
because You subsist in the form of the earth.

1173
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:05,840
By you, who exist in the shape of water,

1174
02:06:05,999 --> 02:06:09,320
all this universe is gratified, oh Devi.

1175
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:20,999
You are the power of Vishnu, and have endless valor.

1176
02:06:21,999 --> 02:06:27,200
You are the primordial maya, which is the source of the universe;

1177
02:06:27,999 --> 02:06:33,999
by you all this universe has been thrown into an illusion, oh Devi.

1178
02:06:35,999 --> 02:06:39,200
If you become gracious, you become the cause

1179
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:42,960
of final emancipation in this world.

1180
02:06:43,120 --> 02:06:46,999
Ha, I'm already that.

1181
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:13,999
Take the whole, you see.

1182
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:20,960
I will be [unclear]you to start because you can take at the Feet

1183
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:23,999
the whole [thing] of salutations.

1184
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:59,999
Salutations be to You, oh Nirmala Devi,

1185
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:04,400
oh You who abides as intelligence in the heart of all creatures,

1186
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:08,999
and bestow enjoyment and liberation.

1187
02:08:10,400 --> 02:08:14,800
Salutations be to You oh Shri Nirmala Devi,

1188
02:08:14,999 --> 02:08:18,080
oh You, who in the form of minutes, moments,

1189
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:22,240
and other divisions of time bring about change in things

1190
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:26,999
and have thus the power to destroy the universe.

1191
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:30,960
Salutations be to You oh Shri Nirmala Devi,

1192
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:35,440
oh You, who are the good of all good, oh auspicious Devi,

1193
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:40,840
who are, who accomplish every object, the giver of refuge

1194
02:08:40,999 --> 02:08:43,880
oh three eyed Gauri.

1195
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:47,840
Salutations be to You, oh Shri Nirmala Devi,

1196
02:08:47,999 --> 02:08:50,840
You who have the power of creation,

1197
02:08:50,999 --> 02:08:55,080
sustentation and destruction and are eternal.

1198
02:08:55,999 --> 02:09:00,920
You are the substratum and embodiment of the trigunas.

1199
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:04,840
Salutations be to You, oh Shri Nirmala Devi,

1200
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:10,999
oh You, who are intent on saving the dejected and distressed

1201
02:09:11,160 --> 02:09:13,080
that take refuge under You.

1202
02:09:13,999 --> 02:09:18,840
Oh, You, Devi who remove the sufferings of all.

1203
02:09:19,320 --> 02:09:22,960
Salutations be to You, oh Shri Nirmala Devi,

1204
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:26,200
oh You, who ride in the heavenly chariot,

1205
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:30,120
yoked with swans and assume the form of Brahmani.

1206
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:35,200
Oh Devi, who sprinkle water with kusha grass.

1207
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:40,880
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

1208
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:45,040
oh You, who bear the trident, the moon and the serpent,

1209
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:49,440
and ride a big bull and have the form of Maheshvari.

1210
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:54,240
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

1211
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:58,120
oh You who are attended by the peacock and cock

1212
02:09:58,320 --> 02:10:00,480
and bear a great spare,

1213
02:10:00,999 --> 02:10:05,320
oh You, who are sinless and take the form of Kaumari.

1214
02:10:06,999 --> 02:10:09,999
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

1215
02:10:10,160 --> 02:10:14,400
oh You, who hold the great weapons of conch, discus, club and bow,

1216
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:18,280
and take the form of Vaishnavi, be gracious.

1217
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:22,200
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

1218
02:10:22,760 --> 02:10:26,320
oh You, who grasp a huge formidable discus,

1219
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:29,880
and uplift the earth with thy tusk,

1220
02:10:30,040 --> 02:10:35,480
oh, auspicious Devi, who has a boar-like form.

1221
02:10:36,480 --> 02:10:39,999
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

1222
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:43,840
oh You who is the fierce form of a man-lion,

1223
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:48,240
put forth your efforts to sly the daityas,

1224
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:53,480
oh You who possess the benevolence of saving the three worlds.

1225
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:58,880
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

1226
02:10:59,080 --> 02:11:02,999
you who have a diadem and a great thunderbolt,

1227
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:08,320
are dazzling with a thousand eyes, and took away the life of Vrtra,

1228
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:10,160
oh Aindri!

1229
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:14,160
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

1230
02:11:14,360 --> 02:11:18,960
oh You who in the form of Shivaduti,

1231
02:11:19,120 --> 02:11:23,080
slew the mighty hosts of the daityas,

1232
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:27,440
oh You of terrible form and loud throat!

1233
02:11:29,320 --> 02:11:33,360
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

1234
02:11:33,999 --> 02:11:37,400
oh You who have a face terrible with tusks,

1235
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:41,480
and are adorned with a garland of heads, oh Chamunda,

1236
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:44,200
oh slayer of Munda!

1237
02:11:44,440 --> 02:11:48,080
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

1238
02:11:48,360 --> 02:11:53,960
oh You who are good fortune, modesty, great wisdom, faith,

1239
02:11:54,360 --> 02:11:57,280
nourishment and Svadha,

1240
02:11:57,720 --> 02:12:02,960
oh You who are immovable, oh You, great Night and great Illusion.

1241
02:12:04,120 --> 02:12:07,320
Salutations be to You, oh, Shri Nirmala Devi,

1242
02:12:07,720 --> 02:12:10,999
oh You who are intelligence and Sarasvati,

1243
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:15,400
oh best One, prosperity, consort of Vishnu,

1244
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:20,200
dark One, nature, be propitious.

1245
02:12:22,160 --> 02:12:26,360
Oh Queen of all, You who exist in the form of all,

1246
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:28,999
and possess every might,

1247
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:32,880
save us from error, oh Devi.

1248
02:12:33,120 --> 02:12:36,080
Salutation be to you, Devi Durga.

1249
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:44,440
May this benign countenance of Yours adorned with three eyes,

1250
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:47,440
protect us from all fears.

1251
02:12:47,999 --> 02:12:51,800
Salutation be to You, Nirmala Devi.

1252
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:56,840
Terrible with flames, exceedingly sharp

1253
02:12:56,999 --> 02:12:59,160
destroyer of all the asuras,

1254
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:02,999
may your trident guard us from fear.

1255
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:08,080
Salutation be to You, Shri Nirmala Devi.

1256
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:42,800
They haven't got, there, some of them. They haven't got yet.

1257
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:14,720
You must give it to a small boy, because she can see.

1258
02:14:15,999 --> 02:14:18,999
SM: Give it to her.
SY: Matin.

1259
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:36,480
The main Pujari hasn't got it.

1260
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:01,720
Here's the one.

1261
02:15:27,999 --> 02:15:30,960
Give it to the children.

1262
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:35,880
I think they have it all, the children.

1263
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:55,240
Let it be, let it be. Let it be, let it be, let it be.

1264
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:58,800
Let it be. She's always like that, let it be.

1265
02:15:59,240 --> 02:16:03,320
She's been always.... Forget it, forget it.

1266
02:16:06,200 --> 02:16:09,240
She's always caught up child. She is a caught up child.

1267
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:12,920
Comes up, goes down, comes up, goes down.

1268
02:16:19,240 --> 02:16:22,880
Arti, all the children have got it.

1269
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:27,280
Then I will not take flowers from you.

1270
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:30,680
All right?

1271
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:41,480
She's always a caught up child.

1272
02:16:43,999 --> 02:16:47,080
They have been always worried about her. It's all right.

1273
02:16:49,240 --> 02:16:52,760
She'll be all right.

1274
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:03,240
You want to do the aarti?

1275
02:17:04,999 --> 02:17:07,320
You were forgetting all.

1276
02:17:13,680 --> 02:17:16,880
I think the Feet should be taken on this one.

1277
02:18:27,800 --> 02:18:30,240
Take out.

1278
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:36,960
Put the flowers. It's all right.

1279
02:18:54,999 --> 02:18:58,480
Take one photo. Close. Get one photograph.

1280
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:03,720
Now it's all right.

1281
02:28:11,999 --> 02:28:14,920
May God bless you all.

1282
02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:57,999
May God bless you. May God bless you.

1283
02:32:00,560 --> 02:32:03,760
You too have got three colors.

1284
02:32:27,720 --> 02:32:30,360
Very fine, except little [unclear].

1285
02:32:31,880 --> 02:32:34,999
And here you have to put a line.

1286
02:32:37,440 --> 02:32:42,000
If you put a line these My eyes come up, you see.

1287
02:32:42,960 --> 02:32:46,999
You put a line like that. And like this, this much.

1288
02:32:48,480 --> 02:32:50,120
All right?

1289
02:32:50,400 --> 02:32:53,999
Little smaller lips, lower lip smaller, upper one is all right.

1290
02:32:55,160 --> 02:32:57,840
This one is to be stretched a little.

1291
02:32:57,999 --> 02:33:01,999
This is smaller and these eyes have got a little line here.

1292
02:33:02,240 --> 02:33:04,920
All right?

1293
02:33:17,999 --> 02:33:22,000
Eyes is to be brought out little more that side. Little more.

1294
02:33:22,480 --> 02:33:25,440
They look small, you see. They are bigger than that.

1295
02:33:30,680 --> 02:33:32,999
Oh, what is that?

1296
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:34,999
French Sahaja Yogis?

1297
02:33:35,320 --> 02:33:38,760
But they have already given Me a beautiful thing.

1298
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:43,999
He's not come, here? Patrick?

1299
02:33:44,680 --> 02:33:47,999
SY: He's coming at [Christmas].
SM: He wants a break.

1300
02:33:48,160 --> 02:33:50,999
SY: He may come to weekends Mother.
SM: I see.

1301
02:33:51,200 --> 02:33:54,440
But I wanted to meet him. All right.

1302
02:33:54,880 --> 02:33:59,280
SY: He may come tonight.
SM: May come.

1303
02:34:05,880 --> 02:34:09,999
He would have been happy to see that I took the saris. [unclear].

1304
02:34:19,240 --> 02:34:22,960
There should not be anything better than that.

1305
02:34:34,760 --> 02:34:37,840
How did you make these hands?

1306
02:34:39,240 --> 02:34:41,960
SM: You ordered?
SY: No, I found them somewhere.

1307
02:34:42,120 --> 02:34:46,480
You found them? They are just like My hands.

1308
02:34:57,800 --> 02:34:59,680
It's beautiful.

1309
02:35:04,400 --> 02:35:07,960
Our heart is in Your hands Shri Mataji.

1310
02:35:09,400 --> 02:35:12,880
Thank you very much. It's beautiful.

1311
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:26,999
This is a heart, it's made of the glass. So one has to be careful,

1312
02:35:28,240 --> 02:35:31,080
in handling it, look out.

1313
02:35:31,760 --> 02:35:34,160
Out of these two.

1314
02:35:39,999 --> 02:35:42,320
Thank you very much.

1315
02:36:20,360 --> 02:36:23,760
Hello. Look at them.

1316
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:27,280
Such nice girls, aren't you?

1317
02:36:29,320 --> 02:36:31,800
Thank you, thank you.

1318
02:36:31,999 --> 02:36:34,480
But Arti why are you afraid?

1319
02:36:35,280 --> 02:36:39,960
See now, they are not afraid.

1320
02:36:49,999 --> 02:36:54,800
You know, I've been to them.

1321
02:37:06,800 --> 02:37:11,320
Beautiful. Oh, you got it, Ann, from there?

1322
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:15,720
How?

1323
02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:44,840
Thank you very much.

1324
02:37:44,999 --> 02:37:49,840
Now, see, all the children are giving Me flowers. May God bless you.

1325
02:37:50,360 --> 02:37:52,999
Nobody's crying.

1326
02:37:53,200 --> 02:37:56,360
All right?

1327
02:37:57,360 --> 02:37:59,840
Keep somewhere. One person.

1328
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:03,320
See now. Who has done that?

1329
02:38:18,920 --> 02:38:22,760
This is you have done? Oh, great.

1330
02:38:30,920 --> 02:38:32,999
Good.

1331
02:38:33,960 --> 02:38:37,400
That's a good one.

1332
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:48,999
What is this?

1333
02:38:49,280 --> 02:38:52,480
That is from English [with all heart] for Dutch Sahaja Yogis.

1334
02:38:52,999 --> 02:38:54,840
English Sahaja Yogis?

1335
02:38:55,320 --> 02:38:58,880
For the Dutch Sahaja Yogis. For the Dutch Sahaja Yogis he said.

1336
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:03,080
SY: From the English?
SM: From the English to the Dutch?

1337
02:39:04,040 --> 02:39:07,440
All right. I'm opening for you, you don't mind.

1338
02:39:09,999 --> 02:39:12,880
Ha. Now you open.

1339
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:16,920
Take out but this is quite a big opening. Beautiful.

1340
02:39:18,800 --> 02:39:23,360
I'll take out and see. There must be a photograph.

1341
02:40:04,200 --> 02:40:08,160
With a smile, just imagine. Fantastic.

1342
02:40:10,920 --> 02:40:13,920
Actually first time I saw it.

1343
02:40:14,120 --> 02:40:17,160
I said "What a face".

1344
02:40:21,240 --> 02:40:24,040
Smile becoming a light.

1345
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:25,760
Shri Mataji, this is a present

1346
02:40:25,960 --> 02:40:29,040
from all the present Sahaja Yogis here.

1347
02:40:29,280 --> 02:40:32,720
Oh, it's too much [indeed]. Too much.

1348
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:42,040
This is the present of the presents.

1349
02:40:42,999 --> 02:40:47,200
Beautiful. Very beautiful.

1350
02:40:50,360 --> 02:40:53,800
Was there the painting like this?

1351
02:40:53,999 --> 02:40:57,999
I think this is the original image, [after watching this also].

1352
02:40:58,160 --> 02:41:02,240
This is the painting. Beautiful. You must see this.

1353
02:41:21,480 --> 02:41:23,999
This is made in Holland?

1354
02:41:24,280 --> 02:41:25,840
SY1: No, it's made in West Germany, Mother.

1355
02:41:25,999 --> 02:41:28,400
SY2: Austria.
SY1: West Germany.

1356
02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:31,440
West Germany? I see.

1357
02:41:32,200 --> 02:41:34,999
May God bless West Germany.

1358
02:41:43,880 --> 02:41:47,960
I saw this work in New Zealand, you'll be surprised.

1359
02:41:48,920 --> 02:41:52,440
But maybe, it might be Japanese, I don't know, but I saw it.

1360
02:41:57,999 --> 02:42:00,999
And this is a present from the Sahaja Yogis here

1361
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:05,040
for the Dutch Sahaja Yogis.

1362
02:42:18,999 --> 02:42:20,960
It will have double purpose.

1363
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:23,480
To save a lot of money for Sahaja Yoga.

1364
02:42:25,640 --> 02:42:28,200
Also double purpose. Shoes, you see.

1365
02:42:28,400 --> 02:42:31,680
The bhoots run away from shoes. Good idea.

1366
02:42:45,080 --> 02:42:47,920
SM: From where?
SY: From Milan.

1367
02:42:49,400 --> 02:42:53,120
It's from you? Or from Milan?

1368
02:42:53,999 --> 02:42:57,080
From Italy.

1369
02:43:06,960 --> 02:43:11,320
That's a painting? This is a painting?

1370
02:43:13,880 --> 02:43:17,240
Yes, Mother, I think.

1371
02:43:17,440 --> 02:43:21,480
It's painted by Adolf Eberle. [unclear]

1372
02:43:22,320 --> 02:43:25,360
Because it's the real, this is the real important [start]

1373
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:27,840
for our crusade now, the young crusade

1374
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,640
because this is all the people, yes?

1375
02:43:30,880 --> 02:43:35,760
And you see they protest but there is [unclear].

1376
02:43:36,160 --> 02:43:42,320
and there is a lady with her child and whole looking is on the lady.

1377
02:43:42,840 --> 02:43:49,080
And she is also moving and sees really the people who are going...

1378
02:43:49,720 --> 02:43:51,480
Forward.

1379
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:56,760
SM: Forward.
SY: Forward.

1380
02:43:58,080 --> 02:43:59,480
Who has done the painting?

1381
02:43:59,720 --> 02:44:04,080
It is painted by Adolf Eberle and the painting is in Milano.

1382
02:44:10,760 --> 02:44:13,680
The name of the thing is not there.

1383
02:44:13,960 --> 02:44:18,240
SY: I'll write it.
SM: You write it down here. Thank you very much.

1384
02:44:20,280 --> 02:44:23,400
You must have the painting of all the Sahaja Yogis like this,

1385
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:26,880
it would be a good idea.

1386
02:44:37,960 --> 02:44:40,680
Shri Mataji, [unclear]

1387
02:44:40,960 --> 02:44:44,080
and we would like You to give it to destination.

1388
02:44:44,320 --> 02:44:45,840
You feel the vibrations.

1389
02:44:45,999 --> 02:44:49,640
Give it to destination, Mother. Give it to some center.

1390
02:44:59,960 --> 02:45:02,680
I would say we should give it to Australia.

1391
02:45:16,200 --> 02:45:19,999
It's  a responsibility.

1392
02:45:20,160 --> 02:45:23,160
Very big responsibility.

1393
02:45:23,720 --> 02:45:27,320
[Hindi/Marathi]

1394
02:45:27,720 --> 02:45:29,920
[Hindi/Marathi]

1395
02:45:30,080 --> 02:45:33,240
[Hindi/Marathi]

1396
02:45:36,320 --> 02:45:40,400
[Hindi/Marathi]

1397
02:45:40,720 --> 02:45:44,640
[Hindi/Marathi]

1398
02:45:44,920 --> 02:45:46,680
Very beautiful.

1399
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:50,400
[Hindi/Marathi]

1400
02:45:53,999 --> 02:45:56,240
So kind of him.

1401
02:46:02,360 --> 02:46:06,160
So the ladies who have washed My Feet

1402
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:10,920
and the ones who gave Me saris, please come along.

1403
02:46:18,360 --> 02:46:21,320
Now, you should go and have your lunch I think.

1404
02:46:23,080 --> 02:46:26,480
Noodles, in half an hour you will starve, you see.

1405
02:46:37,920 --> 02:46:40,400
I think I'll give them too. Better.

1406
02:46:49,040 --> 02:46:51,760
SM: I give. You, Esther, got it?
SY: No, Shri Mataji.

1407
02:46:51,960 --> 02:46:54,680
Then you take it.

1408
02:46:55,320 --> 02:46:57,040
Now, take it.

1409
02:46:57,240 --> 02:47:00,440
So if everyone has got it, I am sorry.

1410
02:47:25,160 --> 02:47:27,440
SM: What's that?
SY: Present for You, Mother.

1411
02:47:27,920 --> 02:47:30,040
From you?

1412
02:47:32,840 --> 02:47:37,400
So many hearts. All right, open it.

1413
02:48:09,080 --> 02:48:10,920
So we have eight and this is the ninth.

1414
02:48:11,080 --> 02:48:13,400
We really needed the ninth one.

1415
02:48:23,400 --> 02:48:27,080
Oh, this is the tenth one.

1416
02:48:34,840 --> 02:48:36,840
This is Alsatian, na?

1417
02:48:36,999 --> 02:48:39,160
We will have. And we didn't have this one either.

1418
02:48:39,360 --> 02:48:41,920
SY: Dalmatian, Mother.
SM: What that was?

1419
02:48:42,080 --> 02:48:45,400
Dalmatian? Good. Thank you.

1420
02:48:46,880 --> 02:48:50,280
SY: Now we have ten Mother.
SM: Now, I have ten.

1421
02:48:50,680 --> 02:48:53,320
One more I must get. I'll buy Myself.

1422
02:48:53,640 --> 02:48:57,640
Let My husband buy something for Me.

1423
02:48:57,840 --> 02:49:00,840
These are the bangles for the ladies who are here.

1424
02:49:01,400 --> 02:49:03,840
Very graciously.

1425
02:49:04,400 --> 02:49:06,840
Yogi Mahajan has come all the way from India.

1426
02:49:06,999 --> 02:49:09,880
We have to thank him very much.

1427
02:49:20,040 --> 02:49:23,840
And he has brought these beautiful bangles for the ladies.

1428
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:27,560
Please, give one each to anyone.

1429
02:49:30,920 --> 02:49:34,480
All right, go ahead for your food. I don't want you to starve.

1430
02:49:34,999 --> 02:49:37,800
What does he want? A doggy?

1431
02:49:38,120 --> 02:49:40,640
Daddy, daddy, Shri Mataji.

1432
02:49:40,840 --> 02:49:42,080
He wants to go to daddy.

1433
02:49:42,280 --> 02:49:45,120
Daddy? Why to daddy?

1434
02:49:48,840 --> 02:49:50,720
You better have some chana.

1435
02:49:51,440 --> 02:49:54,999
All right? Take some chana.

1436
02:49:55,160 --> 02:49:58,240
Daddy doesn't have any chana. Nothing he has.

1437
02:49:58,999 --> 02:50:02,120
You come the other way round.

1438
02:50:02,400 --> 02:50:04,999
Now, take some chana. Come. Little more.

1439
02:50:05,160 --> 02:50:09,320
He can come. Let all the children have the chana.

1440
02:50:09,600 --> 02:50:14,160
All those children who want chana, come here, all right?

1441
02:50:16,999 --> 02:50:21,600
All want chana. That's it.

1442
02:50:27,600 --> 02:50:32,080
That is too small. Which one is there? Come along.

1443
02:50:44,480 --> 02:50:47,280
Here is the chana.

1444
02:50:49,160 --> 02:50:53,920
Child is not well, Rajan. You have to see her. All right?

1445
02:50:56,920 --> 02:50:59,720
SM: Father has come?
SY: Oh, yes, he's come Mother.

1446
02:51:00,040 --> 02:51:03,480
SY: He's feeling well now.
SM: What all the doctors are saying?

1447
02:51:04,920 --> 02:51:06,720
We don't know. Expecting answers.

1448
02:51:06,920 --> 02:51:08,840
Is she all right? I mean, out of danger?

1449
02:51:08,999 --> 02:51:12,640
Yes, she's out of danger now. Just she'll maybe go home today.

1450
02:51:12,840 --> 02:51:13,840
Oh that's good.

1451
02:51:13,999 --> 02:51:15,560
Just, just five minutes ago,

1452
02:51:15,760 --> 02:51:17,840
someone has phoned from the hospital Shri Mataji,

1453
02:51:17,999 --> 02:51:20,720
that they can be fetched in a car from there.

1454
02:51:20,920 --> 02:51:24,480
She can be fetched. That's good. That's like a Sahaja Yogini.

1455
02:51:24,960 --> 02:51:27,999
All right, but now I would suggest that when she goes back

1456
02:51:28,160 --> 02:51:31,360
let her stay here for a while and then go all the ladies,

1457
02:51:31,600 --> 02:51:32,999
let them go by train.

1458
02:51:33,200 --> 02:51:36,240
And [if it's somebody's] little van is too small.

1459
02:51:36,480 --> 02:51:38,720
And next time it should be a law,

1460
02:51:38,920 --> 02:51:42,720
anybody carrying a child in the lap is not allowed to come.

1461
02:51:42,920 --> 02:51:45,120
All right? That is the status to be able to walk around

1462
02:51:45,320 --> 02:51:46,760
and not in such a way.

1463
02:51:46,960 --> 02:51:48,760
One should not do this way.

1464
02:51:48,960 --> 02:51:51,680
And pregnant women are not allowed at all to come.

1465
02:51:52,160 --> 02:51:55,800
You know that. That's not to be agreed to

1466
02:51:55,999 --> 02:51:57,560
at any cost, whatever it is, you see.

1467
02:51:57,760 --> 02:52:00,280
It's very dangerous, it worries Me.

1468
02:52:00,680 --> 02:52:02,960
Thank God she is all right because of Sahaja Yoga.

1469
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:05,320
She's perfectly all right and she comes back home.

1470
02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:08,680
So that's a good thing. Come.

1471
02:52:11,080 --> 02:52:14,400
But next time make it a point, please make it a point.

1472
02:52:18,880 --> 02:52:22,640
Only flowers.

1473
02:52:27,720 --> 02:52:30,280
SM: Have I given you already.
SY: Yes.

1474
02:52:30,600 --> 02:52:36,080
So, try to understand that, you see, the pregnancy,

1475
02:52:36,400 --> 02:52:38,720
you have to be very careful.

1476
02:52:38,920 --> 02:52:43,160
If you have your own car, all right, if you can have [unclear]

1477
02:52:44,080 --> 02:52:46,999
if you can travel with someone else, it's all right.

1478
02:52:48,160 --> 02:52:49,880
That too in early pregnancy

1479
02:52:50,040 --> 02:52:52,400
not in the very advanced pregnancy.

1480
02:52:52,680 --> 02:52:56,920
Because you have come here to help Me in a way,

1481
02:52:57,999 --> 02:53:00,160
and also to get help from Me.

1482
02:53:00,360 --> 02:53:04,320
But if you come during pregnancy at a very advanced stage

1483
02:53:04,600 --> 02:53:07,600
it can create a problem, you see.

1484
02:53:08,040 --> 02:53:12,360
So be careful not to do such a thing anymore.

1485
02:53:12,720 --> 02:53:15,960
And if there are ladies travelling,

1486
02:53:16,160 --> 02:53:18,960
it's better they travel by train with small children,

1487
02:53:19,120 --> 02:53:22,320
but never a child who is not yet walking.

1488
02:53:23,200 --> 02:53:27,160
If the child is not walking the ladies must stay at home.

1489
02:53:28,680 --> 02:53:32,320
Please remember that, it's a law, that we do not allow

1490
02:53:32,560 --> 02:53:34,999
anybody to come to India with the children.

1491
02:53:35,160 --> 02:53:38,560
Now, if you have got children, and you want to come to India,

1492
02:53:38,760 --> 02:53:40,800
then do only one small thing.

1493
02:53:40,999 --> 02:53:44,880
You notify that you want, "we have got children" and

1494
02:53:45,320 --> 02:53:49,400
we could find out some crèche in Switzerland,

1495
02:53:49,840 --> 02:53:54,240
in Rome, in England, anywhere,

1496
02:53:54,760 --> 02:53:59,000
for these children to be left there. And you can come free,

1497
02:53:59,600 --> 02:54:01,960
freely there. That is important.

1498
02:54:02,160 --> 02:54:05,960
But if the child is very small, I would say, don't come.

1499
02:54:06,440 --> 02:54:09,400
But even children are not to be brought to India.

1500
02:54:09,880 --> 02:54:13,280
So all the children can be kept there. It is during holiday time,

1501
02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:15,440
we are having this time the program.

1502
02:54:15,760 --> 02:54:18,760
So please do not bring children to India.

1503
02:54:19,080 --> 02:54:22,999
Try to keep the children. They can be kept somewhere, not difficult.

1504
02:54:24,240 --> 02:54:27,960
We can form some crèche in the ashrams and we can manage that.

1505
02:54:30,080 --> 02:54:32,200
All right. So now and have your food.

1506
02:54:32,440 --> 02:54:34,240
Somebody must go and keep the door open.

1507
02:54:34,440 --> 02:54:36,240
Please put your hand in the door.

1508
02:54:36,440 --> 02:54:40,200
Shri Mataji, this is the last Puja, for the whole tour of Europe.

1509
02:54:40,480 --> 02:54:43,640
From all the Sahaja Yogis we want to thank you for the tremendous,

1510
02:54:43,800 --> 02:54:48,360
beautifully, enjoible tour that you gave us all. Jai Shri Mataji.
