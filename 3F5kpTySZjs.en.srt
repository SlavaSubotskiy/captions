1
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,030
We realized is happy and how to hang the situation

2
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,330
We have that's very powerful

3
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:58,899
Because able to know that negativity

4
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,909
Is it complete force all the time and we have to face the negative?

5
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,500
I

6
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
guess-

7
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,310
Legal

8
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,310
negative

9
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,970
Planners and when they apply

10
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,790
It is necessary for physical origin. It is necessary for all the

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,819
So do wish

12
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,819
That they should be

13
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,050
Also, you mentioned some funny sort of

14
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,100
People who are in sahaja yoga for some time

15
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,860
And somehow they cannot

16
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,660
Very low grade it because I should say

17
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,160
Disgusted me down. That's the second style

18
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:37,579
Because God's work today is to say as high as me but there are all kinds of

19
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,399
Mental projections and hands up and honor

20
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:48,289
And the first thing that you do attack is a question

21
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,430
That there are suggestions

22
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,610
Then there can be actual fight

23
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:03,649
I have such a

24
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,349
You understand most interesting one, right

25
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
That's pregnant

26
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,860
And you don't forget how she's nobody

27
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,680
Kind of a quality she's

28
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,820
We have told her that we don't want her anymore in sahaja yoga. We do not ask people to

29
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,130
Come they talk to us we don't force them

30
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:39,010
And if they are hopelessly back we'll be serving you have had in your perfect now, please forgive us

31
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,210
and

32
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,770
They get out of sahaja yoga mostly it sounds work up

33
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:51,489
Because we have to choose that's what we have to do with people because there can be very high quality

34
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,530
There can be very cheap type of

35
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,130
Peggy everybody knows has been

36
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,390
Interest was in

37
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:35,260
Children and when she came to me, I told her let's see if I do much about you

38
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:47,559
Then I discovered that she was actually in treating an

39
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,810
Astronaut

40
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,870
Let's just say God next time I hope I don't see your face

41
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:09,849
The whole adventure goes through something. So nonsensical enemies less person. I mean that time can be realized it's only me and

42
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,239
There she would have shot the sympathy of sound here and there then ultimately

43
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:26,169
The erase of them to believe me twice and I told her about the realization I do now promise me

44
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,250
That

45
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,479
And she said whether you have promised me that my realization will be established

46
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,959
I said all right props, but you must promise me Scotty that much

47
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,250
imagine to be

48
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,580
Befitting your own Hospital and your own. I mean I have got sufficient time

49
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,270
We leave my children to express by now. Here is a person sitting down quietly with three children

50
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,059
I just taking how to touch a

51
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:05,649
Very difficult case have trained this woman wavefront of living like a really light personality this time

52
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
But

53
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,980
Every time a new friend of which issues to teach you the black and all the time that's not funny stuff

54
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,939
I am she taught that I am drama sure and how is it not astonished?

55
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,179
And then I think we don't know that you but you're not

56
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,170
So she

57
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,210
She suddenly got exposed

58
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,420
Because she just started fighting intoxicated but

59
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,180
Saw hundreds o shameless

60
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
She denies

61
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,870
So

62
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,079
There was been happier in a way she said

63
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,089
She was always pestering me and I told her that

64
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:17,149
If mother doesn't want and if it is not allowed and I'm doing Jarvis is to say to these two

65
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,730
now I'm telling you the story is that

66
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,959
We resisted

67
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,649
Just fight aware of and

68
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,100
Now the baby

69
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:59,269
We have to understand that how much time do we spend in this tree?

70
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:02,509
We must learn how much

71
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:04,769
must change

72
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:07,248
the depth of a signal

73
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,849
That's very important because we have got time to waste much and

74
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:20,058
If you don't get anybody in engine anymore, let's all be there. If not in the address for the time

75
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:27,889
We have together human beings. We are not bothered to work hard enough. You have to wait first of all quality and

76
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:35,359
In fine, you'll be amazed those people who think to be where you must qualify. We find that uselessly

77
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,980
The divine will not matter the best part of it that you Y do not

78
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:44,599
it will be angry with you for wasting your time on such a fuss and

79
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:53,269
As you'll be going you will develop this discrimination within yourself and you understand you are not waste your energy with someone like that

80
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,268
All this idea of being kind to everyone is not for us

81
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,499
We have to be kind

82
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:03,499
to ourselves and to water

83
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,559
And all such as Leslie

84
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,089
Out of the circulation of evolution. Absolutely. There's no doubt it. This is what I want to tell you that

85
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:19,629
Today, I want you to ask the questions that's important and when you ask the questions

86
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,390
I'll see how the bear hugs

87
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,949
now to be positive and person has to see

88
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,620
How the question is asked?

89
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,650
It's not a question of your wife it's a question of spirituality

90
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,239
The question is from spirituality to spirituality

91
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,209
It's not from one mind to another mind and I would like to see that

92
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:08,050
They have come up so much there was so much out and they have done so much but

93
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,939
Some people don't feel vibration doesn't matter

94
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,889
May not see vibrations for structure may be some physical form

95
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:26,710
Is there some sort of meant I don't understand the main thing is the attitude of the person see

96
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,430
and

97
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,430
negative people

98
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,750
Are

99
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,750
there

100
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Take our time

101
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,300
diverters our attention equal to ten pounds and show

102
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,239
These they do that and they try to divert our attention to that attention

103
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,740
from the spirit

104
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,730
attention from sent

105
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,169
Attention from all that is so important treatments

106
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,898
vision of the whole unit

107
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,089
So we must understand that our lives are valuable that

108
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,829
We are sahaja Yogi's

109
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:08,358
We are workers of God. We are Kundalini resin itself

110
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:15,769
We are here license of a very high quality and we have not to waste our energy people

111
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:18,480
Do not deserve

112
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
It's very potent

113
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,339
It's alright what I do

114
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:30,229
It's different. I'm doing quite a lot of things with that and I see please let me get out

115
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:33,948
But you please don't waste your energy if you find somebody

116
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,559
difficult funny

117
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:43,668
Better give no. Thanks now with this idea which have one person

118
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:52,069
Will sit down here and I would like to see and you should all ask question question

119
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,038
Even because now as you are all going in the fields, you know people ask questions

120
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:15,318
It was sometimes it can be so aggressive that you can resist amount

121
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:21,169
But as I said after certain time, you should just give them up as well. So

122
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:24,499
It's not a responsibility to give realization to anyone

123
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:32,509
It's only those who deserving it is the deserving quality of people

124
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:36,319
That's the water if they are not deserving. We are not interested in there

125
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:39,049
Are sufficient already?

126
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:45,859
Better yeah, and understand that those people who

127
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,349
Enter into the kingdom of God only enter and not every day

128
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,789
So most people problems just because

129
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:13,399
You know as it is different from other

130
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:16,589
organizations

131
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:20,029
here the Gelinas is judged by vibrations and by

132
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,260
actually

133
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:28,639
You have to be extremely positive. I've seen even some cancer patients who came to sahaja

134
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,709
Yoga are so very positive

135
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:41,279
And something good for nothing at all, they're wasting your time and energy so the interest should be

136
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:46,559
I am NOT for people

137
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:53,849
Just wasting our time and energy. It's a friend of iñigo Vanilla's that I think that we try to correct

138
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:00,269
- it's all right their hardness way to be braver

139
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,139
This is what I want to experience

140
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:38,909
Right my own needs but you can directly understand and robit' know your

141
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:51,149
But if you try to be extremely now, let's get these all right

142
00:16:54,430 --> 00:17:00,299
So one is to remove a bag or if you are hard to learn they're just the same

143
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:34,209
Now there are so many interesting pictures and overeducated

144
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,370
See how

145
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:20,039
Because they still like this stage of understanding, all right

146
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:45,389
Yes me won't you say to somebody who comes up to

147
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:48,479
Says very concerning me

148
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:56,249
what is the difference between sahaja yoga and what is the difference between what you're doing and

149
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,620
They all seem to say the same thing

150
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,130
And the basic difference I feel mother is that in sahaja yoga

151
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:05,849
It's not the promise of an experience. It's the actualization

152
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:11,219
something actually happens in the presence of lethargy or other realized Souls and

153
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,520
you get

154
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:29,279
One thing that you can explain is whether they

155
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:34,649
Keep the freedom of the individual whether the individual is actually

156
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:56,609
How does it work do you feel that these people are free in what they're doing

157
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:03,960
Do you feel that they doing it of their own free will does it look like individuals

158
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,789
Do it if you do that are you taught to think for yourself and

159
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:15,538
Is it something where your

160
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:20,879
Freedom isn't affected because

161
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,739
a lot of the other ones you can explain that to people is that

162
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,450
People are second in charge

163
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,650
and

164
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:33,150
the second in charge morning till evening and even

165
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,999
I've never left alone and they do is do that sink and pray and do whatever and it never stopped

166
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,430
And they're actually made

167
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,770
to fit into a boat

168
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,190
Once a nicely shaped they come get out of it

169
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,369
we they don't understand whatever we

170
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,370
Eventually, we don't

171
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,360
they're

172
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,309
Fitted into something and some witness from the left side

173
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,980
which makes them want to be late and

174
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:09,049
It's something that you still find inside you use if you look carefully in yourself

175
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:13,070
You all still got them and we wanted us to be careful with it

176
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,619
Because it's still there its tendency to want to fit into an organization

177
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,290
Be a service attack

178
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:28,910
And not be who you are and go through with it go look at yourself and get through it

179
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,480
And that's the way it works people are told

180
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,570
That's you

181
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,560
But basically they're taking a charge and then they don't think for themselves

182
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:50,420
And the languages is correct. You have to see the results if you want facts as plenty of facts

183
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:55,460
There's people who could fire them in water for the trial on what happened to people

184
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,029
And this is especially

185
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:27,549
Comes up in America because there are people are used to pay me relatively everything you go to this introduction

186
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:40,839
So that's something that attracts a lot of people if if they're used to pain

187
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:57,490
But that's the rules but what happens in the summons suddenly

188
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,759
Great thing about that is that you become collectively conscious which is something that can be

189
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:29,199
Variations of somebody there won't be the same thing and

190
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:35,319
Children, don't take and everybody knows that if they try to vibrations

191
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,020
The

192
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,260
Capacity

193
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,240
Nothing does

194
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:46,729
Actually, I experienced that they can

195
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,330
Use your common sense

196
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,440
I

197
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,460
Experienced a tremendous

198
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:24,740
Destroying force because when I met mother

199
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,130
Hi

200
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,590
First of all, I got oh my stomach

201
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:38,540
Something coming up there's in skin that was approved

202
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:46,160
Negativity came out but something happens, but something really has you mean

203
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,870
Actually, I had no such things I only

204
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,090
Got into their

205
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:03,239
You're not really not not that anything

206
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:14,219
Also won another thing the fact that mother is so elusive

207
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:25,649
The fact that mother is so doesn't possess because I was

208
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:29,310
Well, I think the point Kevin brought up is relevant

209
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,320
But what you can tell them this if you get a power if it's boobs, all right

210
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,919
it makes you feel powerful but in sahaja, yoga, you can actually raise other people's from the Nene and

211
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,790
You can

212
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,869
empower them with the ability to raise Kundalini

213
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,230
For instance for me. The proof was I stood behind

214
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:54,509
Some new person. I just told him sit in front of this photograph. I didn't explain anything

215
00:34:54,510 --> 00:35:00,449
I stood behind him and I started moving as mother it showed us it gave his heart and

216
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:06,720
things started happening to him and began to feel within him things happening and he felt his to be

217
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,330
Linearizing and he began to feel the job

218
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:17,219
and I think that that is the most important thing you can transmit this awakening to other people and

219
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,480
raise their Kundalini

220
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,480
Rather than just feeling empowering you

221
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,550
Something which could be booze and I don't know

222
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,810
Elvis

223
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,810
Artificial has too often

224
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,400
with always

225
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,510
artificial has to popularly another very handsome of

226
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:55,329
course outwardly the ghost we can say that artificial danced an

227
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:03,578
Artificial conceit of a show till here does not

228
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:08,560
The artificial is both our nest because it has to sell

229
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:13,419
When the real is least bothered as he said about me

230
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,220
It's correct

231
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,220
But beyond that

232
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,460
How we make out an artificial knee

233
00:36:23,569 --> 00:36:27,969
Is the problem because they have the same kind of thing

234
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:34,960
Say that we are in the same thing. We are a vibration and energy

235
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,870
And everything

236
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:45,380
Now the best thing would be extremely practical

237
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,910
First of all, you are seekers over

238
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,410
There do

239
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:02,690
You see what chakras are can see you move on another life

240
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,349
They move another life because you are important

241
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,130
So you just see what your brother gets on it

242
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:15,259
If you answer them directly, they reach the mantras an agnostic

243
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,680
So when they say something to you you

244
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:30,380
Must know that if their groups are there possessed and they know you who's also not only that but they can read your mind

245
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,599
That's one of the powers of because they can't even

246
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,260
See what you know

247
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:50,149
They cannot work that we can tell about your future they can tell you about fasting until you're gone

248
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,750
Mental problems

249
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:04,999
Your brother father they will tell you when you're lost your properties are where you have kept your ornaments

250
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,920
Always difficulty

251
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:21,609
Because their interest is material so they know everything now you're facing a person like that

252
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:26,889
So he lives so much alright

253
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,839
So when he confronts the person

254
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,430
Deal with the person used to just inquired

255
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:47,230
Be your fortress in your tortoise events because array

256
00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:53,859
And try to see his

257
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,750
And see when it stops

258
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,119
Now he says by contraction

259
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,020
So I saw the patients

260
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:19,329
Now

261
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,339
Our real nature as he said to the usual

262
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,560
This emerge from the waters near the mum. She doesn't get in touch today

263
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,500
Only she can manage

264
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:55,119
The nourishment cannot avoid the person as we need to take energy. What are the giving States? We are not on the thing

265
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:59,409
If there are the person doesn't want to have it you can't open the mouth

266
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:08,690
So when such a question comes if you'd just let me through no many to denote

267
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:16,129
And you'll be amazed the dynamism of the spiritual mountain

268
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,950
Now

269
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,160
Supposing

270
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:49,040
It stops at tri-county you just have asked him to worship on

271
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,230
Justin.tv season acting

272
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,730
Like I tell you Douglas

273
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,630
Douglas is not such an intention

274
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,970
And

275
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:13,669
David Prowse, he just saw mindful of inherent oceans and he can put the r7 Douglas Cassini

276
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,270
He said I

277
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,240
one who ice he said I'm Douglas Amazon you

278
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,970
Really want this challenge of I?

279
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,600
Said by the way, are you perspiring - but he said yes and widened

280
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:58,969
Something you said what have you started and actually you got it

281
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:09,919
So your powers and divine powers never forget that on arguments

282
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:19,310
But you can't reach eternity

283
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:28,489
Give them realization. I didn't down miss candy because then I'm discussing with them actually an amazing them

284
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:45,259
So first of all to be acceptable because that

285
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,940
Now you know, what if any what is the business

286
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,299
That fun really, is that a bit

287
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,490
That is the strength

288
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,340
But when the light bouncing

289
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,360
The light has come

290
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,660
Even small children listen

291
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,890
You have got your own powers

292
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,840
You can raise your Kundalini

293
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,190
You can raise others cannellini no, no you can show people move up, but that

294
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:45,090
Coming to the side of it

295
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:50,609
How do you have achieved you know, you're given of all your habits if you have become a better person?

296
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:57,299
While people who belong to another country to forgive or image or the contrary will become just famous

297
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:03,060
The slaves they are not independent as she said that there are religions

298
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:09,840
They become ourselves together and it be a palace TT to them is just heavenly

299
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,149
Apart from that your knowledge is timeless

300
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:19,530
You know why I think yeah, nobody make one class

301
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:23,399
You know what contrastive say when to say how to raise it and the whole sizes

302
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,650
Even the boo, boo boo never give design surgery

303
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,080
Or get feet

304
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,680
So

305
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,299
All the points that you have your own powers

306
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:45,119
You can ask them that if we need

307
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,030
Yes

308
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:51,030
very hot

309
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:05,280
Then your power

310
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:17,760
Also we - I'm so

311
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:24,179
You should say now you try to be villainous you say all right in the middle

312
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:35,250
Supposing the Earth's Epps's finish them is finished

313
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,089
Once his realize that he won't talk so

314
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,900
You have to be made

315
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,890
understanding of the situation

316
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:49,200
And first of all, you are a realized soul shenyang on the world Devine is behind

317
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:54,510
It all confidence just face the person

318
00:45:56,830 --> 00:46:00,690
First going to meditative moon down upon your powers

319
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:05,159
And see that you raised two sons

320
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,920
One by one as

321
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,720
But before raising them

322
00:47:27,089 --> 00:47:30,679
The Kundalini won't rise it's apparently

323
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:37,999
So first of all, you must a person

324
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,319
Everyone whatever that's it

325
00:48:00,009 --> 00:48:02,009
And first class he has

326
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:10,259
what it is very good and all these points must be naughty but when

327
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,989
You when you have to

328
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,869
Stop are they just not in the range or they may be done?

329
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:25,559
But definitely, you know, how much

330
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:03,630
Around you

331
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:30,990
Take

332
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:33,439
We can't promise home his parents came they realize and yet

333
00:52:39,749 --> 00:52:41,869
Absolutely, sweet people absolutely

334
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:47,749
Balanced in the sense in which society sees it as a whole

335
00:52:48,269 --> 00:52:51,169
And yet they see the depth that Robert can

336
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:55,489
see and they treat it a little patronizing thing and

337
00:52:56,430 --> 00:53:00,589
They're there. It'll be alright, if you do it your way and we'll do it our way

338
00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:07,008
Meanwhile they have the cigarettes and they entertain their guests and they have their lifestyle

339
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,670
but then but Roberts determination was to to set the example to

340
00:53:14,729 --> 00:53:17,599
Transform to let them see by his transfer

341
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:21,140
Sahaja yoga is it?

342
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,660
When when we were there?

343
00:53:24,089 --> 00:53:26,089
they behaved like

344
00:53:26,459 --> 00:53:32,629
they they became disturbed by the tranquility that he was they started rushing around and

345
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:37,849
Shouting and giving orders and the two things and then slowly they could see what there's nothing

346
00:53:38,459 --> 00:53:40,938
there's nothing through 70 and

347
00:53:41,459 --> 00:53:44,629
There was a little microcosm of the transformation actually

348
00:53:45,509 --> 00:53:47,249
over that weekend

349
00:53:47,249 --> 00:53:49,249
you

350
00:53:49,769 --> 00:53:51,769
Cleveland do it by transformation

351
00:53:54,059 --> 00:54:01,309
And people start to watch and then instead of running around in circles getting nowhere they start to say

352
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,500
Beyond

353
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:29,649
Tell if anybody asks, you can say how much good it's done to you

354
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Crazy

355
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:08,650
To

356
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:11,360
Disgusting very

357
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,080
And

358
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,660
Then they started

359
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:42,339
Is also very subtly go sometimes if we can

360
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:28,449
Even during the time. No didn't realize guest any half month said

361
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,750
you know son of yours didn't quite

362
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:38,350
Transformation perhaps I'm not quite as confident as I could be just yet, but I noticed it

363
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:42,310
My mother for instance would like to come and meet you even

364
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:45,729
Person I was in therapy with

365
01:02:48,619 --> 01:02:54,219
It's not necessary, I feel like she's been quite interested in a friend of mine I used to be

366
01:02:56,630 --> 01:03:03,040
Away but a friend of mine is interested in seeing you. So I have been having an effect on people but sometimes and a

367
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:10,119
Very sincere seeker on my mother my my mother's friend. I gave you your pictures. She's very sincere

368
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:12,850
Sometimes I'm not sure exactly how to

369
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:16,090
Talk about it how to initiate it

370
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:21,879
Kind of bring it up and yet I don't know that there are all these people I realized seeking and enough

371
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,700
love quality people

372
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,750
sometimes I feel

373
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:28,750
instead of offering I'm

374
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:35,469
Forcing it down our throats. And yeah, and I would like to have him come

375
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:45,020
The alternative connection my parents for instance, although they profess to be against this they've been very sweet

376
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:51,020
They've helped me to come here. They they have an attraction to admit them. Despite what they say

377
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:55,700
They've been helping me I guess because they see that we're the change

378
01:03:56,370 --> 01:04:00,170
Then it should not be more appointees it see whatever these desires

379
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:14,299
But if you think that it won't be underneath baby water

380
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:18,650
These are not getting morning people are not themselves

381
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,880
Should she must be someone

382
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:22,159
You need not send it to them that's one thing about always from the very beginning it is too much to bear

383
01:05:24,089 --> 01:05:26,299
She said there must be something about her we don't

384
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:33,770
You see if you tell them that I'm such a saint either they'll be finished

385
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:40,609
Here or maybe on Thomas C so best thing

386
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:47,629
That's sort of convenient in this life cannot be sanded not talk about it anyone

387
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:51,020
Till they are realized Souls one second

388
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:59,240
Even if that book you've written that so strategy

389
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:54,380
Because

390
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:05,569
I say white whatever I buy

391
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:14,090
He would believe the cheese a lot that night you say very scolding later that question

392
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,500
You've got to recognize me and that achieved a tremendous

393
01:07:47,809 --> 01:07:55,689
You said it anyway mother it wasn't a suspect I might have saved in battery but

394
01:08:12,499 --> 01:08:14,499
This is the only condition

395
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:27,580
That's what they put it up that has to be

396
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:31,060
Now I tell you

397
01:08:31,159 --> 01:08:33,159
Say this may be

398
01:08:33,259 --> 01:08:35,259
immersed and maybe and

399
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:42,189
Mine, hope you see just put it like this. It was so painful. I could put it on that wall

400
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:44,230
but especially this one mask

401
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:46,629
I mean I sit I do - what's happening to this baby here?

402
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:50,529
Now this proposal of that it would not all the pages. Believe me

403
01:08:52,219 --> 01:08:57,189
And they were just like nominally emitting such vibrations the remainders I

404
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,469
Didn't ask a beautiful some vibrations from them, so there is room there

405
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,380
See

406
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:12,490
He told me that but then I just put your photograph in this village

407
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,910
And the whole place was flooded by the river

408
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:18,580
and thirty one

409
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:21,220
To

410
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:25,660
Three inches of it all of us

411
01:09:31,549 --> 01:09:33,549
That

412
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:07,839
It can only express itself through the own channels

413
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,809
so they want to talk about you and

414
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:17,050
They won't let us really close to them to come to South Dakota to become

415
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:21,249
Accept them in their new place in a new style

416
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:25,329
But they don't have the capacity to achieve this

417
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,749
using the vibrations because that

418
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:31,810
capacity has

419
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:35,650
So many always have trouble at first

420
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:43,899
Integrating your experience into our own life without staying in our own lifestyle ourselves

421
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:50,379
So I think when people get these urges to Russia

422
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,740
The other question whether is coming from within themselves

423
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:28,619
And their bodies may not be so much

424
01:12:31,869 --> 01:12:35,399
Anyone always which you may not get in Tibet

425
01:12:39,579 --> 01:12:46,379
What I'm saying whether you have to ask 300 man and she buy it but to do the job because I'm trying to think

426
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:18,670
How do you manage so well he says she was celebrated by Germany it's just

427
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:23,019
But it's all managed I mean

428
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:30,249
but sometimes they also manage so when you can bet that if Pete Weber not managing just

429
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:48,940
Understand whether convinced them interview or not is not the point how many people be saved?

430
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:57,400
This is absolutely the sense of how many people on this earth we say

431
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,360
That's the only thing that

432
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:08,380
Whenever until you satisfy somebody or not whether there's a component see how many do you are going to say?

433
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,500
That's all

434
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,040
See that English was very wish

435
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,280
But they draw each other

436
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,080
Ah students must say of

437
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,820
Range

438
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:44,959
But it is not what we have to do how many

439
01:14:50,699 --> 01:14:52,909
And don't get after the anyone

440
01:14:53,429 --> 01:14:57,319
Who is still for 30 we have to get more people?

441
01:14:57,510 --> 01:15:03,170
So you should run after one person is referring waste your energy on one person instead of that. Why not?

442
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:21,949
Earlier wrong mother you were talking about not wasting energy on people. Who were

443
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,759
Or people who've been in sahaja yoga some time but more half-baked and some what

444
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,480
What is the criteria how

445
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:42,140
Judgements made how that's one or a group of people who decide that an individual should be

446
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:46,010
Encouraged they

447
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:52,369
Start talking and they don't you think somebody talked

448
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:33,410
In the

449
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:49,389
What should we say people who say that's a video these are self righteous and so much cause we only

450
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,630
Care about very few people. I think we're doing

451
01:17:56,450 --> 01:18:01,570
Well, I just yeah just for now and we are going to say whether

452
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:12,220
I should be worried you see for the certificate of the Vivianna politician. We are not simply knows

453
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:17,289
We have to do the desire of God. We have to work for what?

454
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:21,080
Was

455
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:28,990
In that is see we have to of course with dignity with compassion with now with affectionate Evita. No doubt

456
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,520
But all these qualities from work or saving

457
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:40,480
If by all these qualities you cannot save someone better because of

458
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:44,590
Their certificate is not produced works

459
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:49,360
There's that you feel kind of a certificate on the phone

460
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:13,250
Nobody out

461
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:22,579
There realizes their of those people who are not

462
01:20:38,849 --> 01:20:45,379
A saint has to respect the same as he made something with our men who respect other people ladies

463
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:54,619
You should respect other people more than the schedules the very family and chalice

464
01:21:36,909 --> 01:21:40,379
Understand if you won seats in another man

465
01:21:41,739 --> 01:21:46,259
if I say he's already hot-tempered fellow you like pieces like that and

466
01:21:48,699 --> 01:21:50,699
Everybody

467
01:21:51,610 --> 01:21:53,610
You

468
01:21:55,479 --> 01:21:57,599
See they told me

469
01:22:06,369 --> 01:22:08,369
-

470
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:13,780
Well, then he has a

471
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:21,689
Proper body or not that he has proper tools or not whether he lives in a palace all on the street. It's forgiveness

472
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:32,830
This is the V which was this identification

473
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:46,929
Because I have a double life I do how people create an impression. Oh

474
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:54,910
It is nothing

475
01:22:56,450 --> 01:23:00,010
Those who are deep people must realize the value of other deeply

476
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,310
Because they are the only ones who understand you. Are you understand?

477
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:08,290
This is one of the reasons why there are dates among sahaja, Yogi's they don't respect it

478
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,920
Once

479
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:42,070
Every flower

480
01:23:51,530 --> 01:23:54,070
Since after all this matter little bit here and there

481
01:23:58,970 --> 01:24:04,839
Also situation within the avatar, but if we have people living there who frankly just not getting it together

482
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,710
Should be able to do role

483
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:22,990
What's not immediate why muscles nautical means actually the base for the simply the music

484
01:24:24,290 --> 01:24:29,080
For perfectly yourself, as I said that yourself to be impatient

485
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:38,169
I shall be the face when you have the perfect just if there are people like that to start instead of me

486
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:40,170
I see you got a face where?

487
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:41,990
actually

488
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:45,639
that place of can be if you have to give them you have to get

489
01:24:46,610 --> 01:24:49,839
the roots and regulations for the ganache on as long as

490
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:52,490
You know

491
01:24:52,490 --> 01:24:54,939
And those who do not want to vote you get out

492
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:05,649
Ashram is not a place of any the meanest men. If you put a very cheap you act up come along

493
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:09,010
So everywhere they want to come down on Saturday night

494
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:13,929
That's us. I shall please deep but is very easy

495
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:03,060
Other is

496
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:09,799
Maybe not an example that could be translated into Britain, but we found that by being stricted first

497
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:13,580
Then the strictness recedes and they become

498
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:22,370
Self-discipline. This is a very nice sensual place a certain intensity due to the punch of a channel that beat the show a

499
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:25,039
Shannon party. So today was a rough day

500
01:27:26,970 --> 01:27:33,080
For five years of age beat the joy daddy

501
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:36,480
Chiseling

502
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,480
That is actually

503
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:43,160
The sever shape was ill to fight till then a tweet

504
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:50,839
One ticket in yourself. Sure. Does he ever shit about it when the child becomes 16 years of age?

505
01:27:51,630 --> 01:27:53,630
tremendous, right

506
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:56,029
Now only eight years have passed in this country

507
01:27:58,290 --> 01:28:01,850
And there are many who are treating us like say I'm never a problem

508
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:05,390
And all of you should be like that but in the beginning you do meet

509
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:10,640
That's the only way you can write out your boots writing

510
01:28:15,630 --> 01:28:17,630
It has to be

511
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:03,799
With regard to the practices within sahaja yoga

512
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:10,219
What should we as parents do for our children to a home of sahaja Yogi's in practical ways

513
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:34,459
But should not spoil it because if there are

514
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:45,049
In the beginning is sahaja, yoga child and

515
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:56,089
It's more important for a simile which I and for an RD manager because he has powers

516
01:29:57,630 --> 01:30:04,850
That's how Rama Rama came around he was a real asshole but you are not ready to be a realized soul

517
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:08,900
But it was really nice on

518
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:15,109
You must take them out you must discipline them in a way by descent

519
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:17,609
Did you start with a movie but the department I've seen children in the west of any pollutant

520
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:20,580
even the airless -

521
01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:24,659
You must I was telling me that you must be demo buyers

522
01:31:25,570 --> 01:31:27,460
Who can have to the light?

523
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:29,460
this country needs

524
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:34,140
Or this Western countries become yoga is symmetrical Ito

525
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:38,400
So best thing is to give them a balance so that they don't ever they reuse

526
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:45,209
You can work everything on them very important and you are you must use

527
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:50,939
The little things we do two laps gently look after them

528
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:57,390
But no dodge follow that they should not become routine aim for that against them again genetic mercy

529
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:02,940
Discipline is very important. They left

530
01:32:32,679 --> 01:32:34,679
Like that

531
01:32:43,179 --> 01:32:45,179
Think that you start in a new

532
01:32:45,789 --> 01:32:47,789
dynasty now and then

533
01:32:48,459 --> 01:32:50,519
and there to change as

534
01:32:51,519 --> 01:32:53,519
new ballast

535
01:32:56,229 --> 01:33:00,629
It doesn't look nice for here like school behave like

536
01:33:03,489 --> 01:33:09,448
Ordinary mundane time it should be said with dignity - with understanding

537
01:33:12,579 --> 01:33:15,029
Coordinating and all these selfishness

538
01:33:21,489 --> 01:33:24,958
But you're just repetitive every time I can imagine yourself

539
01:33:26,050 --> 01:33:28,050
put their attention move to the

540
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:30,780
Salvation side

541
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:34,550
That's

542
01:34:37,530 --> 01:34:41,570
Possibly which I don't you must tell children what you wanted

543
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:47,809
You must be clean because you see after all

544
01:34:49,409 --> 01:34:52,819
Who is going to buy this ribbon important is our condition

545
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:09,430
How much is it better than the Alaia I think music

546
01:35:19,610 --> 01:35:23,500
Canadian children have such a natural poise a natural respect

547
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:26,540
We don't see them in

548
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:28,540
Tell them to darkness

549
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:36,940
If you tell them I want this kid won't see now it's now she drives out here then the circulation desk I think enough

550
01:36:04,949 --> 01:36:06,949
Because of

551
01:38:00,079 --> 01:38:03,639
One night but these partners are not seekers

552
01:38:12,690 --> 01:38:16,940
The same relationship with civilians

553
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:25,910
Whether it is your partner your father mother brothers everything

554
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:32,719
Your relationship

555
01:38:36,150 --> 01:38:40,430
Because you're connected to water his collective consciousness of these are all very

556
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:48,350
Nature you might say

557
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:54,860
I'm sure

558
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:13,590
He's speaking in

559
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:15,360
place where

560
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:16,830
is

561
01:39:16,830 --> 01:39:18,420
disinterested and

562
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:20,420
Just not a seeker. But when?

563
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:25,100
the case of one person is very strong you can see

564
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:33,170
They say the wife may not be interested in sahaja yoga man is

565
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:52,680
Just

566
01:41:37,570 --> 01:41:40,209
We employed by giving sounded odd Android

567
01:42:12,510 --> 01:42:15,530
It was amazed I told him that once you

568
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:28,069
After all all signs and we think that done just to give us style types of water

569
01:42:31,050 --> 01:42:33,050
Why this time has come to us

570
01:42:44,130 --> 01:42:49,220
Everybody said to us

571
01:42:53,220 --> 01:42:59,119
Is a fucking believe money does not matter people are not tensions at money with every very

572
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:02,360
Impressed because them so much time
