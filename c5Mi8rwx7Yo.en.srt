1
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:54,489
When you are all meditating

2
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:59,675
 and inside I also find it difficult to be outside.

3
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:08,300
So today you have arranged to have this puja here.

4
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:14,410
Just before that you have to prepare yourself

5
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:17,449
 physically and mentally.

6
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:23,677
Physically you must give yourself a bandhan

7
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:26,582
and a bandhan is just nothing but

8
00:02:26,783 --> 00:02:30,925
that you give yourself a protection to your aura.

9
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:35,230
And how you do it is very simple

10
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:37,980
 which I will tell you just now how to do it

11
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:44,292
and then you sit down for your puja.

12
00:02:44,493 --> 00:02:47,982
Then mentally you have to put yourself right.

13
00:02:48,183 --> 00:02:52,472
First of all, you should not feel guilty at all.

14
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,824
If you are guilty, you cannot do my puja.

15
00:02:57,087 --> 00:03:01,746
So, you should be absolutely above that.

16
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:05,222
There should be no tension in your mind.

17
00:03:05,488 --> 00:03:08,746
You are not guilty, you are in the present.

18
00:03:08,972 --> 00:03:11,603
See like flowers you are looking.

19
00:03:11,804 --> 00:03:13,716
How can flowers be guilty?

20
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:16,052
First get out of that guilt business.

21
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,894
You should not feel guilty or tense.

22
00:03:19,113 --> 00:03:21,448
Everything that is done is the best.

23
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:23,334
You shouldn’t worry about it.

24
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:27,012
It’s not your responsibility even to arrange it.

25
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:30,496
Just think that everything is done sahaj.

26
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:34,628
Gradually when you’ll move in Sahaja Yoga you’ll be surprised

27
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,933
to see how things are arranged just beautifully.

28
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,089
When these people just were finding out a place

29
00:03:43,371 --> 00:03:48,316
they had no place which was for less than 250$ each.

30
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,243
They said this is rather too much for everybody’s pocket.

31
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:54,818
And then suddenly, spontaneously they found this place.

32
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,363
When they said 50$ nobody could believe.

33
00:03:57,564 --> 00:04:01,348
They thought that we’ll just get some porridge in the morning

34
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:04,792
and the rest of it will be fasting.

35
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:06,943
So many were rather worried,

36
00:04:07,152 --> 00:04:10,340
some thought it was a scout camping ground or whatever it is

37
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,683
and quite worried when it starts raining.

38
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:17,676
But, see, this is all God’s grace to get such a place,

39
00:04:17,877 --> 00:04:20,910
such a comfortable place for you to come here.

40
00:04:21,113 --> 00:04:24,035
Everything is arranged by God’s grace.

41
00:04:24,236 --> 00:04:25,793
So first we have to remember

42
00:04:25,994 --> 00:04:28,164
that it is all arrange through God's grace

43
00:04:28,365 --> 00:04:30,240
If something is not arranged just forget it,

44
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:32,494
just leave it, just don’t worry.

45
00:04:32,695 --> 00:04:35,066
That’s the best way, you have to live.

46
00:04:35,313 --> 00:04:39,426
Then what happens is that you become one with the present

47
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:44,002
and you can overcome all your problems of tension.

48
00:04:44,203 --> 00:04:46,701
Tension mounts up when we want to do

49
00:04:46,902 --> 00:04:48,802
which you are not supposed to do,

50
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:51,437
which we are not successful.

51
00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:53,496
There is also a mental barrier

52
00:04:53,697 --> 00:04:55,768
 between ourselves and our mind

53
00:04:55,969 --> 00:04:58,796
that we want to do a particular thing in a particular way.

54
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:02,044
If you can give up that, then you will be surprised

55
00:05:02,245 --> 00:05:07,810
that you become absolutely one with the Divine

56
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:11,723
 and you start working it out in a very beautiful manner.

57
00:05:11,924 --> 00:05:15,858
Now see the root of a little seed.

58
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:19,892
It just sprouts, it goes this way.

59
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:22,598
If it finds there is an obstruction

60
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:26,075
ot there is some sort of a stone or something, it goes around it.

61
00:05:26,302 --> 00:05:30,241
Then it finds something other obstruction, it goes away from it.

62
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:32,021
It doesn’t fight that,

63
00:05:32,222 --> 00:05:34,476
just says, “All right, let me find my own way."

64
00:05:34,677 --> 00:05:39,653
And then he uses the same stone for holding the tree.

65
00:05:39,854 --> 00:05:43,849
So clever, he goes around the

66
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:49,216
little stone and uses that for its own purpose.

67
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:52,085
This is how a Sahaja Yogi should behave.

68
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:56,271
Not to take responsibility and put others into tension:

69
00:05:56,472 --> 00:05:58,285
 “This must be done. This is not here."

70
00:05:58,486 --> 00:06:00,565
“That is not there." It’s not necessary.

71
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:02,851
It’s your love that is important.

72
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:07,702
For which you must have heard the story of an old woman

73
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:10,341
who was living in a forest.

74
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,560
Her name was Shavari

75
00:06:12,761 --> 00:06:16,520
 and she heard that Shri Ram is going to come in the forest.

76
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:20,981
And she was so much elated, so much happy.

77
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:24,184
Such an innocent woman, she didn’t know what to do.

78
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:27,770
So when Rama came she gave Him,

79
00:06:27,997 --> 00:06:31,661
we have some kind of berry, we called as ber,

80
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,161
she gave them to Him to eat

81
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:36,700
 and she told in very great innocence

82
00:06:36,901 --> 00:06:41,442
that everyone of them I have tested to see that they are not sour.

83
00:06:41,677 --> 00:06:45,809
And she gave them to Him and he ate them so lovingly.

84
00:06:46,036 --> 00:06:49,399
So his brother was a hot-tempered fellow.

85
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,864
He got very angry. He said, “What is this? This lady has no sense.

86
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:58,265
She is giving all these things which are eaten by her, first of all."

87
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:00,126
Which we call as uttishtha

88
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:02,982
means somebody has eaten it, then you are not supposed to eat

89
00:07:03,183 --> 00:07:06,632
even your, say, your brother has eaten something,

90
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:07,851
you cannot eat that.

91
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:12,172
It’s regarded as something not good, not auspicious.

92
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:15,599
"And this lady, an old lady with her few teeth that are left,

93
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,330
she has just pierced every berry and has given to my brother."

94
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:21,413
Very furious.

95
00:07:21,614 --> 00:07:26,083
So Rama’s wife, Sita, was just smiling at the whole situation

96
00:07:26,284 --> 00:07:28,669
and then Rama gave

97
00:07:29,552 --> 00:07:36,044
 Rama gave that berry to his wife and she ate it.

98
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:40,708
She looked at her brother-in-law and She said: "See brother-in-law

99
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:43,372
“These are the best berrys I've ever eaten.

100
00:07:43,573 --> 00:07:45,507
I’ve never had such a taste before."

101
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,294
But I’m not going to give you anything."

102
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:49,677
See, the best way to challenge the ego

103
00:07:49,878 --> 00:07:52,521
 is not to say that you are not going to have it.

104
00:07:52,697 --> 00:07:54,763
He said, “Why?” “No, I won’t give you.

105
00:07:54,964 --> 00:07:57,669
You won’t have them, I will not. I will eat all of them."

106
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,235
Then He said, “No, how can you eat all of that?”

107
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:03,427
He snatched some of them and he ate and also felt the same thing.

108
00:08:03,638 --> 00:08:06,482
Because they are given out of love.

109
00:08:06,683 --> 00:08:08,724
Whatever is done out of love

110
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:11,419
is a thousand-fold better

111
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,143
 than that is done out of tension and problem.

112
00:08:14,395 --> 00:08:19,233
I should never like to cause any tension in your mind of any kind.

113
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:21,702
So for small, small things you should not worry.

114
00:08:21,903 --> 00:08:24,560
You must give up your tensions absolutely

115
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:28,997
and understand that you are the children of God.

116
00:08:29,211 --> 00:08:30,520
You are to be looked after.

117
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:34,218
You are to given everything that is available in His realm.

118
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,309
You should not get into tension at all.

119
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,591
Firstly, not to feel guilty,

120
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:41,552
 thirdly to feel that we had to go to this guru, that guru.

121
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:43,114
All right, forget it.

122
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:46,348
Forget it. Whatever has happened has happened. Forget it!

123
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:48,106
Don’t worry on that point also

124
00:08:48,307 --> 00:08:50,317
because that will tie you down all the time saying,

125
00:08:50,518 --> 00:08:52,059
 “Why did you go to that guru?

126
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,638
Why did you pay money to this fellow?”

127
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:55,994
Why did you do this?

128
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:59,473
Just tell your mind, “I am not bothered.

129
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:01,233
I am not bothered."

130
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:03,824
Whatever has happened, has happened that person is finished.

131
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:05,991
Now whatever my egg has done, now I am a bird.

132
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:07,078
I have nothing to do."

133
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,290
So be in the present, that is very important.

134
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:12,591
Be in the present, have no guilt,

135
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,552
have no worries of the past

136
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:18,882
because if you worry of the past you can never enjoy the present.

137
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:22,042
And you are here to enjoy and not to worry about the past.

138
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,254
What ever has happend, has happend, just forget it.

139
00:09:25,575 --> 00:09:27,747
I hope you understand this very well

140
00:09:27,948 --> 00:09:31,144
 and to forget whatever has happened and forgive.

141
00:09:31,345 --> 00:09:33,509
There are Sahaja Yogis with you. Enjoy life.

142
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,107
Always try to see the good points of other Sahaja Yogis

143
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:37,850
 and not the bad points.

144
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:41,138
Normally we try to find out what’s wrong with another person,

145
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,890
 especially when we know about chakras.

146
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:47,694
We just understand that this person has got these very bad chakras.

147
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:50,348
Then the only thing what to do is to give yourself a bandhan,

148
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,681
 which I will tell you, and deal with the person.

149
00:09:52,882 --> 00:09:55,122
But when you know that person has this sickness

150
00:09:55,323 --> 00:09:56,722
or this kind of a chakra caught up,

151
00:09:56,923 --> 00:09:59,351
no use arguing, no use telling them.

152
00:09:59,552 --> 00:10:01,515
Let them come up, they’ll come right.

153
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:03,202
Tell them that this is what it is.

154
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:07,612
At the most you can tell your children, you can tell your wife.

155
00:10:07,813 --> 00:10:11,568
Someone, but somebody who is not that closely connected,

156
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:14,371
 you cannot put Sahaja Yoga into their heads.

157
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,645
 You cannot force Sahaja Yoga in to them.

158
00:10:16,846 --> 00:10:20,608
Sahaja Yoga cannot be forced into anyone whatsoever.

159
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:23,188
It has to be accepted, ask for it.

160
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,794
It has its own protocol.

161
00:10:24,997 --> 00:10:29,052
It cannot be just poured into your mouth,

162
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,569
that you’d better have it, is a wrong thing.

163
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,794
There are some people who still have lots of doubts,

164
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:37,898
I know that, who are sitting here who have doubts.

165
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:39,365
These should go away.

166
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:41,960
Then because then they feel guilty, “I have doubts."

167
00:10:42,161 --> 00:10:45,187
Please get rid of those doubts if possible

168
00:10:45,388 --> 00:10:47,927
because I do not want that you should feel later on that,

169
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:49,520
 “Oh, Mother, we doubted you."

170
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:52,569
Just now better get rid of the doubts.

171
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,271
One thing that one should understand

172
00:10:54,472 --> 00:10:56,122
that Mataji has nothing to gain for us.

173
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,193
We cannot give her anything.

174
00:10:58,394 --> 00:10:59,890
We cannot give her anything.

175
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:01,989
Only we have to take from Her.

176
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,607
If you understand that then you’ll have no doubts

177
00:11:04,808 --> 00:11:06,562
 because that is one of the fears people have.

178
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:09,593
That I’m going to start having something from you.

179
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,731
So once you understand that She has nothing to take away from us,

180
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:15,085
She has to give us something.

181
00:11:15,286 --> 00:11:18,645
Supposing I say there is a diamond available here free for you,

182
00:11:18,856 --> 00:11:20,187
 will you doubt me?

183
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,942
You’ll say, “All right, let’s see if it’s a diamond or a fake, clutch it.

184
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:26,273
That’s how your attitude should be.

185
00:11:26,489 --> 00:11:29,435
So those who have doubts should know that with the doubts

186
00:11:29,636 --> 00:11:33,536
they will go very slow and they may be thrown out.

187
00:11:33,755 --> 00:11:35,874
So please don’t have any doubts.

188
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:39,077
A doubting mind is the most troublesome thing.

189
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,083
It will never allow you to enjoy your spirit.

190
00:11:43,341 --> 00:11:45,476
There is no need to doubt about it.

191
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:49,122
This is opened everything is so open,

192
00:11:49,323 --> 00:11:51,786
there is no secret about it.

193
00:11:51,997 --> 00:11:55,786
You understand that and try to imbibe

194
00:11:56,138 --> 00:11:58,505
the quality of a good Sahaja Yogi,

195
00:11:58,706 --> 00:12:01,660
of a Sahaja Yogi who is steady.

196
00:12:01,861 --> 00:12:04,841
By doubting, the steadiness will go away

197
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:09,283
and if a tree is not steady how will it imbed itself?

198
00:12:09,484 --> 00:12:12,452
It’s important that you should give up all doubts.

199
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:15,366
You are so quickly into it.

200
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:18,247
Seldom we do such a thing, too much of a thing,

201
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:21,513
I mean never done like that before. It’s an experiment.

202
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:23,726
We want to see now how it works out.

203
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:24,811
It’s really an experiment.

204
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:26,176
We have never done like this before.

205
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:28,081
It’s a very dangerous thing.

206
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:31,333
I’ve seen it that people who get into puja

207
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:34,358
then they might get little stomach pain or something,

208
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,357
or something will happen to you by which you will be cleared out,

209
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:38,624
little bit.

210
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,715
Not much but then you’ll feel much better out of that.

211
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,038
So it is a thing that has to happen.

212
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:47,233
It’s just like an operation which takes place.

213
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,193
First we used to do is the cleansing of the the people,

214
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,645
 of the chakras, this, that.

215
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:53,755
When they are cleansed and have reached a certain position

216
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:56,563
 then only they were allowed to do my puja.

217
00:12:56,764 --> 00:12:59,788
But I found that when I came first to America

218
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:02,000
I did not talk about puja at all.

219
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,724
I talked about the abstract things.

220
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:05,685
I didn’t want to say about these things.

221
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:09,021
We did not do any puja, we did not establish Shri Ganesha,

222
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,473
nothing of the kind.

223
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:14,042
And as a result of that people who came to me got lost.

224
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:16,458
I didn’t tell them how to keep their health all right

225
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:17,616
 or about anything.

226
00:13:17,817 --> 00:13:19,200
It was just such a short time and

227
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:21,710
the whole thing was a bad response from people

228
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:24,271
 that I thought it better to leave it now.

229
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:26,833
But now time has come for all of you

230
00:13:27,034 --> 00:13:29,454
 to have it in a big way because you are all seekers

231
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:31,809
and we cannot delay it anymore.

232
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:34,683
So come to me without any doubt.

233
00:13:34,884 --> 00:13:36,716
If you have doubts it’s better that you go away.

234
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,781
It will be better idea for me and for you also.

235
00:13:39,982 --> 00:13:42,463
When you’re doubts are removed then you come for the puja.

236
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:46,997
Don’t sit here with your doubts, otherwise I will have a headache.

237
00:13:47,302 --> 00:13:50,403
Apart from that you will have a headache.

238
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,817
So sit in a very cheerful mood, in a receptive mood

239
00:13:55,018 --> 00:13:57,770
 and see for yourself what happens to you.

240
00:13:58,053 --> 00:14:00,315
May God bless you.

241
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:06,420
Did you tell them what we are going to do or should I tell?

242
00:14:07,537 --> 00:14:11,068
First we are going to do Shri Ganesha's puja.

243
00:14:11,553 --> 00:14:16,045
Now Shri ganesha's puja is done

244
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:21,107
by washing My feet.

245
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:26,076
Everybody is not going to wash, I wish everybody could do

246
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:29,521
because with that your hands open out very much better.

247
00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:31,563
Everybody who came in San Francisco

248
00:14:31,764 --> 00:14:34,029
washed my feet, felt it very well.

249
00:14:34,295 --> 00:14:36,811
But we have to have some selection of people

250
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:38,977
 who we seen are all right,

251
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,240
they are going to do the worship.

252
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,397
But the rest of them, I told them

253
00:14:43,598 --> 00:14:46,521
this water, which is vibrated, you should put it on your head

254
00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:48,472
to baptise yourself only.

255
00:14:48,673 --> 00:14:50,360
But nobody should touch that water.

256
00:14:50,576 --> 00:14:53,864
When that water is washed out when you are taken the thing

257
00:14:54,073 --> 00:14:56,561
just with the spoon you can put it on the head

258
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,889
and then with your hand you can rub it.

259
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,388
But, I thing best thing will be to put it on the head a little bit

260
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:05,912
and then first in the hand clean it

261
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,451
and then when you put it on the head you can rub it.

262
00:15:09,652 --> 00:15:11,732
Because your hands will show all the vibrations means

263
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:15,313
using or spoiled or if there is any defect.

264
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,451
The best is first to wash your hands and the put it on the head

265
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:20,076
so that it is cleaned out.

266
00:15:20,341 --> 00:15:23,006
We are thinking as a precaution because

267
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:27,037
is a very fast thing we are doing

268
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:28,638
so we are taking a precaution.

269
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:31,092
Because is a very fast movement.

270
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:34,724
And we have to be fast now, so we have started this thing,

271
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:38,295
we may loose some of you, I know that, but doesn't matter.

272
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:41,842
Some can be lost but many can be brought up.

273
00:15:42,043 --> 00:15:43,694
So, it's a big operation

274
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:47,271
 which I hope carefully done may work out wanders.

275
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:49,850
So be careful. And now don't start thinking

276
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:51,810
that I may be one of them who'll be lost.

277
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:54,196
There are people who are thinking like that

278
00:16:01,673 --> 00:16:04,774
Also created doubts in your mind about yourself.

279
00:16:04,975 --> 00:16:06,115
That's the main point of it,

280
00:16:06,316 --> 00:16:09,255
if you have doubts about yourself you will have problems.

281
00:16:09,456 --> 00:16:13,117
Don't have doubts about yourself also, that's very important.

282
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:15,484
Because if you have doubts about yourself

283
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:17,933
then nothing can be worked out.

284
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:21,545
So the first thing is the Ganesha.

285
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:23,609
Ganesha is the innocence in you

286
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:27,710
which is very important to be awaken in America. Is very important.

287
00:16:28,374 --> 00:16:31,984
So the first we are going to do is the Ganesha's puja.

288
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,468
Innocence.

289
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:37,406
And Ganesha incarnated on this earth as Christ,

290
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:39,882
which can be proved also through Kundalini awakening,

291
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,528
 we can prove it

292
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:46,695
Once that happens to you, that your innocence is awaken

293
00:16:46,895 --> 00:16:50,484
when your innocence is waken you will be happy to know

294
00:16:50,685 --> 00:16:54,062
that most of your diseases that come

295
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,535
from the spoiling of this chakra specialy

296
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:03,608
of so many diseases that are like that

297
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:07,118
all these bad diseases are [check].

298
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:11,407
Ganesha is the greatest power because it is innocent.

299
00:17:11,608 --> 00:17:15,522
And the innocentce if it is awaken within you

300
00:17:15,723 --> 00:17:17,796
you become a very powerfull person

301
00:17:18,012 --> 00:17:22,866
and most of the diseases are sort of cured

302
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:24,920
which are connected with this chakra.

303
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:26,640
But today is not the time to tell you

304
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:29,546
about what the diseases are and how they are checked and all that

305
00:17:29,746 --> 00:17:32,211
but all the combinations and permutations

306
00:17:32,412 --> 00:17:34,390
of this chakra with other chakras

307
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:40,689
which gives you horrible diseases, incurrable diseases, can be checked

308
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:44,185
and then how to completely cure them,

309
00:17:44,386 --> 00:17:47,435
for that you have to know the combination of this.

310
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:50,853
When you know the combinations of this then you can check them all

311
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:52,466
completely to get it cured.

312
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:54,435
But at lest they do not advance anymore,

313
00:17:54,636 --> 00:17:56,826
whenever they are they completely undercheck

314
00:17:57,027 --> 00:17:58,497
and gradualy they go down.

315
00:17:58,698 --> 00:17:59,787
But to expedite it

316
00:17:59,988 --> 00:18:02,864
you have to understand the complete combinations of centers.

317
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:07,450
The chakras, their combinations then what mantras to be said

318
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:10,693
how to operate it and everything if you learn

319
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:12,122
 it takes hardly any time.

320
00:18:12,323 --> 00:18:15,435
Luckily they have ofered us another time

321
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,654
[display it] in the end of october, what is the date.

322
00:18:18,855 --> 00:18:26,075
12 st of october here the people who run the camp like us

323
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,435
and they work with the camp because actualy the camp is closed

324
00:18:29,636 --> 00:18:31,658
 until they considering close it completely.

325
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:34,238
They were oposite place, if we wish another seminar

326
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:38,856
for the weekend and the 21 st will be an opening date

327
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:40,756
so if anyone is realy interested

328
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:43,122
let me know before we leave here today,

329
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:49,263
so I can tell to the owner of the camp that that will be ok.

330
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:54,435
That will be a good idea, that will be aditional help to you

331
00:18:54,636 --> 00:18:57,253
and there will be people will tell you about this

332
00:18:57,454 --> 00:18:59,917
because they are all here till one month at least

333
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:02,026
so we can work it out that way.

334
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:06,239
And then Santa Cruz program we have canceled for the time being,

335
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,690
because the response in Santa Cruz itself has been very very poor.

336
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:13,870
People come for a month or so then they dissapear

337
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,941
you see, they are very swifty people,

338
00:19:16,142 --> 00:19:19,487
they take again back to drugs, the have no will power left in them.

339
00:19:19,697 --> 00:19:22,081
Those people who are settled in Santa Cruz

340
00:19:22,282 --> 00:19:24,042
they're very few people who have that will power.

341
00:19:24,243 --> 00:19:28,261
They've become like old people who have no will power in them left

342
00:19:28,597 --> 00:19:30,964
to stand up to the truth and

343
00:19:31,165 --> 00:19:34,972
that's how they've shown no results of improvement.

344
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:36,772
And this is the only place I think

345
00:19:36,973 --> 00:19:39,312
 where we have that way receided back

346
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:40,812
and we have to receide

347
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,488
like the root had to receide at certain places.

348
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:48,704
Then later on, when San Francisco develop into a good center

349
00:19:48,905 --> 00:19:51,218
people also from Santa Cruz can go there

350
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,679
because they like to travel. If you make them travel,

351
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,608
make the suffer a little, they like it.

352
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:02,288
If you tell them it's all here just now you sitting down

353
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:04,718
you'll get it, they say o, that's too much.

354
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,765
That's the nature of american people,

355
00:20:07,966 --> 00:20:11,128
you see, they want to travel, have some adventure something

356
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:13,046
and they want to do like that.

357
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:18,168
It's all right, let them travel to San Francisco and suffer a little

358
00:20:18,348 --> 00:20:20,562
and then get there till settle down.

359
00:20:20,763 --> 00:20:24,314
Whatever it is San Francisco is going to be a very powerfull center.

360
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:28,061
And people from Santa Cruz can go there and work it out.

361
00:20:28,262 --> 00:20:30,476
I think if they can go there,

362
00:20:30,677 --> 00:20:32,953
then they may develop that earnesness

363
00:20:33,154 --> 00:20:35,656
to develop it and to settle down.

364
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:41,783
So the responsibility is very great on all of you who have come here.

365
00:20:42,335 --> 00:20:48,099
You all represent here the fundation of Sahaja Yoga in america.

366
00:20:48,662 --> 00:20:52,913
You are the one who will be held responsible for the emancipation

367
00:20:53,538 --> 00:20:57,690
 of this court specialy.

368
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:04,271
That so many, I think at least 60% of the seekers

369
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:08,275
are born in this part of the country

370
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:12,674
and are there, till 60% of the seekers are here.

371
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:16,538
Some of them are lost because they have gone in a very wrong way,

372
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:19,612
 head lock, but you can save them.

373
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:26,046
You can first off all, establish people who are perfectly all right

374
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:28,578
then there are someone little bit spoiled,

375
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:31,827
then there are some people who can be brought in.

376
00:21:32,028 --> 00:21:35,757
But those people who are absoultely wrong cases

377
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,874
you should no worry just now about them.

378
00:21:38,075 --> 00:21:41,007
You build up all such people together

379
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,555
and then it will be grater for you

380
00:21:43,756 --> 00:21:46,780
to pull out all such people who have no will power.

381
00:21:46,981 --> 00:21:50,038
Because you can give the the will to come out of their problems.

382
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:53,585
We have to save all of them,

383
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:55,975
try to save all of them.

384
00:21:56,202 --> 00:21:59,499
It is better that you do it in such a way

385
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,491
that you first build up your strenght

386
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,972
and then you try to pull them out.

387
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,218
And we can do it.

388
00:22:07,538 --> 00:22:10,475
I am very happy to see so many people here.

389
00:22:10,858 --> 00:22:13,186
I've great hopes now from America.

390
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:16,109
And I'm sure you can save this great country

391
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,711
by which can save the whole humanity.

392
00:22:19,843 --> 00:22:22,078
This is such a great news for all the sahaja yogis

393
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,225
all over the world. They are so anctious.

394
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,858
People have come from India, have come from Australia,

395
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:29,647
have come from Europe.

396
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,303
They've come from all over the world,

397
00:22:32,504 --> 00:22:35,548
from England, and every place they are here

398
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:39,398
just to pull out some americans out

399
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,804
so that then they'll start doing their job.

400
00:22:42,005 --> 00:22:45,210
Next time we have to export americans.

401
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:53,194
May God bless you! May God bless you!

402
00:22:58,468 --> 00:23:03,282
I wanted to say that one thing one should avoid during puja

403
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:06,235
or otherwise also is shalowness.

404
00:23:06,436 --> 00:23:08,843
You should not get puja on a shalow bussiness.

405
00:23:09,044 --> 00:23:11,414
Because it works out in a very subtler way.

406
00:23:11,615 --> 00:23:14,163
So shallowness must be avoided in Sahaja Yoga!

407
00:23:14,364 --> 00:23:18,392
Shallowness or all the time saying that

408
00:23:18,593 --> 00:23:20,593
we are new to this , we are new to that.

409
00:23:20,794 --> 00:23:22,804
There is nothing new because everything is within you.

410
00:23:23,005 --> 00:23:26,202
It's can be activated. There's nothing new, it's all within you.

411
00:23:26,403 --> 00:23:29,429
As any indian is, you are, there's no difference whatsoever.

412
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,960
Only thing they have a little advanced that they can understand me

413
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,903
faster than you can because they have the education.

414
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:38,946
But as far as the mechanism is concerned, you are just the same.

415
00:23:39,192 --> 00:23:41,997
Don't have the idea that you are a new nation

416
00:23:42,198 --> 00:23:44,606
and all this thing have no meaning at all

417
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:48,363
You are ancient people oer seekers of antiquities.

418
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,966
Just don't worry about these things that you are a new nation.

419
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:53,449
You were given this nation

420
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,563
because you did such good in your last life.

421
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:59,074
May God bless you!
