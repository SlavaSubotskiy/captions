1
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:58,419
When you are all meditating and inside I also
find it difficult to be outside.

2
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:09,879
So today you have arranged to have this puja
here.

3
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:19,429
Just before that you have to prepare yourself
physically and mentally.

4
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:28,109
Physically you must give yourself a bandhan
and a bandhan is nothing but you give yourself

5
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:31,369
a protection to your aura.

6
00:02:31,369 --> 00:02:38,559
How you do it is very simple which I will
tell you just now how to do it and then you

7
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:44,589
sit down for your puja.

8
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:47,959
Then mentally you have to put yourself right.

9
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,119
First of all, you should not feel guilty at
all.

10
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:57,639
If you are guilty you cannot do my puja.

11
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:01,339
You should be absolutely above that.

12
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:05,519
There should be no tension in your mind.

13
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,209
You are not guilty, you are in the present.

14
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:11,699
Like flowers you are looking.

15
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:13,578
How can flowers be guilty?

16
00:03:13,578 --> 00:03:16,148
First get out of that guilt business.

17
00:03:16,148 --> 00:03:19,519
You should not feel guilty or tense.

18
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,389
Everything that is done is the best.

19
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:23,069
You shouldn’t worry about it.

20
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:27,309
It’s not your responsibility even to arrange
it.

21
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:29,369
Just think that everything is done sahaj.

22
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:36,929
Gradually when you’ll move in Sahaja Yoga
you’ll be surprised to see how things are

23
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:39,109
arranged just beautifully.

24
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:46,949
When these people were looking for a place
there was no place for less than $250 each.

25
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:51,339
They said this is too much for everybody’s
pocket.

26
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:55,569
Then suddenly, spontaneously they found this
place.

27
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,459
When they said $50 nobody could believe.

28
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:04,389
They thought that we’ll just get some porridge
in the morning and the rest of it will be

29
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:05,389
fasting.

30
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:06,849
So many were rather worried.

31
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:12,259
Some thought it was a scout camping ground
or whatever it is and quite worried when it

32
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:13,509
starts raining.

33
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:19,170
But this is all God’s grace to get such
a place, such a comfortable place for you.

34
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:24,307
You come here and everything is arranged by
God’s grace.

35
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:28,260
So first we have to remember that it is all arrange through God's grace

36
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:32,791
If something is not arranged just forget it,
just leave it, just don’t worry.

37
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,076
That’s the best way,

38
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,208
you have to live

39
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:42,488
Then what happens is that you become one with
the present and you can overcome all your

40
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:44,299
problems of tension.

41
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:49,569
Tension mounts up when we want to do that
which you are not supposed to do, with which

42
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:51,533
we are not successful.

43
00:04:51,612 --> 00:04:57,069
There is also a mental barrier between ourselves
and our mind that we want to do a particular

44
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:58,419
thing in a particular way.

45
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:06,599
If you can give up that, then you will be
surprised that you become absolutely one with

46
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:11,819
the Divine and you start working it out in
a very beautiful manner.

47
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:15,859
Now see the root of a little seed.

48
00:05:15,859 --> 00:05:19,988
It just sprouts, it goes this way.

49
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:25,108
If it finds there is an obstruction, there
is some sort of a stone or something, it goes

50
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:26,108
around it.

51
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:30,149
Then it finds another obstruction, it goes
away from it.

52
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:34,109
It doesn’t fight that but just says, “All
right, let me find my own way."

53
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:39,749
Then he uses the same stone for holding the
tree.

54
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:48,739
So clever, he goes around the little stone
and uses that for its own purpose.

55
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:52,069
This is how a Sahaja Yogi should behave.

56
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:57,420
Not to take responsibility and put others
into tension: “This must be done."

57
00:05:57,445 --> 00:05:58,381
“This is not here."

58
00:05:58,406 --> 00:05:59,636
“That is not there."

59
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:00,661
It’s not necessary.

60
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:02,902
It’s your love that is important.

61
00:06:03,037 --> 00:06:09,729
For which you must have heard the story of
an old woman who was living in a forest.

62
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:16,969
Her name was Shavari and she heard that Shri
Ram was going to come in the forest.

63
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:19,426
And she was so much

64
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:20,068
elated,

65
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:21,408
so much happy.

66
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:24,489
Such an innocent woman, she didn’t know
what to do.

67
00:06:24,489 --> 00:06:30,707
When Rama came she gave Him, we have some kind of berry, we called as ber, to eat and she told in very

68
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:35,504
we called as ber, she gave them to Him
to eat and she told in very

69
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:41,639
great innocence that everyone of them I have
tested to see that they are not sour.

70
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,148
And she gave them to Him and he ate them so lovingly.

71
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:49,495
So his brother was a hot-tempered fellow.

72
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,798
He got very angry.

73
00:06:50,823 --> 00:06:52,014
He said, “What is this?

74
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:53,225
This lady has no sense.

75
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:58,328
She is giving all these things which are eaten
by her, first of all."

76
00:06:58,328 --> 00:07:00,222
It’s what we call as uttishtha

77
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:03,255
means that somebody else has eaten, then you are not supposed to eat

78
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,217
even your say, your brother has

79
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:07,739
eaten something, you cannot eat that.

80
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:12,444
It’s regarded as something not good,
not auspicious.

81
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:16,629
“And this lady, an old lady with her few
teeth that are left, she has just pierced

82
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:19,426
every ber and has given to my brother."

83
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,257
very furious.

84
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:31,349
So Rama’s wife, Sita, was just smiling at the
whole situation and then Rama gave that ber

85
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:36,220
to his wife and she ate it.

86
00:07:36,245 --> 00:07:41,403
She looked at her brother-in-law and She said,
see brother-in-law

87
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:45,779
“These are the best bers I have ever eaten.
I’ve never had such a taste before."

88
00:07:45,804 --> 00:07:47,390
But I’m not going to give you anything."

89
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:52,617
See, the best way to challenge the ego is
not to say that you are not going to have it.

90
00:07:52,793 --> 00:07:53,784
He said, “Why?”

91
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:55,339
She said, “No, I won’t give you.

92
00:07:55,364 --> 00:07:56,921
You won’t have them, I will not.

93
00:07:56,946 --> 00:07:58,078
I will eat all of them."

94
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,331
Then He said, “No, how can you eat all of that?”

95
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:03,856
He snatched some of them and he ate and also
felt the same thing.

96
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:06,754
Because they are given out of love.

97
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:13,019
Whatever is done out of love is a thousand-fold
better than that is done out of tension and

98
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:14,239
problem.

99
00:08:14,264 --> 00:08:19,499
I should never like to cause any tension in
your mind of any kind.

100
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,659
So for small, small things you should not worry.

101
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:28,409
You must give up your tensions absolutely
and understand that you are the children of

102
00:08:28,434 --> 00:08:29,229
God.

103
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:30,616
You are to be looked after.

104
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:34,361
You are to given everything that is available
in His realm.

105
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:36,759
You should not get into tension at all.

106
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:42,263
Firstly, not to feel guilty, thirdly to feel
that we had to go to this guru, that guru?

107
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,772
All right, forget it.

108
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:44,565
Forget it.

109
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,914
Whatever has happened has happened.

110
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:46,644
Forget it!

111
00:08:46,645 --> 00:08:50,859
Don’t worry on that point also because that
will tie you down all the time saying, “Why

112
00:08:50,884 --> 00:08:52,438
did you go to that guru?

113
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:54,987
Why did you pay money to this fellow?”

114
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:56,090
Why did you do this?

115
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:59,857
Just tell your mind, “I am not bothered.

116
00:08:59,882 --> 00:09:01,123
I am not bothered."

117
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:03,920
Whatever has happened, has happened
that person is finished.

118
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:06,087
Now whatever my egg has done, now I am a bird.

119
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,174
I have nothing to do."

120
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:09,562
So be in the present, that is very important.

121
00:09:09,587 --> 00:09:10,578
Be in the present,

122
00:09:10,603 --> 00:09:17,356
have no guilt, have no worries of the past
because if you worry of the past you can never

123
00:09:17,381 --> 00:09:19,009
enjoy the present.

124
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:22,138
You are here to enjoy and not to worry about
the past.

125
00:09:22,173 --> 00:09:25,214
What ever has happend, has happend,
just forget it.

126
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:31,416
I hope you understand this very well and to
forget whatever has happened and forgive.

127
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:32,559
There are Sahaja Yogis with you.

128
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,781
Enjoy life.

129
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:38,122
Always try to see the good points of other
Sahaja Yogis and not the bad points.

130
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:42,589
Normally we try to find out what’s wrong
with another person, especially when we know

131
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:43,589
about chakras.

132
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:47,578
We just understand that this person has got
these very bad chakras.

133
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:50,689
Then the only thing what to do is to give
yourself a bandhan, which I will tell you,

134
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:52,953
and deal with the person.

135
00:09:52,978 --> 00:09:56,818
But when you know that person has this sickness
or this kind of a chakra caught up, no use

136
00:09:56,818 --> 00:09:59,338
arguing, no use telling them.

137
00:09:59,338 --> 00:10:01,189
Let them come up, they’ll come right.

138
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:03,008
Tell them that this is what it is.

139
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:07,909
At the most you can tell your children, you
can tell your wife.

140
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:14,643
But somebody who is not [UNCLEAR] connected,
you cannot put Sahaja Yoga into their heads.

141
00:10:14,668 --> 00:10:16,917
 You cannot be forced Sahaja Yoga in to them

142
00:10:16,942 --> 00:10:20,356
Sahaja Yoga cannot be forced into anyone whatsoever.

143
00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:23,284
It has to be accepted, ask for it.

144
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:24,299
It has its own protocol.

145
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:31,109
It cannot be just poured into your mouth,
that you’d better have it, is a wrong thing.

146
00:10:31,109 --> 00:10:37,107
There are some people who still have lots
of doubts, I know that, who are sitting here

147
00:10:37,131 --> 00:10:37,994
who have doubts.

148
00:10:37,995 --> 00:10:39,416
These should go away.

149
00:10:39,662 --> 00:10:41,894
Because then they feel guilty, “I have doubts."

150
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:47,193
Please get rid of those doubts if possible
because I do not want that you should feel

151
00:10:47,218 --> 00:10:49,616
later on that, “Oh, Mother, we doubted you."

152
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:52,219
Just now better get rid of the doubts.

153
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:56,304
One thing that one should understand that
Mataji has nothing to gain from us.

154
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:58,289
We cannot give her anything.

155
00:10:58,313 --> 00:10:59,768
We cannot give her anything.

156
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:02,085
Only we have to take from Her.

157
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,202
If you understand that then you’ll have
no doubts because that is one of the fears

158
00:11:06,227 --> 00:11:09,389
people have. That I’m going to start
having something from you.

159
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:15,039
So once you understand that she has nothing
to take away from us, she has to give us something.

160
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:20,095
Supposing I say there is a diamond available
here free for you, will you doubt me?

161
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,738
You’ll say, “All right, let’s see if
it’s a diamond or a {UNCLEAR].

162
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:26,369
That’s how your attitude should be.

163
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:31,559
Those who have doubts should know that those
who have doubts will go very slow and they

164
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,319
may be thrown out.

165
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:35,875
So please don’t have any doubts.

166
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,662
A doubting mind is the most troubling thing.

167
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:42,594
It will never allow you to enjoy your spirit.

168
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,671
There is no need to doubt about it.

169
00:11:45,695 --> 00:11:47,075
This is opening,

170
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,549
everything is so open, there is no secret
about it.

171
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:59,598
You understand that and try to imbibe the
quality of a good Sahaja Yogi, of a Sahaja

172
00:11:59,623 --> 00:12:01,932
Yogi who is steady.

173
00:12:01,957 --> 00:12:08,379
By doubting, the steadiness will go away and
if a tree is not steady how will it imbed

174
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:09,379
itself?

175
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:12,422
It’s important that you should give up all
doubts.

176
00:12:12,447 --> 00:12:15,292
You are so quickly into it.

177
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:20,147
Seldom we do such a thing, too much of a thing,
we never have done like that before.

178
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,498
It’s an experiment.

179
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,822
We want to see now how it works out.

180
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:24,907
It’s really an experiment.

181
00:12:24,932 --> 00:12:26,272
We have never done like this before.

182
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:28,353
It’s a very dangerous thing.

183
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:33,041
I’ve seen it that people who get into puja
then they might get little stomach pain or

184
00:12:33,065 --> 00:12:34,454
or something,

185
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:38,469
something will happen to you by which you
get cleared out, little bit.

186
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:41,811
Not much but then you’ll feel much better
out of that.

187
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:44,090
So it is a thing that has to happen.

188
00:12:44,115 --> 00:12:47,329
It’s just like an operation which takes
place.

189
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:51,985
First we used to do is the cleansing of the
the people, of the chakras, this, that

190
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,164
When they are cleansed and have reached a
certain position then only they were allowed

191
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:56,659
to do my puja.

192
00:12:56,684 --> 00:13:01,994
But I found that when I came first to America
I did not talk about puja at all.

193
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:03,820
I talked about abstract things.

194
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:05,781
I didn’t want to say about these things.

195
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:11,050
We did not do any puja, we did not establish
Shri Ganesha, nothing of the kind, and as

196
00:13:11,075 --> 00:13:14,138
a result of that people who came to me got
lost.

197
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,585
I didn’t tell them how to keep their health
all right or about anything.

198
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,559
It was just such a short time and the whole
thing was a bad response from people that

199
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:24,367
I thought it better to leave it now.

200
00:13:24,392 --> 00:13:29,684
But now time has come for all of you to have
it in a big way because you are all seekers

201
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,759
and we cannot delay it anymore.

202
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:34,779
So come to me without any doubt.

203
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:36,988
If you have doubts it’s better that you
go away.

204
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:39,877
It’d be a better idea for me and for you
also.

205
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,735
When you’re doubts are removed then you
come for the puja.

206
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,669
Don’t sit here with your doubts, otherwise
I will have a headache.

207
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:49,509
Apart from that you will have a headache.

208
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:56,149
So sit in a very cheerful mood, in a receptive
mood and see for yourself what happens to

209
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:58,028
you.

210
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:00,411
May God bless you.
