1
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,792
Today we have assembled here to do the puja

2
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,625
of the Mother Earth.

3
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,750
We call it as the Bhoomi Puja, Shri Dhara Puja.

4
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,625
She’s called as Dhara.

5
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:45,750
As you know, “dha” means “sustain.”

6
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:52,083
Ra-dha – the one who sustains the energy is Radha.

7
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,125
And Dhara, which is

8
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:04,375
the one which is sustenance itself,

9
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:09,875
She sustains us.

10
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,125
On Her we live.

11
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,458
As you know,

12
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:27,542
this Mother Earth is revolving with a tremendous speed,

13
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:31,959
and but for Her gravity

14
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:36,417
we would not have existed here.

15
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,000
Apart from that,

16
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:44,291
there is so much atmospheric pressure on Her.

17
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:57,583
She understands, thinks, coordinates, and creates.

18
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:07,542
This only you can find out when you are a realized soul.

19
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,125
You have seen how She sucks in your negativity

20
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,083
when you are standing on Her – bare feet,

21
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:17,542
respecting Her,

22
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:20,834
requesting Her to suck your negativity,

23
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:27,834
with a light in front of you,

24
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,917
in front of My photograph.

25
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:38,000
She knows Me,

26
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,959
because She’s My Mother.

27
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,875
She’s your Grandmother, we can say;

28
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,875
that’s why She nourishes you, She looks after you.

29
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:59,542
Early in the morning when we get up,

30
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,208
when we put our foot on Her we have to say,

31
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:07,333
“Oh Mother, please forgive us

32
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:10,667
we are touching You with our feet.”

33
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,125
But doesn’t matter, children can touch the mother with

34
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:20,959
the feet or with the hands – makes no difference.

35
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:29,834
But She is the creator of the body of Shri Ganesh.

36
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:33,917
She’s the one who is represented within us

37
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:36,917
as the Kundalini.

38
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:44,291
She Herself moves in a spiral round the sun.

39
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,667
The sun also moves up and down,

40
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:53,333
and She moves around the sun in a spiral;

41
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,667
but because both are relatively moving,

42
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:02,000
you don’t see the movement of the sun.

43
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:12,041
The relationship between the Mother Earth and all other

44
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,500
stars, planets, and constellations

45
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:23,667
are kept constant, unvariable with great care.

46
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,417
When we talk of materialism,

47
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:38,792
we are acting against our Mother Earth.

48
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:47,000
Instead of learning from Her subtler qualities,

49
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,625
we are trying to exploit Her, to dig her out,

50
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:55,250
to use Her for our selfish motives.

51
00:10:56,999 --> 00:11:00,083
What does She do to us?

52
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:04,667
She creates these beautiful fruits for you to eat.

53
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,542
She creates beautiful trees for you to make furniture,

54
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:10,917
to make nice houses.

55
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:15,959
She gives you green grass to soothe your nerves.

56
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:24,166
She carries so many rivers and so many huge big oceans

57
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,375
on Her being.

58
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:31,834
She’s always larger than the largest of oceans.

59
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,500
Such a great thing as She is,

60
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:41,291
what do we do to Her is to exploit Her fully,

61
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,417
indiscriminately.

62
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:47,125
Then the reactions are set in.

63
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,041
The beautiful cycle of nature is broken

64
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,750
by our aggressive attitude,

65
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:56,959
and absolutely indiscreet.

66
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:02,875
Then this Mother Earth doesn’t do anything as such

67
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,333
Herself, not much;

68
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:10,000
but then the ether starts acting,

69
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:16,000
and you have problems, what we call as acid rains,

70
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,000
plastic, all kinds of problems that come out of this

71
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,583
indiscreet creation.

72
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:28,291
When we started making machinery,

73
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,500
without any balance

74
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,917
we started producing machinery,

75
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,959
just like mad.

76
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:40,291
As a result of that,

77
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,625
now we have become slaves of machines.

78
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,291
We can’t do anything with our own hands.

79
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:52,166
Because of machines, people have become unemployed.

80
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:56,208
As I’ve said many a times that machines are for us,

81
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,792
we are not for the machines.

82
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,667
But today the situation is very different.

83
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,709
We are entirely into the hands of machines –

84
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,375
again the same indiscreet behavior,

85
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,458
again the same imbalances.

86
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:16,583
Mother Earth teaches us balance.

87
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,875
If She was not in a balance,

88
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,500
we would have been all finished.

89
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,999
She teaches us gravity.

90
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:30,917
She teaches us how to be attractive to another person

91
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:35,083
without the other person knowing about it,

92
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:38,417
feeling about it.

93
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:46,041
Without enslaving, without mesmerizing,

94
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:54,166
without obliging, to attract and to give

95
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,250
without expectations.

96
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,709
Without any expectations She gives us;

97
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,834
whether we respect Her not,

98
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,917
whether we’ll treat Her not,

99
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,333
we give Her.

100
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:12,959
But when She gets very upset, like as in –

101
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:19,959
you have heard that in Mexico She erupted out.

102
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,542
You know what was happening in Mexico,

103
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:23,291
I was telling you long time back,

104
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:27,208
that they are using all kinds of black magic,

105
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:31,333
they are producing all kinds of drugs.

106
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,542
Colombia is doing the same.

107
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,458
And if you do all these things to harm people,

108
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:45,083
then She gets into volcanic conditions,

109
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:49,709
and then a volcano starts bursting out.

110
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:56,959
As you know, Los Angeles and all these places

111
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,250
on the western coast of America

112
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:03,125
are still in the danger of volcanoes.

113
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,999
All kinds of gurus have gone and settled there,

114
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,999
all kinds of black magic is on.

115
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,375
There is witchcraft which is officially recognized.

116
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,792
Officially they are registered.

117
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:17,125
Nobody minds doing anything,

118
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,417
because they say you have human freedom

119
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,875
to do all kinds of devilish things.

120
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:26,083
Under the name of human freedom they are doing

121
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:27,959
all kinds of horrible things.

122
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,083
As a result of that, Mother takes the respite.

123
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,333
It is always a collective respite.

124
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:38,291
It is always a collective respite, please remember this.

125
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:44,000
But when Sita wanted to leave Shri Rama,

126
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:48,125
She opened Herself and took Her inside Herself.

127
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:51,208
That is a reception of the Mother,

128
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,792
that is not the destruction or eruption.

129
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,709
But the eruption harms collectively, and sometimes

130
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,417
some innocent people are also killed in that.

131
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:14,083
Death does not exist, in the divine language.

132
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,166
Those who are dead can be reborn.

133
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:22,417
But death sometimes could be used for punishing people,

134
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:30,917
for destroying them, for taking them away from the scene.

135
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,500
That’s what the Mother Earth does.

136
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:43,125
Sometimes Her anger can be so great that pin-pointedly

137
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,083
She can destroy

138
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:50,083
thousands and thousands of miles of earth,

139
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:56,375
destroying many people who have been extremely

140
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,500
irreligious and uncollective.

141
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,750
In Sahaja Yoga also,

142
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,041
those people who are uncollective,

143
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:09,166
try to be uncollective, are harmed by Her;

144
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:13,458
but in a very secretive way

145
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,625
which they must understand,

146
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,291
or we should say, in a very subtle way.

147
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,875
When Sahaja yogis become uncollective, saying,

148
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,999
“This is my house, my home, this is my privacy.

149
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:34,041
This is my wife, my child, my things.

150
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:38,792
I cannot come to puja because I have got this problem.

151
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,458
I cannot do this work for Sahaja Yoga because I’ve got

152
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,959
that problem” – when they become uncollective,

153
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,709
then in a very subtle way this Mother Earth,

154
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:54,375
which is represented within us as the Kundalini,

155
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:57,125
gets upset.

156
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:03,166
And when She gets upset, She starts acting in a manner

157
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:09,208
which can be very dangerous for people.

158
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:14,999
Possessiveness is not the quality of Mother Earth,

159
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:17,875
She doesn’t possess anyone.

160
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,999
For example, if you are an Indian

161
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,875
you can come to England, you can go anywhere,

162
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,500
you can live anywhere.

163
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:27,834
She doesn’t possess anyone as such;

164
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:32,834
we only the human beings have made this world into

165
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,166
different countries, different places –

166
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,000
all our own ideas of stupidity.

167
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,041
There’s only one world,

168
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:45,041
there’s only one world God has created.

169
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,625
He has not created …

170
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:51,333
It’s rather awkward here. Allright now better.

171
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:13,333
She has not created all these nations.

172
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,625
Only there are ravines

173
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:22,333
through which big rivers flow.

174
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:26,208
Sometimes, wherever She has raised Herself,

175
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,375
there are mountains.

176
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:34,041
These are Her different dulations and different varieties,

177
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,375
just to create beauty.

178
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,834
Supposing the whole world was like a bald-headed

179
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:44,709
gentleman, what would have happened to us?

180
00:19:44,709 --> 00:19:49,750
First of all, we all would have slipped out, I think!

181
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,542
Or else, what would have happened

182
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:58,417
if it was nothing but just all over the forest,

183
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,625
or all over only the mountains,

184
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:04,792
or all over just the rivers?

185
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:13,500
To create the beauty She has used all these things

186
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:20,999
to make us happy, to give us joy, to entertain us.

187
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,792
She created all this beautiful stage for us.

188
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,875
And what do we do?

189
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,999
We have divided Her into parts,

190
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,917
that this is my country,

191
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:38,125
this is your country, this is their country.

192
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,458
When we die, what is our country?

193
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,875
We are all dead bodies,

194
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,542
whether you are buried in a church or in the open,

195
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:54,083
you are all in the Mother Earth.

196
00:20:54,417 --> 00:21:00,000
What is our country is that we are the Mother Earth.

197
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:03,667
So we have to understand that this body is made

198
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,709
out of that Mother Earth to which it has to go,

199
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,125
and we are stupid to feel that we belong to this country

200
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,250
or to that country.

201
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,999
Of course, this is the greatest miracle of the maya,

202
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,542
that people know this

203
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,667
but still they do not want to believe it.

204
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,917
There are so many truths they know:

205
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,542
they are sure, they know about it,

206
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:28,000
but they don’t want to believe it.

207
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,333
Or they believe it, but they don’t want to accept it.

208
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:32,959
And even if they accept it,

209
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,000
they don’t want to know about it.

210
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:40,583
It’s a funny human miracle that they know

211
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,333
that nothing belongs to us.

212
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:46,667
When we come on this Earth our hands are like this;

213
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:50,083
when we go, everything is like this.

214
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,500
Despite that, despite this understanding

215
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:58,125
we still play games with ourselves, cheat ourselves,

216
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,625
and try to believe that I am this country,

217
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:05,834
I am that country, I am so great, and so that.

218
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:10,709
But human beings were born in certain countries

219
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,792
earlier than in other countries.

220
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,000
That has definitely made difference to the tradition and

221
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,917
understanding of life, that is human life.

222
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,291
Earth remains the same, but this changes.

223
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,959
The climate may be different,

224
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:32,166
that’s why the fruits may be different.

225
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,500
It’s all an adjustment.

226
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:38,208
In the whole plan there is such a good adjustment,

227
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:42,333
no quarrel, no problem; it’s just a variety again.

228
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:46,208
Supposing all bananas are produced all over the world,

229
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:47,625
who would care for them?

230
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,417
For example, if you give bananas to Indians,

231
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:54,083
they will laugh at it. But if you give them apples,

232
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:58,333
they’ll say, “Oh, apples, wait!”

233
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:01,125
The other way round for the English:

234
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,458
if you want to give somebody present as an apple,

235
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:09,375
they’ll look at you, “What’s the matter with this person?”

236
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:15,333
So this is again Her own style of playing

237
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,917
and giving you different type of climates,

238
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,792
different type of produces,

239
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,667
so that you enjoy different things.

240
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:25,417
If there is no variety, then you won’t be able to enjoy it.

241
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:27,125
How much She understand you,

242
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:30,667
and how much do we understand Her?

243
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:34,000
For a Sahaja yogi it is important to understand

244
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:37,083
that we are not going to take anything from here.

245
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,500
It’s all nothing but clay.

246
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:44,375
And clay is going to remain here, and is going to vanish

247
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:48,875
for ever and ever.

248
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,999
What are we going to carry with us?

249
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:55,250
What are we going to have with us?

250
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:00,875
All the time it’s our evolution, is now our spirit.

251
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,458
So we are the spirit:

252
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,375
we are neither this nor that, nor that.

253
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:08,041
What we are, we are the spirit,

254
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:11,875
and we are absolutely not

255
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:19,083
any way contaminated by anything that is called matter.

256
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,375
So we should see to the essence of the Mother Earth,

257
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:27,291
that the Mother Earth uses Her matter

258
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:30,709
to give joy to others.

259
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:40,333
In the same way if we use Her to give joy to others,

260
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:44,291
then you have followed Her path.

261
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:53,083
On the contrary if you try to exploit Her,

262
00:24:53,542 --> 00:25:01,333
it’s like making holes or digging at Her,

263
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,709
who is your mother.

264
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:06,834
If you try to separate Her into parts,

265
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:13,417
that means you are cutting Her body into different parts.

266
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:18,875
All these human concepts are anti-mother.

267
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:23,999
But the worst, and worst of all is that

268
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,792
we do not respect Shri Ganesha within us,

269
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:32,625
which is the creation of this Mother Earth.

270
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:35,792
Shri Ganesha which is the innocence within us,

271
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:37,208
we do not respect.

272
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:41,709
We did not respect the innocence that has come to us.

273
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:46,834
The way children are tortured and butchered and abused

274
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:50,041
is amazing: how people are not afraid

275
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,375
one day a big volcano might break into a country like this,

276
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:57,750
where the children are treated like this?

277
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:00,417
In that case the Mother Earth will destroy

278
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,041
all the human beings who are behaving like this,

279
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,083
and She’ll take all such sweet children into Her lap,

280
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:10,542
and She’ll reproduce them somewhere else.

281
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:16,875
It is very important to understand that unless and until

282
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,291
we respect Shri Ganesha within us,

283
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:23,625
our innocence, our chastity,

284
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:32,667
we cannot allow ourselves to call Sahaja yogis.

285
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:38,500
That is the first beginning,

286
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:45,625
the first step towards our ascent.

287
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:51,917
We cannot talk of anything else, unless and until

288
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:58,125
this foundation is laid in the Mother Earth.

289
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:03,625
That is why today I have decided

290
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,166
that we should have a Bhoomi Puja in England.

291
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:17,625
I hope by this, innocence in this country will be respected,

292
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:23,999
will be loved, will be protected and will be nourished.

293
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:31,542
By this, innocence in grown-up people will be awakened,

294
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:34,166
that they will respect their innocence,

295
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:40,166
respect their chastity above all other things.

296
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,792
By this Bhoomi Puja we respect

297
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,834
the essence of the Mother Earth

298
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:48,000
that is the Kundalini within us,

299
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:53,375
and we respect our Self-realization by that.

300
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:59,917
I hope what I am going to do today may

301
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:06,041
be able to transform this country into its real form

302
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:11,959
that I call as the Heart of the Universe.

303
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:19,625
By this, I hope the Mother Earth will melt

304
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:29,125
the stone hearts of this country into beautiful lotuses,

305
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:35,959
into fragrant flowers of daises all around.

306
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,250
May God bless you.

307
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:45,166
Today’s puja is going to be very small,

308
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:49,041
and we are not going to have a very long puja.

309
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:53,834
It’s just going to be Shri Ganesha’s Puja,

310
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:58,291
and Gauri’s Puja, it’s not going to be a very long puja.

311
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:03,208
Only thing is that today with full attention,

312
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:06,999
you all should sit down with left hand towards Me

313
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:10,291
and right hand on the Mother Earth;

314
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:13,834
on the Mother Earth, right hand on the Mother Earth.

315
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:16,000
If you are sitting on the chairs,

316
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:17,458
you can put the left hand towards Me

317
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:20,208
and right hand towards the Mother Earth.
