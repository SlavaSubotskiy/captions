1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,583
...the Hindu Scriptures, the experiences

2
00:00:06,792 --> 00:00:10,583
described in more detail than in Christian Scriptures.

3
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:16,917
And we are told that you should be able to feel vibrations

4
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:21,208
emitting from the crown of your head once you have the awakening,

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:28,333
like a cool wind, and you should also feel them on your hands.

6
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:32,875
And in Muslim Scriptures it's described as the Ruh.

7
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:38,917
And Mohammed said, "I believe that at this time

8
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:42,458
people would become enlightened and their hands would speak".

9
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:46,959
And once you have the experience of the awakening,

10
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:50,917
your fingers become sensitive to the vibrations

11
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:55,583
in yourself and in other people and you can tell

12
00:00:55,792 --> 00:01:00,166
exactly what the condition of each person is and how their

13
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:03,625
chakras are working or if there is a problem there.

14
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:08,709
And because the vibrations flow through,

15
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,000
through our hands and through our body

16
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:15,500
and emit through our head, and

17
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:19,458
if you sit with your hands in this position,

18
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:22,041
you'll probably start to feel

19
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,834
the awakening coming while Mother's talking.

20
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:33,125
And it's something that takes you beyond thought.

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,583
You won't,

22
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:37,667
you don't have to think about it or have a great intellectual

23
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,250
understanding, to appreciate it.

24
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:44,417
In fact children probably appreciate it more than rest of us

25
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:49,500
and always at first and because it is such a

26
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:52,125
true experience.

27
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:57,417
So if you would just be receptive and

28
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,959
not try and think of,

29
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,166
worry about any words that seem a little bit

30
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,583
different to what you are used to hearing,

31
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:10,792
just enjoy the experience.Thank you.

32
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,709
I won't keep you any longer.

33
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:21,291
Shri Mataji has arrived in Perth,

34
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:25,750
from an, what is an extensive, overseas tour, and

35
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,792
I've been with Her now for the best part of two months and

36
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:31,375
we've been visiting many, many countries and

37
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:35,208
at last She has come to my own country which is Australia.

38
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:38,709
Perth of course is the gateway to Australia and..

39
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:40,875
I never see it, although I am from Sidney,

40
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,250
I never see Sidney as the gateway.

41
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:50,959
To me the West is where so much begins today.

42
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,667
There are so many seekers here.

43
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,542
Perth has very beautiful vibrations because we feel these vibrations

44
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,041
and Mataji Herself has commented what

45
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,750
beautiful seekers there are in this city.

46
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,166
There is seeking in each one of us and

47
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:12,208
Linda has spoken very sweetly about that seeking, that

48
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,667
that urge, that we want to be something higher,

49
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:19,000
that we want to achieve something beyond this

50
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:22,500
human existence, the confusion  and the

51
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,000
frustration, that we face from time to time.

52
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:31,917
Not only from time to time but probably most of our daily life.

53
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:36,792
Shri Mataji is the One who can take you beyond this.

54
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,625
And She said "beyond thought", but

55
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:43,041
the experience of Self-realisation is something

56
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:48,750
which you begin to perceive in your central nervous system.

57
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:53,750
You become an enlightened being and the process is one of growth,

58
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:59,000
from that point onwards to the full experience of Self-realisation.

59
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,834
It's an actualisation in other words.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,583
It's a spontaneous happening that occurs.

61
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:09,166
She often says that on the tree of life

62
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:12,375
at first there were just a few flowers

63
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:17,542
that turned to fruit. Now it's the blossom time and the

64
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:23,583
flowers are everywhere and all of them have to turn to fruit.

65
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:29,083
This is what it is now and the grace of God is overflowing

66
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:36,583
in such a way, that all of us can achieve that next step that,

67
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:41,667
that last jump in our awareness.

68
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:46,166
We can become a spiritual being.

69
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,875
We can be beyond thought and yet we can use thought.

70
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,041
We can be beyond emotion and yet we can still enjoy,

71
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:58,166
and feel emotion.

72
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:00,875
In other words we become the Spirit.

73
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,208
And this is the purpose of Mother's visit.

74
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:07,083
We call Her Mother, Mataji means "the Divine Mother".

75
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,999
She's known throughout the world as

76
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:14,750
that being who has come on the earth to just do one job,

77
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,417
that is to awaken the subtle energy that lies

78
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:23,917
in the sacrum, at the base of the spine. And when that energy rises,

79
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,250
very sweetly and very painlessly,

80
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:31,583
the actualisation of your second birth takes place.

81
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:36,999
Christ has spoken about it as She said, Mohammed spoke about it.

82
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:40,875
All the great prophets and saints have spoken about it.

83
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,625
And now the time has come. It seems too hard to believe,

84
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:47,667
but this is what is happening to thousands of people.

85
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,333
Already in Australia on the east coast,

86
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,208
near the cities Sahaja Yoga is well established.

87
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:56,542
I can see from the audience here that

88
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,208
it's going to be well established from now on in Perth.

89
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:04,208
So without any further introduction from me,

90
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:11,709
I'd like to introduce to you, Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

91
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:31,583
I think You are connected to the mains.

92
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:45,041
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

93
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:56,166
It's very nice to come back to Australia for the second time.

94
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,750
And last time I could not come to Perth.

95
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:10,041
I did not know that it was such a beautiful city,

96
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,959
with such beautiful, spiritual vibrations.

97
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:24,417
What Linda has talked to you or Dr. Warren has told you,

98
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:28,750
is the knowledge of the roots.

99
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:37,750
Now what we know through science or through our human senses,

100
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:44,750
is the knowledge of the tree that we see obviously before us.

101
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:51,125
But this is the knowledge of the root

102
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:56,667
and if you have to nourish

103
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:02,417
the plant, you have to water the roots.

104
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:06,333
No use just plucking up some flowers,

105
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:12,709
or some leaves and treating them with something artificial.

106
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:20,083
This knowledge can only be achieved,

107
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,875
if you can somehow or other go to the roots.

108
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,959
For example you are paying attention to Me just now.

109
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:35,917
But if I say, " Please pay attention to yourself", you cannot do it.

110
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,999
You say, "How Mother? How to do it?"

111
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,250
So something has to happen within you,

112
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,917
which should attract your attention inside,

113
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:55,709
so that you can get your attention which is outside,

114
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,750
in connection with the Spirit.

115
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:06,375
And the attention then can be enlightened by the Spirit.

116
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:10,166
So to know the knowledge of this root,

117
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:16,917
you have to become something more than a human being.

118
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,250
Even Darwin, who did not believe in God,

119
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,667
did say very clearly, that if man has come so far,

120
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:32,667
he has to go little further to explain himself.

121
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:38,917
But as he did not try the knowledge of the roots,

122
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:46,125
whatever he said, was about what he saw apparently, outside.

123
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:57,375
To become the subtle has to be something very spontaneous.

124
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:01,667
Has to be something very spontaneous.

125
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:07,125
It cannot be done by thinking or by reading.

126
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:11,667
Some people believe, that if we read, we will go to God,

127
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:15,333
or if we think about God, we'll go to God.

128
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:19,917
It's not true. If it was so,

129
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:23,792
why did Christ say that you are to be born again?

130
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,250
Why did all of them say that

131
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,375
some transformation has to take place within you?

132
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:33,542
Even Buddha has said that you have to get your Self-realisation.

133
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:38,458
Without that He would not talk about God.

134
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:44,999
So something has to happen within us to transform us.

135
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:49,792
The other idea people have, is - beg your pardon?

136
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,625
Sorry, we have to leave early.

137
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:55,999
All right, you come along tomorrow. All right? May God bless you.

138
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:05,834
So something has to happen within us which is spontaneous.

139
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:13,667
Because if our spiritual ascent has been

140
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:21,709
the result of a living process,

141
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:28,959
the further movement has to be living again.

142
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:34,875
So we have to understand first point, logically we should understand

143
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,375
what we should expect about Self-realisation,

144
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,792
that it has to be spontaneous.

145
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:45,125
You cannot work it out,

146
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:52,291
you cannot become.

147
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:56,959
You became human beings spontaneously,

148
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,709
from amoeba stage to this stage.

149
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:04,041
And if you have to become something more it has to be

150
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:08,709
spontaneous by the force which resides within you.

151
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,417
Like the force that resides in a seed,

152
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:20,291
which spontaneously becomes

153
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:27,125
germinated when it is put in the Mother Earth.

154
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:30,000
If you read a book, you cannot do it.

155
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,542
If you stand on your head, you can't do it.

156
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:36,125
If you jump, you do what you like, it's not going to happen.

157
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:41,291
You have to put it in the womb of the Mother Earth,

158
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,208
so that the seed should be germinated.

159
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:47,125
Is the capacity of the Mother Earth,

160
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:49,625
is the quality of the Mother Earth,

161
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:55,000
that gives that spontaneous germination to a seed.

162
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:00,583
Now every day in life we see so many living things happening,

163
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:06,709
like a flower becoming a fruit.

164
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:10,166
But we take it for granted.

165
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:15,999
We don't understand that we cannot transform a flower into a fruit.

166
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,959
We cannot do anything that is living.

167
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,792
What we can do is the dead work.

168
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:26,333
If a tree dies, all right, so we make a beautiful furniture.

169
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:31,041
Or something dead is converted into another form of dead,

170
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:35,500
which also deaden us with habits.

171
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:40,000
So the work of the Divine

172
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:45,166
or the All Pervading Power of Love of God,

173
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:49,250
is living work of the living God.

174
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:53,417
And that power we know it exists

175
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,834
but we are not aware of it

176
00:13:56,041 --> 00:14:00,999
and we cannot feel it on the central nervous system.

177
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:09,500
When people talk about the All Pervading Power, it's a mystery.

178
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:13,375
They talk about the Holy Ghost. This is another mystery.

179
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,542
Everything seems to be a mystery

180
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,041
before you have got your Realisation.

181
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,959
For example this instrument is made

182
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:26,250
and is not connected to the mains.

183
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,999
It's a mystery. Nobody knows what is it for,

184
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,792
what's the purpose of this instrument is.

185
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:34,417
But once it is put to the mains,

186
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:40,625
you start seeing how fantastic it is, how tremendous it is.

187
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:45,166
One can't believe when they say that in Sahaja Yoga

188
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,583
you receive all these powers of your own.

189
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:52,333
One can't believe it, because they think, "How can it be possible?"

190
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:57,875
But for your information, you are a fantastic being made by God.

191
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,834
And this is the instrument,

192
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,542
that is lying within you in a subtle form.

193
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:08,166
Now when I'm talking to you, you have to know one more thing,

194
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:12,250
that you should keep an open mind to listen to Me,

195
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,583
like a scientist does.

196
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,834
It's a hypothesis for you and it's truth for Me.

197
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,083
All right. If it is proofed to be truth for you

198
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:28,417
then you should go forward with it and try to understand,

199
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:36,250
how the truth is being established  logically within you.

200
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:42,333
At the very outset I've seen people have doubts about the Divine.

201
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:45,208
They start asking, "Mother how is it possible,

202
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,834
that we can get it so easily?

203
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,542
How one can get realisation so easily?

204
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,333
We have to cleanse it, we have to suffer, we have to do this."

205
00:15:55,667 --> 00:16:03,417
Perhaps you do not know, that when we use an electric switch,

206
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:09,250
we do not think, what has gone in the history,

207
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:12,041
what people have suffered in the history

208
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:16,250
in creating that little switch.

209
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:21,667
It has taken ages for this switch to come up,

210
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:27,250
to discover the electricity, the working of it and the whole, whole

211
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:31,834
development of electrical appliances, till we got the switch.

212
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:36,500
Now we only know we have to switch on and we get the lights.

213
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:40,250
But when I say that you don't have to do anything else,

214
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,542
you are not to suffer,

215
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,166
you must know somebody has suffered for you on the cross.

216
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:49,959
Somebody has done the cleansing part of it,

217
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:56,542
and you cannot cleanse yourself unless and until you are out of it.

218
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:01,999
If you have to cleanse your car, you have to get out of it.

219
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:06,959
That is why first of all you must get your Self-realisation,

220
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:14,542
the light of your being, the purpose of your life, the absolute.

221
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:17,709
She has already explained to you the chart,

222
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:23,000
that is the instrument, the subtle instrument that is within you.

223
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,291
Now here the chart is showing you all the different centers,

224
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:34,667
but these centers are manifested also in the gross as plexuses.

225
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:39,000
We have first of all the Mooladhara chakra.

226
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:45,125
This chakra is the center which controls actually the pelvic plexus,

227
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:48,999
through which all our excretion takes place.

228
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,500
It's a very important center, Mooladhara,

229
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:55,667
means the support of the root.

230
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:58,792
Is the support of the root, is the center

231
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:01,959
of the support of the root.

232
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,291
Is a very, very important center, because

233
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:09,333
this represents our innocence.

234
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:13,375
In the subtle it is the innocence in us,

235
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:18,250
which looks after this center.

236
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:23,291
Through our ignorance or through our naiveness,

237
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:25,375
we loose our innocence.

238
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:28,166
But actually innocence can never be lost,

239
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:34,667
only it is tarnished or covered by our stupidity maybe,

240
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,417
by our wrong doings to ourselves.

241
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,792
It exists all the time,

242
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,291
and when the Kundalini rises which is above that,

243
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:47,250
which is coiled up into three and a half coils,

244
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,291
this chakra becomes aware of itself.

245
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,792
The deity of innocence within it gets awakened

246
00:18:54,999 --> 00:19:01,625
and one starts feeling the innocence within one's personality.

247
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:07,291
The Kundalini itself, this residual power of desire,

248
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,417
is placed in the triangular bone.

249
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:15,500
The triangular bone is the bone called as sacrum.

250
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:18,333
It's a Greek word, meaning sacred.

251
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:22,959
So the Greek knew that this

252
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,291
triangular bone contained something sacred.

253
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:28,291
And when I went to Greece and asked them,

254
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,125
"How is it you call it sacrum?",

255
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:34,458
they said, "There has been a report, Indo-Aryan report,

256
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:38,625
much before Alexander, where we came to know about this bone,

257
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:44,542
that it is a sacred bone and it has a special power within it."

258
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:50,083
Now this Kundalini is a power which is the pure desire,

259
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,125
is the power of pure desire.

260
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,417
While the other, if you see the blue line,

261
00:19:56,709 --> 00:20:00,375
the left side power within us,

262
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:04,999
which starts from the right at the back and goes to the left,

263
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,083
is the power of desire.

264
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:14,375
But not pure desire, because this can be made impured.

265
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:20,875
And all other desires but the desire to be one with the Divine,

266
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:25,875
are corruptible, can be wrong, can be confusing.

267
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:30,291
As you know in economics it is said, that

268
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,375
no desire is satiable in general,

269
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,709
because you want to buy a house, you want to buy a car,

270
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:38,250
then you want to buy that and you buy another thing.

271
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,834
You are never satisfied with matter.

272
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:45,333
So this desire which is lying in the sacrum bone

273
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:47,709
absolutely in its pure form,

274
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,792
the pure desire to be one with the Divine,

275
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:56,208
is the one that gives you ultimate satisfaction and joy.

276
00:20:56,709 --> 00:21:00,667
It is so spontaneous, that if people ask Me, "How You do it?",

277
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:05,125
is going to be difficult to explain at this level how it is done.

278
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,959
As you cannot explain how a seed germinates

279
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,083
and how it becomes a tree.

280
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,709
All living things cannot be explained,

281
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:18,834
only to be seen and to be felt within yourself.

282
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,333
I will be able to tell you tomorrow more about these centers,

283
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:27,333
what are these centers and what are they related to you.

284
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,083
In any case I hope you have the books now and

285
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:35,583
when you go, you can take these books with you and read them at home

286
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:39,208
and see for yourself, if you can understand,

287
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:41,208
what's written in those books.

288
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:45,250
But here today as an introduction, I would like to tell you

289
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,250
certain questions all these people have in their mind.

290
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:52,583
For example there have been many fake gurus coming from India

291
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,959
and they have been enticing many people abroad.

292
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,291
And most of the newspaper people ask Me about them.

293
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:05,750
So I have to tell that you of course can blame these fake gurus,

294
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:08,709
no doubt, that they are sinister, they have been devilish,

295
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:10,959
they have been money oriented, I agree.

296
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:15,250
But also that a seeker has to use his brains

297
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,999
and must understand, what he is seeking.

298
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:22,959
If we just blind folded go to these gurus, then

299
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:27,250
what can one do about it? It's very sad, because they are so naive,

300
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:31,125
they must understand what we are seeking, what we are expecting,

301
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:34,583
and what should happen to us.

302
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:44,125
Now, some people don't understand that you cannot pay for God.

303
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:48,667
You have not paid anything for becoming a human being.

304
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,333
He doesn't understand money.

305
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,166
Money is created only by human beings.

306
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:57,000
God has not created money. He doesn't understand money at all.

307
00:22:57,208 --> 00:23:01,375
You cannot purchase God, you cannot purchase this knowledge,

308
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,583
you cannot purchase your realisation.

309
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:06,500
None of the things that are related with God,

310
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,834
can be purchased with money.

311
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,166
Anybody who tries to take money from you,

312
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,458
in the name of God, is a parasite.

313
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:20,000
Not only a parasite,

314
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:26,333
but I would say a person who is anti-God.

315
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:30,417
Because that is how he is maligning the name of God.

316
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:36,959
It cannot be purchased, it cannot be sold, it cannot be organised,

317
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,999
it cannot be manoeuvred.

318
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,625
We cannot have aa organisation of God.

319
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:48,333
We cannot organise Him. He is the way He is.

320
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:51,875
We cannot tell Him now, "You come along every Sunday to our church".

321
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:56,333
He won't. It is His desire, if He wants to do it

322
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,333
or if He doesn't want to do it.

323
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:04,750
The only thing that binds God is love, dedication and truthfulness.

324
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:07,625
If you are truthful, if you are dedicated,

325
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:09,583
then God is interested in you.

326
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:13,208
If you are not, He is not at all interested in people,

327
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:17,125
who are seeking not God but something else.

328
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:21,999
But what is most unfortunate, that the people who are mislaid,

329
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,542
are all seekers of God.

330
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,875
They are all seekers of truth, they are true people,

331
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:31,999
they are honest, they are dedicated and they are exploited.

332
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:36,875
So again I would say, anybody who takes money in the name of God,

333
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:40,250
please see that, that is not God, please!

334
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:43,375
As a Mother I'm warning you, that one has to understand,

335
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:47,667
any saint who takes money in the name of God is

336
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:52,999
not a person, who is to be regarded as a divine personality,

337
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,250
by no chance a saint.

338
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,041
Now secondly, as I told you, you cannot put in an effort,

339
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,834
it is a spontaneous happening.

340
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,083
Now one of the arguments people have, that in such and such book,

341
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:08,500
X, Y, Z this is written.

342
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:12,667
In the other book so and so, this is written.

343
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:17,999
Another fellow who was such and such has said so.

344
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:23,000
It's very easy to dwell upon such sayings and on such books.

345
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:28,250
I would request you to be here at this moment with Me,

346
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
to understand what I have to say.

347
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,959
If you bring in other people,

348
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:34,375
I'll have to tell you the facts about them,

349
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,917
which you may not like, which will not be palatable.

350
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:39,250
We'll create a controversy for nothing at all.

351
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:42,625
Because we are not here to create any controversies.

352
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:45,750
We are here to achieve our goal of Self-realisation

353
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,959
for our betterment.

354
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:52,959
Once you understand this, that the main interest is of the Divine

355
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:58,083
and that is, that you all should get your Self-realisation.

356
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:01,375
We have known that we have become human beings.

357
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:04,792
But we have never asked a question, no scientist has asked a question:

358
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,333
Why have we become a human being?

359
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,875
Why are we on this earth moving

360
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:12,166
with these two legs and two feet in this fashion?

361
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:16,542
What is the speciality, why God has made us

362
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:20,166
in such a beautiful way, that we are called as human beings?

363
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:23,417
If you ask this question to yourself, you won't be able to say

364
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:27,417
that there is any purpose in what God has done to us.

365
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:29,500
But I say, there is a purpose!

366
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:33,083
The purpose is that you have to become the instrument of God.

367
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:39,417
You have to become the carrier of His power.

368
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:44,999
When the Kundalini rises and breaks through your seventh chakra here,

369
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,709
then it is amazing how you feel this All Pervading Power

370
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:52,083
as cool breeze in your hands. But that's not sufficient.

371
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,959
If you feel the cool breeze, supposing I give you a car

372
00:26:55,125 --> 00:27:00,208
or any instrument and I don't tell you how to drive, it is useless.

373
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:04,667
But if you learn the complete decoding of this feeling

374
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:09,750
of this All Pervading Power, you can do great things,

375
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:12,375
because God has put these powers within you,

376
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:15,000
only the light has to come in.

377
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,999
Without the light as you cannot see anything properly,

378
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:20,792
you cannot integrate anything, correlate anything.

379
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:24,792
In the same way, when there is no light within yourself,

380
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:31,417
you are not integrated within, nor you understand absolute things.

381
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:34,417
What you understand are relative things.

382
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:38,250
With our mind projection whatever we do is all relative.

383
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,125
That's why we are having problems about our politics,

384
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:47,999
about our economics, about our every sort of thing that we are doing.

385
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,041
Our development also has been very one-sided in the sense,

386
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,999
that our material development has taken place

387
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:58,166
without the Spirit in it.

388
00:27:58,417 --> 00:28:01,750
Anything without the Spirit is something like a tree

389
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:06,458
growing, outgrowing it's size much more than the roots

390
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:11,208
and that's how sometimes we always are worried and shocked

391
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:17,250
at the destruction, that is facing us from within and without.

392
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:21,166
We see diseases like cancer and other horrible diseases,

393
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:22,875
which we cannot combat.

394
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:28,333
We see the problems of the nations and political, economic crises,

395
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:32,667
and we don't understand how to control it on individual basis.

396
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:37,291
All these things can only be solved if you become the Spirit.

397
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,375
The Spirit is within you the link with the whole.

398
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:46,999
Like the microcosm, the whole, you are a part and parcel of that.

399
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:49,709
Like my finger is part and parcel of the whole.

400
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:54,000
Now, if there is pain in my finger, I can feel the whole.

401
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:57,291
In the same way once I become aware of My Spirit,

402
00:28:57,542 --> 00:29:01,417
I can feel the whole, I become collectively conscious.

403
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:04,792
I do not talk about it, I do not say that

404
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:08,542
'You are now brothers and sisters', but it just happens that

405
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,375
on your fingertips you start feeling others, very clearly,

406
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:15,041
their centres, their problems, your problems

407
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,250
and also you know methods how to clear it out.

408
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,208
Compassion people talk of, of giving compassion,

409
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:24,834
looking after people and doing good to them.

410
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:29,208
But this compassion talks, it doesn't solve the problem.

411
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:33,458
But the compassion that flows from you, works. It works out.

412
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:37,709
It helps people in a way that they are not aware of it.

413
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:40,917
For example in India we had one Indian,

414
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,750
who got realisation in a village.

415
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:45,000
He was a farmer, he went back,

416
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:49,583
and he gave realisation to so many people, and it is unbelievable,

417
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:56,291
how he could manage such a lot of population to come to Sahaja Yoga.

418
00:29:56,542 --> 00:29:58,667
But he told Me that certain incidents

419
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:05,083
like, 'A man came to me and he was an alcoholic,

420
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:08,417
and he came to me and he was about to beat me.

421
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:10,875
But I was very quiet. I just told him,

422
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:13,125
"Now don't beat me, you sit down for a while".

423
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:17,041
He sat down and after some time, I awakened his Kundalini.

424
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,917
Overnight he gave up alcohol!

425
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,792
Overnight he gave it up.

426
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:23,875
He became like a king. He said, "What?

427
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,750
I'm not going to drink anymore".'

428
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:31,375
It's not mental, but just he achieved his supreme thing,

429
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:38,500
the highest thing, his purpose and the whole being got glorified.

430
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:42,333
So you start feeling your own powers.

431
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:45,875
Actually when you go to any guru, you must also find out

432
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:49,959
from the disciples, if they have achieved any powers or not.

433
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:52,834
It is not important if a guru says, "I am such and such".

434
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,709
For example, the lady who came to interview Me, she said,

435
00:30:57,917 --> 00:31:01,208
"Do You think you are the highest saint of India?" and all that.

436
00:31:01,417 --> 00:31:05,417
I said, "I never said so. But the saints in India do say so."

437
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:08,291
All right. If you believe in it or not makes no difference.

438
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:11,291
It is for you to find out. But leave alone Me,

439
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,417
why not find out about yourself, what happens to you.

440
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:19,208
Supposing you become the saint, supposing you have the powers,

441
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:22,375
supposing you manifest that compassion which I am talking of,

442
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:25,792
then you have to believe that there is something about yourself.

443
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:28,500
First of all you all must have faith in yourselves,

444
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:32,417
that you are capable of becoming that Self,

445
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:36,291
which is collectively conscious to begin with,

446
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:41,917
which is the source of all the joy, health, wealth

447
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:44,834
and all kinds of satisfaction,

448
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:49,458
and the one which is the witness of the play of Divine,

449
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:55,750
the one that allows you to transmit this Divine power to others.

450
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:59,250
After realisation, for example Dr. Warren himself

451
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,750
was very reluctant in the beginning.

452
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:04,208
He was a difficult person to begin with.

453
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:06,083
Then he got his realisation

454
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:09,125
and after realisation he was quite satisfied.

455
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:11,125
Because he had been to so many gurus.

456
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,125
There's no guru he had not been.

457
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:20,166
And he was so angry and aggressive when he came to Sahaja Yoga.

458
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:25,458
When he got into realisation, he just felt that he has found it.

459
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:29,625
Now, through him in Australia we have established

460
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:33,166
so many centres, and so many people have got realisation.

461
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:35,959
It's a surprising thing that one man,

462
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:40,041
who reluctantly came to Me on a telephone number,

463
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,834
has suddenly become such an enlightened person,

464
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,625
that he has given realisation to so many people,

465
00:32:47,917 --> 00:32:50,917
and to whom he has given realisation, have

466
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,750
also given Realisation to so many others.

467
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:57,875
Apart from that they have cured diseases like cancer

468
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:02,542
and all kinds of serious diseases we talk about. It's a fact.

469
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,250
For this you cannot pay. That's one thing for sure.

470
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,458
You cannot pay for it. It's all free.

471
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:11,999
As this nature is free to give you everything

472
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:14,792
that is essential and vital within you.

473
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:20,125
In the same way this knowledge has to be without any effort.

474
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:24,083
Supposing if we have to learn about breathing,

475
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:28,083
going to a library, how many of us would survive?

476
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:32,083
It is so vital that it has to be the easiest, the simplest

477
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:35,250
and everything that is living is so simple,

478
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:39,250
that we don't also bother to think about it.

479
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:43,500
We take all this for granted.

480
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:47,667
The subject is very wide.

481
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:50,500
It has many aspects and dimensions.

482
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:55,041
First when the Kundalini rises, it crosses through this center,

483
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:57,792
which is called as the Agnya chakra,

484
00:33:57,999 --> 00:34:02,583
which is the chakra of our Lord Jesus Christ.

485
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:05,291
Tomorrow I'll be telling you the names of all the deities,

486
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,500
who reside on these centers.

487
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:10,125
Now it is difficult for a scientist to accept,

488
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:14,375
that there are deities who are sitting on these chakras.

489
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:18,792
But Socrates and Confucius who were such ancient people,

490
00:34:18,999 --> 00:34:22,792
have talked about these Gods, that we have to keep them pleased

491
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,875
and you have to keep them all right.

492
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:27,583
But those realised souls perhaps you don't know.

493
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:32,375
That's not easy to convince human beings who are not realised souls

494
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:37,000
about these deities being within you.

495
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:40,041
And they are all just waiting there.

496
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:45,792
As soon as the Kundalini rises you start manifesting your grandeur,

497
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:48,917
your great personality that awaits you.

498
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:52,667
This is something not fantastic to Me,

499
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:56,917
because I've seen thousands of people getting realisation,

500
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:59,709
thousands of them feeling the cool breeze,

501
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:02,458
thousands of them transforming.

502
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:05,709
Another thing one has to see in a person, in a guru,

503
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:08,041
when you go to a guru, that

504
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:12,000
'Is this the man giving any transformation to another person?'

505
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:15,417
Here they are, they are smuggling, they are telling lies,

506
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:17,583
they are killing people and they have a guru.

507
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:18,875
How can you have a guru,

508
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:22,166
when you are doing all these anti-God activities?

509
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:24,458
All kinds of anti-God activities they are doing:

510
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:30,208
They are hot-tempered, they are liars, they are intriguers,

511
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:32,750
all sorts of things they'll be doing

512
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:35,792
and they will be saying that "We have a guru".

513
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,875
What's the use of such a guru, who allows you to do these things?

514
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:41,834
It's better not to have such a guru who allows you to do that.

515
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:44,875
Secondly, a guru if you have a real one,

516
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:48,000
he has to look after your health, minimum of minimum.

517
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:51,375
But if you go to a guru and if you get epilepsy

518
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:54,709
or if you go to a guru and you get a bad head

519
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:57,166
or some sort of a headache, then he says,

520
00:35:57,375 --> 00:36:00,041
"All right, these are your sins, you better suffer".

521
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,125
So one should ask a question to such a guru,

522
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:06,583
that, "Then why are you there? Why are we paying you for?

523
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:10,208
If you can't even look after our health,what are we paying you for?"

524
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:13,291
There could be a guru who can teach you something,

525
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,542
like he'll say that, "I'll make you fly".

526
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,875
So you must ask the guru to fly himself.

527
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:20,166
If the guru can fly, then you pay him.

528
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:22,959
What's the use of paying a guru who just says, you can fly.

529
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:25,834
"All right, you give me six thousand pounds, I'll make you fly."

530
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,917
Better ask the guru to fly and see that he flies.

531
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:31,542
But people are so identified with the gurus,

532
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,583
that despite they become absolutely bankrupt, finished,

533
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:38,709
gone cases, still they are sticking on to these gurus,

534
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:40,000
because they are mesmerised.

535
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:43,000
They don't want to have their own Self-realisation,

536
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:45,250
they don't want to have their own powers,

537
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:48,875
but they want to abide by the so-called powers of their guru

538
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:52,750
and all these things. They become absolutely hopeless cases,

539
00:36:52,999 --> 00:36:55,917
gone cases, good for nothing, lost people,

540
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:59,250
but still they'll stick on to these people and

541
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:03,417
will continue with it till they are perished as useless cabbages.

542
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:06,667
It's a very common thing, I've seen of some of the people

543
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:09,375
who teach that you must starve now, you must starve.

544
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:10,792
And the guru eats well,

545
00:37:10,999 --> 00:37:13,583
but all the disciples are starving and suffering.

546
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:15,333
There's one thing more in Sahaja Yoga,

547
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:17,667
you are not supposed to suffer anymore.

548
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:21,166
There's no need to suffer.

549
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:24,625
Christ has suffered. He has suffered for us.

550
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,834
Now, no more suffering is needed for anyone of you.

551
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,583
Tomorrow I'll tell you how, when Christ is awakened,

552
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,083
you can feel

553
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:37,709
your so-called karmas and your so-called

554
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:40,166
egos and all that just are sucked in.

555
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:46,041
Here as you will see, ego is created with this right side power

556
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:51,458
called as the kriya shakti, is the power of action.

557
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:55,792
And when it moves further and further and touches the other side

558
00:37:55,999 --> 00:37:58,458
which is the superego, then

559
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:01,500
in the center here, on the fontanel bone area,

560
00:38:01,709 --> 00:38:03,750
a calcification takes place.

561
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:07,041
And when that happens you develop your I-ness.

562
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:12,667
You become "I", Mr." I", Mr."Second I", Mr. "Third I".

563
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:16,458
Now, this is like an egg we can say,

564
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:18,999
which has to be transformed into a bird.

565
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:24,208
In Sanskrit a realised soul is called as 'vijaha', means twice born.

566
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:27,625
And also a bird is called as twice-born.

567
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:32,875
In the same way a human being which looks so insipid, so boring,

568
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:36,250
so useless, sometimes he also condemns himself for nothing at all,

569
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:39,667
sometimes you find him so bombastic, so egoistical,

570
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,417
so horrible, so aggressive.

571
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:45,583
All these people are nothing but these little eggs.

572
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:51,000
Only thing what one has to do is to transform them into the bird.

573
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,999
The bird, that is a free bird,

574
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,834
which understands what is wrong with you,

575
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,417
what is wrong with others and how to correct yourself.

576
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:04,999
Because the Spirit is the master, is the guru.

577
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:08,792
Your Spirit is your master. You are your own master.

578
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:10,834
You become your own master

579
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,542
and you start understanding everything one by one.

580
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,125
I am just your Mother. I'll decode for you,

581
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,875
I'll tell you what is what, what is this.

582
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:24,166
Once you understand that and you start finding it out,

583
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,458
you yourself will be amazed, that

584
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:28,750
not only that you can cure yourself,

585
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:30,500
you can raise your own Kundalini,

586
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:32,542
you can work it out on yourself

587
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,583
and keep your transformation moving further and further,

588
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:40,000
but you become entitled, endowed with powers,

589
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:42,417
that you can give realisations to others,

590
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:45,709
you can do all these things by yourself,

591
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:48,875
and it is such a remarkable thing, which must be achieved.

592
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:52,792
Because if you see the condition of this world today,

593
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:54,375
it is in a very big mess.

594
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:58,458
I don't know if people understand it what we are facing.

595
00:39:58,667 --> 00:40:02,875
We are just like the tree as I told you, which has lost his roots,

596
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:05,709
and anytime it can be destroyed.

597
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:09,834
It is very important today that all of us must seek

598
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,458
and find the Spirit.

599
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:16,250
Everybody who has told this, they were not liars,

600
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:18,250
they are not telling us wrong things.

601
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,458
Traditionally everyone has said the same thing.

602
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:25,166
Now these gurus can also start some untraditional stuff,

603
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:28,333
and people believe it, because it is something new.

604
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:32,083
This is the higher evolution of a person

605
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:35,375
where you arrive at a point,

606
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:40,041
where you become the witness of the play of the whole game.

607
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,709
For example a thought rises and falls off,

608
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:44,999
another thought rises and falls off.

609
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:47,625
Between these thoughts there is a little space

610
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:49,917
and this space is the present,

611
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:53,333
while we live in the present or the past.

612
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:59,999
But - we live in the present, we don't live in the present,

613
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,625
but we live in the future or in the past.

614
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:05,709
Now the past doesn't exist, because it's over,

615
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:07,625
and the present (should be FUTURE) doesn't exist at all.

616
00:41:07,834 --> 00:41:10,792
So our thoughts are all the time moving like that.

617
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:16,125
If somehow you can stop yourself at the point that is the present,

618
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:21,959
then you start enjoying the dynamics of every moment which you live.

619
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:25,542
And that's what is achieved through Kundalini awakening.

620
00:41:25,792 --> 00:41:28,709
As I told you this subject matter is very great.

621
00:41:28,917 --> 00:41:33,959
In an introduction I have tried to cover lots of points,

622
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:37,041
which people have been asking Me all over the world.

623
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,333
And if you have any new points to ask Me,

624
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:41,959
I'll be very happy to answer you.

625
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,000
Tomorrow I'll tell you actually

626
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:46,500
what happens, when the Kundalini rises.

627
00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:49,083
I would like you to
ask Me questions

628
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:53,083
and after that we will have the session of realisation,

629
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:55,792
which may take hardly ten to fifteen minutes.

630
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,875
May God bless you all.

631
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:03,709
Can I have questions from you?

632
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:21,125
You have a question? Anyone with questions...

633
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:24,709
This is the best way to openly talk.

634
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:28,750
Did You say the mind is the Spirit?

635
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:30,875
Did You say the mind is the Spirit?

636
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:33,417
No, tomorrow I'll tell you the difference,

637
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:38,750
but if you want I tell you mind and Spirit are two different things.

638
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:47,083
In English language what we call mind it's a confusing thing.

639
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:51,458
But it's simple to understand.

640
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:57,208
Now here you see is an institution,

641
00:42:57,458 --> 00:43:02,375
which looks like a blue balloon in the head.

642
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:05,625
That is the mind.

643
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:12,917
It is created by the action of the power of desire.

644
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,959
which we call in psychology as superego,

645
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:20,999
which is the result of all our conditionings, is the mind.

646
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:24,625
You can call it manasa. In Sanskrit language is manasa.

647
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:30,917
Now on the right side, the yellow coloured line, you see,

648
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:35,709
ends up into another yellow coloured institution,

649
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:42,041
is a result or a by-product of our activity,

650
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:48,667
physical and through our brain, which we call as mental.

651
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:53,125
This creates an institution called ego.

652
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:57,166
So we have got superego as well as ego.

653
00:43:57,417 --> 00:44:00,291
Supposing you tell somebody, "Don't do like this.

654
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,000
It is not to be done. You have to be disciplined like that."

655
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,291
Then, if you go too much with it,

656
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,709
then conditioning takes place in a person.

657
00:44:08,917 --> 00:44:14,041
And these conditionings are expressed as a balloon there,

658
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,583
which is a by-product of conditionings.

659
00:44:17,917 --> 00:44:22,500
And the another one is the by-product of our activity,

660
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:26,208
which is mental as well as physical.

661
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:31,917
So we have two things, one is the manasa, is mana.

662
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:35,709
I don't know, in English it is called as mind,

663
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:41,166
but it is confusion, because they call a mental case to a mad man and

664
00:44:41,417 --> 00:44:44,959
when you work through your brain, you call it a mental activity.

665
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:50,375
So I would suggest, that if the confusion has to be understood,

666
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:52,709
has to be understood properly.

667
00:44:52,917 --> 00:44:57,875
What happens to a man who works through his brain too much,

668
00:44:58,125 --> 00:44:59,625
gets a heart attack.

669
00:44:59,834 --> 00:45:03,041
It's surprising, he should get something wrong there -

670
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,250
but no, he gets a heart attack.

671
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:09,709
A man, who works for the future through his mental capacity,

672
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:12,375
gets a heart attack, means a balance.

673
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:17,750
And then a man, who works with his emotions too much,

674
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,458
gets this brain which is degenerated, so you call it mental.

675
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:27,834
So because of this the confusion is there, because of the balance.

676
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,333
It's surprising, that in a mental hospital

677
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:34,250
you don't need anything to find out about heart,

678
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:36,458
electrocardiogram and all that is not needed,

679
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:40,208
because a mental case never gets a heart attack normally.

680
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,542
So because of this confusion people call a mental case

681
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:47,667
to a person who actually uses his emotional side.

682
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:54,250
So for all our purposes we use a pure word called superego and ego.

683
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,750
Now apart from that we have got the Spirit

684
00:45:57,959 --> 00:46:01,208
and the Spirit is in the heart.

685
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:05,083
It is the reflection of God Almighty.

686
00:46:05,667 --> 00:46:08,875
Another thing we have got down below, is the Kundalini.

687
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:12,667
Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost.

688
00:46:12,917 --> 00:46:17,625
And Holy Ghost is the All Pervading Power of God's Love.

689
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,583
So that's how we have these four things separated.

690
00:46:20,834 --> 00:46:23,417
Another thing we have got, which is the attention,

691
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:25,917
which is sustained by our liver.

692
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:30,834
So now you understand we have a heart, we have an ego and superego,

693
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:34,333
and we have got that power which is sleeping,

694
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:39,166
which is to be awakened within us, which is called as Kundalini.

695
00:46:39,417 --> 00:46:40,917
In the Bible also it is said that,

696
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:44,542
"I will appear before you like tongues of flames".

697
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:48,375
And what you see is, are these centres, when they are enlightened,

698
00:46:48,583 --> 00:46:50,709
they look like tongues of flames of different colours,

699
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:52,333
as shown you the picture.

700
00:46:52,542 --> 00:46:58,000
But ultimately the thousand petaled lotus here

701
00:46:58,208 --> 00:47:02,792
has many colours, all the seven colours of the rainbow.

702
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:05,625
I hope it is clear to the subject.

703
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:12,834
So far our Spirit has not come into our attention.

704
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:14,792
Yes, speak.

705
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,542
Is there any danger in Kundalini path being awakened too quickly?

706
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,166
I'm sorry I should have tackled this question everybody ask,

707
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:32,333
it is true. Because so many books have been written about Kundalini,

708
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:37,041
which are horrifying things and there is no danger at all.

709
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:40,041
Kundalini is your own Mother.

710
00:47:40,417 --> 00:47:43,417
She bears all the things, She bears all the problems for you.

711
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:44,834
She is your own Mother.

712
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,458
She's just waiting for the moment to give you realisation,

713
00:47:48,667 --> 00:47:51,542
so there is somebody who knows the job!

714
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,583
But those people who have written about Kundalini -

715
00:47:54,792 --> 00:47:58,625
I've seen one book which was written, I was amazed how these people,

716
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,500
could write about Kundalini, all this nonsense

717
00:48:01,709 --> 00:48:04,125
in such a big book and selling it,

718
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:07,917
which has no relevance at all to the state of Kundalini,

719
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:11,333
to the nature of Kundalini, even to the seat of Kundalini.

720
00:48:11,542 --> 00:48:16,208
They are so confused, but the realm of God,

721
00:48:16,792 --> 00:48:19,500
everybody tries to handle, is the sad part,

722
00:48:19,709 --> 00:48:21,999
that everyone tries to handle that realm

723
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:23,917
and they can say whatever they like.

724
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:25,750
There is no danger at all,

725
00:48:25,959 --> 00:48:29,625
we have given realisation to thousands and thousands of people.

726
00:48:29,834 --> 00:48:32,000
Of course, when the Kundalini is rising,

727
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:34,083
if you have any opposition within yourself

728
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:36,250
due to a disease or trouble

729
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:39,542
maybe little bit, you might feel hot in the hand.

730
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,375
But nothing more than that, or less than that.

731
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:45,999
It is a very beautiful experience, very pleasant

732
00:48:46,166 --> 00:48:49,750
and great pleasure to Me.

733
00:48:50,583 --> 00:48:51,375
Yes.

734
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:58,083
Is this Kundalini energy active at birth?

735
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:00,875
Is it there at birth?

736
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,166
Is the Kundalini energy present at birth?

737
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:10,333
Yes! About two months or so, when you are in a foetus,

738
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:14,125
it enters into your being, which is present there throughout.

739
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:22,583
Is it present before birth?

740
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:25,709
No, not before birth, how can it be present?

741
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:28,709
You see, in the sense that in the womb it is present.

742
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,250
It is in the womb of the mother, as the foetus it does, but

743
00:49:32,458 --> 00:49:34,417
before the foetus is formed, how can it be present,

744
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:37,041
there has to be something to be present in.

745
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:40,500
So it is there when the foetus is about two months of age,

746
00:49:40,709 --> 00:49:47,125
it starts expressing itself there, it is there. All right?

747
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:52,291
Should we do any practice for tomorrow?

748
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,083
For?

749
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:55,333
Should we practice anything?

750
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:57,000
Should we practice anything...?

751
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:59,709
For tomorrow at this level.

752
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:00,542
I see.

753
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,750
Should they practice anything for tomorrow?

754
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:05,250
Could I make an announcement about the workshop?

755
00:50:05,458 --> 00:50:06,959
All right.

756
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:11,250
We haven't told you but tomorrow during the day we've got a workshop

757
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:12,999
for those who would like can come along.

758
00:50:13,166 --> 00:50:15,041
May be a little inconvenient but

759
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:18,333
for those who would like to come along, there's a place for your coming.

760
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:20,125
Today we'll work it out also.

761
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:21,625
You can come along but

762
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:23,500
we'll make an announcement at the end of the program,

763
00:50:23,709 --> 00:50:25,542
and the answer is yes.

764
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:28,667
But Mataji will show you at the end of the lecture

765
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:32,250
after you have the experience.

766
00:50:32,875 --> 00:50:36,667
He seems to be a great seeker.

767
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:41,750
Is there any other question please?

768
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:03,917
Is this spontaneous awakening, as opposed to the more dangerous

769
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:08,917
awakening that occurs some,  by some people,

770
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:12,000
due to Your Power?

771
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,542
It's very embarrassing.

772
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:20,917
It is not due to Us at all, that's all I can say,

773
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:22,792
but you have got your own power.

774
00:51:22,999 --> 00:51:25,500
Now say for example if there is a light,

775
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,083
a candle that is enlightened, all right,

776
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:30,999
and if it has to enlighten another light -

777
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:35,667
is it the power of this candle that you will say that has enlightened?

778
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:40,083
Because the candle itself is ready, this candle is enlightened,

779
00:51:40,291 --> 00:51:42,041
it just touches the other candle

780
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:44,625
and that candle gets enlightened by itself,

781
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:47,583
because it is just ready.

782
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:51,375
I understand, from the nature I think that

783
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:56,041
You have so many of the yoga teachings.

784
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,250
What's it?

785
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,250
Periods of starving and endeavour

786
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:04,750
hopefully with Kundalini (...)

787
00:52:04,959 --> 00:52:08,792
and sometimes, it's told, it will be in the next life.

788
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:13,999
He said, from the reading and traditionally it's said that

789
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:18,417
Kundalini rises slowly and it has to be the result of certain things

790
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:22,583
and I think he's a little puzzled, how it can be now

791
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:24,792
in Your presence.

792
00:52:24,999 --> 00:52:27,333
Have you read Shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya?

793
00:52:27,542 --> 00:52:29,500
He's the master of this, all right?

794
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:34,417
What he says that, "Mother can do it",  that's it.

795
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:37,125
You have to find out about Myself.

796
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:39,166
All right? I'll better not tell you.

797
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:41,500
To be tactful, one should not talk about oneself.

798
00:52:41,709 --> 00:52:43,083
It's a dangerous thing.

799
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:45,208
Christ has said, "I'm the life, I'm the path",

800
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:47,166
and people crucified Him.

801
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:50,458
Just see! You dare not say anything about yourself.

802
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,125
If you say, they will just trouble you.

803
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:54,500
It's better to keep quiet.

804
00:52:54,709 --> 00:52:58,041
I'll do what I have to do, then you find out about Me. All right?

805
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:02,125
I don't want to say anything, because if I say anything, you feel hurt.

806
00:53:02,542 --> 00:53:07,166
But please, please don't misunderstand me, I'm not questioning You.

807
00:53:07,542 --> 00:53:08,250
I cannot...

808
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:10,500
I'm trying to find out the balance,

809
00:53:10,709 --> 00:53:13,041
thinking that spontaneous comes to me.

810
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:16,250
I personally am endeavoured to the Kriya Yoga.

811
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:17,208
Yoga?

812
00:53:17,417 --> 00:53:18,083
Kriya Yoga.

813
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:24,250
All right. All right. I understand you.

814
00:53:24,999 --> 00:53:30,583
Now, I'll tell you about. Kriya Yoga is against spontaneous.

815
00:53:30,834 --> 00:53:32,792
(...)  completely.

816
00:53:32,999 --> 00:53:35,834
And by Kriya Yoga you cannot get  realisation.

817
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,500
There is no Kriya Yoga.

818
00:53:37,709 --> 00:53:40,291
In no traditional book it is there, no traditional.

819
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,709
This is a new thing started by people,

820
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:45,458
they used to even cut the tongues of people,

821
00:53:45,667 --> 00:53:48,458
say that you put it back here, put the tracheae,

822
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:51,208
do all kinds of things. There are many people in India who have

823
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:56,792
their tongues waving like dogs, who have been to Kriya.

824
00:53:56,999 --> 00:53:59,333
There's no such things needed at all.

825
00:53:59,542 --> 00:54:01,208
It is spontaneous, it is within you,

826
00:54:01,417 --> 00:54:04,667
you don't have to do anything about it. That is what it is!

827
00:54:04,917 --> 00:54:06,083
Absolutely!

828
00:54:06,291 --> 00:54:08,667
You don't have to do anything, you don't have to stand on your head,

829
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:11,250
or nothing at all. It's just simple.

830
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:14,041
So Kriya Yoga is not sahaja.

831
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,709
'Is not sahaja' means

832
00:54:15,917 --> 00:54:19,291
'saha' means 'with' and 'ja' is 'born'. It's spontaneous.

833
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,583
It is a spontaneous thing, you don't have to do anything about it.

834
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:25,208
Nothing.

835
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:30,875
But once you get it, once you get it, you can give it to others.

836
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:33,625
It's like if you know how to swim

837
00:54:33,834 --> 00:54:37,291
and if there's somebody who does not know and he is getting drowned.

838
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,834
What you tell that person, that

839
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,583
"You keep quiet just now, I'll take you to the shore".

840
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:43,166
Then you are brought to the shore

841
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:46,959
and you teach him how to swim, and then he can save others also.

842
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:49,000
But the one who does not know how to swim,

843
00:54:49,208 --> 00:54:53,917
has to do nothing for the time being, just to get his realisation,

844
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:57,083
mature in it and then give realisation to others.

845
00:54:57,291 --> 00:55:00,375
No Kriya is needed at all in Sahaja Yoga.

846
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:02,291
Actually it is not at all traditional.

847
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,709
It is a very recent stuff that has come out.

848
00:55:04,917 --> 00:55:07,875
If you read from the past, if you read Adi Shankaracharya,

849
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:10,709
the sixth century, if you read other people, Markandeya like,

850
00:55:10,917 --> 00:55:13,542
fourteenth century, you'll be amazed, that

851
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:17,208
they have said the same thing what I am saying; this is traditional.

852
00:55:17,417 --> 00:55:21,291
But these new gurus came up, they started talking about this and that,

853
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,959
but it is not so.

854
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:25,999
Nobody can achieve realisation by Kriya Yoga.

855
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:29,250
I've not met one. On the contrary they come to Me as patients.

856
00:55:29,542 --> 00:55:32,417
I must say, I'm sorry to say, but it is so.

857
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:34,250
People have spent so much money,

858
00:55:34,458 --> 00:55:38,375
from India they have gone all the way to America to do Kriya Yoga

859
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:41,500
and they are just suffering. Nobody has achieved anything.

860
00:55:41,709 --> 00:55:43,834
So now whatever you have done, it's finished.

861
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,750
Now you be interested in yourself and in your seeking.

862
00:55:46,999 --> 00:55:49,041
Just forget it whatever you have done.

863
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,625
Now what you have to do is,

864
00:55:50,834 --> 00:55:53,625
to just get your realisation and work it out.

865
00:55:53,834 --> 00:55:56,375
Forget it whatever you have been doing,

866
00:55:56,583 --> 00:55:58,625
because you have not yet achieved the result.

867
00:55:58,834 --> 00:55:59,709
So forget it!

868
00:55:59,917 --> 00:56:03,709
And see for yourself without any Kriya you receive it or not.

869
00:56:03,917 --> 00:56:05,875
It is all described but the trouble is,

870
00:56:06,041 --> 00:56:10,041
all the Sanskrit books which are authentic are not being translated.

871
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,625
So it's not traditional at all.

872
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:16,458
Christ never said you have to do anything like that.

873
00:56:16,709 --> 00:56:20,125
Nobody has said it. Everybody has talked of spontaneous happening.

874
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:24,625
Even Martin Luther, when he tried to change people from Catholicism,

875
00:56:24,834 --> 00:56:26,542
he talked of spontaneity.

876
00:56:26,834 --> 00:56:29,333
He was also a realised soul, but later on his followers

877
00:56:29,542 --> 00:56:31,333
tried to make a mess of everything.

878
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:34,083
In the same way Christ also talked of the same thing.

879
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:36,583
Did they say that you have to stand on your head, cut your tongues,

880
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:38,417
put them back, push it back?

881
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:41,208
All these things are absolutely not to be done.

882
00:56:41,417 --> 00:56:44,667
It's very harmful, one should never do it.

883
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:55,750
So let us have now the experiment, all right?

884
00:56:55,999 --> 00:56:57,333
All of you are seekers.

885
00:56:57,542 --> 00:57:00,917
Now forget what you have been doing, what is done, forget it.

886
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:02,500
Because you have been -

887
00:57:02,709 --> 00:57:05,834
you have to be kind to yourself, to be truthful to yourself,

888
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:07,250
you have to be your Self.

889
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,834
I'm the only person who'll say that you have to get to it.

890
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,500
If you don't get it, I will not rest and you should not rest.

891
00:57:13,709 --> 00:57:16,542
If I have patience for you, you should also have patience for you.

892
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:19,709
Don't be angry with anyone, don't be angry with yourself,

893
00:57:19,959 --> 00:57:21,125
don't be angry with your gurus,

894
00:57:21,333 --> 00:57:23,750
whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

895
00:57:23,959 --> 00:57:28,875
You'll be amazed, I Myself get surprised the way Divine is working.

896
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:32,959
Whatever you may do it, whatever may be the problems, it works,

897
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:34,709
it works, really it works.

898
00:57:34,917 --> 00:57:36,667
It's something so amazing.

899
00:57:36,875 --> 00:57:38,917
It is better that you see to it, that you get it.

900
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:40,917
Because you are seekers of ages.

901
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:44,625
This is not a life you are wasting, you have been seeking for ages.

902
00:57:44,834 --> 00:57:48,667
And today the time has come, that's why you are here to get it.

903
00:57:48,917 --> 00:57:51,792
So please just get your realisation. Forget the past.

904
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,583
May God bless you all.

905
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:14,625
I would request you for a simple thing:

906
00:58:14,834 --> 00:58:15,917
we have to take out our shoes,

907
00:58:16,083 --> 00:58:18,375
because the Mother Earth also takes away our problems.

908
00:58:18,583 --> 00:58:20,583
She's very helpful. Even the light is helpful.

909
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:23,291
Now some people ask, "Why the light?" Even this little light

910
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,917
is so helpful, if it is there. Just take out your shoes.

911
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:31,917
Just to take help from the Mother Earth. It's very simple.

912
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:36,000
Now you have to put your both the hands towards Me like this

913
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:37,375
in a very simple way.

914
00:58:37,625 --> 00:58:39,166
First of all you should be comfortably seated.

915
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:40,999
There should be no discomfort,

916
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:43,750
so that when it is happening you again get distracted.

917
00:58:43,959 --> 00:58:47,250
Just to sit comfortably, have easy sitting,

918
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:55,375
no, no tightening in the neck or in the -

919
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:57,959
I mean uncomfortable tightening.

920
00:58:58,125 --> 00:59:00,834
It's all right, if you can feel comfortable.
