1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:09,809
Every time I face the new people, I have to
give an introductory talk and Sahaj Yogis

2
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:17,470
get sometimes impatient about it.

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:27,990
But we have to understand that this is the
knowledge of the Divine 

4
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,150
and those who have not known about it are
to be told.

5
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,250
And those who have known should know that
there are many things they have not known,

6
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,179
which they have to know.

7
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:48,690
Still there is a lot to be known.

8
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:57,600
Supposing I tell you all about it and you
do not get your Realisation, you do not get

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:06,860
your yoga, you do not get your connection
with the Divine then it is useless.

10
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,320
Talk will remain talk.

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,120
You may verify it; you may find it the same
written in many scriptures.

12
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,620
Many saints have told you the same thing [but]
it has no use.

13
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:32,700
The knowledge, gyana, is useless without yoga,
without the union with the Divine.

14
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,600
When you get the yoga, also, when you are
realised, you get your Realisation, and I

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,600
do not give you the knowledge, then your Realisation
is also useless.

16
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,870
I have seen in this great country many realised-souls
are born.

17
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:57,830
They live as realised-souls, they don’t
know what are they; they act as spiritualists,

18
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,450
they call themselves, whatever people call
them.

19
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:05,090
But they are not aware that they are realised-souls!

20
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:20,769
They commit mistakes, they go onto wrong paths,
get confused about their Realisation.

21
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:33,739
So, it is necessary also to know what have
they got, what does it mean, how to use it,

22
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:44,680
how to go ahead with it and how to develop.

23
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,159
Many people who have been here in this hall
have got Realisation.

24
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:55,600
Once they get Realisation, they feel so satisfied
about it that they just don’t come next

25
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,849
time.

26
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:01,680
And sometimes, after a year or two years they
appear saying that, “Mother, we are again

27
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
lost."

28
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:17,300
So, to get Realisation is the most important
thing, absolutely important because if you

29
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,480
do not start your car, you do not move.

30
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,430
You [may] go on describing everything that,
“Now here we are on Leicester Square.

31
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,819
Now we are here!”

32
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,670
But you are not there, you’re just talking.

33
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:38,719
The car has to move first, has to start and
when the car has started then you must also

34
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,749
know the roads, how to go.

35
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:47,459
Then the car starts and bumps into something,
then you feel that, “What has happened?

36
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:48,639
Our car has started!”

37
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:57,280
So, these are two things: one is the yoga
– is the Realisation, through awakening

38
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:07,840
of your Kundalini and the other is the gyana
(knowledge), which is the part which gives

39
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,599
you complete knowledge and mastery over your
powers.

40
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:22,860
For example, you go to a house and the lady
gives you the keys, “All right this is your

41
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,860
house.

42
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,199
You use it as you like it."

43
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,930
Say, I come to England and somebody gives
me the keys.

44
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,259
I don’t know how to use a washing machine!

45
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:35,960
And I don’t know how to use the oven!

46
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,860
Though she has given me the keys, I have entered
into it, I should know how to use it.

47
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:52,490
I should know also what are the don’ts and
what are the dos.

48
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:59,340
Before entering into the house, what’s the
use of knowing, also?

49
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:05,500
Of course, it may help you, if you have a
little knowledge about it.

50
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,870
But you cannot practise anything because you
have not entered inside it.

51
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,919
The machinery is not before you, you are not
facing it.

52
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:29,190
So, in Sahaj Yoga one has to first get into
[the] Self-realised state and then should

53
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:41,600
know thoroughly how to use that state, or
how to be in that state, how to manifest it,

54
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,350
improve it and stabilise it.

55
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:52,379
For this you cannot go into courses – that
is for definite.

56
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:55,409
“Should we do fourteen courses outside?”

57
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,860
Has nothing to do with Sahaj Yoga.

58
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:04,129
You have to get the keys.

59
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:11,199
Secondly, you cannot pay any money for it,
you cannot purchase it.

60
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:21,879
It is very difficult for human beings to understand
this part: that you cannot pay for it.

61
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:28,620
That is one place where you cannot pay and
purchase.

62
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:36,740
It is not that you are going to judge the
Sahaj Yoga, but Sahaj Yoga is going to judge

63
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,740
you.

64
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,830
It’s just the other way around.

65
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:48,300
It is not that you are going to purchase Sahaj
Yoga, but Sahaj Yoga has to purchase you and

66
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,039
has to accept you.

67
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:59,289
It is very easy to do any other nonsense:
just you pay the money and you are there enrolled,

68
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:00,289
permanently.

69
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:04,880
You become the member of any group, very easy.

70
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,879
And you can club together and be satisfied,
“Oh, we are this and that!”

71
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,110
You can brand yourself as anything but not
as Sahaj Yogis, unless and until you have

72
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,699
got it.

73
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:36,850
It is that essential, that authentic, that
intrinsic, that innate, that you have to be

74
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:37,850
that.

75
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:44,870
You can be an Englishman if you get a British
passport.

76
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,490
You can be a director anywhere if you can
qualify for that.

77
00:07:50,490 --> 00:08:01,759
But you cannot be a Sahaj Yogi by doing anything
that you have been doing to achieve for worldly

78
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:09,449
things or worldly positions, worldly possessions.

79
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:15,699
We see so many such phenomena in our life
that we cannot see or cannot manoeuvre, cannot

80
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:28,509
do such as a flower manifest into a fruit.

81
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:39,680
As we cannot germinate a seed, we cannot do
this living thing, which has to be done by

82
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:48,019
Divine power and not by human power.

83
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:58,690
Once you get it, the Divine power starts flowing
through you, then you can also charge the

84
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,690
dynamo.

85
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,300
There is no false certificate that can be
given.

86
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,970
You may be having a son who is not realised:
you may stand on your head or do whatever

87
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:12,240
you please, you just cannot certify unless
and until he has got it.

88
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,491
It is such a strange thing, so unique.

89
00:09:15,491 --> 00:09:21,570
But do you know: this is what you are seeking.

90
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:30,149
The rest of the things can be sought.

91
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:43,280
This is the thing which can only be requested
for, to be prayed for, to be asked for.

92
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,779
You cannot demand it.

93
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:50,150
Only the grace of God can work it out.

94
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:59,110
Today I happened to read Bible, part of it,
and I was amazed how John has revealed so

95
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:05,800
many things about chakras and this; but of
course, in a very mystic language.

96
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:18,570
He calls chakras as the plug/plaque in his
dream he saw, and the deities as the angels.

97
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:26,630
He has also described the Realisation.

98
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,140
It is so wonderful to read it.

99
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:38,960
But only after Realisation you’ll understand,
because it’s a very, very deep writing and

100
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:50,820
you cannot read much from it – mystical
sounding, vague words.

101
00:10:50,820 --> 00:11:01,220
Now, we are here to seek ourselves.

102
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,550
Everybody is floating an enterprise like that,
everybody is saying, “Oh, we are here to

103
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,350
help you to seek yourself."

104
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,870
I may be one of them, too.

105
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,040
Why should you believe me, in any case?

106
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:20,740
The first thought that will come into your
mind is, “Why should we believe Mataji?”

107
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:26,899
If you believe in me blindly, it is not going
to help me at all.

108
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:33,240
Neither it is going to help me, if you are
going to deny.

109
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:41,519
Like a scientist just keep your eyes open,
keep your mind open, because this is what

110
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,120
you are seeking, not just in this lifetime.

111
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:51,829
You have been seeking for ages and unless
and until you get it you are not going to

112
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:57,029
be satisfied, you are not going to find your
fulfilment.

113
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:58,820
This has to happen to you.

114
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:09,089
I don’t know how far Gavin has been able
to explain to you what to expect out of Sahaja

115
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:10,690
Yoga.

116
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:20,240
But it is the actualisation of this experience
I’m talking about, which has to work out.

117
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:35,360
Here you see they have drawn a human being,
as he exists, with his Divine instrument within

118
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
himself.

119
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:46,579
These are the patterns of the energies which
are undercurrent of the sympathetic and parasympathetic

120
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:50,459
nervous system.

121
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:58,519
The sympathetic nervous system is managed
by two channels within us.

122
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:09,570
One, on the left hand side that you see with
the blue line, is the power to desire: is

123
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,160
called as ichcha shakti.

124
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:24,690
And the other one, on the right hand side,
with the yellow line, is the power to act,

125
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,160
which is called as the kriya shakti.

126
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,980
The first one is called as the ichcha shakti.

127
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,199
First one has to desire and then he acts.

128
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:45,670
And these two powers exist within us as left
and right sympathetic nervous system, which

129
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:51,960
doctors can see outside the spinal cord, but
this is inside the spinal cord and inside

130
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,720
the cranial bones, inside the brain as you
can see there.

131
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:05,800
These all can be related to the gross nervous
system that doctors can see.

132
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,040
But they are subtle energies within us.

133
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:18,020
The one which runs on the left hand side is
connected with the seventh chakras down below;

134
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:25,800
or you can call it the first chakra.

135
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:32,560
This gives us desire to live and also desire
to die.

136
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:46,480
All desires give us emotions, it gives us
existence and when we deny our existence,

137
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,699
then it gives us death.

138
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:58,360
The other one is the power of action for which
we use our physical being and our mental being.

139
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,850
So, this represents our physical and mental
being.

140
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:12,970
The central one is called as the path of knowledge:
gyana shakti.

141
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:20,720
But the knowledge we know of is very different
from the knowledge I am talking about.

142
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:28,139
I mean the subjective knowledge that we have
achieved as human beings through our evolution.

143
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:40,810
For example, a human being is much higher
in his awareness than the animal.

144
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:46,160
His awareness is the thing that he has achieved
through his evolution, which is built in him,

145
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,610
which acts subjectively.

146
00:15:47,610 --> 00:16:06,269
For example, supposing you take a rose flower:
you know it is a rose flower and you enjoy

147
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:08,759
it.

148
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:15,050
But for an animal, it makes no difference
whether it is filth or a garden, it can pass

149
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,250
through it most unawares.

150
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:29,410
So, your gyana shakti means your awareness
or your knowledge – knowledge that is awareness,

151
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:35,639
human awareness – is developed to a point
and still has to develop more, has to manifest

152
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,639
more.

153
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,779
It has to have another dimension.

154
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:52,509
Because of a certain gap in between – you
can see the central line; this green gap gives

155
00:16:52,509 --> 00:17:08,750
you the Void – gives you an awareness which
is not yet complete.

156
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:18,400
The completion of human awareness can only
be achieved if he reaches the absolute point.

157
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:27,770
Supposing you have not reached the absolute
point then whatever you are talking is relative.

158
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,960
Relative to relative creates confusion.

159
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:42,020
So, the idea of righteousness, idea of holiness,
idea of sin, everything is relative.

160
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:54,090
You have to reach that absolute point by which
you judge whether it is holiness or not, whether

161
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,390
it is sinful or not.

162
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,450
That we have to reach.

163
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:08,760
That absolute point is within us, placed in
our heart, which is called as the Spirit and

164
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,400
is the reflection of God Almighty.

165
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:19,440
In Sanskrit language it is called as Atma.

166
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:29,900
That Spirit resides within us, it watches
all our activities, it knows everything about

167
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:42,290
us and it informs the lowest chakra there,
which records everything that we do – all

168
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:49,010
our conditionings, all our ego-trips – to
that three and a half-coiled energy, which

169
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,650
we call as Kundalini.

170
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,540
‘Kundalini’ means coils.

171
00:18:53,540 --> 00:19:00,020
This is the Kundalini, as called as the Serpent
power.

172
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,809
Now, horrible things have been said and written
about Kundalini.

173
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:15,860
When I read, I mean when I even heard about
it, I was really shocked about the naive description

174
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,630
of it!

175
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:25,480
I’ve always said that it is like a villager
going in the city and putting both the hands

176
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,591
into the plug and saying that, “Electricity
I know, don’t tell me about it!

177
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:36,440
You see what happens, it gives you a shock
and you just fall back and you break your

178
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,440
neck."

179
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:46,809
Those who do not know about Kundalini have
written about Kundalini because this is the

180
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:49,081
only area where nobody can control you.

181
00:19:49,081 --> 00:19:53,500
You can write anything about God, against
God, or do whatever you please, who can check

182
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
you?

183
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
There is no law which forbids.

184
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,960
You can write about Kundalini whatever you
feel like.

185
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,800
She is your Mother.

186
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:11,050
She has been born with you several times.

187
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:17,400
She is the one who is going to give you Realisation.

188
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,860
And do you think your Kundalini is going to
harm you by any chance?

189
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,860
Is going to torture you?

190
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,860
Is going to trouble you?

191
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:37,990
And if you have to achieve the highest through
the Divine love of God, is it going to be

192
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,210
torturesome?

193
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:47,570
Did you get this nose and these eyes and mouth
and everything that you have as a human being

194
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,419
out of some tortures?

195
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:57,490
You never even felt how it has happened!

196
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:03,680
How gentle it is, how kind it is!

197
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:09,590
It is your Mother who is sitting there waiting
for a moment to rise.

198
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:16,559
Now the whole thing sounds very poetic to
a scientific mind.

199
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,350
But poetry is also a part of human beings.

200
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,590
If it sounds poetic.

201
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:30,070
It is the poetic work, of the Kundalini.

202
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:36,770
God is not only science; he is also love,
beauty.

203
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:43,200
He is not only dry truth; He is also joy.

204
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,700
He is joy.

205
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:54,320
He’s joy, because he is truth, He’s truth
because He’s beauty.

206
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:04,890
So, when the Kundalini rises within you through
these six centres that are shown here, it

207
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:15,030
pierces this area, which is called as the
fontanel bone and gives you Self-realisation.

208
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:21,940
This is called as baptism.

209
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:29,909
You cannot go to a theological college and
become a Baptist.

210
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:34,430
Nobody can brand you a Baptist.

211
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,370
You have to be realised.

212
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:43,860
This fontanel bone area has to be pierced
through by the Kundalini, then only you become

213
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,010
one with the All-pervading Power, with that
subtle power.

214
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:53,740
It has to happen; this germination has to
take place within you.

215
00:22:53,740 --> 00:23:03,120
You are still at a seed stage and just by
branding a seed you do not become a tree.

216
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:13,220
So, it has to happen within us, and has to
happen beautifully, and spontaneously, because

217
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:20,150
it is a living process of evolution.

218
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:27,039
We have evolved into human beings from amoeba:
nobody has done anything about it.

219
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:38,240
And we are not going to do anything about
becoming that for which we are made.

220
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,950
Somebody who has created this machinery is
going to put you through to the mains if he

221
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,110
wants to use it.

222
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:53,100
But in between there’s a little problem.

223
00:23:53,100 --> 00:24:01,250
Everything was ready, just perfect, just to
be connected to the mains.

224
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:07,400
But the instrument was given the freedom to
choose.

225
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:16,230
That is important for evolution, very important,
that you should be given the freedom, a complete

226
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:20,170
freedom to choose whether it is right or wrong.

227
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,471
Nobody can force that onto you.

228
00:24:23,471 --> 00:24:32,590
In all your freedom you have to choose whether
you want to enter into the Kingdom of God

229
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,590
or not.

230
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:39,169
Nobody’s going to force you there, to enter.

231
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:47,070
It has to be your desire; it has to be your
asking.

232
00:24:47,070 --> 00:25:00,090
And for that freedom has been given to use
these two powers of your desire and of your

233
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:17,770
action which gives you the idea of your accelerator
and of your brake: to know how to drive your

234
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:36,960
own car, so that the master behind it hands
over the keys to you and car to you.

235
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:44,410
It was necessary for you to learn these two
powers, to be managed.

236
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:54,090
But in your freedom and in understanding yourself
you have committed mistakes; you have bumped

237
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,090
your cars too much.

238
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:01,750
It was said that: keep in the centre, do not
go too much left or to the right or you’ll

239
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,090
get into bumps.

240
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,610
Either you went into the left or to the right.

241
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:12,090
And when you tried to correct your right you
went into the left, to another extreme.

242
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,490
To correct to the left you went to the right.

243
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,270
By going to the extremes, you will be bumping
your car.

244
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:27,730
And this is exactly what has happened to us
– doesn’t matter.

245
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:32,400
The car has to be repaired; it has to be done.

246
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,390
A little patience can work it out.

247
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:42,370
There’s nothing to get annoyed with oneself.

248
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:47,210
When the car starts it goes very fast.

249
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:56,640
Then you 
should know how to slow it down, how to organise

250
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,640
it.

251
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:04,770
Then you have to become the authority, yourself,
of discrimination.

252
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:09,539
I don’t have to tell you that this is not
good or that is not good.

253
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:11,350
How is it possible?

254
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:21,529
Because you become one with the Divine, you
become one with the Primordial Being, with

255
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:31,960
the Great Being, with the Akbar, and you start
acting according to that.

256
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:41,230
A subjective manifestation of your awareness
takes place by which you understand what’s

257
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:46,560
wrong with you and what’s wrong with others.

258
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,090
It is so precise and correct.

259
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:59,020
You just feel on your hands, on your fingers
as shown, all the centres that are within

260
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,210
you, which are created out of different elements.

261
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:08,159
Immediately you know what is in imbalance,
what is more, what is less, left is more or

262
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,340
right is more, what is wrong with you.

263
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,289
Even a born-realised child, say, of two years
who can talk, can tell you what’s wrong,

264
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:17,289
because it’s subjective.

265
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:23,710
You start feeling it: this is happening, that
is happening.

266
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:35,720
All this understanding comes to you because
it is Self-knowledge.

267
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:42,590
But when you know about yourself you also
know about others, because you jump into collective

268
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,559
consciousness.

269
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,860
You ‘jump into’, I say.

270
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,100
You become collectively conscious.

271
00:28:53,100 --> 00:29:00,110
It is not that I say, “We are all brothers
and sisters,” have United Nations for it

272
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,059
and use it for giving jobs to everyone.

273
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:04,100
It’s not that way.

274
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:08,070
It’s an actualisation that takes place:
you just become.

275
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:18,269
Jolly well you’ll have to feel it.

276
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:19,269
You cannot get rid of it.

277
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:20,269
It becomes your awareness.

278
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:22,840
You just feel it and that’s how you correct
it.

279
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,250
Everybody is a part and parcel of that Great
Being.

280
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:32,320
As this finger can feel this finger; and as,
when it is hurt, this finger goes to sooth

281
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,970
it, in the same way the whole is more important
than individual.

282
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:46,100
So, when we are seeking our wholesomeness
we have to know that, only through Self-realisation,

283
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:51,179
by becoming one with the Self, you are going
to get it.

284
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:55,899
Talks, talks, talks – we have had many.

285
00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:59,279
Let’s have the real and get it.

286
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,350
You cannot argue about it.

287
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:08,470
It happens, especially in this country I have
seen, because you are great thinkers and analysers.

288
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:13,179
Everything you try to analyse.

289
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:18,700
But this is beyond your thinking.

290
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,220
You go beyond your rationality.

291
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,850
Because rationality is limited and you have
to be triggered into something unlimited,

292
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:30,500
so you have to leave that.

293
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:36,240
You have to go into that space.

294
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,360
You cannot explain it by thinking.

295
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:46,049
But then, when it starts flowing through you,
you use your rationality to understand, “Why

296
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:49,730
this finger is burning?”

297
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:53,980
It is decoded in Sahaj Yoga.

298
00:30:53,980 --> 00:31:19,130
In Sahaj Yoga you know all the decoding of
all the signals you get from the Absolute.

299
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,169
Your computer starts working.

300
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:26,580
But who has to decode the computer and the
numbers?

301
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,990
All that is explained.

302
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,649
That is what you have to learn, that is known
as gyana.

303
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:38,659
After Realisation what one has to do?

304
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:42,320
Also, a point comes up sometimes.

305
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,390
Supposing, I have enlightened this one (candle),
now what have we to do?

306
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,020
Is to give light.

307
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,250
What a question!

308
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:55,650
When you are enlightened, after enlightenment
what do you do?

309
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,550
Is to give light, that’s all.

310
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:01,460
That’s your job, is to give light.

311
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:08,419
But how to manoeuvre it, how to organise it
– that’s the thing you have to learn,

312
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:13,919
for which I’m willing to work very hard.

313
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:25,049
And everything that I say, you have to verify
it, and you have to see for yourself.

314
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:30,950
After Realisation, if you start doubting – we
had people who started doubting – and what

315
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,049
are you doubting here?

316
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:34,090
I don’t want anything from you.

317
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:43,929
I am sitting here just to give, not to take
anything, then what are you doubting about?

318
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:48,460
They start doubting and the progress is much
less.

319
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:57,350
But some people are of very high calibre in
this country, are of a very great high calibre,

320
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,340
and once they get it, they just get it like
that.

321
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:06,159
You will be amazed, there was one gentleman
who went to someone and was ditched and deceived

322
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:14,710
and absolutely he was looted: he just saw
my photograph.

323
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:21,700
There are, Gavin himself has got his Realisation
only through my photograph.

324
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:27,100
There are many here who have got it through
my photograph only.

325
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,120
But they are people of calibre.

326
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:36,200
So, I said that Sahaj Yoga is going to judge
you and you are not going to judge Sahaj Yoga:

327
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,200
you cannot.

328
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,130
You cannot measure it.

329
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,140
It is an ocean.

330
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,000
Just enjoy it and be your Self.

331
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,419
It’s a gift for which you have been asking,
so just take it.

332
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:57,260
It’s absolutely free, you cannot pay it
and don’t think on these hopeless worldly

333
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,260
ways.

334
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:05,700
It is the love of God, the grace of God, which
one has to receive.

335
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,500
Just enjoy it.

336
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,840
Just have it.

337
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:17,740
That’s what it is and we should work it
out.

338
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:27,880
Now I had a system, especially in these countries,
that people can ask me questions.

339
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:33,870
But it happened like that, that questions
were asked by extremely negative people mostly.

340
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:39,870
I would answer them, they would take everybody’s
time who were anxious to have Realisation.

341
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:43,880
And then just as soon as we started, “All
right let’s have the Realisation,” the

342
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,320
person would get up and go away.

343
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,320
It’s common practice.

344
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:53,280
The person is not at all interested in Self-realisation,
seems to be more interested in questions.

345
00:34:53,280 --> 00:35:00,920
And, sort of, you give more chance to a person
who is negative and useless than to people

346
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,750
who really want Realisation.

347
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:09,720
Now, if there is a question, I still would
like you to ask me, no doubt, but be sensible

348
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,770
and considerate.

349
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,650
Thank you very much.

350
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,710
May God bless you all!

351
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:23,220
Be considerate when you ask a question, but
ask.

352
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:29,130
It’s nice to ask, you know, because I have
no questions, that’s the problem.

353
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:33,900
Not to fear, please ask the question.

354
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,722
Lady from the audience: Have a question.

355
00:35:35,722 --> 00:35:38,370
Shri Mataji: You have been always asking,
I am not going to allow this time.

356
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,400
She is useless.

357
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,430
You asked me.

358
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,580
Somebody else should ask me.

359
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,740
Her questions are always like that, has no
meaning.

360
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,180
You’d better get your Realisation, perfected.

361
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,180
Anybody else?

362
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,180
Ask.

363
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:55,770
She has been every time asking questions,
but you don’t want to perfect your Realisation.

364
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:59,560
You must perfect your Realisation.

365
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:05,160
Yes please.

366
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:16,350
Yes, ask me, loudly.

367
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:55,530
Seeker: I’ll try not to be negative but
I’ve tried a few different organisations

368
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,200
and I’ve searched quite a lot of different
organisations

369
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,850
Shri Mataji: I can see that.

370
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,850
All right

371
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:04,433
Seeker: and always I come to the same question
that people who are interested in truth, how

372
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:05,433
could they come to such an organisation as
yours?

373
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:06,433
Shri Mataji: I have no organisation.

374
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:07,433
We have no membership.

375
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,433
This is not an organisation.

376
00:37:08,433 --> 00:37:09,433
Question: But…

377
00:37:09,433 --> 00:37:10,433
Shri Mataji: Now, I’m very happy that…Please,
sit down, all right?

378
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:11,433
I know.

379
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:12,433
He is a seeker.

380
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:13,433
He has been to many organisations.

381
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:14,433
There has to be.

382
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:16,580
It is written already in the Bible, there
have to be many like these, you see, coming

383
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,580
up.

384
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,370
All right?

385
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:32,760
But first of all, I have requested you that
here we are not selling anything, to begin

386
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,990
with.

387
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,140
We are not selling.

388
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:42,810
What are you going to lose in any case?

389
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:49,380
Maybe, your ego a little bit, maybe.

390
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:56,599
Because we are identified with our ego, we
think our self is our ego, you see; which

391
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:59,970
may not be pampered [here] also, as in another
organisation.

392
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:06,100
I have been, seen people who are very honest,
they go to other organisations and they find

393
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:13,230
that only their ego is pampered and their
pockets are being vacated.

394
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:16,430
No, that’s not here.

395
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:22,100
Now, I also do not guarantee that you will
get your Realisation definitely.

396
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,730
It’s like germination.

397
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:29,510
If it works, I’ll be the happiest person
and you’ll be the happiest.

398
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:33,450
If it doesn’t work, please come again, we’ll
work out.

399
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:41,010
So, again if you have started judging about
it, it won’t work out.

400
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:51,210
There are fifty per cent people here who are
realised people and they know your problems.

401
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:57,870
They haven’t given me a single pie (1\192
Rupee), nothing!

402
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:07,580
But if you come here, you 
have come in your own right, because you are

403
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:19,530
a seeker and I respect you for that and I
love you for that.

404
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,530
And I am here for you.

405
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,530
Not in London.

406
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,720
I didn’t come to London for that, I came
by chance.

407
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,150
You know that my husband was appointed here
to this U.N.

408
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:33,000
thing, he was elected, and I had to come here.

409
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:41,900
But also, this is God’s desire that I should
be with you because there are so many seekers!

410
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,920
So, I am with you here.

411
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:51,120
If you have been to many organisations and
many thugs also, I must tell you very, very

412
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,370
frankly that you’ll have problems much more
than anybody else will have.

413
00:39:55,370 --> 00:40:04,100
It’s going to be difficult to give you Realisation,
because all these organisations do spoil your

414
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,600
Kundalini and your chakras.

415
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:13,840
I’ve yet to meet one organisation which
doesn’t spoil.

416
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:22,570
Except for, there are some real people who
live in the forests and they have disciples.

417
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:29,730
But I can make them out: if they are coming
from the real gurus, I immediately know.

418
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:39,080
But no organisation, so far, I have known,
who has even kept your instrument intact.

419
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:47,800
They have spoilt your Agnya, they have spoilt
other centres, which are so vital, just to

420
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,810
get some money out of you.

421
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:55,970
I don’t know why they have done it.

422
00:40:55,970 --> 00:41:04,970
I know you are tired of seeking but no more
you should repent about it.

423
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:09,580
But if you have been to other gurus, you must
tell us, because we’ll have problems correcting

424
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,060
you.

425
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:22,400
Even if you read the books, even if you just
think of them or even if you have a photograph,

426
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,750
it acts negatively; it’s a problem.

427
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:36,150
So, I request you to let us know if you have
been to any guru.

428
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:43,890
I wish I could tell you the experiences we
have had from people who went to other gurus,

429
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,820
and the things that we had to correct.

430
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:53,180
And most of the Sahaj Yogis are here who have
been, at least half of them or most of them

431
00:41:53,180 --> 00:42:00,080
have been to some gurus somewhere and have
known this, that there is a problem.

432
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,180
Doesn’t matter!

433
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:14,780
If your Kundalini is preserved even by them,
I’ll be very thankful.

434
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,880
All right?

435
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,030
It’s correct now?

436
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,130
What’s it?

437
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:25,020
So, should we start now?

438
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,500
Let us see how it works out, hmm?

439
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,500
Hmm.

440
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:44,890
Now, put your hands like this.

441
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:47,320
One has to be extremely positive, after Realisation,
about it.

442
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:52,870
If you go down you will move very slow.

443
00:42:52,870 --> 00:43:00,400
It is like three paces forward and two paces
backwards.

444
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,410
When you will reach?

445
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,670
You’ll never reach!

446
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:10,600
Before that, I do not ask for anything.

447
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,450
But after that you have to do it.

448
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:21,610
Secondly, when you put your hands towards
me, as shown there, all these fingers have

449
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:32,670
got the centres, the chakras, dormantly placed
on these fingers: one, two, three, four, five,

450
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:40,960
six and seven, on the left, on the right;
left sympathetic and right sympathetic.

451
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:48,410
So, when you are placing towards me, like
as you place towards this one, it radiates

452
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:49,410
heat.

453
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:52,250
In the same way, I radiate this Divine love.

454
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:57,620
You will also radiate when you will be realised,
when you will be enlightened.

455
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:03,450
So, when you put your hands towards me you
take this radiation within yourself.

456
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:08,030
It goes within yourself onto these.

457
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:20,990
There are two very important chakras, which
work it down on your, these, two lines and

458
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:27,170
inform the Kundalini through the lower chakra
to rise.

459
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:32,740
And you can see with your naked eyes the pulsation
of Kundalini in some people, who’s this

460
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,740
chakra is catching.

461
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,740
With naked eyes you can see.

462
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,270
You can see even the rising of the Kundalini.

463
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:44,450
If you have the stethoscope you can feel the
throbbing going up.

464
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:50,920
When it reaches here, it throbs here and then
it stops.

465
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,400
That is the time you are realised.

466
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,360
But some people have lots of imbalances.

467
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,910
Now, how do we remove them?

468
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:09,200
Supposing the ego is too much on this side,
there is no space here.

469
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,900
So, you have to push down the ego.

470
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,770
If the superego is too much, you have to push
down the superego.

471
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:27,720
So, those who are realised people, also radiate
this, this Divine love, this integrated force

472
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:35,980
of vital energies and they, through their
vibrations, manoeuvre it by giving these radiations,

473
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,560
they take it down.

474
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,900
You can also do it.

475
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,820
You have to learn, only, the art.

476
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:49,330
And then they raise the Kundalini, so the
Kundalini starts.

477
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:53,340
If there is an obstruction you can see the
Kundalini going there.

478
00:45:53,340 --> 00:46:00,180
For example: somebody has a liver trouble;
you can see the Kundalini going there and

479
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,180
throbbing.

480
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:07,880
If you have the kidneys trouble, the Kundalini
will go there; poor thing will supply to the

481
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,090
kidneys and then come up.

482
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:16,300
That’s why the first thing that will happen
to you is, that physically you will be cured.

483
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,760
We have definitely cured cancer.

484
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,570
The president of India (Neelam Sanjiva Reddy)
who was suffering from cancer, was cured by

485
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:24,570
me.

486
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:28,030
If you want you can write to him and ask.

487
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:33,840
That cancer can only be cured by Sahaj Yoga,
by nothing else, is also another fact.

488
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,110
But doesn’t matter; don’t get too frightened
about it.

489
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:45,290
Just now, let us have the Kundalini moving.

490
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:48,460
Let us see if it starts.

491
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:49,800
It has to start.

492
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,520
By anything you cannot do it.

493
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,800
Only through Divine radiation you can do it.

494
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:05,690
But (break in recording) I have seen horrible
Kundalinis, I have seen, in doing this work.

495
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:11,190
People are not aware of it: what we have done
to harm ourselves, people are not aware and

496
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:17,680
that’s why sometimes it takes time, doesn’t
matter.

497
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:23,840
As I have patience and love for you, please
have patience for yourself because you are

498
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,080
a seeker.

499
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:33,930
You are a seeker of truth and that’s why
I’m here.

500
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:41,230
Now please put your hands like this close
your eyes.

501
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,570
And you have to put your feet on the ground.

502
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:52,220
The reason is that the Mother Earth sucks
in lots of our problems.

503
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:59,250
Now the people who are realised also can help
me, they are just like my hands.

504
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,100
You have to also become my hands.

505
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:05,400
But when they move their hands and all that
you are not to get frightened of them.

506
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,880
They are the people who are salvaging you!

507
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,160
They have to help you.

508
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,910
If they know swimming, they have to fetch
you to the shores.

509
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:18,500
They have to extend their hands to you.

510
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,420
Don’t be frightened of them.

511
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:24,400
Come on the shores and you are going to do
the same thing.

512
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,510
There’s nothing to be frightened.

513
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:28,360
They are not going to do anything.

514
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,830
Might be, they might feel, if you are realised
or not.

515
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:38,300
So, just put your hands like this.

516
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:42,820
Now, you have to close your eyes.

517
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:47,060
Close your eyes, please.

518
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:52,370
But some cannot close their eyes because the
eyelids will flicker.

519
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:56,730
So, please open your eyes, in that case.

520
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:02,810
If your eyes can be easily closed without
any flickering, then keep them closed.

521
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:06,500
That’s a very good sign.

522
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:18,830
Now, if you feel anything like little shaking
in the hands or anything like that, then open

523
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:19,830
your eyes.

524
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:21,260
Nothing external should happen.

525
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,340
If it happens, then open your eyes.

526
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:31,410
Even if you feel heat in the hand, you’ll
not feel much, but if you feel slightly even,

527
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:40,580
which you think is little unbearable then
open your eyes.

528
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:45,320
When you close your eyes most of you will
find you have no thoughts in your mind already.

529
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:51,610
This is called as Nirvichar Samadhi, is called
as thoughtless awareness.

530
00:49:51,610 --> 00:50:00,180
It’s this samadhi, it’s this state which
is achieved after thousands of years of meditation,

531
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,030
as they say.

532
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:04,920
It’s the most difficult thing, agreed.

533
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,900
But there could be someone for whom this could
be only just a play
