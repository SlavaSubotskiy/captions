1
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:36,917
It is a very unique opportunity, I think,

2
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,375
for Me to meet you again in Bombay

3
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:44,041
when you are all leaving this country,

4
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:51,333
and this kind of a special type of a puja

5
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,333
that we are having today.

6
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:58,959
This is the puja done to the sun,

7
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:03,583
and is called as Makar Sankrant.

8
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:11,375
"Makar" is the tropic of Capricorn,

9
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,333
Capricorn is Makar.

10
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,000
So now the sun is moving from the tropic of Capricorn

11
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,542
towards the tropic of Cancer,

12
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:26,125
and is always a fixed date because it's a,

13
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,208
it has something to do with the sun.

14
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:31,333
This is the only date which is fixed in the Indian calendar,

15
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,500
because they have to deal with the sun.

16
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,375
But this time, I don't know why, what has happened

17
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,375
that they have put it on the fifteenth

18
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:41,125
of this month - it's always the fourteenth.

19
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:46,417
Now today is, they are changing,

20
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:51,917
I would say that the seasons are going to be changed.

21
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:58,458
We've got six months when this moves,

22
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:01,834
sun moves towards the southern hemisphere

23
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:06,458
and makes it warm, and it comes to the northern hemisphere

24
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,333
from tomorrow.

25
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:15,417
So today is the last day, which we say that

26
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:18,083
is the day which is the coldest day,

27
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:22,125
according to Indian understanding.

28
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,417
After this the heat will start growing

29
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:30,333
and all the - we can do anything that is auspicious,

30
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:35,208
any auspicious things can be done after this puja is over,

31
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:37,542
during the summer-time.

32
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:40,041
Though it's very hot in summer,

33
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:43,875
still people wants the sun to rule us

34
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,792
and to give us warmth because,

35
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:51,917
because of him only all the fields and all the vegetables,

36
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:54,709
all the fruits, everything grows.

37
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:59,792
And that's why when the six months the sun is not here,

38
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,667
we call it as "Sankrant,"

39
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,959
meaning a "calamity" in a way.

40
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,834
That is when of course in the,

41
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:12,709
in the European countries or say in England or America,

42
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:18,041
it is a calamity at that time when the sun is not there.

43
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:23,375
But even here it is regarded as a time today,

44
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,959
it's the day that the end of the Sankrant,

45
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,500
means the end of the calamity is over.

46
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,583
And they give something sweet to eat

47
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,709
which is also mixed with sesame seeds,

48
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,999
because sesame seed is heat-giving.

49
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:45,875
So today being the coldest day they want to give sesame seed,

50
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:49,625
also want you to retain the heat

51
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:53,041
and to adjust yourself to the heat that's coming up.

52
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,041
This is all thought of in a way,

53
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,375
in a very gross level,

54
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,834
on a very gross level,

55
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:02,375
that we should keep the people warm enough.

56
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,583
Also it is said that

57
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:10,917
the warmth of love should be expressed at this time

58
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:14,125
for people, because it is the coldest day.

59
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,959
So they say that "We give you this special thing for you

60
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,041
to say something sweet" - that is "goad goad bola"

61
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,917
- means "you say something sweet to us."

62
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,625
And the people who live in warm countries are sweeter people

63
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,709
than the people who live in colder places,

64
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:34,583
because the nature is rather very unkind to them.

65
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,834
I don't blame them for their temperament,

66
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,583
because the nature is so unkind.

67
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:41,917
In India you can live anywhere:

68
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,750
you can live under a tree,

69
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,917
you can live in a forest,

70
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:49,166
anywhere you can live quite happily,

71
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:53,166
as long as there is water to drink and water to bathe.

72
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:57,291
And there's not such a problem as

73
00:07:57,542 --> 00:08:00,208
we have to face in the other parts of the world,

74
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,333
where if you have to go out of the house

75
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,999
you take about fifteen, twenty minutes to dress yourself up.

76
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:07,917
Here you just can walk out of the house,

77
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:10,917
you can keep your houses open during the summer-time,

78
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,750
and there's no problem of any kind

79
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:15,917
as far as the nature is concerned.

80
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:20,625
Nature becomes very kind during summer-time here because

81
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:25,458
the trees are lush and lot of greenery,

82
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,750
people feel very happy during that time,

83
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:37,792
and all the activity becomes more with the sun's energy.

84
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:43,583
But in the West as you have seen that the sun is much less.

85
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:45,166
Because of that,

86
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,083
people keep more to their houses,

87
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,667
to artificial heating or other heatings,

88
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:52,000
and the doors are closed,

89
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,917
the hearts are closed,

90
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,999
and it's difficult for them to

91
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,000
communicate with other people.

92
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,333
As you go down south more in your countries also,

93
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,583
you'll find people are warmer,

94
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,792
simpler,

95
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:17,667
very hospitable.

96
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:23,041
With the sun you get the heart which is very open heart,

97
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:27,041
and a kind of a inviting heart.

98
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:30,750
Now if you see on the Sahaja Yoga style,

99
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:33,333
the sun line is the right side

100
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,834
and the moon, moon is the left side.

101
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,999
On the moon line

102
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,542
one can desire but cannot act.

103
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,792
Apart from that, on the moon line

104
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:48,750
if you go too far it can be destructive.

105
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,875
Because if you sit in the house doing nothing

106
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:56,917
- and also these days there's unemployment, say for example,

107
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:01,750
no work - then you start thinking too much,

108
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:07,417
and this thinking is just the desire energy working out,

109
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:08,875
no action.

110
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,875
And without the action

111
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,458
this energy can become very destructive.

112
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:16,417
That is why we find that people,

113
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,417
they say that "empty mind,

114
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:24,417
empty mind is the devil's workshop."

115
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,625
Where people have, do not act,

116
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,291
when the action doesn't take place,

117
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,667
then it can be quite destructive...

118
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:45,166
So the whole situation is different

119
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,875
in a country which is warm,

120
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,208
and a country which is not warm.

121
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:53,417
But in a country where it is very warm also,

122
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:54,792
like Africa,

123
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:58,208
there are complications due to too much of heat.

124
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:04,333
Like we have the tropic of -

125
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,625
mean the equator passing through,

126
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,750
and it heats up that area so much

127
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,041
that it becomes full of jungles,

128
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,999
very high trees and tall trees;

129
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:21,999
and the whole place is covered with foliage so much

130
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:24,417
that there's no possibility

131
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:30,750
for any sunshine to penetrate through,

132
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,625
and it's quite dark,

133
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:35,291
it's full of darkness.

134
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:39,709
So that extreme also comes in the same category

135
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,500
as the extreme of the cold season.

136
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:44,709
Now such people live there

137
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,458
and they, naturally because the sun is less,

138
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,750
so they do not grow much;

139
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,834
and they can be primitive people

140
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,375
and they can be quite aggressive,

141
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,125
like they learn things from the animals

142
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,959
and they could be quite aggressive.

143
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,041
So the balance has to be struck,

144
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,291
and the balance is that,

145
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:15,750
that we should desire and act.

146
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:21,458
But the trouble is in human atmosphere

147
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,959
there is a division of labor, I think,

148
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:30,250
that one part of the country is thinking,

149
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,000
another part of the country is acting.

150
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,834
Under these circumstances nothing works out.

151
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:42,375
So a balance has to be struck where

152
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:45,917
you have the Sushumna working out.

153
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:49,375
Now the Sushumna Nadi is the one where

154
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:53,750
one would say is the equator - it's not,

155
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,125
is not the equator,

156
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:58,834
but is the axis of the Mother Earth.

157
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,166
Axis of the Mother Earth is the Sushumna,

158
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,166
and that has to act;

159
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,250
and when it comes to that axis then we should understand that we have to be on our axis.

160
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:13,166
So we are on the axis,it is the one that balances.

161
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:17,875
Actually there is, there is, there is nothing

162
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,750
like a big pole

163
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,875
inside the Mother Earth which we can call it as an axis.

164
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:27,083
There is nothing that is material

165
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:30,458
inside the Mother Earth that we can call it as an axis,

166
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,083
but it's the energy force

167
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,667
which acts in such a manner

168
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:39,417
that the Earth moves with such tremendous speed

169
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:42,750
when the cosmos is all spread out so much.

170
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:47,208
It not only moves but it creates day and night for us,

171
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,792
so that day-time we can work and night-time we can sleep,

172
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:52,458
to give us a balance.

173
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,999
Only also it moves in such a manner round the sun

174
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:03,542
that half of the countries get the sun

175
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:05,458
during the summer-time,

176
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:09,875
and half of them get it during the winter-time.

177
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,750
That's the axis that acts and works out everything.

178
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:14,917
Apart from that,

179
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:19,667
this axis keeps all the distances necessary

180
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:24,291
from other planets and other moving bodies in the cosmos.

181
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:29,000
This axis is the intelligence of the Mother Earth.

182
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:35,083
It is not only the intelligence but it is the fragrance,

183
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:39,917
and apart from, it is the Sushumna Nadi,

184
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:42,000
you can say, of the Mother Earth.

185
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:46,458
Now through this axis only all these swayambhus

186
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:51,542
and all these great happenings of earthquakes

187
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,458
and all that takes place.

188
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,208
This axis is the one which moves.

189
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,291
It's an energy, we can call it axis as the energy,

190
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:04,166
moves the lava into different directions

191
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:12,208
and pierces through different areas to create earthquakes,

192
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,041
and also to have

193
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:22,709
... volcanoes, volcanoes.

194
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:28,709
And all these things happen because the axis has sense

195
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:29,959
what is to be done.

196
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:33,041
This axis is the one that loves us.

197
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Because of this axis we,

198
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:38,709
we have seasons.

199
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:42,375
The seasons are created beautifully to give us

200
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,458
different, different varieties of food

201
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,959
and varieties of things.

202
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,959
The heat of the Mother Earth if it is lost,

203
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,500
then we'll have nothing on this Earth,

204
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,166
it'll be all frozen and there will be all snow,

205
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,041
and we'll have no food, nothing,

206
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,000
and it will be like moon living here.

207
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,166
Now it has been specially created:

208
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:14,125
first the Mother Earth when it was created

209
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,041
through the heat of the sun,

210
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,834
so we can say that the sun is the father of the Mother Earth.

211
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,041
Then she was brought very close to the moon

212
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,125
so it cooled down, absolutely it cooled down,

213
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,709
it was all snow.

214
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,625
Then it was brought closer to the sun

215
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:37,500
and moved at a point where

216
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,250
life could start working,

217
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,709
and that's how the whole thing was organized beautifully

218
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,917
to make life grow in that area.

219
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,125
Now when the life started growing,

220
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:53,834
gradually we know that how the carbon was formed.

221
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:57,417
Now the carbon is formed by the same axis,

222
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,625
because there's heat in the axis,

223
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,750
the energy of heat that converts

224
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:10,999
the plants into carbon.

225
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,875
Now this carbon is, later on

226
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,709
forms the basis for,

227
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:19,417
we can say,

228
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:25,999
for the production of carbohydrates,

229
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:27,250
you can say,

230
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,834
or all organic matter.

231
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:34,166
But to create life we had to have another help,

232
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,750
is the nitrogen;

233
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,291
and this nitrogen was also, you'll be surprised to know,

234
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:43,417
that was created by the same axis, by its movement.

235
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:46,291
And when it created this nitrogen,

236
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,000
the nitrogen gave us the amino acids;

237
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,709
and when the amino acids were created within us,

238
00:17:53,125 --> 00:18:00,041
then we started our lives from amoeba and all that.

239
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:04,542
Of course this was done in the ocean,

240
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,583
because in the ocean with the movement,

241
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,999
nitrogen was created and life was created,

242
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,166
and then through the ocean it's emitted out,

243
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:17,417
and that's how we have amino acids.

244
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,125
With the amino acids, the formation of amino acids

245
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,125
gave us the combinations and permutations,

246
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,417
different lives.

247
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,709
So in the whole evolutionary process

248
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:32,709
the Mother Earth has played a very big part through her axis.

249
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,166
In the same way in human beings,

250
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:38,291
the axis is the most important thing.

251
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:42,750
That's the main principle of life we have got, is our axis.

252
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,417
We have to stand on our axis.

253
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,250
Those who do not stand on their axis,

254
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,625
stand more towards the left or towards the right,

255
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:56,166
are capable of complete destruction;

256
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,291
because either they will be destroyed by

257
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:03,041
too much of right side or too much of left side.

258
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:07,875
So our axis has to be properly dealt with.

259
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:11,125
Now those people who do not have a proper axis

260
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:14,500
can have problems of different chakras,

261
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:20,250
of different kind of quality in a person.

262
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,458
A person who stretches his axis too much,

263
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,500
puts back his head like this,

264
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,750
is a person who is very right-sided

265
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,458
and creates problem with his ego;

266
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,834
and the one who absolutely bends down

267
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:38,750
like a slavish person also is a person

268
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,291
who goes towards his destructiveness.

269
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:46,166
Now there's a big problem between these two types of people,

270
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
one trying to dominate another,

271
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,750
and when they start dominating another person

272
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,875
they actually destroy themselves,

273
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,917
as well as destroy the ones whom they are dominating.

274
00:19:57,917 --> 00:19:59,250
For example now,

275
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,750
we have seen that we had

276
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,834
Britishers who came here and ruled us.

277
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:10,375
We have seen the French went and ruled some other people,

278
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,208
then there are Portuguese who went and ruled

279
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,458
some other people.

280
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,375
But everything that they did to dominate

281
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,458
and all that has double reactions.

282
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:21,041
First of all by their domination, say,

283
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,125
Indians became very slavish,

284
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,709
Indians became - even today they are extremely slavish,

285
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,583
and they do not have that independent axis

286
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,834
as they should have.

287
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:33,125
Extremely slavish people they are.

288
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,333
I mean, especially I've seen in the West,

289
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,625
I am surprised when the Indians go from here,

290
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,709
I find they are so very slavish.

291
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:44,166
They try to sort of do all kinds of slavish acts

292
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,917
to please the white-skinned people.

293
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:53,000
The white skin became sort of a very adorable stuff in India.

294
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,375
That added to the ego of the whites,

295
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:00,709
added to the ego of the whites,

296
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:02,917
and today you see what's happening is

297
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,000
all that ego is destroying them.

298
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,458
They are on the verge of destruction because of their ego.

299
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:12,041
So it is so unnatural and it is so superficial.

300
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,625
One has to understand that what is the best

301
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,000
within a human being is his axis,

302
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,959
and everybody has an axis,

303
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:23,625
and one must respect the axis of every person.

304
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:28,000
In Sahaja Yoga I don't know you by your faces so much;

305
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,709
I know you by your chakras,

306
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:31,959
by your Sushumna,

307
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,583
what sort of a Sushumna you have.

308
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,959
If you have a deep Sushumna, I know you as a deep person.

309
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,375
If you have a superficial Sushumna,

310
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,792
I know you as a person with a very superficial

311
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:45,000
type of a Sushumna.

312
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,458
And even if you make up something

313
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,917
by sort of being very nice or good,

314
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,125
or talking about Sahaja Yoga

315
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,375
or knowing too much about Sahaja Yoga,

316
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:01,583
and saying things which will baffle normally anyone

317
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,959
as if you are masters of Sahaja Yoga,

318
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:06,000
I know how deep you are.

319
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,041
So the depth on the axis

320
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,375
is more important than anything else.

321
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:15,125
Your axis has to be very deep.

322
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,875
Now you will say that "Mother,

323
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:21,166
the axis is the same as it is, so how can it be deep?"

324
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:25,625
So the, in the axis as you see is made in human beings,

325
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:31,375
is like a three-and-a-half coiled paper-like thing,

326
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:35,500
and the inside of it is the Brahma Nadi.

327
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,000
The Brahma Nadi is a very, very small little,

328
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:43,375
we can call a very, very hair-like thing

329
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:48,375
where only a hair-like Kundalini can pass through.

330
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:52,458
But when the person is deep this Brahma Nadi is bigger,

331
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:54,166
and all the rest of them

332
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:59,125
which are coiled into each otherare smaller;

333
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:02,041
while the people who are not deep, their outside

334
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:08,166
what you call the foldings are bigger

335
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:11,041
than the inside small thing.

336
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:14,959
Now such people could be apparently very dynamic,

337
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:17,834
may look very intelligent, may look very smart,

338
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:20,000
may look to be very good-looking

339
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,250
or whatever it may be outwardly,

340
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,625
but inwardly they are not deep.

341
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,000
Inwardly if they are deep,

342
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,875
their whole attitude is beautiful.

343
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:34,166
They are very joy-giving people,

344
00:23:34,709 --> 00:23:36,291
they are very joy-giving.

345
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:41,000
And the more if you meet a person of another kind

346
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:44,458
he may look joyous, he may try to give you joy,

347
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,834
but the joy won't be really that deep;

348
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:50,583
it would be like a joy-killing.

349
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:57,000
So it is important for us to make our axis deeper,

350
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:01,834
and that is where we lack the proper assiduity,

351
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:06,500
the proper effort we have to put in.

352
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:12,166
Now some people have automatically a very deep axis,

353
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:17,834
and some people have very, very what you should say,

354
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:22,834
a very constricted type of the axis.

355
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,500
This axis has to be grown.

356
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,875
Now when you come for My puja and all that

357
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,750
I do expand it, I agree,

358
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,500
but it is temporary thing.

359
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:38,583
To retain it at that point one has to work at home,

360
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:40,834
in the collective also.

361
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:46,041
One has to work very much at home with meditation.

362
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,041
But it should be done seriously.

363
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:51,250
It should not be just a joke,

364
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:52,834
to be frivolous,

365
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:55,500
to be stupid - that's not the way.

366
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,375
It should be done very seriously, in the meaning

367
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:02,166
that it is a devoted task you have taken,

368
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,375
it's a meditative thing;

369
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,625
it's a prayer to God we can call it,

370
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,625
it's a puja to God.

371
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:15,000
Is to be done with that reverence,

372
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:22,250
because reverence is the key of achievement.

373
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:26,500
If you have no reverence about yourself

374
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,291
and no reverence of others,

375
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:30,250
then it cannot be done.

376
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,750
But first you must have reverence for your own life.

377
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,583
"What am I doing with my life?

378
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:36,875
Where am I wasting it?

379
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:38,000
Why should I waste it?

380
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,166
Why shouldn't I be deep?

381
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:42,250
After all, there must be some purpose of my life.

382
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,000
Am I serving my purpose, am I doing that?"

383
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:48,792
All these things if they pop into your head,

384
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:52,792
then you will understand it's very easy to fight out your ego,

385
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,208
because normally on small, small things people fight.

386
00:25:56,208 --> 00:26:00,375
I've seen that in Sahaja Yoga also people fight on things

387
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:04,125
like, I mean which are so useless, absolutely useless.

388
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:08,083
To Me it sounds stupid to even mention

389
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:11,000
the way people fight over small things and quarrel.

390
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:14,792
But a deep person, even if he doesn't speak much,

391
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,959
even if he doesn't show off much,

392
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:20,792
even if he doesn't sit in the front line,

393
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:23,667
he expresses himself through his depth,

394
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:26,583
because I can work out better through that.

395
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:31,000
So to develop this one must meditate,

396
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
important thing is to meditate;

397
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,750
every day, every day, every day.

398
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,750
You may not eat your food one day,

399
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,250
you may not sleep one day,

400
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,291
you may not go to your office one day,

401
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:45,458
you may not do anything that you are doing every day

402
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,625
- but you must meditate every day.

403
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,250
That's an important point,

404
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:55,959
to develop the central constricted part into a bigger area.

405
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:04,250
Now when that happens that you start developing it,

406
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,917
the first thing you will notice about yourself

407
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:10,000
that you do not care for any comfort,

408
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:13,375
you're not bothered about any,

409
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:17,417
any material thing.

410
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:20,166
Whatever it is you are above it,

411
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:22,417
you just don't bother your head - let it be.

412
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:25,041
You just don't want to put your neck

413
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:28,291
into a thing where you do not belong.

414
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:30,125
You just get out of it,

415
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,667
and you think that

416
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:35,917
"Oh God, this is too much for me, I just don't care for it."

417
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:39,458
So your whole attention now moves inward.

418
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:41,875
When the attention starts moving inward

419
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:43,875
then it expands more.

420
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:47,333
It's the inner part which is called as the Brahma Nadi,

421
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:52,208
and starts expanding and expanding.

422
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:55,000
Now in small, small things also:

423
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:56,917
say for example

424
00:27:57,834 --> 00:28:01,041
if I have not mentioned somebody

425
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:03,959
and mentioned somebody else,

426
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:06,500
then they feel,

427
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,875
"Oh, why didn't Mother mention my name?"

428
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:12,500
It's too small a thing that it doesn't matter.

429
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,709
As long as you have a deep axis you are with Me,

430
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:21,041
I am with you, absolutely one with each other.

431
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,667
But these outward things are,

432
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,917
"Oh, She gave a nice sari to another one,

433
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:28,250
She never gave us a sari, She didn't do this,

434
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,500
didn't do that."

435
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,000
All those things if it comes to your head,

436
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,834
that means absolutely it's true

437
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:38,500
that there is something lacking in you.

438
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,083
Or if you try to complain,

439
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:43,792
"Oh, I went there, I had to go by a bus

440
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:45,792
and I had to stand on this thing,"

441
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:48,458
that shows that you are not comforted at all.

442
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:53,250
This widening comforts you.

443
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:55,917
That's the comforting thing,

444
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:59,458
and that really makes you feel so comfortable

445
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:04,917
in any circumstance, in any position, in any lifestyle,

446
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:11,125
and you do not want to have any other comfort.

447
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:16,333
And this one has to develop,

448
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:18,333
through meditative effort.

449
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:22,542
Secondly is, we have to know that Sahaja Yoga

450
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:25,125
as it is today is a collective happening.

451
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:28,834
I find especially among Indian men,

452
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:31,041
they never do any work with their hands,

453
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:32,458
which is a wrong thing.

454
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:35,250
Because they don't use their hands at all

455
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
their collectivity is poor, very poor.

456
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,834
Indians have the worst collectivity.

457
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:42,000
If you have an ashram,

458
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,667
I don't know why should we build the ashram,

459
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:45,333
nobody is going to stay there.

460
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:48,667
They want to have their own houses,

461
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:49,999
their own families,

462
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:51,583
their own children;

463
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:54,333
they are the worst of all for collectivity.

464
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:58,333
The reason is, Indian men never do any work with their hands.

465
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:02,792
They cannot nail one nail - there are many like that

466
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,542
- leave alone repairing anything.

467
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:09,667
They will stand with their hands on their hips

468
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:13,667
and would just tell work to other people, you see.

469
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,583
There's a Marathi saying,

470
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:18,375
a very interesting ....

471
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:25,959
that is, "To sit on a camel and to drive the goats."

472
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:30,041
So that is very typical of Indian men.

473
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:31,709
They cannot repair anything,

474
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:33,250
they cannot do anything.

475
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,834
Now if supposing somebody is spreading something,

476
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,375
they'll just stand like this, watch,

477
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,375
they'll never put their hands to it.

478
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:42,625
So for every Sahaja yogi it is important

479
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:45,166
what we call as shramadaan.

480
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,834
They have to do some shramadaan.

481
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:52,875
"Shramadaan" means the giving of some labor,

482
00:30:54,834 --> 00:30:57,375
and that is what we lack.

483
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:02,999
That even if it comes to that you'd better clean your house,

484
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:05,166
you'd better clean the outside of your house,

485
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:07,625
try to put some garden around your house,

486
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,417
try to paint your house,

487
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:11,875
do some sort of a work with your hand

488
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:15,041
which even if you don't have anything,

489
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:19,166
you can even brush your hair or something like that.

490
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:23,625
Whatever you think is the easiest you can start with,

491
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:25,750
because I don't think people even do that.

492
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,875
Even they don't shave themselves,

493
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:30,375
they get the person to shave them - I mean,

494
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:33,291
absolutely lazy lumps as they are.

495
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:36,291
Now, but on the contrary

496
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:39,250
we see in the West people use their hands.

497
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:41,750
Because of that, you see,

498
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:44,500
because they can use their hands, they are very collective.

499
00:31:44,792 --> 00:31:47,750
So they score a point on being collective,

500
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,875
while the Indians score a point because

501
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,792
they are Indians and they have a heritage

502
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:52,999
and they know what is Kundalini,

503
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:55,333
they know about Ganesha, they know everything.

504
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,542
So they score a point this side.

505
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:59,458
So it's the left side is the desire,

506
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:00,999
the right side is the action;

507
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:03,875
again we come back to the same position where

508
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:05,291
we have an imbalance,

509
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,667
that the action takes place in the West,

510
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:12,583
and here is only thinking - "all right, we'll do this"

511
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:15,458
- planning. Everything is a planning point.

512
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:19,083
Nothing works out. You go on planning, planning, planning.

513
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:21,750
Now we are building one single ashram

514
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,417
in Delhi for the last, I think, ten years.

515
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:30,834
It is like Taj Mahal, I tell you!

516
00:32:34,709 --> 00:32:37,500
And it's so difficult, you see,

517
00:32:37,917 --> 00:32:40,041
to understand why they have taken so much time

518
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,500
when it's not a very big place, nothing.

519
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:46,709
But it is not only the Sahaja yogis but other factors also,

520
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,834
because everybody is like that, everything is postponed,

521
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:52,500
everything is to be done tomorrow.

522
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,834
"This we will do tomorrow."

523
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:56,834
Then one person will come, another person won't come.

524
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:01,500
Like we used to have in the school,

525
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:07,792
we would get a sum like that or something to solve that,

526
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:11,000
see, there were: one house was built,

527
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,250
three persons came to work and one ran away.

528
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:18,458
Then two persons came to work and one stayed

529
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:19,792
and two ran away;

530
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:24,041
and then five persons came to work and two persons ran away.

531
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:26,667
So how, when will the house be finished?

532
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:28,500
Never!

533
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:34,333
With such runaways it can never be finished.

534
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:35,500
It's like that.

535
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,667
So this is what, where we lack collectivity.

536
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:41,375
I was saying that all Indians must find out

537
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:45,583
some place where they could go and plant something.

538
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:48,083
Get hold of some sort of a place

539
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:52,208
where they could go and plant some nice banyan trees,

540
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:55,458
water it together, work it out together.

541
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:58,000
Now the Indian women are that way better.

542
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,041
They do lot of work as far as the cooking is concerned

543
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:02,458
and all that,

544
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,500
but the other part is missing.

545
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,709
The other part is intelligence,

546
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:08,959
it's the other part is to think.

547
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:11,583
Now if all the time what they are thinking,

548
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:14,792
"Oh, my husband likes this, I must cook this for him,"

549
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:19,000
and now if the husband has to have a, say,

550
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,375
a lemon with his food.

551
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:21,792
Now there's no lemon in the house.

552
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:24,041
This woman would run up and down all over the place

553
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:25,917
to get the lemon for the husband,

554
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:27,792
otherwise he will not eat the food.

555
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:28,500
Doesn't matter,

556
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,375
once in a while if he doesn't eat it's all right.

557
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:35,834
But the women will try,

558
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:38,041
because you see they must keep their,

559
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:39,500
they understand one thing

560
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,333
that you must keep their palate all right.

561
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:43,792
Then they are quite sensible in India

562
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,999
because here they're real tigers,

563
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:47,792
all the husbands are like tigers,

564
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:50,083
so you have to keep them feeding; otherwise you see,

565
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:52,709
God knows when the tiger will jump on you.

566
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:56,458
The other way round in England or America I've seen,

567
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:57,917
the husbands are like,

568
00:34:57,917 --> 00:35:01,208
just like goats and the women are like tigers!

569
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:11,709
And the Westernized Indian women also are like that,

570
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:13,542
and when they go to West,

571
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:16,792
even simple women I've seen they become like tigresses.

572
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,875
Something surprising how they change immediately

573
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:22,667
to the position, even if they may not wear the jeans

574
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:23,917
and all those things,

575
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:25,542
but they become like that.

576
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:29,250
So this imbalancing starts in a human being

577
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,208
when he doesn't understand

578
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:33,542
that you have to be a axis of the Mother Earth,

579
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:37,291
and neither the Capricorn or the Cancer.

580
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:42,125
This balance comes through our depth,

581
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,333
and that depth has to be improved.

582
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:49,875
Not through just by talking about it,

583
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:52,041
by talking about Sahaja Yoga,

584
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:55,417
but actually seriously doing meditation,

585
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:58,166
actually seriously doing meditation.

586
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:05,291
Secondly, we must do some collective work.

587
00:36:05,709 --> 00:36:08,542
Now we have in India, say, architects.

588
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,166
They have never touched anything with their own hands.

589
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:16,291
They are sitting and drawing, you see, that's all - finished.

590
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,500
Now after the drawing, do what you like.

591
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,166
And now they have problems, practical problems,

592
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,667
they cannot nail one nail.

593
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:28,709
All are what you call them as white-collar...

594
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:32,208
Absolutely useless for any handwork.

595
00:36:32,542 --> 00:36:35,000
They cannot do any handwork whatsoever.

596
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,999
Even if they have to lift, say, one of these chairs

597
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,250
and stretch them, they cannot do it, normally.

598
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:45,750
So under these circumstances one has to understand

599
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:50,208
that we come from a society which is absolutely ruinous

600
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,333
as far as collectivity is concerned,

601
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:55,000
so let us be collective.

602
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,583
Let us try to do something collective.

603
00:36:57,999 --> 00:37:01,000
But the collectivity is so poor in India,

604
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,417
so poor that even they do not treat their wives nicely.

605
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:09,583
They'll not talk to their wife nicely,

606
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:11,083
to their children nicely;

607
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:15,417
to them it is absolutely adharmic to be kind to their wives.

608
00:37:18,792 --> 00:37:21,792
Now the other side is that the Western people

609
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,333
care so much for collectivity that

610
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:26,667
whatever it is they try to compromise,

611
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:29,750
and try to keep the family life all right.

612
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,542
So it's the two extremes as we have.

613
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:37,917
Despite that somehow, thanks to the wisdom of Indian women,

614
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:39,999
the family life is going strong.

615
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:44,291
But if you see such men in England,

616
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:47,125
I can tell you nobody will stand the nonsense

617
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:49,875
that Indian men do to their women here.

618
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:55,750
Absolutely, it cannot be forgiven the way they behave.

619
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:59,291
So the balance between the women and men:

620
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:01,709
what is the axis, is the home.

621
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:04,250
Home is the axis.

622
00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:07,333
In the home, what sort of talks you have?

623
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:09,083
What do you think about,

624
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:10,583
what is your problem?

625
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:12,458
Where is your attention,

626
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,250
what do you discuss?

627
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:16,792
That's very important to see.

628
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:18,875
In that you'll find out

629
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:21,083
what is going on in the family.

630
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:23,750
Say you are talking ill of each other,

631
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:27,458
if you are telling your child against your husband,

632
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,750
husband is telling the wife against,

633
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:33,333
telling the children about, against the,

634
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:38,125
against the husband, like that.

635
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:39,834
If it is going on like that,

636
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:41,125
then what happens,

637
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:44,625
that there cannot be the axis which is all right.

638
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:46,834
The axis is love,

639
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:49,250
axis is love,

640
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:52,959
but not exploitation nor spoiling - it's love.

641
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:57,041
In country like ours, you see, what is the axis we have?

642
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,000
The axis of our country is adhyatma.

643
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:08,000
We have to now get over this hankering after money,

644
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,208
development, this, that. First take to adhyatma.

645
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:16,792
If people get realization before they are developed,

646
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:20,834
there won't be the problem of creating another America here.

647
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:23,166
We don't have to become communist,

648
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:24,834
we don't have to do anything like that,

649
00:39:24,834 --> 00:39:26,999
because communists are just the same as Americans,

650
00:39:26,999 --> 00:39:29,750
there's no difference at all in temperament.

651
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:34,166
If an American is allowed to stay in Russia

652
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:36,375
he'll behave the same way as a Russian behaves,

653
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,041
and if a Russian is sent to America

654
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:40,750
he behaves the same way as the Americans behave.

655
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,166
There's no change at all.

656
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:48,750
Now if the axis of adhyatma in any country

657
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:54,041
where a person achieves his spiritual ascent

658
00:39:55,417 --> 00:39:59,999
is, becomes the most important thing and is achieved,

659
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,291
then any amount of development,

660
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:04,542
any amount of all these things

661
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:08,625
cannot destroy that country,

662
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:10,250
cannot create wars.

663
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,166
There will be peace everywhere,

664
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:14,166
there will be enjoyment everywhere.

665
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:16,834
So on this day of Makar Sankrant

666
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:19,750
let us say now the Sankrant is over,

667
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:23,166
and we have to look forward to the new age

668
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:30,750
of a new moon blessing us,

669
00:40:30,999 --> 00:40:34,041
and the great sun coming over

670
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,542
to give us all the energy we need,

671
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:43,875
to celebrate the advent of the golden age of Sahaja Yoga.

672
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:45,999
May God bless you all.

673
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:55,667
Now for the puja,

674
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:57,709
the Makar Sankrant Puja is very little,

675
00:40:57,709 --> 00:41:01,542
it's the puja of the Surya Devata, I don't know ...

676
00:42:29,875 --> 00:42:31,458
From the foreign country,

677
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:35,291
who is going to stay after the

678
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:45,458
11th, that is on the 12th? On the 12th - after the 12th.

679
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:52,375
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten ...

680
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:58,333
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

681
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,625
All right, let's put it,

682
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:04,709
who is going to stay in Bombay after the 11th?

683
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,917
When are these people going?

684
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,375
Those who are going to stay in Bombay after the 11th,

685
00:43:18,959 --> 00:43:22,333
when are they going, when are you going?

686
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:28,000
You are coming to Pratishthan. All right.

687
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:31,000
What about you, John?

688
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Do you want to stay here in Bombay,

689
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,166
or you want to stay in Pratishthan?

690
00:43:55,959 --> 00:43:57,959
I mean, there's no arrangements here,

691
00:43:57,959 --> 00:44:02,333
so all those who are not going on the 11th or 12th,

692
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:05,250
like that, in the near future,

693
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:09,458
how many are those who are going to stay longer?

694
00:44:18,959 --> 00:44:22,125
About thirty-four. How many men and how many ladies?

695
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:33,041
So we have decided that the men can come to Pratishthan,

696
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:36,375
and the rest of the ladies can go to Alibagh.

697
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:39,625
The reason is Pratishthan is still extremely spartan.

698
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:41,709
It's not meant for ladies at all,

699
00:44:41,709 --> 00:44:44,125
and I have only one room where I live.

700
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:47,125
So best thing would be to send all the ladies...

701
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:57,250
Let them go to Alibagh,

702
00:44:57,625 --> 00:45:00,583
and let them pay for their stay in Alibagh

703
00:45:00,959 --> 00:45:04,792
to people who will be looking after them.

704
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:07,125
Those who are coming to Pratishthan,

705
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:10,917
how many there are? The rest of the men, about fifty.

706
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,834
Fifty, all right.

707
00:45:14,709 --> 00:45:18,333
So when are you going back with the whole thing?

708
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:25,458
You see, because it's such a liability, this work.

709
00:45:25,917 --> 00:45:27,041
You can come to Pratishthan

710
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:29,041
if you want to take some photographs or things,

711
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:31,625
but it's a liability for us because,

712
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:33,959
you see, unless and until you go back,

713
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:36,458
it will be a liability on our head all the time.

714
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,583
So best thing is that you come to Pratishthan,

715
00:45:38,834 --> 00:45:41,166
do a little photography or whatever you want to do.

716
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:43,792
And then you'd better book yourself,

717
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,583
because this must go out of our country,

718
00:45:46,917 --> 00:45:48,709
otherwise they're always on our head,

719
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:52,000
and they are following us.

720
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:55,333
So I am sorry, but you'll have to go with this ...

721
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:57,625
stuff that you are carrying.

722
00:45:57,999 --> 00:46:00,750
So we will have to do it in three, four days' time.

723
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,750
You can finish the photography there,

724
00:46:04,999 --> 00:46:06,458
and you fix up your going.

725
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,667
So for all the ladies who are going to stay on,

726
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:14,542
can go in Washi or can go to Alibagh.

727
00:46:14,999 --> 00:46:16,333
Alibagh is better...

728
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:22,792
They can go to Alibagh and stay there in Alibagh,

729
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,125
about thirteen or fourteen ladies...

730
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,959
All right, so done.

731
00:46:38,959 --> 00:46:42,208
Now let's ... Atharv, Ganesha ...

732
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:46,792
Twenty-one people from America have to go,

733
00:46:46,792 --> 00:46:49,333
so we'll try to finish the puja as soon as possible,

734
00:46:49,709 --> 00:46:51,583
and they can leave.
