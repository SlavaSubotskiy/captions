1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:09,230
I'm telling them about love, all-pervading
love of God Almighty.

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,200
He's created this whole thing.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,160
The whole atmosphere is there.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,759
The whole feeling is there of love.

5
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:29,380
But it's possible only for people who are
innocent, like children.

6
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:35,550
If you are very mature in your hatred, no
one can save you.

7
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,379
You'll have ten arguments to show that your
hatred is justifiable.

8
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,940
Then you'll go to any extent to justify it.

9
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:53,750
We had people in our country, which is a very,
supposed to be a very, sober country, a very

10
00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:00,469
peaceful country, we had people who just believe
in killing - kill this, kill that.

11
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:09,140
So even in this country, which didn't believe
in all these things, indulged into all kinds

12
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,820
of violence since long.

13
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:23,490
But basically we are people who believe in
peace, because without peace no growth can

14
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,590
take place.

15
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,490
There has to be complete peace.

16
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:34,840
If there is peace in your heart, if there
is peace surrounding you, you grow into a

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,710
beautiful nation.

18
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:53,010
Not out of fear, not out of pressure, but
from inside; if you are a person who has complete

19
00:01:53,010 --> 00:02:00,810
peace within the heart, not that he is not
afraid of anything, but he emits peace.

20
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,780
He gives peace.

21
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,179
Anybody who goes near such a person, gets
the peace, the feeling of peacefulness.

22
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:13,200
You all are Sahaja Yogis.

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,350
You all have got your Realization.

24
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:24,420
That is, your spirit is now emitting vibrations
of peace and joy.

25
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:31,540
Wherever you are, you will emit peaceful vibrations.

26
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,049
You will create peace.

27
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:43,730
You'll find out ways of creating peace, how
to establish peaceful atmosphere.

28
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:54,230
It's very important that we have to grow in
such a manner that we create peace and give

29
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,489
peace to others and become examples of it.

30
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:08,060
I cannot believe in this Delhi I could have
so many people who are realised souls.

31
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,420
I never expected.

32
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:24,060
First of all, I had to wait until people got
into a proper mind to understand My work,

33
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:33,200
because we had partition and so many people
lost their lives, lost their properties and

34
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
I have faced all that.

35
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:42,299
I have seen it Myself and they just couldn't;
couldn't forgive other people.

36
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:55,870
So forgiveness is a very good method of understanding
the pain of others; troubles of others, but

37
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,840
this depth you have to develop.

38
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:09,489
Instead of getting angry, getting revengeful,
if you can develop that peace within yourself,

39
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:19,780
if you can manage to have the peace of your
mind through Divine love, there's no need

40
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,340
for you to do anything extra.

41
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:29,120
It's just the peace that you have, now, in
your heart.

42
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,110
Just feel it.

43
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,080
You are a peaceful person.

44
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,340
You are not a person who is easily disturbed.

45
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,863
You will never give explanations for getting
angry, for spoiling the mood of people.

46
00:04:45,863 --> 00:04:46,863
You will not do that.

47
00:04:46,863 --> 00:04:57,630
You are the ones who rise above all this anger
and this stupid revengefulness.

48
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:07,380
It is difficult to explain to those people
who are not Realized Souls, because if I talk

49
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,330
to them, they won't like it.

50
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,889
If they get their realisation, we can talk
to them.

51
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,729
So best thing you should spread Sahaja Yoga.

52
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:27,139
Spread it among Sikhs, among Muslims, among
Christians, throughout, and especially among

53
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:36,139
Hindus because nowadays I find Hindus are
also, have lost their grip over their understanding

54
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:46,139
of our country and its culture and that's
how they just revenge, they take revenge.

55
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,810
I don't understand this kind of revenge but
what to do?

56
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:59,509
People are already on that level, on that
low level, where they don't understand many

57
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:00,509
things.

58
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:12,039
For example now, they do not want people to
build a temple of Shri Rama at a particular

59
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,039
point.

60
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:19,150
Because they are not Sahaja Yogis, I can't
talk to them that that is the place where

61
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,060
He was born.

62
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,539
So we must pay full respect to His incarnation.

63
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:34,630
If that is the place He was born, we can feel
it with the vibrations, then why deny the

64
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:40,180
fact and the truth just because you don't
want it to be done?

65
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,530
It's very difficult to talk to them.

66
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:52,759
What to understand is that, what has Babar
done for us?

67
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,050
Who was Babar?

68
00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:00,729
He was a foreigner and this one was not even
built by Babar.

69
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:03,719
No, it was not.

70
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:11,819
It was somebody who was his - one of the military
man who went and built it and that's why they

71
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,720
call it a Babri Masjid.

72
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:21,539
But let us find out what happened to this
Mr. Babar.

73
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:27,509
He died, but he came from abroad.

74
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:30,770
He was not even an Indian.

75
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,430
And doesn't matter, he was not born there.

76
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:41,120
I mean, he had nothing to do with that place,
but definitely I know and you all will know,

77
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:49,419
can feel it all on your hands just now that
it is Babri Masjid, is the place where Shri

78
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:51,729
Rama was born.

79
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:59,120
Now, if you want to build a temple there,
what will go wrong with people?

80
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,449
What will happen to them if a temple is built
there?

81
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:10,110
I mean it is just a question of respect and
feelings about it.

82
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:17,410
I also take Rama's name; everybody takes His
name because such a solace and such a comfort.

83
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:24,249
But the way people look at things, it's difficult,
you can't talk to them.

84
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:37,190
Now they are talking about another nonsense
that we have one hair of Mohammed-sahib in

85
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,479
Kashmir.

86
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,050
Now somebody said that it is not His hair.

87
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,830
How do you know?

88
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,350
What is your criterion to decide whose hair
it is?

89
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:57,290
Actually, you will be amazed, when I went
to Kashmir; we were going somewhere in the

90
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:02,230
car and suddenly I felt tremendous vibrations.

91
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,261
So I asked the driver, "Why don't you take
the car on this side?"

92
00:09:06,261 --> 00:09:07,261
He said, "Why?"

93
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:08,261
"Because I want to go."

94
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:15,029
He said, "It is an old road and there are
some few people living there."

95
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:17,000
"It doesn't matter.

96
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,320
Take it."

97
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:28,860
We went near and nearer and there were some
houses of Muslims, so we called them and asked

98
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,030
them, "What is here going on?"

99
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:37,850
They said, "It is Hazrat Bal."

100
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:42,390
Even the name gives you such peace.

101
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,820
It was the hair of Muhammed-sahib.

102
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:53,060
Now Hindus don't want to know about Him and
Muslims don't want to know about Shri Ram.

103
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,240
It's very surprising.

104
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,820
They are all having their own shops and selling
there own things, but they don't understand

105
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:09,690
that whatever they are selling is the same
which the other people are selling.

106
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,740
For example, they say, "Allah."

107
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,459
Who is Allah?

108
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:24,790
According to Sahaj Yoga, Allah is nobody else
but Vishnu and Vishnu who came also as Shri

109
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,149
Ram.

110
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:34,240
So whatever they call as Allah is Shri Ram
Himself.

111
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,060
Only a Sahaj Yogi can understand that.

112
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:42,500
If you put up your hands now when I am talking,
you will be surprised what vibrations are

113
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:54,610
there because it is Shri Ram, who is Allah,
whom you are trying to insult by your stupidity.

114
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:02,120
So it could be stupidity on part of Muhammed-sahib
or on part of Hindus.

115
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,920
Hindus are also not understanding.

116
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,740
Somehow they know that is the birthplace of
Shri Ram.

117
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,329
Somehow, I don't know, somebody must have
told them.

118
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:18,120
Or maybe - I don't know how they know - they
don't know vibrations.

119
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:28,560
I haven't yet met many Hindus who have vibration
- I mean those who are what you can call fundamentalist.

120
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,940
They never have vibrations.

121
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,310
So I used to wonder, how do they know this
is the janma bhoomi of Shri Rama?

122
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,710
Maybe, somehow they come to know.

123
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,620
But they have no point to prove.

124
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:48,540
The problem is if they were Realized Souls,
if our high court judges were Realized Souls,

125
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:55,759
if our cabinet were Realized Souls, you could
have talked to them.

126
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:01,639
But they are all - what should I say?

127
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:04,970
- Absolutely blocked people.

128
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,160
How to tell them that this quarrel is a nonsense?

129
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:17,170
It is perfectly all right to build a temple
of Shri Ram.

130
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:24,660
But whatever you may say, the trouble is first
they all should get their Self Realization.

131
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:33,050
Just now, at the time when we are talking,
see, there are not sufficient people who have

132
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,709
got Self Realization.

133
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,740
You are all Realized Souls.

134
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:47,600
There was another one who told Me, who was
giving Realization to these mahantas - mahantas

135
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,850
are the people who are suppose to be saints
- and every one of them, when they got Realization,

136
00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:00,949
they got exposed, so he didn't know what to
do with them.

137
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:08,019
That may happen with anyone, even in Christian
churches or you go to Jews - everywhere you'll

138
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:10,230
find this is the problem.

139
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:16,769
If you give them Realization, they'll get
exposed.

140
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:26,640
So what's the use of disturbing all the people
who have such faith in them and think they're

141
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,160
very great people.

142
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,579
Now only way you can judge them is through
vibrations.

143
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:40,620
But out of love, I can't tell them that "You
are not Realized Souls.

144
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:46,019
You have no business to talk about Shri Ram
or about Mohammed-sahib.

145
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,560
They're much beyond you."

146
00:13:47,560 --> 00:14:00,399
So the problem now is between the people who
are not knowledgeable and those who are knowledgeable.

147
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,360
It was a very big gap before.

148
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:10,610
Only one person used to be a Realized Soul;
so they used to stone him, beat him, do all

149
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,089
kinds of things.

150
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:15,370
Now you are so many.

151
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:23,731
So, if you put up your case anywhere, even
at this stage, nobody is going to listen to

152
00:14:23,731 --> 00:14:24,731
you.

153
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:25,731
I would request you only one thing.

154
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:35,389
Give Realization to people, as many as possible,
and not to any 'spiritual' so-called people.

155
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:37,959
Because they get exposed, what's the use?

156
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:41,730
This is a common thing.

157
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,410
So many people have told Me, "We gave Realization
to one priest.

158
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,410
He got exposed."

159
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,670
"Means, what happened?"

160
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,850
"He was exposed, Mother.

161
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,569
He was put in jail."

162
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:57,300
"Aiy, this is too much.

163
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,779
After getting Realisation, he goes to jail."

164
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,089
So this is the problem.

165
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:06,720
In love, you cannot be hypocritical about
it.

166
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,420
Love - you have to be a pure personality.

167
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,339
Must try to purify yourself.

168
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:14,339
You have to change.

169
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:21,639
If you are still angry, if you are still greedy,
if you have all these things, love won't work

170
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,639
out.

171
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,769
It won't work out.

172
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:32,089
So to love someone in a Divine way is to first
understand the value of innocence.

173
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:35,899
Why I love children?

174
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:38,769
Because they're innocent.

175
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:40,940
They don't have all these things.

176
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:52,490
Like in our country these days, the epidemic
- epidemic of corruption has started - epidemic.

177
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,709
It's not simple.

178
00:15:56,709 --> 00:16:04,600
Anybody you see, after every third person,
there's an epidemic of corruption.

179
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,350
Now why?

180
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,850
Because they want money.

181
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,600
All right.

182
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,060
Then what do they do with their money?

183
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:23,509
They don't know how to hide, so they put it
in some sort of a pot or whatever it is and

184
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:27,589
the money gets lost.

185
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:29,730
If not, they are caught up.

186
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,949
That's not so important.

187
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:38,350
What's important is, 'Why have this greed?'

188
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:46,290
People who are rich are more greedy than the
people who are poor, because the poor people

189
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,500
at least have some fear of God.

190
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,860
But the rich are very greedy.

191
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,000
They're running after this, running after
that.

192
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,940
There's no end to it.

193
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:08,880
It is very surprising that in this country
of ours this new disease has started.

194
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,750
With this disease, even in Sahaja Yoga, there
are some people who have made a business out

195
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,089
of Sahaj Yoga and making money.

196
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:27,540
So greed is something that comes to you from
the right side and you start justifying it.

197
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:32,460
There's no place for love for the right side.

198
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:45,190
Now this greed has gone so far that the whole
country is getting ruined.

199
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,290
We can never progress.

200
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:53,090
We can never achieve anything because everywhere
there's greed when people are just taking

201
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,090
it.

202
00:17:54,090 --> 00:18:03,669
But if you love your country, if you have
love for your country, you won't do it.

203
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:06,280
But that love is missing.

204
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,140
They love - I don't know whom do they love.

205
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:16,320
They love their children in such a way that
they ruin their lives.

206
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,340
Love is not limited.

207
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,970
Love has to be unlimited.

208
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:27,070
Unlimited love which binds the whole world.

209
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:37,980
There is this force, there is already acting
this force; only thing you have to become

210
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:45,790
the agents of that, to become the people who
can communicate that love.

211
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:54,240
You have every right to that great wealth
of love and you can spread that all around.

212
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:03,110
But I find that even here people think in
the terms of money.

213
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,270
Money is the enemy of love.

214
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:14,720
I assure you if you have interest in money,
you can never progress in Sahaja Yoga.

215
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,620
I'm hopeless, I agree.

216
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,140
I don't know how to take interest even.

217
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,000
What is so interesting about it?

218
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,620
And people laugh at Me that "You don't know
simple things, even to count the money."

219
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,880
I said, "I know."

220
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:37,030
I can tell you like this, how much money's
there, but I'm not interested.

221
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,870
There's so many other things to be interested.

222
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,650
You see the children.

223
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,669
You see nice, nice people.

224
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:50,320
In the whole world, there are so many beautiful
people, beautiful things.

225
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:57,919
Why pay so much attention to this useless
stuff, which comes and goes?

226
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:06,010
But that is what is the most - I should say
- gripping thing that is also there.

227
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,980
In India is the worst, I think.

228
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,840
They say that India is the most corrupt country,
but I don't know.

229
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,630
I have never seen that kind of thing, but
must be true.

230
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:30,850
On such an occasion, it's very auspicious
that you should think that money is of no

231
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:42,090
value to you, has no value, and you will be
amazed, you will have never dirth of money

232
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,090
- absolutely.

233
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:55,030
This is one thing in Sahaja Yoga you have
to get, that money is of no value.

234
00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:00,720
There's no interest in money.

235
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:10,290
Your money is in getting how many people you
have in Sahaja Yoga, how many people you have

236
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:16,320
brought in Sahaja Yoga, how many people have
got this joy.

237
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,240
You have not purchased it.

238
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,159
Nobody has to purchase it.

239
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:26,010
It's free, flowing everywhere.

240
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,860
It's so joy giving.

241
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,510
What else do you want with money?

242
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,510
Nothing.

243
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:40,730
Just with money - headaches, fear and all
kinds of problems.

244
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:58,529
So, parallel to our Sahaja Yoga, it should
be the life of freedom, complete freedom and

245
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:04,730
enjoyment, nothing to worry about.

246
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,809
Nothing is dependent on money.

247
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:17,720
I have seen people living in very poor conditions,
extremely happy and joyous; while those who

248
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,600
have lots of money, especially in the foreign
countries, are rich people.

249
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,910
They have depression, all kinds of funny,
funny situations there.

250
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,640
They commit suicides.

251
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,640
Why?

252
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,940
If money was everything, why all the rich
country people commit suicide?

253
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,830
What is the gain they have?

254
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:52,640
See, and all the time what they are thinking,
how to get into a kind of a fashion.

255
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,900
Fashion, because if you have no money, you
cannot get into those fashions.

256
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:07,140
The fashions are so common now, so common,
that for that people hanker.

257
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:13,400
If they cannot get to the fashions, they think
that something has gone wrong with them, something

258
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,880
is - But not you because you are Sahaja Yogis.

259
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:24,130
Now you see these things happening, so what
have you to do?

260
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:30,940
Have pity for such people - no contempt, but
pity - and you have to tell them that, "What

261
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,080
are you doing?

262
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,350
Why are you wasting your time?

263
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:42,790
This is the best time for you to reach the
highest goal of your life, of Self Realization

264
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:47,910
and why are you so much running after all
these things?

265
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:53,610
What is it that makes you run this rat-race?"

266
00:23:53,610 --> 00:24:01,360
I think it's a breaking point everywhere and
people are thinking, but you are the people

267
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,520
who should provide.

268
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:08,350
In a very large scale, you can work it out.

269
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,190
I mean, I have seen people who have nothing
in them.

270
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,039
They are not spiritual.

271
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,020
They are not the ones who can give Realization
or anything.

272
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:25,029
But just because they are doing some social
work, they are very famous.

273
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:26,992
What is the social work?

274
00:24:26,992 --> 00:24:30,260
Looking after the poor or something like that.

275
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:41,661
Now, when your love, which is so great, which
is so effective, that starts working, you

276
00:24:41,661 --> 00:24:53,070
feel you should do something, then you'll
be amazed how your Sahaja Yoga will be understood.

277
00:24:53,070 --> 00:25:00,740
So far Sahaja Yoga is all right, people are
very nice, excellent, saintly and all.

278
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:09,230
But effect of that must be seen and people
should see the effect of that, of your love.

279
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,190
First is forgiveness.

280
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,400
You have to forgive people.

281
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,550
They are utterly stupid.

282
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:21,950
I have just now explained to you how stupid
they are.

283
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,120
So, nothing to worry about that.

284
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:34,179
If you are such a wise personality, you should
try to judge everything with wisdom and don't

285
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:46,669
fall a trap into things where you feel that
you have to do it like some fashion or some

286
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:50,340
sort of a - I should say what?

287
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,700
- some grouping.

288
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,760
No need, we are Sahaja Yogis.

289
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,790
We are self-sufficient.

290
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,539
We don't need anything.

291
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:02,770
If you are one, we are all right.

292
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,270
If you are many, we are all right.

293
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:14,130
Now you must know that you have reached a
very high state and you have touched that

294
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:18,190
love, that Universal Love of God.

295
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:24,470
So express more of that love in your daily
life.

296
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:29,420
Express more of that love in dealing with
others.

297
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:34,590
Express your love in a way that others are
made happy.

298
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:39,220
It's all something to be thought of.

299
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,159
How can you quarrel if you are real Sahaja
Yogis?

300
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,140
How can you put down others if they are Sahaja
Yogis?

301
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,232
How can you deceive others if you are Sahaja
Yogis?

302
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,232
Not possible.

303
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:55,690
You should have no interest in all these things.

304
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:04,830
That means now you are clarified and you are
clear and you are now Nirmal.

305
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,000
Nobody can touch you.

306
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,070
This sort of attitude, should have respect
for yourself.

307
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:19,480
This kind of understanding you should have
about yourself.

308
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,830
What is your role?

309
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,179
What is your position?

310
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:34,029
You should know that you are Realized Souls
and what you should do as Realized Soul that

311
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:35,029
you should know.

312
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:45,050
You are not another sort of madman running
the rat race or also you're not in competition.

313
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:49,790
You're not competitive.

314
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:57,919
You are just progressing by your own love
and blessings.

315
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,080
I know how the blessings work.

316
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:09,429
But first of all, you have to be worthy of
that blessing, otherwise - can't help it.

317
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:11,750
Your loving nature.

318
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:23,799
That's why Christ has said that you have to
be like children to enter into the Kingdom

319
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:25,539
of God.

320
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:32,669
You are already in the Kingdom of God, but
you have to be like children; how innocent

321
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:40,720
they are, how simple they are and they're
happy with small, small things.

322
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,090
They don't want something very extraordinary.

323
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:56,450
It's very surprising how our love, which is
actually, is enlightened by Divine Love, can

324
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,860
change the whole world.

325
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:08,230
How I had this idea and how it has prospered.

326
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:18,080
If you all help Me in this, I'm sure Sahaja
Yoga can do so many things, which have not

327
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,110
been achieved.

328
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:24,210
Now you go home and think whatever I have
told you.

329
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,740
Think about it.

330
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,299
What you need is introspection.

331
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,740
What you need is understanding.

332
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:34,650
"What have I done out of my life as Sahaja
Yogis?"

333
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:41,409
And then you will find out that you can do
a lot, a lot.

334
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:44,399
And that has to be done.

335
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,389
May God bless you.
