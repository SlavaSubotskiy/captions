1
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,600
These are the songs sung in Himalayas, and to be sung here

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,520
is something really remarkable, isn’t it?

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,540
They brought it all the way here to be sung here.

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,580
Now I think I have already given you a very,

5
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,520
very long lecture and the speech as you call it,

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,740
but some reactions were very good and

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,580
some could absorb it very well,

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,640
but some they said were sleeping.

9
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,630
Now these things happen because of negativity.

10
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,600
You have to fight your negativity because negativity

11
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,640
is the thing that ask questions,

12
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,520
because when I am talking I am telling the Truth,

13
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,590
absolute Truth, but it asks questions and it reflects.

14
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,710
When it starts reflecting, nothing goes in the head because

15
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,730
you are left with the past sentence and

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,590
the present you are not with it, so the whole thing

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,730
boils down to something like an escape and then

18
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,640
you escape to sleep off.

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,720
When I tried My level best today to put you on to your

20
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,550
conscious mind.

21
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,570
You have to be conscious, you have to be alert,

22
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,710
and that’s the point is: that unless and until you are

23
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,600
conscious, you cannot ascend.

24
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,630
Any abnormal person cannot ascend.

25
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,680
You have to normalize yourself.

26
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,550
So many of you had lots of abnormalities

27
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,640
which were brought out and thrown away,

28
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,640
and many have been cleansed,

29
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,540
but now if there are some still lingering with it,

30
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,520
they must work it out.

31
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,670
They cannot just go on justifying it.

32
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,620
Normally negative persons attract a negative personality.

33
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,520
So if you have such a negativity of any kind within you,

34
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,620
you should never sit next to a negative person,

35
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,730
never go near such a person, keep away but stick on

36
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,650
with the positive person, like I said stick on

37
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:25,700
and support your leaders without question,

38
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,710
without questioning, but this is the trouble that

39
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,720
you start fighting your own leader.

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
If the leader say something to you,

41
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,740
you quarrel with the leader, and you argue with the leader,

42
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,680
so it’s finished.

43
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,530
I speak through the leaders,

44
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,730
so you don’t question it.

45
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,610
 If you question it, then there will be a problem,

46
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,740
you have to stick on with your leaders

47
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,700
who are positive people.

48
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,520
And if you start questioning them,

49
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,650
then you will be nowhere, no link between you and Me.

50
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,710
And this is everywhere, I was told in Switzerland

51
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,710
it is like this, in France now it is better,

52
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,520
it’s used to be like that, everywhere, except for Italy,

53
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,740
I think Italy has the best results.

54
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,600
Don’t fight with your leaders; don’t argue with them.

55
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Do not reflect about Sahaja Yoga, what can you say?

56
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,710
What do you know? How can you reflect?

57
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,720
What is your knowledge?

58
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,620
Do you question your chemistry teacher when he says

59
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,570
hydrogen, has got two atoms or one atom?  Do you?

60
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,590
And when you start doing this with your ego,

61
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:51,660
you are thrown out of the realm of evolution.

62
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,680
So do not reflect, just listen, and try to take it inside.

63
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,640
These are all mantras; take them inside.

64
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,610
Instead of that you start questioning,

65
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,580
arguing with your leaders, giving them advices,

66
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,590
please don’t do it, stop it now.

67
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:14,510
This is no politics where everybody can advice,

68
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,500
everybody has to say something.

69
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,740
Mostly the bhoots are such;

70
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,720
only the bhootish people go on advising,

71
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,530
and having their own say.

72
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,590
And they go against the leaders throughout.

73
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,580
Now specially for the elderly people,

74
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,700
I would say because you are more grown up sometimes

75
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,570
than the leader are.

76
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,590
Then you think you have the right to correct the leaders,

77
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,520
it’s not so.

78
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,540
In Sahaja Yoga, it is not how much you are old,

79
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,620
but it is how much you are evolved.

80
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,700
So when you start questioning your leaders and

81
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,730
reflecting on their behavior or anything like that,

82
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,520
and answering them back or also giving your ideas,

83
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,560
you are gone.

84
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,720
It’s like a link.

85
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,680
Say there’s a link

86
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:09,570
between the chakras and the cells, say it like that.

87
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:16,680
Now if you deny the chakras, how one has to work it out,

88
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,650
because I am connected with them

89
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,550
and through them you are connected.

90
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,720
But when you deny them, then you fall out.

91
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,560
I know what to do with the leaders, I choose them,

92
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,660
I arrange them, I organize them, I change them;

93
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,550
I know what to do.

94
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,720
Now you people do not challenge them,

95
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,560
is nothing but your ego.

96
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,650
In India it doesn’t happen at all, doesn’t happen.

97
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,710
Once Mother is appointed somebody this is accept,

98
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,500
because for them this is the Truth

99
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,600
that they have been seeking.

100
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,510
The all other are nonsenses, it's all complications,

101
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,730
and because you are so complicated

102
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,650
that they have been look nice,

103
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,510
you think you are surrendering your personalities.

104
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:04,570
Not at all. It’s developing, surrendering yourself

105
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,570
to the sap of life, to the vitality,

106
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,550
to the vital force of life, surrender, accept more,

107
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,590
accept more.

108
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,730
This ego can never allow your to take inside anything.

109
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,700
Be careful on that.

110
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,740
This will never allow you to sleep;

111
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,540
this will never give you peace.

112
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,500
It will never allow you to grow;

113
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,560
it will never take you to your own goal,

114
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,590
so surrender that your ego of yours.

115
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,720
So one thing I have to tell you: don’t fight, don’t quarrel,

116
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,550
don’t question, don’t reflect about your leaders

117
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,630
to begin with,

118
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,550
otherwise you will be cut off.

119
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,510
Keep in his good book.

120
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,700
Try to support him, ask him what does he want,

121
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,640
what help he needs.

122
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,630
The more you get attached to him,

123
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,710
the more you get closer to him, the more you will get.

124
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,500
But see people are very wasteful.

125
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,740
They have wasted their lives in drugs, this, that,

126
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,550
all nonsense; and women have another bad habit,

127
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,600
is to gossip.

128
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,520
They want to gossip,

129
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,730
gossip about this person, criticize that person.

130
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,720
It’s a very bad habit in women to gossip.

131
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,550
I never pay heed to anyone who gossips and

132
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,580
I don’t like a person who gossips,

133
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,710
so don’t gossip about things, cheaply, frivolously talking

134
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,640
about others.

135
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,640
It’s not necessary you should be educated,

136
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,660
it’s not necessary that you should come from a

137
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,720
very well-bred family, nothing is necessary as long as you

138
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,620
are a Sahaja Yogi. You can be a diamond,

139
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,520
but allow yourself to be cut into the diamond. Allow!

140
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,720
So the reaction from some person was very good,

141
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,630
they absorbed what I said, they took everything inside,

142
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,740
but some of them went off to sleep.

143
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,630
Now, if those who were struggling at that time

144
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,740
may not have understood it - it’s a very difficult subject -

145
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,630
I told you it’s a very subtle subject, doesn’t matter.

146
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,630
But those who have been like that,

147
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:26,570
should look after themselves, should find out.

148
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,650
I found one thing with left-sided people:

149
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,560
if they can put a candle near their left Swadisthana,

150
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,640
little far, and put one candle before the photograph and

151
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,710
put left hand towards the photograph and right hand

152
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,510
on the Mother Earth, it works.

153
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,710
And the candle at the back should be kept a little far away

154
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,540
because it makes sounds, it goes this way, that way, burns.

155
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,600
Those who have been taking drugs, not LSD but other drugs,

156
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,740
who are drowsy people, who feel sleepy,

157
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,660
whose brains are destroyed by drug, all those people

158
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,690
can benefit a lot by this. Do it everyday.

159
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,560
Going into drug, you never felt your surrender to drugs,

160
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,640
never felt that

161
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,710
it was something that was going to kill you completely.

162
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,530
You know so many people are killed, so many are dying,

163
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,690
but you wanted to do that, I don’t know because

164
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,590
your ego said, “All right, go ahead, try this.

165
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,520
You are the one, nothing will happen to you.”

166
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,540
That is the ego suggests. So you did it.

167
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,580
All right doesn’t matter,

168
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,720
whatever has happened has happened, let us clear it out,

169
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,500
because we are seekers.

170
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,600
So those who have really felt one in the lecture,

171
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,660
without any questioning,

172
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,740
should know that they are doing well.

173
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,600
Those who were questioning, reflecting, should know

174
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,520
they have ego, and those who were dozing out should know

175
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,530
that they are left-sided.

176
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,550
Left side is worst than the right side

177
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,600
because right side can be easily corrected, it shows.

178
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,640
It shows outside, people don’t like it.

179
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,690
Such a person is criticized, everybody says:

180
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,540
"He is egoistical", he is this, that.

181
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:26,580
Everybody knows that such a person goes out like Hitler.

182
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,700
But the left-sided person, you see, is very

183
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,500
pitiable and you have very great pity for such a person,

184
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,610
you sympathize and you get lost with that person.

185
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,730
They are more dangerous and difficult to be cured,

186
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,520
very difficult.

187
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,550
So, it’s not an easy task, we have to work it out.

188
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,640
I am trying My level best; you should also help Me.

189
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,680
I was thinking that if you can start using little oil

190
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,570
for your head will be a good idea in the night.

191
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,510
As Sahaja yogis, you should. I think the hairstyle

192
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,630
should be changed for Sahaja Yogis.

193
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,570
This modern, fashionable style won’t suit us.

194
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,590
Because this will, we will all have bald heads one day,

195
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,680
I can tell you, and you will see the Sahashrara

196
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,500
with a big dimple here. Better use some nice coconut oil,

197
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,690
rub in your head nicely, and in the night and

198
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,540
in the morning.

199
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,560
After all, it doesn’t show much.

200
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,560
And comb your hair in a proper way because also I think

201
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,530
if your dresses are like bhoots,

202
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,690
your hair are like bhoots and the bhoots will take over

203
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,700
thinking, “Oh, this is a bhoot sitting down here;

204
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,730
I better take hold of that bhoot.”

205
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,690
So dress up in a way, shouldn’t have hair on your forehead

206
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,650
at all, keep it straight, make it nice and have it

207
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,610
absolutely clean foreheads.

208
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,560
We are Sahaja yogis. We have to change our dresses;

209
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,720
we have to change ours styles.

210
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,590
You cannot be fashionable like these stupid punks.

211
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,680
So we are a type, by our hairstyles people should know that

212
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,690
these are Sahaja yogis.

213
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,620
So before you start getting bald, better try putting

214
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,600
some oil in your head.

215
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,610
That is some very important thing

216
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,720
that Sahaja Yogis have to do.

217
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:15,650
You can take vibrated oil if you like and I think olive oil

218
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,620
is good, but better than olive oil, I find,

219
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,680
it is coconut oil is better for the growth of the hair.

220
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,580
But sometimes you can also put almond oil, is also good,

221
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,630
almond oil for you because if you have any problem

222
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:36,740
that you feel exhausted or your nerves need attention,

223
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,560
you are nervous type of person,

224
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,700
then almond oil is good for you.

225
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:47,540
And for people who have teeth which are troubling them

226
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,690
they must look after them.

227
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,530
No use going to the dentists,

228
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,630
because dentists create problems.

229
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,570
Simple thing is to use olive oil and some salt and rub it

230
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:02,610
on your gums nicely everyday before sleeping.

231
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,550
That will keep your teeth all right. You’ll be amazed,

232
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,590
till today I have not been to any dentists.

233
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,500
Never been to a dentist

234
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,600
and I hope I wouldn't go to a dentist.

235
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,620
So, but one thing is that I have certain bad habits,

236
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,560
one of them is that I brush my teeth quite often.

237
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,660
But, don’t use electrical brushes and all that,

238
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,740
but use brushes or use your fingers is the best way is to

239
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:36,570
rub with the salt and the oil, is a very good for you,

240
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,600
and then allow the whole thing to come out and then wash it.

241
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,570
Then the third thing I find in Europe

242
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,620
that you people do not clear your throats,

243
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,550
and your tongues,

244
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,670
which is another thing very much against Vishuddhi.

245
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,500
And that must be one of the reasons why

246
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,640
your Vishuddhis are bad.

247
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,500
So though it is not in fashionable here, in the West,

248
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,680
but very important thing is to put your

249
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,710
two fingers in the mouth and rub your fingers, not the thing,

250
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,680
fingers and clean your tongue in such a way that

251
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,640
everything comes out in the morning,

252
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,580
is important because that accumulates and then it rots.

253
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,570
So this has to be done and may be that you might think that

254
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,720
this is really making noise and all that, doesn’t matter,

255
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,640
you have to clear out your throat,

256
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,560
that’s how you’ll keep your Vishuddhis very clear.

257
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,730
This is one of the things and another thing is that

258
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,650
you must always use water, as much as possible,

259
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,720
for washing when you go for your morning ...

260
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,670
water must be used, paper is a very dirty and

261
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,570
unhygienic habit, very dirty and unhygienic habit.

262
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,690
But, even if you use paper, you must use water after that.

263
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,610
Is very important that all the time the water

264
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,590
should be used as much as possible.

265
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,550
For Sahaja yogis, it is a very, very important thing.

266
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,610
Now, for some people who will find that they are

267
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:17,600
on a subtler level, quite on the verge of collapse

268
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,570
in the way that they still have those problems that they

269
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,650
want to sleep with other women and they want to do

270
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,690
all these things, they should give up Sahaja yoga.

271
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,510
Best is to leave us alone.

272
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,540
We can’t have such useless people with us.

273
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,520
So they should give up Sahaja yoga and don’t trouble us

274
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,720
because we can get thousands and thousands in India,

275
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,690
we have no problem, for them it is not difficult,

276
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,680
they are already there. So, those who are still like that,

277
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,660
who are trying to have relations with other women and

278
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,700
having their eyes on other women;

279
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,610
and or the women like that, you see, all this kind of

280
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,690
maniacs, I call them maniacs only,

281
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,530
should give up Sahaja yoga and should spare us.

282
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,690
This is for definite.

283
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,540
Now, we have always been saying that those who are

284
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,620
very negative people will have to leave Sahaja yoga

285
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,670
and the day will come, so for all of you

286
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,680
it is very necessary that you should try to clean yourself

287
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:16,710
and never sit with a person who is negative.

288
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,640
Never make friendship with a person who is negative.

289
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:24,690
Try to be more helpful to a person who is positive.

290
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,610
Clear out yourself.  Clean out yourself;

291
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,540
look after yourself; respect yourself; love yourself.

292
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,730
Live with your dignity.

293
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,700
Cheapish thing, frivolous thing,

294
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,720
useless thing should not be done,

295
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,640
and make your ego be challenged.

296
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,550
Let somebody insult you and see that

297
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,630
that you do not answer back.

298
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,650
Just see it, not to get into temper.

299
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:56,500
Try that your ego doesn’t react.

300
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:03,530
That can be achieved very easily if you try in the mirror,

301
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,590
look at yourself and laugh at yourself,

302
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,730
make fun of yourself.

303
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,700
You think of yourself.

304
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,590
Who are you?  What do you have?  Nothing.

305
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,580
Now today’s lecture was really, was not only,

306
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,550
was a great lecture, but also it was like mantras.

307
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,580
All good for the brain, and I would say that this lecture

308
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:33,720
must be listened to again and again, and to be taken in -

309
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,510
not to be questioned, not to be questioned, to be taken in,

310
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,540
to be absorbed.

311
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,620
I hope you understand this.

312
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,660
Now after this Sahashrara Puja I hope you people

313
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,730
try to maintain the position you have reached.

314
00:17:52,620 --> 00:18:01,700
I would expect all of you to support, to glorify your leaders

315
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,510
and not in any way debate them, argue with them,

316
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,530
give them ideas.

317
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,610
Even the wives I have said are not to argue

318
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,550
with the leaders.

319
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,690
It’s like pulling each other, like they said there

320
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,560
were some scorpions sent for investigation

321
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,500
from different places.

322
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,680
And they saw one jar was open, and they said,

323
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,710
“What is this? This, from this jar all the scorpions

324
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,500
will jump out.”

325
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,520
They said, “They cannot, because as one comes up,

326
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,610
another pulls him down.”

327
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,590
In the same way we behave. So if there’s a leader,

328
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,640
this is ego that makes you jealous, and this is ego

329
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,680
that says that you know better,

330
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,540
you better give a solution.

331
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,510
Not that you cannot suggest people,

332
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,680
tell Me also things, but if it doesn’t accept,

333
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,580
well and good.

334
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,670
That’s a challenge to your ego.

335
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,550
It’s better that he says “no” to you

336
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,610
so that you see for yourself,

337
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,720
“Is it my ego still insisting on that position?”

338
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,640
Now, on the second thing that I have said that

339
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,580
we should not be drawn by convention.

340
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:20,680
Like the convention was that, say, this time the English

341
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,740
felt, the English leaders felt, which was a big mistake,

342
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:30,710
that Italians would be inconvenienced if they stay over.

343
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,550
Italians are very large-hearted people, like Indians are,

344
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,570
they will be overjoyed if they stay over.

345
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,580
But it is the English mind.

346
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,670
It’s the English who cannot tolerate one person staying

347
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:42,700
for two days.

348
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,570
They’ll ask you immediately as you go,

349
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,710
“What time are you leaving?”

350
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,710
So, it is their mind that worked out that way that

351
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,500
it will be inconvenient, because they’ll be inconvenienced.

352
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,710
Though they were told, “You could stay here till Monday,

353
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,630
there’s no problem, you’ll have to pay just ten pounds,”

354
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,530
but I thought like that. This is an English image

355
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,700
of being good to others.

356
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,640
Because to them, anybody staying in their house, finished,

357
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,710
they won’t allow anybody to come inside the house.

358
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,540
Let there be snow or anything outside,

359
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,520
they’ll just see and talk to them and say.

360
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,710
I’ve een it Myself.

361
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,680
One day we had, I had gone out it was snowing,

362
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,620
and I saw a lady standing out in the doorsteps

363
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,620
with a pram and there was a little baby and the other lady

364
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,650
was an old lady talking from inside,

365
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:47,500
just from the chink, in a way that the door was not

366
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,560
completely opened out.

367
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,550
And when I came back after an hour and so,

368
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,540
still that lady was standing outside and talking.

369
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,690
This lady didn’t have sense to say that “You come in.”

370
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,540
But this another lady also did not mind it also because

371
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:03,670
she must be doing the same.

372
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,580
So the large-heartedness of anything they cannot understand.

373
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,550
Moreover, there was no problem,

374
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:21,520
it was suggested that you can stay here and you can be here.

375
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,600
Now today we had to hurry up a lot.

376
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,670
The whole thing was quite inconvenienced and

377
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,620
we had to do it because of a slight mistake.

378
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,500
They should have asked Me and I thought you all

379
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,650
were staying on Monday because this is logical;

380
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,690
it is sensible.

381
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,510
But because of the conception that we should not

382
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,510
inconvenience.

383
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,540
It's not only with English, it's possible with anyone of you.

384
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:49,600
When you start thinking, “I thought,” you are gone.

385
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,630
So this concepts that you have, about things,

386
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,710
are actually very dangerous things.

387
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:01,710
I’ve been having experiences of experiences of this stupid

388
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:06,640
conventions people have:  “I thought.”

389
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,690
They try to be good but ultimately try to be nasty.

390
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,540
They are nasty.

391
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,510
So that means there's something definitely wrong

392
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,670
with the convention they have about things and

393
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,660
that’s why people, if they were right when they

394
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,560
were thinking, world would have been a different thing.

395
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,670
But they are thinking at a level where it's just

396
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,610
everything is sloping down, and you are going downward.

397
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,680
As soon as you start thinking, you go downward.

398
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,600
Such is the defect of your thinking because it is bound

399
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,720
by the tanks of your conventions.

400
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,700
Whenever you think, you see, you are bound by your

401
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,650
conventions and you go down.

402
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,600
I didn’t touch many points today which I could have touched,

403
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,610
like art. I was saying, I was amazed and exuberant,

404
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,640
like this the flower like this makes me so very happy

405
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,570
to see a garden.

406
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,530
But to a sophisticated mind, is more rock or

407
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,740
something nonsensical.

408
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,720
To them, one flower somewhere because rest of the area

409
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,600
should be their space for their ego.

410
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,730
So they cannot see the beauty, it’s too much, too much,

411
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,530
even Sahaja Yoga is too much for us.

412
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,600
What are you a little baby or what?

413
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,680
What is too much?

414
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,710
You see, as we like a baby we give a bottle,

415
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,710
so much of milk, so much of milk,

416
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,710
so Sahaja Yoga is too much for you.

417
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,690
You are draws or what?

418
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,540
There is no substance in such kind of a nonsense.

419
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,510
That’s why, “This is sophisticated, this is nice,”

420
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,580
criticize everyone.

421
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,580
People are so frightened even to decorate their houses,

422
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,610
because it will be criticized.

423
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:12,500
Better keep it plain, white, just white.

424
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,540
Even the nose they don’t like.

425
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,550
They want to cut out the nose, eyes, everything,

426
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,520
just have plain.

427
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,670
And imagine, it's the play of the ego

428
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,650
which wants an individuality.

429
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,580
How they are in just a position with what they

430
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,640
wanted to see this clearly?

431
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,690
If you go in a garden, they'll have one, you see, tree

432
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,660
somewhere hanging in there.

433
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,710
This is supposed to be garden. You say,

434
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,640
“Where is the garden”? They say, “This is garden.”

435
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,720
Microscope.  “Where is the garden?”

436
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,670
“Oh no, we put only one tree at a point you see

437
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,720
so it becomes important.”

438
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,720
So this is only a tree here and then you move up,

439
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,620
then will be another little bush and another.

440
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,680
Everything is too much. Why?

441
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,570
Because the ego is too much in their heads.

442
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,660
That’s why everything is too much for them.

443
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,540
This stupidity has to go now.

444
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,510
You have to take whatever is good;

445
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,650
too much you must take and give up

446
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,660
whatever is too much in you.

447
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,700
That has to be understood.

448
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,540
All these stupid ideas, all kinds of stupid ideas,

449
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:39,580
like you want to buy a house, so it’s all right,

450
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,540
you go and buy a house.

451
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,700
I went round, most of the houses are about

452
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:50,680
seven and a half feet height, but they like it.

453
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:51,710
I said, “Why?”

454
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,530
“It’s very old.”

455
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,710
I said, “So what?”

456
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,540
They said, “But it’s an old house, it is this and that

457
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,650
and that old house.”

458
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,500
I said, “But why do you like it?”

459
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,510
New houses are eight feet, at the most.

460
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,710
So there is no choice.

461
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,600
But why do you want to have a house which is an old house?

462
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,680
Victorian houses they don’t like. Why?

463
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,680
Because they are not so conventional,

464
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,680
they are not so fashionable.

465
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,700
You must have a house where you should break your neck,

466
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,700
walk into the bathroom in an awkward way.

467
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:30,540
You can’t even sit or stand, half way hang in the air.

468
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,670
That’s a very house of the character.

469
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,620
And the character is that which makes you awkward and

470
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,530
feel funny, that person has character, I mean the person,

471
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:45,730
if he is absurd, he is queer, weird, he is strange,

472
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,580
he is a man of character.

473
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,720
This is the situation today.

474
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,610
He is a man of character and he is weird,

475
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,650
absolutely a strange personality. How is it?

476
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,550
“You know he came on a bicycle with a half pant.”

477
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,510
I said, “Really?” The a man of character.

478
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,730
“Yeah, he’s getting arthritis with it.”

479
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:12,570
Doing queer, funny stupid things is regarded as

480
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,560
something of a personality.

481
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,580
Now, as Sahaja yogis, you have to realize that

482
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,620
you are not that stupid.

483
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:25,560
You are crowned with your Self.

484
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,580
Now you are not going to behave like these stupid people,

485
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,640
and their fashions, to give it up.

486
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,740
They laugh at you, you laugh at them.

487
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:43,520
In a lunatic asylum, if you go, all the lunatics will say,

488
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,550
“Oh, so you have also come here to join us.” Isn’t it?

489
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:51,550
They all think they are the wisest and you get lost with them

490
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,690
You start thinking, “Am I lunatic myself?”

491
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,510
So you all when you see such a person

492
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,740
you should just laugh at him.

493
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,700
Like a lady, she is thought out to be very fashionable,

494
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:11,500
came with a dress, you see, very open her body with

495
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,520
all her bones showing, and this and that.

496
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,730
And we happen to go and see that house Myself and My husband.

497
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,580
So as soon as he saw her, he came back and vomited.

498
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,620
I said, “What’s the matter?’”

499
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,520
“I saw her; I vomited.”

500
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:34,650
And we got into the car, we didn’t enter and we came away.

501
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,600
And she thought she was a very fashionable lady,

502
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,690
showing her bones, all her body, horrible.

503
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,630
Imagine, like a dead body standing before you.

504
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,670
But a dead body is regarded as fashionable.

505
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,620
Everybody wants to behave like a dead body.

506
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,500
Now, you should see the sense in it.

507
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,680
Otherwise you are not Sahaja Yogis.

508
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,520
You must see the nonsense that is going on and

509
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,710
you are not a nonsensical personality.

510
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:13,560
All these things now if you see from a new angle,

511
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,620
as I told you now, that you are higher personalities,

512
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,710
that you have achieved a new awareness of your chakras,

513
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,530
you’ll be amazed your reactions will be very,

514
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,540
very different. If you see something like this...

515
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,560
“Ahh!, you say, “Beautiful!”

516
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,670
But till you have those horrible conventions with you,

517
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,570
you cannot.

518
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,680
A house which is dilapidated absolutely going to fall

519
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,680
on your head is, “What a character!”

520
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,570
The whole character will fall on your head!

521
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,670
Absurd ideas people have.

522
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,730
Or then they want something modern which is absolutely

523
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,570
weird and nonsensical.

524
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,740
You see, there was a lady, she built a house, modern,

525
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,610
and we had to climb up the steps,

526
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,640
and every steps she had divided into smaller,

527
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,580
smaller pieces, we were so much worried

528
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,740
that we’ll all fall off.

529
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,620
You see, every step was made of small, small pieces,

530
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,730
like a step, you see every step was made into steps.

531
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,740
So when you put your foot there and you don’t know

532
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,520
where you are putting your foot, you see.

533
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,570
She must have spent a lot of money making that

534
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,700
kind of a nonsensical thing, but to her,

535
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,680
she would show everyone, “Now, come along, see this.”

536
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,590
I refused to go up, I said, “I have nothing to do.”

537
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:35,710
I went back. Yes, it doesn’t matter.

538
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,710
As they show resentment, you must show resentment.

539
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,670
Stupid,

540
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,540
it doesn’t appeal to Me,

541
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,740
it doesn’t appeal to Me these things.

542
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,730
I have seen. I don’t like it these things,

543
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,540
the way there's one flower hanging somewhere,

544
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,700
and anything if I see, I see I don’t like it.

545
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,700
I don’t enjoy it at all Myself.

546
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,650
And if I am the criteria,

547
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,670
if I am the one who can judge things,

548
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,600
then I would tell you I don’t like all these nonsense.

549
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,540
The way people dress up these days, they look like clowns

550
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,700
to Me, lunatics, like I can say brats,

551
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,720
or you can call them, what do you call them tramps.

552
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,720
You cannot make out one from another.

553
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,630
Lousy pants, you see,

554
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,680
some grandfather’s pant they are wearing,

555
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,710
and grandmother’s blouse on top,

556
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,510
and the ladies walking on the street, see,

557
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:30,610
you feel some funny, queer people walking across,

558
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,670
and they think it is fashionable.

559
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,630
I think from India we should get all old clothes here

560
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,710
and sell them off for a higher price.

561
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,510
It's very queer, you just look at it, see from this angle,

562
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,510
standing on the hilltop, just look at these mad people,

563
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,720
see how lunatic they are, stupid they are,

564
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,660
how they are behaving, what is their fashion.

565
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:08,610
If you see the olden times, people used to dress up well

566
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,530
with all kinds of frills, all kinds of things,

567
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,740
but this is what they don’t like.

568
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,690
Whatever God has given us should be decorated and respected.

569
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,730
I mean yesterday, the way you did the hall,

570
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:29,730
I mean today the way you did the whole of the hall and

571
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:34,710
all that, so very beautiful it look, so nice it look.

572
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,650
But somebody would say, “Oh, let us have

573
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,720
an absolutely plain thing for Mother.

574
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,640
Some dilapidated wall behind which is about to fall down.

575
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,690
"That would be real character.”

576
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,500
How can these ideas be acceptable to Sahaja Yogis!

577
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,560
This I just don’t understand.

578
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,650
And they pay for it.

579
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,590
They pay for these conventions and they pay for all

580
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,700
these kind of odd things, they do pay for it.

581
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,690
Supposing there is a fashion today to have your haircut

582
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,550
like this on top, they will pay for it.

583
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,730
Then you cut them another way, they pay for it.

584
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,580
You have to pay for all these misdoings also.

585
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,680
The fashion is: supposing somebody invite somebody

586
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,670
to your house, you must have a different type of a glass,

587
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,570
cup and a glass for this, otherwise you are not all right.

588
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,570
And then what find?

589
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,610
There’s another group of these hippies and those have come.

590
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,540
They’ll give you the dirtiest possible mugs

591
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,600
that you cannot drink anything.

592
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,540
So either you accept this nonsense or that nonsense.

593
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,640
It’s absolutely absurd.

594
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,510
And you know I have seen Indians when they are in England,

595
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,690
they just don’t understand, they just cancel them all right,

596
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,570
cancel them. They are mad people.

597
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:18,600
The quality of personality is very, very low, very low.

598
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:24,530
Take it from Me, very low. You might have ego,

599
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:29,510
might exist with that ego, but it is very low here.

600
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:37,520
Accept it. Innocence is missing, auspiciousness is missing,

601
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,720
cleanliness is missing.

602
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:48,580
The attraction of simplicity is missing, so artificial.

603
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,620
Even the ideas of simplicity is artificial.

604
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,680
With artificiality how can you have a quality of human life?

605
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:05,640
How can you? You become artificial people.

606
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,620
So give up all these conventions.

607
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:14,590
I am not here to propagate Indian culture as such,

608
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,610
but I must say if there is any culture it is in India,

609
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:21,670
because this is no culture. All becoming.

610
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,570
If you walk about, I mean you look like when I see

611
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,570
the people around, they look like host of mad people walking.

612
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,590
You see them on the streets, not one person is normal.

613
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,730
America is even worse.

614
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,740
They must do like this, or this like this.

615
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,680
Not one person has a proper face.

616
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,550
It’s a fact I tell you.

617
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,560
With Sahaja Yoga, your quality has come up, it has come up,

618
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:02,640
you’ve become that now, so great.

619
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:10,600
That’s why you do not feel here there is Lakshmi.

620
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,560
They have money but no Lakshmi.

621
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,630
There’s no beauty of that.

622
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,680
It’s so desolate, like a barren land.

623
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:32,590
Your ego has blown off everything that was beautiful.

624
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,580
You could not tolerate anybody’s art,

625
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:40,730
so you would not have any artistic things in the house.

626
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,710
You need not have many things at all, so you have plastics.

627
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,660
Beauty has run away from your lives.

628
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,560
When you talk also it’s fashionable to be arrogant.

629
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:02,660
Imagine: to be arrogant, to be very dry,

630
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:12,710
there’s no beauty in it. It’s all put up show;

631
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:21,630
there’s no bravery in it, nothing sublime.

632
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,520
On the subtle form you have lost it;

633
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,600
that’s why on the gross form you don’t see it.

634
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,540
Whatever you have lost inside, it's shown outside -

635
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:39,520
bankruptcy, complete bankruptcy.

636
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:42,740
So when you see that with others, when I am saying you,

637
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,570
I am meaning in the others, those who are not yet

638
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:48,520
Sahaja yogis in the West.

639
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,500
Try to understand that they are at a much lower level

640
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:53,570
than you are, and don’t take to their ideas,

641
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,620
and their ways and methods.

642
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,640
Just keep yourself alert.

643
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,680
And then you’ll see they’ll run after you.

644
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,700
Ego is like a donkey.

645
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:07,560
If somebody is ahead of them, they know somebody is ahead

646
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,570
of them, then they bend their head to that.

647
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,530
And if they see somebody is behind them, then they kick.

648
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,580
So you have your dignity, you have your special style,

649
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,690
you live with a special style.

650
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:29,730
Don’t be one of them. Dress up properly, in a proper way.

651
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:34,560
You may have only two shirts; you may have only three shirts;

652
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:40,680
you need not have many, but have something sensible,

653
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:51,560
normal, comfortable and also which is not charring to others.

654
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,530
We are the ones who are going to encourage our art,

655
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,650
we are the ones who are going to bring back all

656
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,580
that is lost.

657
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,640
We can’t have Rembrandt anymore; we cannot have

658
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:09,520
Leonardo da Vinci; we cannot have Michelangelo again.

659
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,500
Finished them all completely.

660
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,570
Here everyone thinks that they are Michelangelo.

661
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:22,660
We can’t even have, say, Gorky;

662
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:33,560
we can’t have William Blake, can we? Of that courage?

663
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:39,610
We cannot have Abraham Lincoln, can we have?

664
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:47,560
All dwarfs, useless people.

665
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,640
You scratch them and you find

666
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,690
they are good for nothing, useless.

667
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:55,740
Out of you only all these great people have to come out now.

668
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,640
And their specialty about them,

669
00:39:59,510 --> 00:39:59,740
they had their own personality.

670
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,650
They would not give way to any fashions or anything.

671
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,620
They wouldn’t give way to any cheap popularity.

672
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:13,740
Out of you people all these great personalities

673
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,740
are to be born.

674
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:21,710
So for you and for your progeny you have to think,

675
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,520
"What are we doing?” in such a great work as it is,

676
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:28,540
it’s not only for your enjoyment that we have a seminar,

677
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:33,590
nice music, nice food, nice place, we come and enjoy, no!

678
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,630
Enjoyment is just an advertising department.

679
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:54,630
You have to really work hard inside, not outside.

680
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,670
No arguments of any kind. Useless,

681
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,670
simple thing if I say I have to carry, say, this box,

682
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,660
somebody will come out and say,

683
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,730
“All right, then I think we should get a van.”

684
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,530
“No, but van is too much.” “Then what should we do?”

685
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:20,560
They’ll go on arguing till that the box is gone,

686
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,540
everything is done and I come back and I say,

687
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,570
“Now, what are you doing?”

688
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,730
“We are discussing “We are discussing how to take the box."

689
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,720
It’s already gone.

690
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:35,500
Such wasteful habits we should give up.

691
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:44,570
We have to have new wisdom within us.

692
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,550
All this old wisdom, you just throw it away.

693
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:51,730
Unless and until you don’t do that, your ego won’t go away.

694
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,500
It won’t leave unless and until you decide to throw away

695
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:03,520
all those ideas which to you appear to be there.

696
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,590
You have to be like children.

697
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,710
Try to learn something new all the time;

698
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:14,700
we are to be open to learn something new all the time.

699
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,530
You have to learn.

700
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,680
You have lost it.

701
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,680
You had something that you have lost it so many.

702
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,650
Instead of going ahead, you have lost it.

703
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,570
You would have been all right if you had remained

704
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:30,570
on the right path, you would have achieved because,

705
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:34,580
after all, some countries are traditionally very old.

706
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:38,720
They also got lost - like Greece, you can say, is lost.

707
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,700
Horrible Greek tragedies, I mean, sit down and cry

708
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:44,740
for nothing at all.

709
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,690
Nothing has happened, everything is perfect,

710
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:50,580
people just go and sit down and cry.

711
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,660
It’s like you make somebody say that “This one is dead.

712
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,550
Let us now feel that he is dead.

713
00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:01,680
Sit down, all of us should cry.”  Stupid as that.

714
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,600
It's all artificially-created problems and

715
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,740
artificially-created gloom because you have no real gloom;

716
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,630
you have no real problem;

717
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:13,580
they’ve got food to eat; got everything,

718
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:16,670
that’s why you are creating problems for yourself.

719
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,680
That’s why you need psychiatrist, you need drugs,

720
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,530
you need this, you need that. Because you have no problems,

721
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:27,500
you want to have some problems, as simple as that.

722
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:30,540
Those who have problems have to fight with it.

723
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:34,590
They have no time for all these nonsensical things.

724
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:35,710
You have too much time.

725
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,720
All your problems are solved, as far as the material things

726
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,570
are concerned, but still you are very much involved into it.

727
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:47,740
So now face it, face it clearly,

728
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:54,520
that we are not that anymore.

729
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,590
We are different people.

730
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:00,600
We are no more worms in the mud but we are lotuses,

731
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,710
we have fragrance, we have powers,

732
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:10,730
we are specially blessed. We have a special sense of joy;

733
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,710
let’s enjoy that and give it to others and

734
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:23,550
and be glorified with it, feel the dignity of it.

735
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:30,600
I am sure that it is going to work out this time,

736
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,690
that I have done My level best, I think,

737
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,540
and this lecture should really go through you all.

738
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,600
All right, any questions?

739
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,620
Can I have some water?

740
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:49,600
Any questions you have?

741
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:00,520
They might be think I'll drink from here.

742
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,620
Modern idea that may be I'll drink from here.

743
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,730
There's no need to have glass

744
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,510
Mother may like to drink from there.

745
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,660
All right, any questions?

746
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,720
In thoughtless awareness.

747
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,570
Now keep it up, keep it up in thoughtless awareness,

748
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:54,520
absolutely you're blasted, keep it up. Keep yourself blasted.

749
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:55,730
That is this ego business.

750
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,500
Little bit still there rudimentary, keep it out.

751
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:06,600
This is meditation. Where there's no ego any more.

752
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,630
You are in thoughtless awareness, absolutely stuanned.

753
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,540
Can't think.

754
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,700
But I have done, is not good. You should do it.

755
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:23,560
That is the point I am coming to again.

756
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,710
Have your own personality.

757
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:29,510
If punks could behave like that,

758
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:32,660
why can’t you behave sensibly?

759
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:58,670
And also I have to say few words about how we behave

760
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:03,660
in our day-to-day live because the Mother has to see that

761
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:07,550
they are, children are not to be ill-bred.

762
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,700
People should not say that SahajaYogis are ill bred.

763
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:17,570
First sign of an ill-bred child is that he leaves his bed

764
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:25,530
in a mess. He leaves all his things in a mess.

765
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:29,540
While coming I saw all the beds.

766
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,570
What are we doing here? Nothing.

767
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:41,540
So put yourself into a discipline of leading a neat life.

768
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,660
As a Mother I have to tell you this.

769
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:48,610
It takes hardly ten to fifteen minutes,

770
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:50,640
but just tell yourself, "This is meditation",

771
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:52,740
do in meditative way.

772
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,680
We in India think that the Western people

773
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,520
are extremely neat and tidy.

774
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,730
Really, they can’t believe it.

775
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,590
They think you are in top of the world.

776
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:07,600
You must be the neatest people ever lived.

777
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:11,540
They said ten times “thank you.”

778
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:16,510
But even once you will not keep your bed all right.

779
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,560
Your things should be neat.

780
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:26,510
You must keep yourself neat, appear neat.

781
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:31,510
Then second thing I've seen, noticed this

782
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:34,530
which is told by many people which I have also noticed

783
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,600
that you go to somebody’s house,

784
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:41,700
then an ill-bred person will start using the phone

785
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:43,690
without asking.

786
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,530
Certain things are important to understand.

787
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,630
Like entering into the kitchen eating everything.

788
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,690
It’s a very common thing people are noticing this,

789
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:00,590
that you get the food like paupers, like beggars

790
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,660
they come in the house.

791
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:08,670
At least twenty-one bottles of honey

792
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,600
which people had given Me as present,

793
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,700
when My son-in-law came there was not even

794
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:18,500
one bottle to give him honey.

795
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:19,690
So who ate?

796
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:23,740
All the Sahaja yogis who came and ate the honey.

797
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:28,530
I mean, it’s all right but you must ask.

798
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:31,570
You polish off everything in the house.

799
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:34,670
All right, you have come, there is food cooked for you,

800
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,540
just have your food.

801
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:46,530
If you go in the larder or you go anywhere to find,

802
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,710
everything is missing.

803
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:53,620
You buy from the whole mart you find everything polished off.

804
00:49:55,580 --> 00:50:00,510
So an ill-bred person can be made out like that.

805
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:04,520
But you will be surprised, a good breeding person,

806
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:08,670
even if this much is left of another person,

807
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:10,640
that person will keep it and keep it,

808
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,700
till it is passed over.

809
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,550
I’ll tell you about My own husband who is,

810
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:18,710
who need not worry about this but if he knows

811
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:21,520
we have something of another person,

812
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:24,640
he’ll  put it lock and key and see every time it is there

813
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,670
till he returns it to him.

814
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:37,520
And same I can say about My children or

815
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:42,570
anybody I know of, but this is beggarish

816
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:44,690
that you take somebody’s things, miss use it,

817
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,620
throw away where you feel like and break everything.

818
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:52,600
But I've seen with My own things,

819
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:55,600
when the leaders have been complaining to Me that

820
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:58,640
come to our houses, they polish off everything

821
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:02,510
from our fridges and all that, I was not surprised.

822
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:07,520
The Sahaja Yoga has become like a resort

823
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,690
for the all the beggars and the paupers of the world

824
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:13,600
because it is free.

825
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:17,580
All the poor people come down to Sahaja Yoga and

826
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,600
you have to nourish them and look after them.

827
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,600
It should not be such.

828
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:27,660
You may be poor but you must have dignity.

829
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:33,540
Even the servants are in India are better.

830
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:38,570
They wouldn’t touch your things without asking.

831
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:42,570
They have much more breeding.

832
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:52,570
And ill-bred person is a person who is a rude person,

833
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,650
arrogant person.

834
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,630
You can say the same thing in a proper manner.

835
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,510
As a Mother to give Me a real glory is that,

836
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,630
that people should say that

837
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:07,510
you are very well brought up children.

838
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:25,610
A kind of system must exist.

839
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:29,520
A spartan system, it's a spartans system.

840
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,710
It is not all a sort of a lousy system.

841
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,610
It's a spartan system.

842
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:41,710
We are yogis, should be neat, tidy, all the time clean

843
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,530
with few things.

844
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:47,740
Like in India, people are quite shocked.

845
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:53,500
You carry such big, big bags and it carries all the,

846
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,600
for ladies, specially all the paints and this and that.

847
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:59,550
Where are you going to use before the villagers there

848
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,520
these paints, they don’t understand.

849
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,540
All these things we have to see for ourselves.

850
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,650
We have to be dignified.

851
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:20,700
We have to be people with a kind of a personality.

852
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,560
Supposing somebody is a saint.

853
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,680
He might be a poor man

854
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:30,640
but you can make him out by his dignity.

855
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,710
There was a saint called Tukhaarama

856
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,570
whom which you have heard about him this

857
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,610
"Amhi Bi Ghadalo" comes from his music.

858
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,660
He was poor and very generous also.

859
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,710
He used to give away everything and he always left

860
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:49,690
with very little.

861
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:57,560
So Shivaji Maharaj, the great Shivaji came down to his place,

862
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:02,510
brought  lots of ornaments and things and presentations

863
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,630
and gave it to his wife and children. He was out.

864
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:08,680
She was very happy to wear all these things because he gave.

865
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:12,520
Of course in the beginning she also said,

866
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,650
“That is  not all right.” But he said,

867
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:16,680
“No I am only trying to sort of pay my respect to you -

868
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:20,590
this, that - and give. And she wore it.

869
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:24,540
He came and he said, “No, I am a saint.

870
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:31,620
You take these. You are a king; you have to live like a king.

871
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:35,520
All right as a king, you can have it.

872
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:41,630
But not as a saint. I don’t need all these.

873
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,600
My wife doesn’t need all these things.

874
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:45,660
Because you are living like a king,

875
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,660
maybe you are realized soul also but you are a king,

876
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,500
so live like a king.”

877
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:02,560
But one has to realize that in Sahaja Yoga you are not

878
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:05,550
to move like a barren personality also.

879
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:09,580
You have to be properly dressed, properly appearing.

880
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,560
You should not look like beggars,

881
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:16,730
but you should look like dignified people of the society.

882
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:22,550
Now for example, as you know I am the Goddess,

883
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:26,520
and the Goddess has to wear, I don't know how many ornaments

884
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:30,560
just to adorn Her chakras.

885
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:34,500
I mean I have lots of ornaments Myself of My own.

886
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,520
But only for puja I wear otherwise I don’t wear.

887
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,640
I am supposed to wear lots of things.

888
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:47,700
Why? Because it may not be that all right,

889
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,620
may be dignified but may not be that all right to wear

890
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:54,590
all those things all the time.

891
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,700
But I am supposed to wear.

892
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,530
Like I am supposed to wear many more things on the hands

893
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,590
here, rings on the feet, everything all the time you have

894
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:11,500
wear gold in the, what do you call the, you don’t have that

895
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:15,690
ornament here which we tie up like a belt.

896
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,640
But I don’t do it.

897
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:24,600
I keep it to a marginal point

898
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:28,580
only in puja I wear some things out of it.

899
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,610
So you must have that discretion what to wear,

900
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:38,590
how to wear, how far to go, how to look dignified,

901
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:41,590
how to be well bred so that you glorify

902
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:45,550
the breeding of your Mother.

903
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:55,520
This time I hope when you all come to India

904
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,720
you'll notice all these things among Indians.

905
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:02,500
You will never see them eating;

906
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,580
you never see them having their baths;

907
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,560
you never see them sleeping.

908
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:10,720
You don’t know how they live, where they live,

909
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,630
how they work out,

910
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,530
everything they are just there on the spot

911
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,640
whenever you are there.

912
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:20,580
Isn’t it true?

913
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:23,530
They take their baths, they finish everything early

914
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:24,710
in the morning about 4 o’clock or 5 o’clock.

915
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:31,740
They are out, spartan and always clean whether a villager,

916
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:37,690
whether he is a Shedule caste or Brahmin or anything.

917
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:42,720
They all neatly dressed; you cannot make them out.

918
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,620
Clean, white clothes they'll wear.

919
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:49,600
Clean white cap they will have.

920
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:54,600
They never have dirty clothes.

921
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:05,580
So this is another side, which is not so sublime,

922
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:11,500
gross side and not so subtle but is very important

923
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:16,630
because whatever is in the subtle expresses outside.

924
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:26,740
In all your behavior this will shine,

925
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:33,670
like thousands facets of a diamond because

926
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:38,500
you have attended now the Sahasrara Day.  Let’s see.

927
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:43,570
What you have thousand facets we show.

928
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,550
Love each other; respect each other;

929
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:55,710
respect yourself and all the time say one mantra

930
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:00,550
within yourself “I am a Sahaja Yogi.”

931
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:04,580
It says everything about your responsibilities,

932
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:10,660
what are your aspirations, what you are.

933
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:19,650
You are a Sahaja Yogi. Being reborn by Adi Shakti Herself.

934
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:31,620
Any personal problems you have you should write to Me and

935
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,510
I’ll try to answer.

936
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,520
If I do not answer, then think that answer I've managed.

937
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:40,570
If I do not answer then think that I've managed to answer,

938
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,570
but if there is anything to be suggested

939
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:45,590
I will definitely inform you.

940
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:48,540
Any other problem.

941
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:51,590
But like a lady today came,

942
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:52,720
she was crying about her husband.

943
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,660
She did before also again today she is crying.

944
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,640
She'll go mad.

945
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,740
A Sahaja Yogi should not cry.

946
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:02,710
Overcome your problems;

947
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:06,560
try to handle your husband; try to handle everything.

948
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,520
I do not like very much the divorce part of it,

949
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:11,550
but if somebody is a gone case is all right.

950
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:13,560
I would say is a gone case, you divorce.

951
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:19,670
But unnecessarily, just because it's not yet a proper

952
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:22,610
understanding one should not cry, weep

953
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:24,520
and do all these things.

954
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:27,610
On the contrary one should try to overcome

955
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:31,610
your own personal problems because you have powers.

956
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,680
And You can write to Me, not very long letters.

957
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,710
I get lost.

958
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,620
Yes, really I get lost.

959
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:04,570
In the morning there are so many letters for Me to read,

960
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:06,670
one better than the other,

961
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,690
and My husband also get a big post.

962
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,620
But he says, “Nobody writes me love letters,

963
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:17,570
they all write about their bills to be paid.”

964
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:23,520
I said, “It’s just the same.”

965
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:41,560
You may translate this Gregoire.

966
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:55,720
Full of problems.

967
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:25,730
I said that, “I have to pay for their love.”

968
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:30,660
That's what it is.

969
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:37,710
But children write very sweet letters.

970
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,620
They just made some painting or something,

971
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:44,570
or some flowers and few things there, that’s all.

972
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:48,590
They'll make a heart and put Me there or something like that.

973
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:54,590
Very sweet, sweet things they do and just the joy

974
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:58,740
and the happiness you see they express.

975
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,710
Never they've no problems. They have no problems.

976
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:03,600
Children don’t have problems. They are not complicated.

977
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:05,680
You catch hold of the problems, that's the trouble is.

978
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:08,640
They have no problems of any kind.

979
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:15,630
So you have not told me, anyone of you,

980
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,720
anything that you want to be done.

981
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,610
Now only thing at the last I would like you

982
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:23,510
you to listen to Warren who will read it out

983
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:26,580
to you the programs, we are going to have

984
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,660
in this summer time.

985
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:20,610
After sometime it may happened that

986
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:23,570
I settle down in one place and you all have to come there,

987
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:25,590
because I wouldn’t be able to travel so much,

988
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:30,560
I can tell you this much ... All right. For the time being.

989
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:33,570
You must also understand that now

990
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:35,500
the Mohamad has gone to the mountains

991
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:39,530
now the mountains have to come to Mohamed.

992
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:43,520
All right. So thank you very much.

993
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:45,590
You haven't told Me any of your problems

994
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:48,700
So, I think, there are no problems?

995
01:17:12,570 --> 01:17:14,730
Tomorrow morning I may not be able to meet you.

996
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:19,610
So may God bless you all.

997
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,650
Give yourself a bandhan now, all of you.

998
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:29,620
Properly, with full attention, with full dignity,

999
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:30,740
with full movement.

1000
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:33,640
See, full.

1001
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:41,690
Nothing should be done cheaply.

1002
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:11,580
I don't need anything but lets doing it with yours...

1003
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:38,540
In India they asked the question that,

1004
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:39,680
"If She is the Goddess

1005
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,640
why does She say "Namaskar" to everyone?"

1006
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,540
They can't understand the Goddess saying, "namaskar".
