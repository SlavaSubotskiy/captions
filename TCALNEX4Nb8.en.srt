00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Navaratri Puja, Cabella Ligure, Italy

2
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:07,143
27th September, 1992

3
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:36,185
Today is the first day of Navaratri.

4
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,560
And when I found that the rain was there

5
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:46,560
and all kinds of problems,

6
00:00:46,976 --> 00:00:49,435
and Vishnumaya was suggesting some things,

7
00:00:50,477 --> 00:00:53,560
I just consulted the calendar,

8
00:00:54,352 --> 00:00:58,352
and you will be amazed to know that in the calendar

9
00:00:58,727 --> 00:01:03,602
it is written that till five forty-five it’s not auspicious –

10
00:01:04,018 --> 00:01:05,602
it’s inauspicious.

11
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:08,393
After five forty-five only

12
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,519
the right thing starts,

13
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:21,685
so just imagine, by calculation how it was correct

14
00:01:22,227 --> 00:01:29,101
that five forty-five we had to have this puja,

15
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:31,560
after five forty-five.

16
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,727
That is, the first day of Navaratri starts in Italy

17
00:01:35,727 --> 00:01:39,727
or in Europe after five forty-five.

18
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:42,602
So it is something one must understand that

19
00:01:43,143 --> 00:01:46,769
the Chaitanya is working out everything,

20
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,810
and it is giving all the suggestions;

21
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:51,935
because I had not at all seen the, what you call the

22
00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:53,644
tithi (auspicious time),

23
00:01:53,644 --> 00:01:55,602
but I just felt that, I said that we’ll have it

24
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,060
in the evening.

25
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:59,060
And when I said it, I said “Let’s see this,”

26
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,101
and there it was.

27
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:04,227
There’s so many things we have to see,

28
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:12,018
that whatever has been revealed to you, you can verify it.

29
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:15,809
For example, I had said long time back

30
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:21,268
that Mooladhara Chakra is made out of carbon,

31
00:02:21,602 --> 00:02:23,227
carbon atom,

32
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:31,477
and if you see it from left to the right – right to the left,

33
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:38,060
left side you see nothing but a swastika.

34
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,809
So, now you see from left to the right,

35
00:02:43,352 --> 00:02:46,185
then you see Omkara;

36
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,477
and once you see from down below upward,

37
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:54,976
you see the alpha and omega.

38
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:57,810
Now see, Christ has said that

39
00:02:58,227 --> 00:03:03,018
“I am the Alpha and the Omega.”

40
00:03:03,352 --> 00:03:06,893
So this swastika becomes Omkara,

41
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:12,060
also becomes Christ.

42
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:14,935
You can see it very clearly.

43
00:03:15,185 --> 00:03:19,685
Now we have got a beautiful picture of that,

44
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,185
we have a tape, and I wanted to see you all that,

45
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,769
but I don’t know how we can manage here.

46
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:29,227
But I wish you all could see it, it’s so clear-cut.

47
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:34,976
So alpha and omega, also these mathematical things

48
00:03:35,976 --> 00:03:39,268
have come to us from

49
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,060
inside, from the Divine.

50
00:03:45,477 --> 00:03:47,393
This is not we have created.

51
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:53,851
This was found out by some mathematicians

52
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,268
who were realized souls,

53
00:03:56,727 --> 00:04:00,310
and they used this alpha and omega.

54
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,644
It’s surprising how it shows so clearly that

55
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:07,018
swastika becoming Omkar,

56
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,018
and Omkar then becoming alpha and omega.

57
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:18,268
So everything in Sahaja Yoga is tangible and

58
00:04:18,602 --> 00:04:21,143
can be verified.

59
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:28,310
Now you are worshipping today the Durga,

60
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,976
or all the nine forms of the Goddess.

61
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:38,769
She came nine times on this Earth, according to this, that

62
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,435
She fought all the people who were destroying

63
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,435
the seekers,

64
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:53,268
who were trying to make a mess of their lives.

65
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:59,602
And these tortured saints,

66
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,393
when they prayed to the Goddess – because none of the

67
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:11,435
gods could do anything, and Sadashiva is never interfering

68
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:14,268
with what the Goddess is doing –

69
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:17,685
so they worshipped the Bhagawati,

70
00:05:18,227 --> 00:05:22,352
and then the incarnation of Hers came nine times,

71
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:26,769
according to the need of the time.

72
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:31,101
So every time you find Her confronting people who are

73
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:34,727
extremely arrogant, self-opinionated,

74
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:38,602
thinking no end of themselves;

75
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,185
and the bhaktas are tortured by these self-opinionated

76
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:48,018
horrible rakshasas.

77
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,644
Now, in India when we cast the horoscope of a person,

78
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:53,810
we have three categories of people:

79
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:56,851
one are the devas, they’re called dev;

80
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,560
the second ones are the ones which are manavas,

81
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:04,851
means human beings;

82
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:07,018
and the third ones are rakshasas.

83
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:13,560
So I think I have got all of you from the dev categories,

84
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:15,685
because you could not have taken to Sahaja Yoga

85
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:18,810
that seriously unless and until you were there.

86
00:06:19,143 --> 00:06:22,185
After all, why should you believe Me also that

87
00:06:22,477 --> 00:06:25,143
when I say that there was the Durga, and there was

88
00:06:25,477 --> 00:06:29,519
this thing, and She did this and did that?

89
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:33,935
It’s not that from one faith you have come out and now

90
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,935
you are jumping onto another faith; it’s not like that.

91
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:42,769
It is actually been proved – you can feel.

92
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:45,893
For example, when you are raising the Kundalini

93
00:06:46,185 --> 00:06:48,602
on the center Heart,

94
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:51,976
you can feel

95
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:55,477
that on the center Heart if there is a catch,

96
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:59,143
you have to take name of the Jagadamba.

97
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:03,477
Unless and until you take Her name it won’t open out.

98
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:06,769
Also when I am clearing out your center Heart,

99
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:12,769
I have to also say, “Now I am in reality Jagadamba,”

100
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,685
and then the Jagadamba within you awakens.

101
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:20,352
So now you have verified it much more

102
00:07:20,685 --> 00:07:22,769
than the scientists have done.

103
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:26,018
The scientists are going from outside,

104
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:28,101
and they are not conclusive at all.

105
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:30,976
Now if you have one problem, they will work it out;

106
00:07:31,435 --> 00:07:33,352
another problem – they work out problems,

107
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:36,477
but they don’t know the basics,

108
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:40,935
what the problems are, and where lies the solution.

109
00:07:41,352 --> 00:07:48,644
While you can see that once the Amba, this Kundalini

110
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:53,101
who is the reflection of the Holy Ghost,

111
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,185
of the Adi Shakti within you,

112
00:07:56,644 --> 00:08:01,477
when She rises through these different chakras,

113
00:08:02,018 --> 00:08:05,101
She gives them power because She’s the Power,

114
00:08:05,477 --> 00:08:07,101
She’s the Shakti.

115
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,227
She is the desire power of Sadashiva.

116
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:17,477
She is the complete power of Sadashiva.

117
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:21,727
And so She gives the power totally to every chakra,

118
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:25,393
by which all these chakras are enlightened

119
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:28,060
and all the deities are awakened.

120
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:32,185
Supposing we have no power of life,

121
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,809
we’ll be like dead people.

122
00:08:35,644 --> 00:08:38,976
So these centers when they receive this power,

123
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,101
this Shakti, then they are awakened.

124
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:45,310
Now you have seen it, you can do it yourself.

125
00:08:45,602 --> 00:08:47,435
It’s all tangible,

126
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:50,893
you can verify it.

127
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:57,602
I have told you that She resides on the Heart center.

128
00:08:57,893 --> 00:09:00,519
Now see how Heart center is placed –

129
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,519
also very interesting to see.

130
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:08,976
While She is Jagadamba; but the Amba, means the pure

131
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:15,769
form of power, resides in the triangular bone,

132
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,101
like Kundalini.

133
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:21,560
But Her form which is Jagadamba,

134
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:26,352
where She is the Mother of the Universe,

135
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:30,727
She resides on the Heart center.

136
00:09:31,352 --> 00:09:35,352
Now this Heart center is very important.

137
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:40,602
When – I have already told you this, that when a child

138
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:45,435
is about, till the twelve years of age,

139
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:51,310
this center produces the ganas.

140
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:57,685
Ganas are the workers on the left-hand side.

141
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,227
They are like, we can say St. Michael is their leader,

142
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:12,477
but their king is Ganapati, Ganesha.

143
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:19,310
So first She has done is the ghatasthapana.

144
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:22,644
“Ghatasthapana” means – you have done here now,

145
00:10:22,851 --> 00:10:26,143
this is the ghatasthapana (pot with coconut)

146
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:28,185
This is the kumbha.

147
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:31,143
Now this kumbha She has established first:

148
00:10:31,393 --> 00:10:33,018
that is the triangular bone.

149
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:37,143
Now this is Her first work, that to establish this,

150
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:39,769
your Mooladhara.

151
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:44,060
So She established within you is innocence.

152
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,769
She established innocence within you to begin with.

153
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,185
So She has put this ghata in which She is staying

154
00:10:53,477 --> 00:10:55,227
as Kundalini now.

155
00:10:55,602 --> 00:11:00,685
So the first is that to establish the Kundalini

156
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,809
in the triangular bone, and then to establish Shri Ganesha.

157
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,352
This is the first work, by which whatever She is going

158
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:15,560
to create now –

159
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:20,685
all the Universes, the Earth, everything –

160
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:24,893
whatever She is going to create has to be filled with

161
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,810
innocence.

162
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,602
Now if you see the stones,

163
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:35,393
they’re innocent.

164
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:37,976
If you hit the stone you’ll get the hit,

165
00:11:38,268 --> 00:11:41,060
otherwise it doesn’t come up and hit you.

166
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,519
They’re innocent.

167
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:51,227
If you see the rivers, they’re innocent.

168
00:11:52,851 --> 00:11:57,560
Everything that has been created as matter is innocent.

169
00:11:58,143 --> 00:12:02,560
It is not cunning, it is not manipulating,

170
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:05,810
it is not aggressive – nothing of the kind.

171
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,352
They’re innocent,

172
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:12,268
means they’re under the complete order of God Almighty.

173
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:14,519
They do not have their own free will to do what they like.

174
00:12:17,851 --> 00:12:23,685
Whatever is done is with the absolutely under complete

175
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,060
command of God Almighty,

176
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:31,310
and so they are, we can say they’re innocent,

177
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:36,893
because they have no free will to do what they like.

178
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:42,101
So then if you see the animals also,

179
00:12:42,435 --> 00:12:47,143
they also are innocent, except for very few.

180
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:50,727
Most of them are innocent, innocent in the sense that

181
00:12:51,143 --> 00:12:55,018
they are called as “pashu”– means they are completely

182
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,727
under the control, pasha, of God Almighty.

183
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:02,268
A tiger will behave like a tiger,

184
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:05,393
and a snake will behave like a snake.

185
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:09,519
But in human beings somebody will behave like a tiger,

186
00:13:09,893 --> 00:13:13,851
tomorrow like a snake and third day like a worm.

187
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,227
There’s no steadiness.

188
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:19,560
For this you cannot say that this gentleman is today tiger,

189
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,976
so tomorrow he will not be a snake.

190
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:27,935
They have no free will to change their individuality.

191
00:13:28,727 --> 00:13:30,769
They are left alone.

192
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,519
So that is not the job of the Shakti to bother.

193
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,185
That’s already been created, they are there,

194
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,393
and they are existing.

195
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,101
They have a purpose, that’s why they are there;

196
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,519
and the purpose is only one, is to support human beings,

197
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:51,809
because you are at the epitome of evolution.

198
00:13:52,227 --> 00:13:57,560
So She has created all these things just for you

199
00:13:57,851 --> 00:14:04,268
to be created, and ultimately to get your Self-realization;

200
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:06,477
to have meaning for your life,

201
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:08,602
to get connected to this all-pervading Power,

202
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:12,060
to enter into the Kingdom of God.

203
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,060
All is Her work.

204
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:18,644
So we can say nine times She came, and the tenth time

205
00:14:18,935 --> 00:14:22,769
She is supposed to give Realization to all of you.

206
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,935
But at the tenth time, all these three powers are

207
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:31,393
joined together – that’s why it’s called Trigunatmika.

208
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:33,352
That’s why Buddha has said “Matreya”–

209
00:14:33,644 --> 00:14:37,519
means three Mothers put together.

210
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:43,310
So this Power when it starts acting, it has the complete

211
00:14:43,727 --> 00:14:50,809
control over all your three channels and seven centers –

212
00:14:51,185 --> 00:14:53,227
complete control,

213
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:59,352
as if without the permission or without the taking

214
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:05,809
the name of this Power, you cannot achieve anything.

215
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,227
Is a fact,

216
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:12,477
and that is where human beings fail,

217
00:15:12,727 --> 00:15:14,644
because they have a free will,

218
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:18,268
and they don’t know why to obey anyone or why to listen

219
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:21,935
to anyone, and why to accept anyone.

220
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,769
That’s why, though you have to be given Self-realization,

221
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,185
the task is very difficult;

222
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:34,809
because you are not used to

223
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:38,809
a way where you don’t have to use your free will.

224
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:41,769
Specially in the Western countries,

225
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:46,310
people have choices even for their cereals.

226
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,727
I was told that in America there are 126 types of cereals.

227
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,268
This kind of nonsense if you are doing,

228
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:01,477
your ego definitely bloats out, and you think

229
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:07,268
that “We have a right to decide for ourself.”

230
00:16:07,644 --> 00:16:10,560
And you cannot accept somebody who can tell you that

231
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:13,851
this is not right, and this is not right.

232
00:16:14,268 --> 00:16:22,352
So the same Power has now been awakened in

233
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:24,769
the Paramachaitanya.

234
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:28,227
Now, this awakening into the Paramachaitanya is doing

235
00:16:28,602 --> 00:16:32,602
marvellous work, which you can see clearly.

236
00:16:33,018 --> 00:16:36,685
Firstly, you have seen My photographs.

237
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:39,268
You see My photographs, you are stunned,

238
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,352
you are surprised. I mean,

239
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:45,644
I Myself don’t know what is this Paramachaitanya

240
00:16:45,935 --> 00:16:47,602
is busy with.

241
00:16:47,851 --> 00:16:51,810
It is so activated that all the time it is working out

242
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:58,185
to convince you people about the truth.

243
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,060
If it was so active at the time of Christ,

244
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,352
would have been much better.

245
00:17:04,352 --> 00:17:07,101
But it had to be this way, because human beings are

246
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:11,393
the most difficult things to manage.

247
00:17:11,727 --> 00:17:15,268
They have been given freedom; that too,

248
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,809
you’d be amazed,

249
00:17:17,143 --> 00:17:20,935
that the freedom was given to Adam and Eve,

250
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:22,519
but how it was achieved,

251
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,143
we should understand this.

252
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,851
In the Gnostics Bible it has come out what I’ve been

253
00:17:27,143 --> 00:17:33,685
saying, that Adam and Eve, both of them

254
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:40,310
were like pashus, under the complete control of God –

255
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,018
no free will.

256
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:48,809
They would have lived in the nude in the garden of Eden,

257
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:53,893
would not have even thought of knowing anything

258
00:17:54,143 --> 00:17:58,143
more than that, but to eat, live like animals.

259
00:17:58,393 --> 00:18:00,893
They were just like animals.

260
00:18:01,185 --> 00:18:06,435
Then it is the Shakti itself took the form of a snake,

261
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,060
and went and told them that

262
00:18:08,393 --> 00:18:11,435
“You must have the fruit of Knowledge.”

263
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:14,101
She wanted to evolve.

264
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:17,519
That was not the idea of God Almighty,

265
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,519
because it’s quite a headache, you know,

266
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:22,310
to do such a thing.

267
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,352
He thought, “What is the need to have

268
00:18:24,602 --> 00:18:27,101
such headaches around Me?”

269
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:30,685
But Shakti knew Her own style.

270
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:35,935
She knew that She is capable of lots of miracles,

271
00:18:36,352 --> 00:18:40,143
and She can make these human beings understand

272
00:18:40,393 --> 00:18:43,435
the Knowledge, and She can really make them

273
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,644
knowledgeable.

274
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:49,185
So She said, “You must eat this fruit,

275
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:56,685
and you must try to know the Knowledge.”

276
00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:04,018
So a new type of human race started,

277
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:09,477
which wanted to know what is the Knowledge.

278
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:12,810
You have seen that we had all kinds

279
00:19:13,143 --> 00:19:15,727
of primitive people before.

280
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,143
Then they started evolving, evolving.

281
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,143
Now, I have to say that

282
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:29,685
the first creation which took place before that,

283
00:19:31,227 --> 00:19:34,893
there were other higher creations

284
00:19:40,185 --> 00:19:44,644
which were planned by Adi Shakti

285
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:48,893
to plan out the whole thing.

286
00:19:49,227 --> 00:19:51,893
So She created Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha,

287
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:58,560
and She created their lokas, their atmospheres or you can

288
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:02,477
say their areas.

289
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:04,143
In that all the planning was done,

290
00:20:04,477 --> 00:20:08,935
how we can achieve this to make these animals realized

291
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:12,143
souls, from animal to human beings,

292
00:20:12,435 --> 00:20:15,810
and from human beings to realized souls.

293
00:20:16,185 --> 00:20:18,810
It was a very big problem.

294
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:22,809
That’s how they created, you see – as you know that

295
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:24,685
Vishnu had His own loka,

296
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:26,435
Mahesha had His own loka,

297
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:29,310
and Brahmadeva had His own loka.

298
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,602
And they decided among themselves how best we can do it.

299
00:20:33,602 --> 00:20:37,101
Because these three channels were created in human

300
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:39,268
beings later on.

301
00:20:39,268 --> 00:20:43,519
Out of the three channels came out these three Shaktis:

302
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,769
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

303
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,185
They produced two children,

304
00:20:49,477 --> 00:20:51,644
one shakti and one the brother,

305
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:54,143
and then intermarriage and all that took place,

306
00:20:54,393 --> 00:20:58,435
in a way – marriage not in the human way,

307
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:01,769
not in the human way we should say, but they were,

308
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:07,477
the energy was given to the potential man.

309
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:11,143
So the woman, who was the energy representing,

310
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,018
was given to a man.

311
00:21:15,935 --> 00:21:17,810
All these things happened,

312
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:24,644
and they chose to work it out in human beings.

313
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:29,018
It happened like this, that the first working

314
00:21:29,435 --> 00:21:33,727
somehow or other was very effective in India.

315
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:36,893
Or maybe they chose India because Indian climate

316
00:21:37,352 --> 00:21:38,393
is so good.

317
00:21:39,018 --> 00:21:40,644
I mean, you know definitely there are six seasons.

318
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:42,018
It’s not like this anytime,

319
00:21:42,352 --> 00:21:46,227
like this irrational rain comes in, like London

320
00:21:46,602 --> 00:21:47,809
you have to play football also with

321
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:50,393
an umbrella on your head!

322
00:21:52,393 --> 00:21:55,769
So there are exactly six seasons in India,

323
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,143
and they are so well balanced.

324
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:04,769
That’s why this Paramachaitanya is also called as

325
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:08,393
“Ritambhara pragya” in India – not here,

326
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,519
we cannot say.

327
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:12,435
“Ritambhara pragya” means the one

328
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:15,935
which is the Knowledge, pragya,

329
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:20,560
means the one enlightened Knowledge,

330
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:24,310
of the one which makes seasons.

331
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:29,477
Because here ritambhara pragya is in a doldrum.

332
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,893
It’s not at all understanding,

333
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,644
because of the human beings as they are.

334
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,976
They are so much scatterbrain, I should say,

335
00:22:39,435 --> 00:22:42,727
that even the nature has become scatterbrain here,

336
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,227
and cannot understand how to deal with such human

337
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:47,560
beings – is a fact.

338
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:50,685
But in India it is the six seasons are there,

339
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,809
and these six seasons are absolutely known.

340
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,268
One has not studied the astrology of India,

341
00:23:01,602 --> 00:23:03,935
but they have their own astrology –

342
00:23:04,268 --> 00:23:05,935
of course, I don’t believe in it.

343
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:10,893
But the, at the level of a human level

344
00:23:11,227 --> 00:23:13,477
you can see how they depict

345
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,810
and how they can exactly say when it will rain,

346
00:23:17,268 --> 00:23:21,060
when it will not rain; what will happen, that will happen.

347
00:23:21,602 --> 00:23:24,477
Even about the stars, that such a star will be coming.

348
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:27,101
Now this has been done in thousands of years back.

349
00:23:27,435 --> 00:23:28,644
They will exactly say

350
00:23:28,644 --> 00:23:30,809
what time which star will be coming nearer,

351
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,809
what star are today governing,

352
00:23:33,477 --> 00:23:35,143
tomorrow what will be the star there.

353
00:23:35,685 --> 00:23:39,976
In those olden days they had studied all these things.

354
00:23:40,477 --> 00:23:43,352
When I see here, I don’t know what was the situation

355
00:23:43,727 --> 00:23:46,477
at that time in these Western countries,

356
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:50,018
whether there were human beings or not I don’t know;

357
00:23:50,393 --> 00:23:56,435
but historically I think it was not such a developed place.

358
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:03,185
So then all this arrangement was made,

359
00:24:03,185 --> 00:24:08,018
and human beings were made to understand

360
00:24:08,352 --> 00:24:11,893
that there is God.

361
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:17,477
The saints were respected – I’m telling you in India –

362
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,644
real saints were respected,

363
00:24:20,018 --> 00:24:24,602
and they made different observations.

364
00:24:24,935 --> 00:24:28,602
Now when I read say, Adi Shankaracharya,

365
00:24:28,976 --> 00:24:32,727
I am amazed how he knows so many things about Me.

366
00:24:33,101 --> 00:24:35,935
He knows how My knee looks like,

367
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:39,519
he knows how many lines I have on My back,

368
00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:42,851
how many – I mean, it is very amazing how this man

369
00:24:43,185 --> 00:24:46,352
knows everything about Me.

370
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:48,602
That means through his meditative power he could

371
00:24:49,018 --> 00:24:51,602
envisage Me – he never saw Me.

372
00:24:52,018 --> 00:24:55,393
The description and everything is so clear-cut.

373
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:59,352
Now if you say the thousand names of the Goddess,

374
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:04,393
thousand names of the Goddess are so precise.

375
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:08,060
I mean, you can verify them in Me, I am just like that.

376
00:25:08,393 --> 00:25:11,560
Whatever it is, good or bad, whatever is said about Me

377
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,393
is there, is a fact.

378
00:25:14,935 --> 00:25:18,185
And it is the Knowledge of these people

379
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:21,893
is most remarkable: how did they know that

380
00:25:22,227 --> 00:25:24,809
a Goddess is like that?

381
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:28,143
Certain of My things which I also don’t know,

382
00:25:28,143 --> 00:25:32,851
but they are there, and they have described.

383
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:34,976
It’s very surprising.

384
00:25:35,435 --> 00:25:37,976
So their meditative power in India was great.

385
00:25:38,352 --> 00:25:43,310
The reason was, our seasons were disciplined,

386
00:25:43,769 --> 00:25:46,101
people are disciplined.

387
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,602
In India most of the people get up early in the morning,

388
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:51,435
do their pujas, everything, take their baths,

389
00:25:51,893 --> 00:25:56,352
and they go for work, come home, be with the family, have

390
00:25:56,685 --> 00:26:01,060
their food, and then sing some songs and bhajans,

391
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:05,018
and then sleep off – normally.

392
00:26:05,644 --> 00:26:07,393
Very disciplined.

393
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:09,809
They don’t go on holidays,

394
00:26:10,143 --> 00:26:12,727
they don’t get into drinking and things like that.

395
00:26:13,018 --> 00:26:16,352
Normally in the family, no question, if somebody drinks

396
00:26:16,644 --> 00:26:18,769
he’s thrown out of the house.

397
00:26:19,185 --> 00:26:22,143
He’s condemned as a leper.

398
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:26,435
He’s called as a daruda, means he is a drunkard.

399
00:26:27,435 --> 00:26:30,310
And even nowadays some people are drinking,

400
00:26:30,935 --> 00:26:35,477
but they too, they hide their drinking.

401
00:26:35,851 --> 00:26:38,310
Nobody drinks in the presence of others.

402
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:41,893
I mean, I don’t know, their influence might increase

403
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:44,477
and people will start openly drinking,

404
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,809
but normally they don’t.

405
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:51,893
So because of these six seasons being absolutely in

406
00:26:52,227 --> 00:26:58,185
discipline, we knew what to do when, and how to do it.

407
00:26:58,602 --> 00:27:03,268
Now, people could live in the jungles.

408
00:27:03,644 --> 00:27:06,268
Like in England, if you have to go out it takes fifteen,

409
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:09,060
twenty minutes: you have to wear your shoes, socks,

410
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:12,809
your coat, your under- this thing, that thing;

411
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:15,851
otherwise you can’t get out.

412
00:27:16,185 --> 00:27:18,227
And you start from one place; reaching another place

413
00:27:18,602 --> 00:27:21,268
you’ll find it is raining heavily, you have nothing,

414
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,685
you get drenched.

415
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:27,143
But this is not so in India.

416
00:27:27,393 --> 00:27:30,268
It’s so balanced that when you come, all of you come

417
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,644
in winter-time, you have seen it.

418
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:35,893
It doesn’t rain suddenly, it doesn’t happen like that

419
00:27:36,185 --> 00:27:37,810
at a wrong time.

420
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,935
You can stay outside as long as you want.

421
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,101
So these people could live in the jungles,

422
00:27:44,393 --> 00:27:48,851
in the sense we didn’t have so much idea of comfort at all.

423
00:27:48,851 --> 00:27:52,227
In a simple little hut they could live:

424
00:27:52,602 --> 00:27:54,268
a little protection from the sun,

425
00:27:54,685 --> 00:27:58,602
and protection from the rain for rainy season,

426
00:27:58,893 --> 00:28:00,185
that’s all.

427
00:28:01,602 --> 00:28:04,893
And they had very little needs of life.

428
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,143
And we didn’t use plastics – I mean,

429
00:28:07,393 --> 00:28:09,602
there were no plastics that time, or even now

430
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,268
we don’t use plastics.

431
00:28:12,644 --> 00:28:16,810
And we used to have few thalis and things.

432
00:28:17,143 --> 00:28:20,310
In a small family also they’ll have just thalis,

433
00:28:20,644 --> 00:28:24,976
which were just permanently with the family.

434
00:28:25,393 --> 00:28:28,769
Now I find that such a difference there is.

435
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:31,935
You see, in simple living what happens,

436
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:37,727
that you do not take out

437
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:40,268
all the wealth from the Mother Earth.

438
00:28:40,644 --> 00:28:42,769
There’s no ecological problem there.

439
00:28:43,268 --> 00:28:47,185
But by having as you are saying so many glasses for this,

440
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,227
so many glasses for that, all this kind of thing that you

441
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:56,560
produce has no aesthetic value, and has no durability.

442
00:28:56,893 --> 00:28:59,809
So then you have mountains and mountains of these huge

443
00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:03,352
big plastics which cannot be burnt, which cannot be

444
00:29:03,602 --> 00:29:07,976
thrown away, if you throw away in the sea it floats,

445
00:29:08,352 --> 00:29:11,018
and such problems are there.

446
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,268
So this Shakti that was working in those days

447
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,851
was in them to make them seekers;

448
00:29:21,477 --> 00:29:24,268
because they didn’t have to do anything else, you know.

449
00:29:24,268 --> 00:29:26,519
It’s all right, you have food to eat,

450
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:28,060
you have place to sleep,

451
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,685
finished – not much to be done,

452
00:29:31,976 --> 00:29:34,310
living so happily.

453
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:37,435
With all these

454
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:43,393
comforts in the way that so little a demand on your time,

455
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:45,644
they had time, lot of time.

456
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:50,935
And with that time, what did they do?

457
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:55,727
They didn’t go, say, for that, for a swimming or

458
00:29:56,143 --> 00:29:59,393
ballroom dancing, or nothing of the kind.

459
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:02,769
With that time they meditated.

460
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,809
And when that time meditation started,

461
00:30:06,352 --> 00:30:11,560
then they started realizing what is the divine Power,

462
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:15,018
what is Divinity, what is God.

463
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,352
For example I’ll tell you, here people discuss even

464
00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:22,227
the private life of Christ, and say all kinds of things;

465
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:25,602
I mean, it’s impossible in India, nobody does that.

466
00:30:25,935 --> 00:30:28,935
It never comes to their head that

467
00:30:29,352 --> 00:30:31,644
how Krishna had sixteen thousand wives –

468
00:30:31,851 --> 00:30:34,310
must be some reason, He is God after all. God is God,

469
00:30:34,644 --> 00:30:38,185
youare a human being – how can you know about God,

470
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:40,268
because you have come through Him?

471
00:30:40,644 --> 00:30:42,644
They don’t discuss such nonsensical things,

472
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:43,685
must be that.

473
00:30:44,435 --> 00:30:46,352
And now when I told them these are His powers,

474
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,352
sixteen thousand, they said, “Yes.”

475
00:30:49,185 --> 00:30:51,435
Then, the five wives were the five elements – “Yes.”

476
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:53,976
They are God.

477
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,809
Nobody discusses these things.

478
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:58,477
God is – how can you understand God?

479
00:30:58,727 --> 00:31:01,143
Can you understand Me? You can’t.

480
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:04,727
Try – you can’t understand Me.

481
00:31:04,727 --> 00:31:06,809
Very difficult.

482
00:31:07,185 --> 00:31:09,477
So you can’t understand,

483
00:31:09,893 --> 00:31:11,310
you can’t understand God.

484
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,268
Please understand one thing,

485
00:31:13,644 --> 00:31:16,727
that for to understand God is an impossibility.

486
00:31:17,101 --> 00:31:18,769
But you can be in connection with God,

487
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,851
you can be in the company of God,

488
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,809
you can be blessed by God,

489
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,185
you can be looked after by God,

490
00:31:25,644 --> 00:31:27,976
you can know lots of things about God;

491
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:32,352
but you cannot understand.

492
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:37,101
This is another thing one has to know,

493
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,143
that you cannot understand why God does these things,

494
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,018
why He does this, why He does that.

495
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:47,060
You cannot understand, you cannot explain it.

496
00:31:47,602 --> 00:31:49,143
I mean, somebody can even say here,

497
00:31:49,143 --> 00:31:51,143
“Why did He make swastika?”

498
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:53,060
Then, “Why did He make Omkara?”

499
00:31:53,435 --> 00:31:55,769
I mean here the people are so arrogant that they can even

500
00:31:56,185 --> 00:32:00,185
ask God, “Why did You exist?”

501
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,060
They can go to that limit, you know,

502
00:32:02,685 --> 00:32:05,976
there’s nothing surprising.

503
00:32:06,352 --> 00:32:09,976
So this arrogance, this ego has blinded us from God.

504
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,310
We think no end of ourselves,

505
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,268
we are very self-opinionated,

506
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:17,268
and we do not know much about it.

507
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:22,602
So this Power, this Shakti is the one which has given you

508
00:32:22,893 --> 00:32:25,727
Self-realization, will also give you God-realization;

509
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:27,769
but still you will not understand God.

510
00:32:28,185 --> 00:32:31,727
You have to go above God to understand Him.

511
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,769
How will you understand?

512
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:36,477
Supposing there’s something below you,

513
00:32:36,477 --> 00:32:37,810
you can understand;

514
00:32:38,101 --> 00:32:39,727
but something above you, how will you understand?

515
00:32:40,101 --> 00:32:42,727
Supposing somebody is down below in Cabella

516
00:32:43,268 --> 00:32:44,727
and wants to understand about My house,

517
00:32:45,393 --> 00:32:48,143
will he understand?

518
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:53,851
He has to go above the Cabella to see My house.

519
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,976
So the Source from which we have come,

520
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,769
we cannot understand that.

521
00:33:00,101 --> 00:33:01,560
We cannot judge, we cannot say why;

522
00:33:02,685 --> 00:33:08,809
that is God’s wish, God’s desire, whatever He does.

523
00:33:09,018 --> 00:33:10,893
So what we have to say: whatever His wish,

524
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:14,101
we’ll be happy with that.

525
00:33:14,602 --> 00:33:17,727
And the power that is within you is Amba,

526
00:33:18,268 --> 00:33:20,685
is the desire power of God itself.

527
00:33:21,018 --> 00:33:22,393
So whatever your wish is, means that

528
00:33:23,227 --> 00:33:28,018
His wish is that you should enter into His Kingdom.

529
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:31,185
Now you enter into the Kingdom of God.

530
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:33,976
Then the Shakti makes you

531
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:39,393
sit on different beautiful positions,

532
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,227
and some are sitting in the Heart of God,

533
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:46,809
some are sitting in the Sahasrara of God,

534
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,893
in the Kingdom of God.

535
00:33:50,435 --> 00:33:53,227
Now you should assume your power.

536
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:56,227
On Navaratri now, you should understand that it has now

537
00:33:56,685 --> 00:34:01,519
crossed the limit and now we are on the tenth position,

538
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:03,060
where you must assume.

539
00:34:03,352 --> 00:34:05,352
I have told you many a times, now believe that

540
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:07,602
you are Sahaja yogis.

541
00:34:07,602 --> 00:34:10,769
Believe that you are,

542
00:34:11,018 --> 00:34:13,727
you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

543
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,644
You cannot judge God, you cannot say why She does that,

544
00:34:16,644 --> 00:34:18,685
why She does that, why He does that.

545
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:21,809
You cannot say that – that’s different.

546
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:26,435
But when you sit there, then it is not an assembly,

547
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:30,018
it is not like a politician fighting, no;

548
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,685
it is that you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

549
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:38,477
blessed by God, looked after, protected, nourished,

550
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:42,352
and made knowledgeable.

551
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:45,935
But still this arrogance has to go down,

552
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:49,935
that we can understand why it happens.

553
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:54,310
That humility is very important for us;

554
00:34:54,644 --> 00:34:57,976
otherwise this power cannot take you beyond.

555
00:34:58,644 --> 00:35:01,101
Now as it is, it has crossed the Sahasrara,

556
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:04,769
now this power has to go higher and higher.

557
00:35:05,018 --> 00:35:09,809
For that, first you should be humble.

558
00:35:10,227 --> 00:35:12,685
“Humble” doesn’t mean that it should be something

559
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:17,560
artificial humility of a businessman, or a politician.

560
00:35:17,935 --> 00:35:21,519
It is a humbleness is within your heart,

561
00:35:22,018 --> 00:35:25,727
that “Oh God, we don’t want to understand You,

562
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,268
You are too great.

563
00:35:28,644 --> 00:35:33,644
But let us know ourselves.”

564
00:35:34,268 --> 00:35:36,685
And then you’ll be amazed that He has made you

565
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:39,435
like His own image.

566
00:35:39,935 --> 00:35:42,976
That means He has given you all the powers.

567
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,644
He has made you.

568
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:49,477
When He has made you, you cannot make Him.

569
00:35:49,893 --> 00:35:52,602
He is the Source, you cannot make Him.

570
00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:56,143
He has made you in His own image.

571
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:02,644
Now, what you can do is to make others in His image.

572
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,185
These powers are with you.

573
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:07,018
But the first thing you have to have,

574
00:36:07,393 --> 00:36:09,227
the discipline within yourself,

575
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:11,143
that is missing.

576
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,143
People cannot discipline themselves – means

577
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:15,268
if they cannot control themselves,

578
00:36:15,602 --> 00:36:18,935
how can they control anyone?

579
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:24,519
No discipline means you cannot control yourself.

580
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:26,685
So the discipline should be that first

581
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,809
you must see that you control yourself,

582
00:36:30,227 --> 00:36:34,352
because now you are in the Kingdom of God.

583
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:37,893
Have you seen a film called “Mr. Bean”

584
00:36:38,227 --> 00:36:41,602
where they show a stupid man, you see?

585
00:36:42,477 --> 00:36:46,685
So what happens that when you are now come to the court

586
00:36:47,143 --> 00:36:48,685
of the Goddess,

587
00:36:49,018 --> 00:36:51,060
when you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

588
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:54,893
you are made to sit on your throne in a dignified way.

589
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:59,143
But you start behaving like Mr. Bean, you see.

590
00:36:59,435 --> 00:37:01,976
You don’t know how to sit on your seat,

591
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,560
you want to sit on the sides,

592
00:37:04,851 --> 00:37:08,519
you want to sit on the wall or do all kinds of things.

593
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:10,435
There’s no discipline.

594
00:37:10,893 --> 00:37:12,560
You have to have the discipline.

595
00:37:13,101 --> 00:37:14,352
Where are you sitting?

596
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:16,893
You are sitting in the Kingdom of God.

597
00:37:17,352 --> 00:37:18,809
So you should have that dignity,

598
00:37:19,352 --> 00:37:20,809
you should have that affection,

599
00:37:21,435 --> 00:37:22,809
you should have that compassion,

600
00:37:23,143 --> 00:37:27,477
you must have that love, and the dedication.

601
00:37:27,809 --> 00:37:30,352
But if it is not there, then this power is useless,

602
00:37:30,727 --> 00:37:33,893
because you are the vehicle of that power.

603
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:38,060
Supposing I have to take water, I have to have glass

604
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:40,976
which is emptied inside.

605
00:37:41,268 --> 00:37:42,769
If it is already full with ego,

606
00:37:43,185 --> 00:37:45,310
what can you put inside that?

607
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,227
Or if it is a stone, you can’t drink water out of that,

608
00:37:48,644 --> 00:37:56,310
you’ll have to dig in the space for putting the water.

609
00:37:56,685 --> 00:37:59,018
So if you are already filled with your own ideas,

610
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:05,809
with your own conveniences, with your own progress

611
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,727
or whatever it is, only that,

612
00:38:10,018 --> 00:38:13,060
then you cannot rise very high.

613
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:15,727
You have to surrender fully there, to say that

614
00:38:16,393 --> 00:38:19,976
“Mother, whatever is Your desire,

615
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:26,352
that we do not want to have any our individual desire.”

616
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:28,893
Then the desire of God will work.

617
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,893
You want Kundalini to work for you which is the desire

618
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,560
of God,

619
00:38:34,018 --> 00:38:37,435
not your desire, which is independent of your desire,

620
00:38:38,018 --> 00:38:43,018
but is the one which will fulfill your

621
00:38:43,352 --> 00:38:45,352
complete so-called desires,

622
00:38:46,018 --> 00:38:48,018
without even your Knowledge.

623
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:51,352
Miracles after miracles will happen, so many miracles

624
00:38:51,644 --> 00:38:54,393
that now we do not know how to compile the book

625
00:38:54,727 --> 00:38:55,935
even on miracles.

626
00:38:56,393 --> 00:38:58,185
But these miracles are coming to you because you are

627
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:00,101
realized souls.

628
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:03,976
Your attention should be all right, you must see and

629
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:07,893
introspect yourself. “I am sitting in the Kingdom of God,

630
00:39:08,352 --> 00:39:09,976
now what is my situation?

631
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:13,477
Is it worth it, am I worth it, am I behaving in the same

632
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:18,976
manner, or still I don’t believe?”

633
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,560
If you don’t believe, how can you rise?

634
00:39:21,935 --> 00:39:24,268
“Believe” means that you have seen something,

635
00:39:24,685 --> 00:39:26,519
you have known something which is tangible,

636
00:39:26,935 --> 00:39:29,018
you have got the experience of it.

637
00:39:29,393 --> 00:39:33,769
Still you are not surrendered.

638
00:39:34,143 --> 00:39:36,310
If you surrender to the will of God,

639
00:39:36,644 --> 00:39:39,060
then everything is taken charge.

640
00:39:39,435 --> 00:39:41,976
It will never let you down, no question;

641
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,976
and everything, all things which look like

642
00:39:45,352 --> 00:39:48,685
mountains of difficulties and obstructions

643
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:53,560
you will surpass, just like an aeroplane goes over it.

644
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:56,893
You won’t have any problem whatsoever.

645
00:39:57,268 --> 00:40:00,101
So one thing today, I am very happy that this puja is done

646
00:40:00,727 --> 00:40:06,810
by the people from a country which is discipline

647
00:40:07,143 --> 00:40:12,185
is very important – that is, Switzerland.

648
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:18,935
But their discipline is for bad things, not for good.

649
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:25,519
For example, they have a military:

650
00:40:25,851 --> 00:40:29,435
who is going to go to that far-fetched place, you see,

651
00:40:29,685 --> 00:40:30,769
to attack?

652
00:40:31,352 --> 00:40:32,477
No one.

653
00:40:32,851 --> 00:40:34,227
Why do they have military?

654
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:36,435
And compulsory military, do you know that?

655
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:38,435
Because they have looted other people’s money and

656
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:41,727
kept them there, like thugs.

657
00:40:42,018 --> 00:40:43,810
So all that money is in their banks, and they are worried

658
00:40:44,143 --> 00:40:47,185
that any time, you see, any person can come up and

659
00:40:47,477 --> 00:40:56,393
demand the money, and may start using the power

660
00:40:56,644 --> 00:40:58,185
of destruction on us.

661
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,310
So, because they are doing wrong, that’s why they

662
00:41:00,851 --> 00:41:05,352
have a military – out of fear, just out of fear.

663
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:07,644
There is no need to have any military there.

664
00:41:07,644 --> 00:41:10,018
But everybody has to go to military

665
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:12,685
and join the military,

666
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:19,727
because they are thieves of the worst type.

667
00:41:20,602 --> 00:41:24,268
Then secondly, they have also very much slavery

668
00:41:24,727 --> 00:41:26,519
of the watch, which human beings have made,

669
00:41:26,893 --> 00:41:29,060
God has not made.

670
00:41:29,602 --> 00:41:31,851
So the watch is important, because they are

671
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:34,851
making watches.

672
00:41:35,268 --> 00:41:38,185
If they are making watches and if they do not slave

673
00:41:38,435 --> 00:41:43,393
under the watches, who will buy their watches?

674
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:45,893
They will say, “What’s the use of you all have watches,

675
00:41:46,352 --> 00:41:47,644
and the way you are?”

676
00:41:47,893 --> 00:41:49,685
So they are very disciplined.

677
00:41:50,435 --> 00:41:53,185
Not only, they also are, I mean extremely

678
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,560
as they’ve shown yesterday, they’re really

679
00:41:55,893 --> 00:42:00,809
too much of cleanliness in them.

680
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,935
Some of the girls who were married – I must say

681
00:42:04,393 --> 00:42:07,519
I’m sorry to say this, but it is a fact –

682
00:42:07,851 --> 00:42:09,851
were married from Switzerland,

683
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,519
and the reports have come that

684
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,519
“Mother, they must have been maid-servants

685
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:15,435
or bar-maids.”

686
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,227
So I said, “Why?”

687
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,060
“If something falls down somewhere, immediately

688
00:42:19,435 --> 00:42:21,101
they’ll pick it up and keep there.

689
00:42:21,685 --> 00:42:24,018
If something even – it’s just like, like in the guests,

690
00:42:24,352 --> 00:42:26,435
you see the guests are sitting

691
00:42:26,435 --> 00:42:27,809
and they have no time to talk.

692
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:29,685
There’s no question of talking to each other,

693
00:42:30,101 --> 00:42:30,893
there’s nothing;

694
00:42:31,685 --> 00:42:32,935
all the time they are worried about

695
00:42:33,393 --> 00:42:34,602
this thing, this is getting dirty,

696
00:42:35,143 --> 00:42:37,893
that is getting dirty, like maid-servants.”

697
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,185
Can you imagine?

698
00:42:39,644 --> 00:42:42,602
This has also come from the same horrible disciplining

699
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:43,976
that they have.

700
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:48,851
This disciplining is not divine disciplining.

701
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,976
Nature is not like that.

702
00:42:51,352 --> 00:42:53,560
If you see the nature, see how the nature is beautiful,

703
00:42:54,101 --> 00:42:57,560
the – you’ll never find any smell there.

704
00:42:57,851 --> 00:42:59,851
Ha, but if human beings go and live there,

705
00:43:00,227 --> 00:43:04,101
then all smells start. But there is no smell.

706
00:43:04,477 --> 00:43:07,727
Nature looks after itself, it cleanses itself, it does everything.

707
00:43:08,227 --> 00:43:11,143
So for everything there’s a time, it must be done with

708
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:12,809
a little leisure.

709
00:43:13,268 --> 00:43:14,893
I mean, once if you have to clean the house,

710
00:43:15,185 --> 00:43:16,519
so clean the house.

711
00:43:16,893 --> 00:43:18,018
But all the time if your attention is cleaning this,

712
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:20,976
cleaning this, make this clean, put this right –

713
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:27,435
you are good for nothing, you are like a Hoover machine!

714
00:43:28,435 --> 00:43:30,310
And who can love such a woman

715
00:43:30,685 --> 00:43:36,560
who’s just a Hoover machine all the time?

716
00:43:42,477 --> 00:43:46,935
But again as the, you know the Devi has the,

717
00:43:47,352 --> 00:43:50,143
all the extremes, so this is one extreme.

718
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:55,060
And the another extreme is that absolutely lousiest people,

719
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,519
that in England –

720
00:43:58,143 --> 00:44:00,769
absolutely lousy, very lousy.

721
00:44:01,268 --> 00:44:03,644
They can live with all kinds of lousiness,

722
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:08,060
and that is going too far.

723
00:44:08,393 --> 00:44:12,060
So this is in between one has to be.

724
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:16,809
Cleanliness is for us, we are not for cleanliness.

725
00:44:17,018 --> 00:44:20,727
You are not paid for that, you are not maid-servants.

726
00:44:21,227 --> 00:44:22,976
So cleanliness has to be there.

727
00:44:23,393 --> 00:44:24,268
We like it so we’ll make it clean,

728
00:44:24,769 --> 00:44:25,810
but it should not be that

729
00:44:26,185 --> 00:44:29,060
everybody should be panicked about it;

730
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,644
to be in a situation that you have no time to talk to

731
00:44:34,018 --> 00:44:37,227
anyone, to be nice to anyone, also no time even

732
00:44:37,685 --> 00:44:39,851
to meditate.

733
00:44:39,851 --> 00:44:42,060
Even meditating they will be seeing round

734
00:44:42,435 --> 00:44:44,560
if something is falling here, “Oh my God!”

735
00:44:44,976 --> 00:44:46,809
and they will go and pick up.

736
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,769
I wouldn’t be surprised that even in the church they

737
00:44:49,976 --> 00:44:50,893
start doing that!

738
00:44:52,185 --> 00:44:56,352
There’s no discipline of meditation,

739
00:44:56,769 --> 00:45:00,809
discipline of meditation, of divine work,

740
00:45:00,809 --> 00:45:06,769
discipline of following the will of God –

741
00:45:07,101 --> 00:45:09,227
that’s not there.

742
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:12,101
Unless and that discipline comes many,

743
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:16,227
what you are doing is something so mundane and stupid,

744
00:45:16,685 --> 00:45:22,809
useless wastage of your life, have no dignity for yourself.

745
00:45:23,143 --> 00:45:27,727
So now as Sahaja yogis we have to have that discipline

746
00:45:28,185 --> 00:45:30,644
of meditation.

747
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:36,060
Then the Power, this Amba, She knows you so well:

748
00:45:36,435 --> 00:45:37,644
She knows your past,

749
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,685
and She knows what sort of a person you are.

750
00:45:40,685 --> 00:45:43,935
Once you start introspecting

751
00:45:44,268 --> 00:45:46,185
and seeing it within yourself,

752
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,310
“what is wrong with me?”

753
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:53,185
and to reach that state of complete equilibrium,

754
00:45:53,644 --> 00:45:55,018
“what have I to do?” –

755
00:45:55,477 --> 00:45:59,352
is to first of all, you have to meditate.

756
00:46:00,018 --> 00:46:04,352
There is no way out, I must tell you, there is no way.

757
00:46:04,727 --> 00:46:06,727
Somebody said, “Mother, I have given up eating this,

758
00:46:07,101 --> 00:46:09,893
I have given up eating that” – nothing.

759
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:14,310
“Mother, I do this and I stand on my head” – nothing.

760
00:46:14,935 --> 00:46:17,810
You must meditate, and the meditation

761
00:46:18,185 --> 00:46:20,393
should be little bit in the morning

762
00:46:20,727 --> 00:46:22,560
and little bit in the evening.

763
00:46:22,976 --> 00:46:26,602
And don’t see your watch when you are meditating.

764
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:34,477
The time has to be kept for meditation, whatever it is.

765
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:36,477
It takes hardly any time.

766
00:46:36,477 --> 00:46:38,018
I mean, even I have seen women take so much time

767
00:46:38,435 --> 00:46:41,809
to get ready that even one tenth of that time

768
00:46:42,143 --> 00:46:45,352
if you can give for your meditation,

769
00:46:45,727 --> 00:46:48,477
you will be, you’ll not need much make-up.

770
00:46:48,976 --> 00:46:51,602
Your skin will improve, your hair will improve, your face

771
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:54,809
will improve, everything will work out.

772
00:46:55,018 --> 00:46:57,602
You don’t have to use anything, don’t have to use any

773
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,644
perfumes or anything whatsoever,

774
00:47:01,268 --> 00:47:04,310
your body itself will be full of perfume.

775
00:47:04,769 --> 00:47:06,310
Everything will be supplied.

776
00:47:06,727 --> 00:47:10,644
So what we have to do is to first of all see

777
00:47:10,851 --> 00:47:14,101
a surrender to the will of the God.

778
00:47:14,435 --> 00:47:17,560
For Sahaja yogis it’s very important.

779
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:20,769
Once you surrender, all your problems will be solved.

780
00:47:20,976 --> 00:47:23,143
You surrender your problems also.

781
00:47:23,435 --> 00:47:25,851
“I leave it to You. God, You solve the problem.

782
00:47:26,227 --> 00:47:29,810
You do this.”

783
00:47:30,268 --> 00:47:34,060
It is such a precise, such an effective,

784
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:40,143
such an efficient Power.

785
00:47:41,185 --> 00:47:47,519
And above all it loves you, cares for you, it forgives you.

786
00:47:47,851 --> 00:47:49,060
Even if you make mistakes it forgives,

787
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,060
“All right, it will be all right.”

788
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:53,935
It is wanting you all to be properly seated

789
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:59,060
in your thrones, enjoying your power.

790
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,809
So whatever is needed is done with great care.

791
00:48:04,352 --> 00:48:08,268
So Navaratri is now the tenth day of Navaratri,

792
00:48:08,727 --> 00:48:11,227
which is the most important for all of you,

793
00:48:12,018 --> 00:48:18,602
is where this Paramchaitanya has become active.

794
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,810
And by its activity you should know it is become

795
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:23,935
very powerful,

796
00:48:24,644 --> 00:48:29,769
and that now anybody who tries to be nasty with you,

797
00:48:30,435 --> 00:48:34,185
tries to trouble you – “I don’t have to worry at all.”

798
00:48:34,769 --> 00:48:37,060
It will take care of it.

799
00:48:37,976 --> 00:48:40,644
All wrong things you have done,

800
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:43,101
all bad karmas you have done,

801
00:48:43,685 --> 00:48:47,727
you will be rewarded for that, no doubt.

802
00:48:48,143 --> 00:48:50,393
But if you are a realized soul, finished;

803
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:52,519
you are not on that level.

804
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:55,101
Like we can say that ordinary people

805
00:48:55,477 --> 00:48:57,727
can be charged with criminality,

806
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:02,352
but supposing you rise to a higher status of kinghood,

807
00:49:02,727 --> 00:49:04,893
then nobody can charge you.

808
00:49:05,393 --> 00:49:07,227
You are above the law.

809
00:49:07,809 --> 00:49:10,477
In the same way, it has happened with you that nobody

810
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:14,018
can touch you, nobody can destroy you, and

811
00:49:14,644 --> 00:49:17,935
nobody can hamper your progress.

812
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:22,060
Only it is you who can do it.

813
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,435
And nobody can harm Me,

814
00:49:24,769 --> 00:49:27,185
no rakshasa can harm Me and has never done so.

815
00:49:27,685 --> 00:49:31,851
But it is you who can harm Me;

816
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:36,769
because in this life I have taken you into My body,

817
00:49:37,101 --> 00:49:40,893
and I am working it out in My body,

818
00:49:41,352 --> 00:49:44,685
everything, your cleansing, everything,

819
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:46,935
which is a difficult task.

820
00:49:47,268 --> 00:49:48,893
But in the beginning only,

821
00:49:49,185 --> 00:49:52,018
this Power went to Adam and Eve and told them that

822
00:49:52,477 --> 00:49:54,477
“you must have the Knowledge.”

823
00:49:54,477 --> 00:49:58,143
So that promise has to be fulfilled

824
00:49:58,477 --> 00:49:59,727
and that has to be done,

825
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,644
though it’s a very hazardous task.

826
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,727
Specially in the West I find it is very hazardous

827
00:50:05,143 --> 00:50:08,644
to make people understand

828
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:13,393
that they are the part and parcel of the whole;

829
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:15,810
it’s a very difficult task.

830
00:50:16,227 --> 00:50:17,644
They talk of big, big things.

831
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:19,310
I have seen people write articles nowadays

832
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,809
that nothing is substantial,

833
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:27,477
this science is so limited, it has not solved our problem.

834
00:50:27,851 --> 00:50:30,685
All these big, big books they are writing.

835
00:50:31,227 --> 00:50:33,227
But if you write to them now that we have found out

836
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,143
something, they don’t want to see you.

837
00:50:36,602 --> 00:50:37,893
They don’t want to meet you.

838
00:50:38,393 --> 00:50:39,893
They have nothing to do with it.

839
00:50:40,477 --> 00:50:41,810
So I don’t know what sort of seekers they are,

840
00:50:42,352 --> 00:50:46,018
with such a big ego balloon in front, and they are seekers.

841
00:50:46,602 --> 00:50:48,935
What are they seeking?

842
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:51,268
The ego, the balloon – supposing you have a big balloon

843
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,185
and you drop in the water, what will happen,

844
00:50:53,644 --> 00:50:56,310
the balloon will take here and there and there and here,

845
00:50:56,644 --> 00:50:58,935
you have no destination.

846
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,101
In the same way they are without any destination,

847
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,477
saying that “we are seeking, we are doing this,

848
00:51:04,769 --> 00:51:09,976
we are doing that” – without any destination,

849
00:51:10,685 --> 00:51:10,893
without any understanding,

850
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:12,560
without any meaning to their life,

851
00:51:12,935 --> 00:51:14,809
absolutely useless people.

852
00:51:15,227 --> 00:51:16,727
They are worth nothing.

853
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:18,809
We have to try as much as possible

854
00:51:19,185 --> 00:51:20,602
how many we can save;

855
00:51:20,935 --> 00:51:22,435
but those who do not want to come,

856
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:25,519
there’s no need,

857
00:51:25,644 --> 00:51:27,227
there's no need for us.

858
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,393
They have to ask for it, they have to humble down and

859
00:51:30,851 --> 00:51:33,310
they have to say that “We want to come to you” –

860
00:51:33,644 --> 00:51:35,018
then only we’ll have.

861
00:51:35,893 --> 00:51:37,101
I never write any letter to anyone,

862
00:51:37,477 --> 00:51:39,101
“Please come to My program.”

863
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,602
All these gurus used to write to all the actors and

864
00:51:41,893 --> 00:51:45,685
musicians and all that; I never write.

865
00:51:46,018 --> 00:51:47,685
It’s just I am advertising Myself,

866
00:51:48,143 --> 00:51:50,352
if you want to come you can come.

867
00:51:50,685 --> 00:51:54,143
This advertisement also I was not willing.

868
00:51:55,935 --> 00:51:59,727
So you can imagine that

869
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:06,310
we have now brought to the fruitfulness of the promise

870
00:52:06,727 --> 00:52:11,310
given long time back, that you will have the Knowledge.

871
00:52:11,809 --> 00:52:14,185
And you have the Knowledge.

872
00:52:14,809 --> 00:52:16,809
But with this Knowledge you should be identified,

873
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:19,976
and you should know that you have this Knowledge,

874
00:52:20,477 --> 00:52:22,809
and that this Knowledge can be given to others.

875
00:52:23,602 --> 00:52:27,227
And we can transform this world into a beautiful world,

876
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:31,810
and fulfill the vision of Adi Shakti.

877
00:52:32,602 --> 00:52:35,809
She created you for this purpose,

878
00:52:36,268 --> 00:52:38,769
brought you out from human level to the superhuman

879
00:52:39,268 --> 00:52:41,769
level for this purpose,

880
00:52:42,268 --> 00:52:44,393
and that is what you have to do it.

881
00:52:44,393 --> 00:52:50,560
And if you are today worshipping Me as the Jagadamba,

882
00:52:50,851 --> 00:52:52,101
then know that

883
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:58,519
the Jagadamba itself is nothing else but Adi Shakti.

884
00:52:59,018 --> 00:53:04,393
And unless and until you people rise to that level

885
00:53:04,769 --> 00:53:07,644
of disciplining yourself in divine way –

886
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,268
like some people are still smoking,

887
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:13,310
“Oh, it’s all right, you know, we are ordinary people,

888
00:53:13,644 --> 00:53:15,644
we can’t do it.” All right, get out.

889
00:53:15,851 --> 00:53:19,809
Don’t worry about such people. They’ll be left behind,

890
00:53:20,185 --> 00:53:22,685
useless people, where will they go?

891
00:53:23,227 --> 00:53:25,435
They’ll be, I think, hanging in the limbo,

892
00:53:25,851 --> 00:53:29,727
because there isn’t much place now left even in the hell,

893
00:53:30,227 --> 00:53:32,143
so what is going to happen to them?

894
00:53:32,477 --> 00:53:33,560
But all this is available to you;

895
00:53:33,893 --> 00:53:34,810
only thing you must know

896
00:53:35,227 --> 00:53:38,893
how to control yourself, control your senses.

897
00:53:39,268 --> 00:53:42,810
In small, small things also we cannot control ourselves.

898
00:53:43,185 --> 00:53:45,810
If we cannot control our own horses,

899
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:51,727
how can we reach that stage where we have to reach?

900
00:53:52,101 --> 00:53:55,060
So in all these small things don’t waste your energies.

901
00:53:55,435 --> 00:53:59,310
Just think, you have to meditate, you have to rise,

902
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:02,685
and you have to give it to others.

903
00:54:03,101 --> 00:54:07,727
This is very much possible if you really love yourself.

904
00:54:08,143 --> 00:54:10,602
If you love yourself, then you have to understand that

905
00:54:11,227 --> 00:54:16,477
“See my body, see my mind, everything is given to me by

906
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:19,519
God. How beautiful it is.

907
00:54:20,018 --> 00:54:22,935
And now it’s such a beautiful one, and it will be used by

908
00:54:23,268 --> 00:54:28,143
God for such a great purpose.”

909
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:30,810
You are molded, you are made like that

910
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:34,519
up to this point; but now it is your free will,

911
00:54:34,935 --> 00:54:38,809
and with this free will you have to rise.

912
00:54:39,101 --> 00:54:41,352
With this free will you have to understand

913
00:54:41,809 --> 00:54:47,435
what is to be done, and how to achieve that state.

914
00:54:48,602 --> 00:54:58,477
It is nature’s reaction to things.

915
00:54:59,018 --> 00:55:01,769
Always nature reacts to human beings.

916
00:55:02,185 --> 00:55:06,060
Nature has no free will but God reacts,

917
00:55:06,393 --> 00:55:08,935
and when the reaction of the God comes in

918
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:12,435
then we find all these things happening.

919
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,809
And I wish you could listen to My tape on Vishnumaya,

920
00:55:16,227 --> 00:55:20,435
which is very, very well explaining why all these

921
00:55:20,769 --> 00:55:25,851
calamities come, why people die of these calamities.

922
00:55:26,227 --> 00:55:29,227
It was a very good lecture, I hope you all will listen to it,

923
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:32,227
and listen to it again and again.

924
00:55:32,602 --> 00:55:36,018
My lectures should not be just for nice one evening,

925
00:55:36,352 --> 00:55:38,644
but should be something you should try to understand.

926
00:55:39,018 --> 00:55:41,851
Now whatever I am saying is the truth,

927
00:55:42,268 --> 00:55:44,519
is the absolute truth and is a subtle thing,

928
00:55:44,935 --> 00:55:47,560
which none of them have said so far.

929
00:55:48,143 --> 00:55:49,976
Because you have got your realization,

930
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:55,310
because you are Sahaja yogi, I can say this to you.

931
00:55:55,685 --> 00:56:04,435
May God bless you.
