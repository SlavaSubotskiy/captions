enlightened in this world that's the

24
00:04:49,459 --> 00:05:01,789
reality was the Enlightenment of human

25
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:06,559
beings it's not Colonel it's not some

26
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:11,719
love as human beings if they are

27
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:16,729
enlightened then there is no problem

28
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:21,110
anymore left the problems come with the

29
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:24,319
people who are not invited because they

30
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:28,099
are in the darkness they are groping in

31
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:31,179
the darkness and some of them are don't

32
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:39,349
know also that they are company

33
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:48,439
completely ignorant of realities once

34
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:56,449
you come to sahaja yoga and enlighten

35
00:05:48,439 --> 00:06:03,229

36
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:07,149
light what is good what is bad to begin

37
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:15,559

38
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:20,989
beautifully just like these flowers who

39
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:27,589

40
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:34,579
giving you joy in the same way when you

41
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:37,419
are enlightened with that light you

42
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:37,419
don't see anything

43
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:52,120

49
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:16,330

50
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:19,900

51
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:29,380

you have got the light but also you have

57
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:02,070
to give light to others you have to

58
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:05,680
enlighten others just like these colors

59
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:09,960

you know how far to go how to beat

127
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:40,100
people and how to spread sorry it's

128
00:13:35,609 --> 00:13:44,910
something you have already within you

129
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:47,789
but you have to first of all establish

130
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:49,529
your connection with it if you have

131
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:53,639
established your connection with that

132
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:57,239
ocean that will happen you can

133
00:13:53,639 --> 00:14:00,629
definitely work it out work it out in

134
00:13:57,239 --> 00:14:02,069
such a beautiful manner and will be

135
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:06,989
somewhere amazed how you will be

136
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:11,789
successful the success that you get out

137
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:16,439
of all this ignorance you are amazed at

138
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:20,579
it but you have the light with the light

139
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:22,499
you do remove all the darkness doesn't

140
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:26,129
have to think about it just removes

141
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:31,579
because we have but if you don't have

142
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:35,930
the light then no use talking about it

143
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:42,569
no use doing it because

144
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:46,110
it does give any success on the contrary

145
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:54,779
it's a failure failure of the worst type

146
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:58,230
and can be very dangerous for people we

147
00:14:54,779 --> 00:15:03,480
have had very funny experiences also in

148
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:07,170
the search but I think they all are

149
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:11,519
learning one by one thus this should not

150
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:16,680
have been done that was wrong now what

151
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:18,209
blinds you we should find out in this

152
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,050
country it's such a money oriented

153
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:28,740
country America we shall spread all over

154
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:33,600
the world and being money-oriented you

155
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:37,649
do get enamored you do feel that you

156
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:40,769
must make money out of sahaja yoga there

157
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:42,329
are some who do not think like that but

158
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:47,430
they are still running after making

159
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:52,459
money there is no need at all for you to

160
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:57,000
make money or to find for yourself a

161
00:15:52,459 --> 00:16:02,870
kind of a security in one your security

162
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:07,230
is in great within you so all these

163
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:13,949
outside things which are absolutely

164
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:16,550
unnecessary should not blindly now if

165
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:21,870
you have the light you can see clearly

166
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:24,990

surprised how the divine has helped you

169

170
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:37,970
points I get letters from people who say

it's your light which has removed the

175
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:58,990
darkness if you are ignorant then only

176
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:06,380
the light can remove the darkness of

177
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:10,840
your ignorance actually we don't know

178
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:16,550
how much there is the power of the light

179
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:24,470
as you can see here every light is

180
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:29,000

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:50,660
person or take any special care or

00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:54,920
anything you will just know that this

187
00:17:50,660 --> 00:18:00,400
person is realized soul or not I've had

188
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:05,330
many such experiences where I found that

189
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:10,220
people don't know is realized very

190
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:16,120
surprising if you know who is a realized

191
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:20,720
soul then half of your problem is over

192
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:24,710
now the second one is the problem of how

193
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:29,660
to convince that fellow what he is

194
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:34,990
capable of I find that problem also with

195
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,990
circles they are capable

196
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:45,780
a very great book all over the world

197
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:51,150
they can find out so many things which

198
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:55,650
are normally normal people cannot find

199
00:18:51,150 --> 00:19:00,390
out but sahaja Yogi's can immediately

200
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:05,280
find out what sort of a person you're

201
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:09,380
facing this is the difference that means

202
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:14,520
you know the truth truth about everyone

203
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:21,930
truth about the whole situation truth

204
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:25,770
about who is just boosting or just

205
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:29,070
making up a story or some sort of a

206
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:32,580
hypocrisy it's not difficult because now

207
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:37,260
you have the site you can see with your

208
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:42,480
light what's wrong what's good with

209
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:48,590
others such a blessing it is for you

210
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:55,370
that you cannot be cheated because also

211
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:59,670
you are looked after by the divine

212
00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:03,410
guided all the time by the river have

213
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:08,010
faith that you have faith in the divine

214
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:12,960
that's very important as you have faith

215
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:16,890
in a cannibal have faith that the divine

216
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:22,710
will give you a light will guide your

217
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:25,830
path to take you to the right place to

218
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:28,710
do the right thing I mean so many of

219
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:31,410
these experiences are with you I need

220
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:34,350
not tell you how much people have

221
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:37,400
written to me how they found things

222
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,400
working out

223
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:48,450
despite all that we are collecting we

224
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:56,220
are nice to each other we don't tell

225
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:58,740
lies we don't try to destroy anyone that

226
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:02,550
means we are much above all human

227
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:06,000
feelings and this is only because of the

228
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:10,740
light you can see where you are

229
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:16,980
faltering it it's just you see for

230
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:21,600
yourself for that I think meditation is

231
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:25,590
the most important thing is every day

232
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:31,400
should do meditation those who do not do

233
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:36,440
meditation not capable of falling down

234
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:40,950
because meditation is like putting oil

235
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:44,880
into the love those who do not meditate

236
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:50,550
think they can do without it or sand

237
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:56,700
instead they have to meditate morning

238
00:21:50,550 --> 00:22:01,170
and him the problem is everything comes

239
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:04,050
from Andy so simple that they don't

240
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:09,179
understand that meditation is very

241
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:12,960
important typical not you but there are

242
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:21,860
many I know who get realization don't

243
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:26,520
meditate and their style is different

244
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:31,260
their nature is different meditation is

245
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:37,470
such a soothing such a beautiful way of

246
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:41,820
connection with the divine that all your

247
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:43,260
problems get solved in that meditative

248
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:48,280
mood

249
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:53,110
if you are not meditating you are not

250
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:55,720
following meditation then maybe your

251
00:22:53,110 --> 00:23:06,760
light will go down it won't give

252
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:12,130
sufficient is importantly wearing to

253
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:16,750
find out about yourself about others in

254
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:22,870
the medication how to do meditation many

255
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:26,710
people ask don't do anything to just go

256
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:30,309
into thoughtless already try to go to

257
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:33,130
the thoughtless awareness if you can get

258
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:37,510
into that condition of thoughtless

259
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:41,910
awareness you can your job because

260
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:46,150
that's the point where you are the truth

261
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:50,620
with the reality with a joy with

262
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:55,870
everything that is so condom when you

263
00:23:50,620 --> 00:24:01,230
meditate try not to not to make some

264
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:04,809
sort of a function out of it no

265
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:09,360
meditation is something silencing

266
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:13,120
yourself silencing your thoughts and

267
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:18,809
going to that deep ocean which is within

268
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:22,330
yourself but supposing you don't do that

269
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:25,360
if you don't breathe it eight I can make

270
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:29,490
out immediately those who are meditating

271
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:32,290
and those work it's not difficult for me

272
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:38,230
those who do not meditate are always

273
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:40,559
hesitated they are confused they can't

274
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,559
honest

275
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:50,190
and that's why meditation is the most

276
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:55,140
important thing in self just like a

277
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:58,320
light burns the electricity flowing in a

278
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:05,000
treadle concern or by because of the

279
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:10,590
tunnels in the same way meditation is a

280
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:15,299
continuous availability of the divine

281
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:20,640
force that will reduce all your

282
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:25,260
operations not only that but takes out

283
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:31,500
all the negative thoughts it takes out

284
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:35,460
all the discouraging thing and when you

285
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:40,290
are meditating like that thoughtless

286
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:47,220
awareness then he'll be amazed how you

287
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:50,520
are ahead from within and without it's a

288
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:56,570
terrible power that works is thoughtless

289
00:25:50,520 --> 00:26:00,150
awareness so those who do not meditate

290
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:05,220
cannot go very much far with that

291
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:08,490
wantage of sahaja yoga once you try to

292
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:14,010
meditate and go up to the point of

293
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:19,230
thoughtless oil so what happens to you

294
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:26,880
if you are in thoughtless awareness what

295
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:32,640
happens to you is that you get

296
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:40,710
the confidence complete confidence talk

297
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:43,590
to you later you know you have that have

298
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:46,650
seen children coming from our school in

299
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:51,780
the rosh hashanah extremely confident

300
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:55,950
and extremely humble and i asked them

301
00:26:51,780 --> 00:27:03,780
what do you do he said they said / we

302
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:08,780
meditate we meditate in the school in

303
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:11,870
the evening and that meditation helps

304
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:16,070
imagine the small children can say that

305
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:20,130
so why not you also understand that

306
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:24,720
meditation will give you security it

307
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:28,610
will give you a real enlightenment and a

308
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:32,930
complete connection with the divine

309
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,930
without the connection of the divine

310
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:37,310
most elusive green sahaja yoga

311
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:57,690
I know the people who are meditating who

312
00:27:53,909 --> 00:28:01,529
have gone down into their being and who

313
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:06,239
are very developed also I know people

314
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:09,539
one little supervision your depth is in

315
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:13,309
thoughtless awareness is a very

316
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:16,950
important point which you should reach

317
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:20,759
looking at anything if you are

318
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:24,659
thoughtlessly aware then you really

319
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:32,190
become reflective about just works out

320
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:35,460
that way I don't know how far you can

321
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:39,809
remain in that condition but even for a

322
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:43,529
second you can achieve it star achieving

323
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:46,769
it more than I have talked so much about

324
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:52,049
meditation before but today when I see

325
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:55,619
all these candles burning I think they

326
00:28:52,049 --> 00:29:01,289
are all meditative they are all in

327
00:28:55,619 --> 00:29:05,129
meditation and that's how their work in

328
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:09,749
the same way sahaja Yogi's who meditate

329
00:29:05,129 --> 00:29:12,450
I know and those who don't I know and if

330
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:16,019
they have problems I know why the

331
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:18,539
problems are their main thing is your

332
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:22,859
connection with the divine is only

333
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:26,369
possible when you meditate and become

334
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:33,340
thoughtlessly aware that's the point

335
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:39,890
where you mind works it helps

336
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:44,020
it comes to your help in such great that

337
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:47,870
you don't know how we have achieved it

338
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:52,400
so thoughtless awareness in the first

339
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:57,860
point all of you should achieve very

340
00:29:52,400 --> 00:30:00,890
important after that we can achieve

341
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:06,370
something else but the first step is

342
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:11,330
thought the Sun it is very important to

343
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:14,750
become thoughtlessly aware because then

344
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:18,320
there are no thoughts coming from the

345
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:24,070
left or right from the present or the

346
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:28,100
future just in the present you are there

347
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:32,150
it's something you all have it's not

348
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:36,050
that me I am saying that to you but all

349
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:38,990
of you have this but steady yourself you

350
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:42,890
have to steady yourself at thoughtless

351
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:46,070
awareness how long that's not the point

352
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:49,150
the point is once you touched it you

353
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:53,420
will go on touching it many people

354
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:57,670
meditate but their thought process is

355
00:30:53,420 --> 00:31:03,470
going on they are not thoughtlessly

356
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:07,690
silent now this is the one point which

357
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:10,550
is very important if you have to grow

358
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:13,250
you should be absolutely in connection

359
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:16,730
with the divine through thoughtless

360
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:19,430
awareness you don't have to bring you

361
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:22,580
don't have to call anyone nothing it

362
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:25,130
just works because it is within you all

363
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:28,370
these thoughts are bombarding from both

364
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:31,310
the sides in your mind these thoughts

365
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:36,040
that are coming to you have no meaning

366
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:37,760
with you they do not substantiate

367
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:42,310
yourself you

368
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:46,670
ocean and you have to get into that

369
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:50,650
state of thoughtless awareness it is

370
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:55,640
always described in all the great books

371
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:57,920
but not so clearly I am Telling I don't

372
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,350
say that some of you do not get

373
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:04,850
thoughtless awareness so they are good

374
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:07,940
for nothing no but please try you can

375
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:11,900
all get into that state of thoughtless

376
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:16,090
awareness even for a second if you get

377
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:25,430
it is a very good idea then you go on

378
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:29,210
increasing that second I think this is a

379
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:34,640
reflecting mind when you look at

380
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:43,730
something you can become thoughtlessly

381
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:49,880
aware and then if mind effects to the

382
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:53,300
depth of what you see that's how you all

383
00:32:49,880 --> 00:33:01,760
will become really very creative sahaja

384
00:32:53,300 --> 00:33:04,880
Yogi's would I find that this state of

385
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:09,320
thoughtless awareness is not established

386
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:12,800
by many which is not good today on this

387
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:15,920
day of diwali i would say that you

388
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:20,450
enlighten yourself we thought this

389
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:22,850
awareness it is not difficult is within

390
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:26,740
you because thoughts are coming from

391
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:31,040
this side and that side and they are not

392
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:37,010
the waves of your brain no just your own

393
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:40,580
reactions but in case you meditate in

394
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:41,360
the real sense of the world then you

395
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,120
will get in

396
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:48,200
to that thoughtless awareness which is a

397
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:51,590
very important point and all these

398
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:56,780
nonsensical thoughts which are of no use

399
00:33:51,590 --> 00:34:00,910
to you will disappear they won't be

400
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:07,210
there and then your growth is possible

401
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:09,889
and you grow very many people are here

402
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:15,800
who will save the mother we don't get

403
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:19,520
that straight try try that I don't

404
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:24,109
believe you cannot get it all of you can

405
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:30,429
get that thought that I can eat it and

406
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:30,429
you will get in that you don't have to

407
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:40,970
discard anything you don't have to see

408
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:44,780
anything just go into meditation and

409
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:48,050
you'll be amazed how little work of

410
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:52,100
course you are many was there most of

411
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:57,880
you but still they would say increase

412
00:34:52,100 --> 00:35:02,000
that thoughtless awareness that area

413
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:06,580
today is very important because of this

414
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:12,609
day of the valley the valley is supposed

415
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:17,060
to be enlightenment II but enlightenment

416
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:21,650
within is how much you are in

417
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:27,080
thoughtless alone under everything works

418
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:30,320
out because you are the ocean of it you

419
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:35,660
have it within yourself only you have to

420
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:41,180
tap it if you don't have it then in the

421
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:44,750
world you have to just tap it and you'll

422
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:46,720
be amazed that you are a source of such

423
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:52,330
on

424
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:57,520
source or such happiness I should say

425
00:35:52,330 --> 00:36:03,520
source of really frightening so today's

426
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:07,030
message is that while meditating go into

427
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:12,240
thoughtless awareness no thought is

428
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:14,619
important because it's your own creation

429
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:20,080
but if you have to become with the

430
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:22,450
divine creation you have to get to that

431
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:26,260
state of thoughtless awareness minimum

432
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:30,599
of me once that comes to you gradually

433
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:33,160
it will grow and you will be amazed how

434
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:37,119
you will be able to grow into sahaja
