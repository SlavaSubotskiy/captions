1
00:00:01,444 --> 00:00:05,060
Today I told you about Kundalini,

2
00:00:05,261 --> 00:00:12,593
and that Kundalini is the Pure Desire
within us,

3
00:00:16,274 --> 00:00:22,018
that manifests or is awakened

4
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:27,483
to give us our Self-realization.

5
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:36,178
Means the desire is only fulfilled when
you get your Self-realization,

6
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:40,943
otherwise it is not manifested – it is just
dormant;

7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:49,825
it is still residual. It has created
the whole universe,

8
00:00:50,026 --> 00:00:56,679
but until and unless you get
Self-realization,

9
00:00:57,443 --> 00:01:03,816
unless and until you become one with
your Spirit,

10
00:01:05,716 --> 00:01:10,026
you have not achieved the manifestation
of this power,

11
00:01:10,227 --> 00:01:15,322
which will go on making you run and run
and run,

12
00:01:15,523 --> 00:01:19,832
thinking that you have not yet achieved,
or you have not found out your meaning.

13
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:24,771
It will be there, all the time, sleeping,

14
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:28,878
but giving you a feeling of vacuum,
you see.

15
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:34,381
So this power must be made to manifest,

16
00:01:34,582 --> 00:01:37,684
but when it manifests…

17
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:43,184
[Shri Mataji pauses to comfort an
infant: “What’s it? What happened?

18
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:47,587
Well, let it be, let him sit down, come.
What happened? Come along.

19
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:52,248
What’s happening? Eh? It’s alright."

20
00:01:52,449 --> 00:01:58,946
(Shri Mataji kisses the child) “Alright.
Alright?” (The baby: “Yes”) “Good.

21
00:02:06,818 --> 00:02:13,327
Now one has to keep quiet, alright?”
(Shri Mataji kisses the child.)]

22
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:19,755
Then, this power has got certain qualities.

23
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:27,433
The first quality it has got, this is
ungrahavati,

24
00:02:27,634 --> 00:02:32,736
means it goes against the gravity.

25
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:40,629
It goes against the gravity. You see,
a thing rises,

26
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:44,228
 it doesn’t go down.

27
00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:51,749
So a person who has to be aspiring
by nature.

28
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:58,172
If a person is not aspiring type
the Kundalini doesn’t rise.

29
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,184
Because, like, you see that, when food
passes down our stomach

30
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:09,014
it presses the sides of the intestines.

31
00:03:09,215 --> 00:03:14,358
By that these movements of going down
takes place. Do you see my point?

32
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:20,761
So when the Kundalini starts, and starts
pressing on the sides of the chakras,

33
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:25,905
she creates a feeling of throwing it higher
and higher,

34
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:29,680
so the chakras bounce it upward.

35
00:03:33,552 --> 00:03:36,614
All the heavy things,

36
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:43,431
all go downward,

37
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:52,979
but the Kundalini rises higher and higher
and higher, because it is like fire.

38
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:58,632
Fire never burns downward. It always
burns upward.

39
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:09,084
She looks also like fire, and she has
the capacity of fire within her.

40
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:21,368
The fire has a capacity to purify, and to
burn off whatever can be burnt off.

41
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:25,537
It purifies the things which it cannot
burn,

42
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:29,709
and burns off the things which are
inflammable, which can be burnt out.

43
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,378
[Aside: “Come along, come forward”.
Man: “Thank you very much”.]

44
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:50,611
So, the quality of fire that exists
in the Kundalini

45
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,770
burns off whatever is useless.

46
00:04:57,976 --> 00:05:03,255
Like in our house we find all the useless
things, and we take them in the garden

47
00:05:03,456 --> 00:05:07,854
and burn them off, finished – once for all
they are finished.

48
00:05:08,055 --> 00:05:12,036
So when the Kundalini rises, she also burns
off all useless things that you have,

49
00:05:12,237 --> 00:05:18,938
all your useless desires, your useless
ideas of action,

50
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:25,828
all sorts of useless accumulation
of feelings and egos,

51
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:29,288
and every sort of a nonsensical thing that
is in between.

52
00:05:29,473 --> 00:05:33,051
Everything is burnt off fast, because they
can be burnt,

53
00:05:33,252 --> 00:05:39,502
they are not eternal by nature. They are
not eternal by nature.

54
00:05:39,703 --> 00:05:45,625
They are temporarily there. All that is
temporary, she burns off,

55
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:53,666
and that’s how she enlightens the Spirit,
because Spirit cannot be burnt by anything.

56
00:05:55,455 --> 00:06:03,501
But this burning is so beautiful that it
burns off all that is bad, stagnating,

57
00:06:03,702 --> 00:06:08,918
all that is polluting, all that is
a disease,

58
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:12,767
and cools down the system.

59
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:22,163
It is very interesting to see how this
power of fire becomes the cool breeze,

60
00:06:22,593 --> 00:06:26,938
but in the science also you find that
electricity can give you

61
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:30,431
hot breeze or cool breeze.

62
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:33,647
You can transform from one to another,

63
00:06:33,848 --> 00:06:37,675
but there is no ultimate for these things,
they are always reversible.

64
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:41,723
Supposing something becomes a magnetism,
you can always convert into electricity,

65
00:06:41,924 --> 00:06:45,229
electricity can always be converted
into magnetism.

66
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,003
But Kundalini is such a thing that once
she burns off

67
00:06:50,204 --> 00:06:56,406
everything that is there, that’s how you
get heat, because she’s burning.

68
00:06:56,607 --> 00:07:03,308
But when she cools down and becomes cool
then she is not reversible.

69
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:09,969
That’s why it is a living process. Living
process is never reversible.

70
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,876
All dead processes can be reversible,

71
00:07:13,077 --> 00:07:16,288
but anything that is reversible – now,
supposing you are grown up:

72
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:20,321
you cannot become a little baby. Whatever
you may try -

73
00:07:20,522 --> 00:07:25,461
you may have any number of operations -
you cannot become that.

74
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:32,047
Now you are grown up, now you are modern,
over-developed.

75
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:35,543
You may try anything to become a primitive
person – you cannot.

76
00:07:35,744 --> 00:07:41,897
You just cannot, whatever you may try.
That will be all very artificial.

77
00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:47,212
You may just feel that you have become
primitive by wearing some sort of a dress,

78
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:51,751
by feeling that, ‘Oh, now there’s no
modernism in us, and now we have become

79
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:55,228
very, very subdued’, nothing of the kind.

80
00:07:56,396 --> 00:08:03,465
It is curable, but not reversible. But,
it’s a living process.

81
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:12,327
So, Kundalini within us expedites the
living process within us of our evolution.

82
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:21,658
So the power of Kundalini is to purify,
she purifies us like fire.

83
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:31,403
She doesn’t purify us like water, it’s
surprising,

84
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:36,977
she doesn’t purify us like water. Now,
water, what does the water do?

85
00:08:37,178 --> 00:08:44,456
Water never burns off anything, but
it dissolves certain things.

86
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,889
It can take in something within itself,
you see?

87
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:51,093
It can contain some of the dirt within
itself.

88
00:08:51,294 --> 00:08:55,076
Supposing you put a color in the water –
it assumes the color.

89
00:08:55,277 --> 00:08:58,861
But Kundalini does not assume the color.

90
00:08:59,482 --> 00:09:03,515
She burns off. Do you follow My point?

91
00:09:03,716 --> 00:09:08,656
So, if you have anything wrong within you,
she’ll burn it off,

92
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:12,431
but she’ll not absorb – she’s pure.

93
00:09:14,623 --> 00:09:17,434
She cannot absorb

94
00:09:18,817 --> 00:09:25,601
those things into her that will pollute her.
She cannot be polluted.

95
00:09:28,924 --> 00:09:33,959
This quality of fire -

96
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,090
say for example, if you put gold in fire,
silver in fire, you can purify these things.

97
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,484
Their pure form comes in… That’s how
you know.

98
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:49,010
But if you put gold and fire in water,
nothing will happen.

99
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:55,265
At the most you can wash them from outside.
But in and out you cannot do it.

100
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:02,850
So outwardly you can do with other things,
but with Kundalini you do in and out.

101
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,437
The face also looks beautiful,

102
00:10:07,638 --> 00:10:15,713
as if some glazing has taken place
on the face, a new, bright face.

103
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:23,784
It’s not sallow, neither it is horribly
burning,

104
00:10:23,985 --> 00:10:28,860
nor is it pale and ugly-looking,

105
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:36,646
but it becomes radiant. Radiance, that’s
what Kundalini gives you.

106
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:45,136
It looks also, as if a molten

107
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,117
iron, you see - have you seen molten
iron? –

108
00:10:49,318 --> 00:10:56,290
Pillar of – supposing you take a pillar
of iron and, and heat it,

109
00:10:56,491 --> 00:11:01,245
to a point where it starts showing,
you see, copper, every color in it,

110
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:05,487
copperish and all sorts of color you see,
see it’s golden, copperish and all that,

111
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:10,171
you see, like a furnace. But very silently,

112
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:15,691
very silent, it works out.

113
00:11:17,084 --> 00:11:19,640
Now, the sound of Kundalini

114
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:23,680
I have told you in one of My lectures,
how it creates sound.

115
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:30,814
For example at Vishuddhi, it creates
the sound of all the vowels

116
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:35,253
that are in Sanskrit language. The English
vowels are very few.

117
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:42,674
Sanskrit language are a aa – i ii – u uu –
ru ruu – lru lruu –

118
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:50,210
e aì – o aù – am ah. These are the sounds
at Vishuddhi we can say.

119
00:11:51,152 --> 00:11:55,543
But she creates sounds on all the chakras,

120
00:11:55,781 --> 00:12:03,086
but when she comes to Nabhi it becomes
a vani.

121
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:07,181
Vani means information,

122
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:11,170
coded information,

123
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:15,337
that’s the nearest you get, coded
information.

124
00:12:15,538 --> 00:12:19,477
First it is the Paravani, which you don’t
hear.

125
00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:25,903
When it rises from the Kundalini point –
means Mooladhara Chakra and Mooladhara,

126
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:31,232
then it is not heard – there’s no sound.

127
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:36,455
Then it comes to the stomach, the Paravani
starts.

128
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:46,020
Then it comes into the centre, where, in
the heart, always you hear it – Madhyama -

129
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:52,578
where you can hear it ‘Lub dub, Lub dub,
Lub dub’, just like heart,

130
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:57,151
properly. With a stethoscope you can
hear it.

131
00:12:58,356 --> 00:13:02,329
Then it comes to Vishuddhi. It becomes
a witness,

132
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:06,109
means ‘Pashyanti’, the One who Sees.

133
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:09,737
Might have noticed yourself, when you are
caught up in Vishuddhi,

134
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:16,185
you feel the thing going on here. But here
she sees.

135
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,256
Then this sound, which is the sound with
which you speak,

136
00:13:24,705 --> 00:13:30,640
when it comes to the throat, it becomes
Vaikhari, is saying.

137
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:35,917
This is even before the Kundalini’s there,
the Vani, the coded information,

138
00:13:36,118 --> 00:13:40,456
the language, which is first only coded,
becomes decoded here,

139
00:13:40,632 --> 00:13:43,165
she it called Vaikhari, which talks.

140
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:48,240
But after realization, the Kundalini
enlightens the vani,

141
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:51,205
as it enlightens everything else.

142
00:13:51,406 --> 00:13:58,311
Because of that enlightenment, your mantras
become enlightened.

143
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:07,401
And that’s how, when you say a mantra,
it is effective, it’s lighted.

144
00:14:07,951 --> 00:14:13,646
Before this, any mantra said has no
meaning, it’s just ordinary Vani,

145
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:16,594
just like in any ordinary person.

146
00:14:16,786 --> 00:14:22,285
So, it is called as the mantra which is
‘Jagrut’, awakened.

147
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:26,964
So, a mantra which is Jagrut cannot be
created out of a mantra

148
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:30,223
which is not enlightened.

149
00:14:33,428 --> 00:14:36,146
Like if you have, say, an earthen pot

150
00:14:36,347 --> 00:14:40,105
or an earthen thing like this, or this one
as it is,

151
00:14:40,306 --> 00:14:44,291
and you have all the oil and everything
there:

152
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:49,053
still it won’t give light till it is
enlightened.

153
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:54,499
In the same way, the mantra is nothing,
it’s just a dead pot.

154
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:00,764
Unless and until it is enlightened by
Kundalini, it is from ordinary vani,

155
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,679
which cannot give you enlightenment,
and which cannot give enlightenment

156
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,302
to the mantras, and that’s why these
mantras have no meaning at all.

157
00:15:10,891 --> 00:15:14,810
A person whose Spirit is enlightened,

158
00:15:15,391 --> 00:15:21,522
and his vani is enlightened,

159
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:27,176
such a person, whatever he says comes true.

160
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:30,049
Whatever he asks for happens.

161
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:37,701
Even before he says something, the desire,
the desire within us,

162
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:44,057
which is the Paravani, which is the coded
information of the desire you have,

163
00:15:44,258 --> 00:15:47,512
becomes enlightened, and that’s how you
get the results.

164
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:51,612
Suddenly you get something, you said:
"Oh, I have struck the jackpot,

165
00:15:51,813 --> 00:15:54,600
and Mother has done it".

166
00:15:55,601 --> 00:16:02,051
That’s how it works out. The whole system
works out this way, of Kundalini.

167
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:07,254
So this pure Kundalini creates purity
within us.

168
00:16:07,455 --> 00:16:10,956
Without the purity we cannot see anything.
Anything that is impure -

169
00:16:11,157 --> 00:16:17,430
say, say my hands are not clean, I can’t
see the light.

170
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:20,642
Anything that is dirtied, you cannot see
the real picture of it,

171
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:25,290
you cannot see the reality if it is not
been purified.

172
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:30,233
But, even if it is superficially purified
or artificially painted,

173
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:34,387
still, you can always say that it is
artificially painted,

174
00:16:34,588 --> 00:16:39,586
and you cannot see the beauty of this one,
because this is done from outside.

175
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:47,664
But this Kundalini burns off everything -
bhasmasat - makes everything into ashes,

176
00:16:48,737 --> 00:16:54,137
and whatever remains is the pure gold
of the Spirit within us.

177
00:16:56,863 --> 00:17:00,333
That’s why, when people try to raise
the Kundalini by wrong methods,

178
00:17:00,534 --> 00:17:05,984
she shows her temper. Actually, she never
gets angry.

179
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:10,960
If Kundalini gets angry such a person can
never exist, is impossible,

180
00:17:11,161 --> 00:17:14,453
but doesn’t happen normally.

181
00:17:14,654 --> 00:17:20,463
But it is Shri Ganesha, which is the Deity
of Shri Kundalini, gets angry,

182
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:27,242
and He creates this problem of heat.
Because she’s fire, and He’s the deity.

183
00:17:27,443 --> 00:17:34,155
So the fire of this Kundalini works out
in such a manner

184
00:17:34,356 --> 00:17:38,518
that your sympathetic nervous gets excited
with heat,

185
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:43,079
and one may get even blisters and things,
if you try any tricks with Kundalini,

186
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,841
any unholy behaviour... (inaudible words).

187
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:56,225
The Urdhva-vati of Kundalini, the rising
of the Kundalini, is its nature.

188
00:17:56,426 --> 00:18:02,095
But when she goes and touches the Sahasrara,
that is an important point.

189
00:18:03,422 --> 00:18:08,084
If she does not touch the Sahasrara, then
the Grace doesn’t fall in,

190
00:18:08,252 --> 00:18:16,374
and the Grace has to come in within us on
our both sides of the Ida and Pingala Nadi.

191
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:19,867
That’s how you feel relaxed.

192
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:28,428
Now, how important it is for us to preserve
our being, before coming to realization.

193
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:35,639
To preserve it as it is. But we do not
preserve. We make mistakes.

194
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:41,191
Kundalini is not forgiveness, she does not
forgive you.

195
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:48,117
She is not the one who can forgive, because
her nature is hot, like the fire.

196
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,764
She cannot forgive. Only the Spirit can
forgive.

197
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:59,200
Only the Atma can forgive, because she is
the one who indicates all your problems.

198
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:04,415
She is the one who cleanses you. She has
to cleanse you.

199
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:07,440
If she starts forgiving you, your dirt will
be left there.

200
00:19:07,641 --> 00:19:12,115
As we do, you see, we clean: “Oh, it cannot
be cleaned, leave it alone, what to do?”.

201
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:16,950
She is not like that. If it is not clean,
she’ll burn.

202
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:26,173
Cancer is the cause of neglect of Kundalini
awakening.

203
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:36,008
Unless and until Kundalini is awakened,
you cannot cure cancer of any person.

204
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:43,848
So, if somebody, say, has a nice
mother-in-law, she might be a relation,

205
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:50,005
and she was a good lady, she also tried
to take vibrations and all that,

206
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:53,997
she was quite aged, maybe she might be
also a seeker.

207
00:19:54,198 --> 00:19:58,818
But it acts best on seekers, because
the Kundalini has to be awakened

208
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:02,245
and she will not be awakened unless
and until you have aspirations.

209
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:06,425
And if you have no aspirations, if you just
try to get it for your curing,

210
00:20:06,626 --> 00:20:12,325
you might get cured, by her awakening,
but it’s a very forced action.

211
00:20:12,526 --> 00:20:16,238
It’s not so natural, there’s no suction
about it.

212
00:20:19,342 --> 00:20:23,198
We can say like that, supposing in this
room we light fire,

213
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:26,750
there is no oxygen, it won’t live.

214
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:32,216
So we have to have that oxygen within us
of our aspirations.

215
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:38,550
If that atmosphere doesn’t exist,
Kundalini takes time to rise.

216
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:44,829
Unless and until you are realized you
cannot keep Kundalini up there.

217
00:20:46,422 --> 00:20:49,342
You may just touch it, go down, again
you’ll touch it, go down,

218
00:20:49,543 --> 00:20:52,761
again you’ll touch it, go down.
So, as a result of this,

219
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:56,582
some people start feeling the guilt.

220
00:20:56,783 --> 00:21:02,066
‘Why should I have done this? I should not
have done that’, and all that.

221
00:21:03,118 --> 00:21:08,281
But after realization, this guilt is
a big problem.

222
00:21:08,482 --> 00:21:11,729
Even before realization, I find, it is.

223
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:17,754
Because guilt is an escape, where all
the things are accumulated,

224
00:21:18,574 --> 00:21:24,084
which have to be burned off. You see,
all things accumulate on the side,

225
00:21:24,285 --> 00:21:29,049
very nicely stored - stored away you see,
kept there nicely,

226
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,544
so they do not face the Kundalini and get
burnt.

227
00:21:34,348 --> 00:21:37,521
And that’s how the left side of a person

228
00:21:37,722 --> 00:21:42,031
goes on recurring all the time,
all the time, through these two points

229
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:47,740
of left Nabhi and left Vishuddhi.

230
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:51,646
Allow the Kundalini to burn it off.

231
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:59,412
Just put this to the fire.

232
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:05,828
And when you put this to fire of Kundalini
it will burn off completely.

233
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:10,206
Don’t build up any kind of guilt. At least
after realization.

234
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:14,740
Before realization, of course, one has
to worry a little bit.

235
00:22:18,054 --> 00:22:23,541
But, even telling all this, it is convenient
to feel guilty.

236
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:27,628
You avoid all problems by feeling guilty,
‘Oh, I should not have done it, I’m sorry’

237
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:30,636
- English language.

238
00:22:31,193 --> 00:22:33,654
Very simple -‘I’m sorry, I should not have
done.

239
00:22:33,855 --> 00:22:36,480
I’m sorry. I tell you I’ve done a mistake,
all right’.

240
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:40,789
But you do not say like this, that:
‘Alright, I’m sorry, forget it.’

241
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,041
That should be added, too.

242
00:22:44,622 --> 00:22:47,714
You see, when you say somebody ‘I’m sorry’
to somebody,

243
00:22:47,915 --> 00:22:51,893
he’ll say: ‘Alright, forget it’. The other
person also should say within you,

244
00:22:52,094 --> 00:22:55,204
that ‘Forget it’. If you do not do, try
that thing,

245
00:22:55,405 --> 00:22:58,617
you see, this is very nicely accumulated
here all the time,

246
00:22:58,818 --> 00:23:02,186
and this feeling guilty is a very
convenient method

247
00:23:02,387 --> 00:23:06,221
of escaping the truth, you see, showing
that you are very frightened,

248
00:23:06,422 --> 00:23:08,981
you are very upset, this and that,

249
00:23:09,182 --> 00:23:11,733
and just storing up the whole thing up here
in the left Vishuddhi.

250
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:16,058
How will you progress? You cannot progress

251
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:21,647
with this idea that you are guilty, you are
- even if you are,

252
00:23:21,848 --> 00:23:24,684
what are you going to do, what? You want
to go to jail?

253
00:23:24,885 --> 00:23:28,146
Take two running jumps and go there!

254
00:23:28,918 --> 00:23:31,173
I would say like that. Why come to Sahaj
Yog?

255
00:23:31,374 --> 00:23:34,695
Just go to hell, you can go very fast,
there’s no need.

256
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:39,671
But, if you are to be saved, accept that
you are saved,

257
00:23:39,848 --> 00:23:43,541
and do not build up these left Vishuddhi
problems.

258
00:23:43,742 --> 00:23:50,228
It’s a bit too much now. I think it’s high
time that we should burn,

259
00:23:51,635 --> 00:23:56,453
burn all these things, these guilts,

260
00:23:57,629 --> 00:24:04,313
these wrong ideas which always keeps us
down.

261
00:24:04,514 --> 00:24:08,330
It’s like putting something in the neck,
a heavy stone,

262
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:12,889
and saying. ‘I can’t cure, what to do’.
Now, the stone must be removed,

263
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,023
how can Mataji pull you out?

264
00:24:15,224 --> 00:24:21,750
See, whatever I may try, there’s a big
stone and that’s pulling you down.

265
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:26,843
It’s a very big problem, I think now,

266
00:24:27,044 --> 00:24:31,932
because Kundalini doesn’t know what to do,
and how to reach your left Vishuddhi,

267
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:35,760
to burn out that nonsensical thing which
you have stored very sweetly:

268
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:41,306
‘Ah, I’m frightened, I’m afraid,
I’m sorry’.

269
00:24:41,935 --> 00:24:46,272
In Sahaj Yoga, certain few English language
usages are not allowed –

270
00:24:46,473 --> 00:24:49,223
one of these ‘I am afraid’.

271
00:24:49,661 --> 00:24:52,744
Even a politician who is so dominating
will say ‘I’m afraid’.

272
00:24:52,945 --> 00:24:56,862
I mean, what are you afraid of? Everybody
is afraid of you.

273
00:24:57,063 --> 00:25:02,871
What is there to be afraid of? So this
usage is not allowed, ‘I’m afraid’.

274
00:25:03,072 --> 00:25:07,503
This is not allowed at all, to say ‘I’m
afraid’. What are you afraid of?

275
00:25:07,704 --> 00:25:13,025
As I said today that ‘Wages of sin is
fear’.

276
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:16,097
Alright. But wages of sin is fear,

277
00:25:16,298 --> 00:25:21,064
so, if the sin is removed, then the fear
should go or not?

278
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,104
But still, it is like this, there is light,

279
00:25:25,305 --> 00:25:28,935
still you behave as if you, you are
in the dark, still you:

280
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:35,165
‘I can’t see, I’m frightened’. Arey Baba,
there is light, see for yourself!

281
00:25:38,373 --> 00:25:41,698
This is a thing one should know, that your
Kundalini is awakened,

282
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:45,466
that your Spirit is shining. Open your
heart to this,

283
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:48,570
accept this, recognize it,

284
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:53,248
know that you are a realized soul now, and
that Kundalini has purified you.

285
00:25:53,449 --> 00:25:57,151
Now, please do not accumulate this dirt
here, on the left side,

286
00:25:57,365 --> 00:26:01,340
because you like it, because it’s very
convenient to put up faces,

287
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:04,304
to say ‘Oh, it’s alright’.

288
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:07,765
Little bit heat coming up, send it up here,
goes like that.

289
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:12,865
It will be cleaned out. Leave it alone.
Let us face it.

290
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,654
Somebody gets a little heat, ‘Oh, I’m again
bad, again I’m lost,

291
00:26:18,855 --> 00:26:22,440
God knows what have I done?’

292
00:26:25,926 --> 00:26:29,264
Correct? It happens, very commonly.

293
00:26:29,465 --> 00:26:32,804
I find suddenly people...

294
00:26:36,164 --> 00:26:39,527
without My saying anything. Just imagine!

295
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:43,256
“Good morning, good morning!”
”Good morning….”

296
00:26:44,622 --> 00:26:48,615
“What’s the matter?” “It’s very hot…”.

297
00:26:50,189 --> 00:26:54,108
Is this the way to greet your Mother?

298
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:59,094
You are the soldiers, you are the warriors.

299
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:05,680
But, what I find, hands are shaking.
Where should I put these swords?

300
00:27:09,943 --> 00:27:12,348
This is My experience now,

301
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:17,360
that this pouch of the left Vishuddhi is
a very difficult thing.

302
00:27:17,561 --> 00:27:22,158
My ears are also becoming absolutely
clogged with that vibrations,

303
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:24,657
so much flowing on the left side, all this
left Vishuddhi,

304
00:27:24,858 --> 00:27:27,592
that I can’t hear from the left side.

305
00:27:27,816 --> 00:27:32,976
So, at least have some pity on Me, and
give up that nonsense of guilt.

306
00:27:33,177 --> 00:27:37,343
Even a minute you feel guilty, just look at
outside and look at the birds chirping,

307
00:27:37,544 --> 00:27:40,433
look at the sunshine, look at the beautiful
Nature

308
00:27:40,634 --> 00:27:44,255
that has given you such a beautiful color
and all that. Look at that,

309
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:47,273
and just take the beauty within yourself
and without.

310
00:27:47,474 --> 00:27:51,421
Enjoy, and give up this miserable look.

311
00:27:51,622 --> 00:27:58,673
You should at least look like realized
people. Look, at least, if not feel.

312
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:06,494
So, this kind of seriousness has no meaning
in Sahaja Yoga.

313
00:28:06,695 --> 00:28:14,443
A Sahaj Yogi stands like this, and talks
like this, and walks like this - normally.

314
00:28:18,326 --> 00:28:25,817
So, feeling guilty is not only speciality
of English,

315
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:28,899
but I have seen it with all the Western
people have this

316
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,503
very good idea of feeling guilty, everybody
is so.

317
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:36,414
Went to France – I told you about French
people.

318
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:39,072
As soon as I went there, they warned Me
for one thing,

319
00:28:39,248 --> 00:28:43,652
that, “Mother, never say You are the happy
person, You are very happy people”.

320
00:28:43,878 --> 00:28:48,170
I said: ‘Why? Because I’m - I am a happy
person, why should I tell them lies?”.

321
00:28:48,371 --> 00:28:50,784
Said they will never believe Me, and
they’ll think You are absolutely

322
00:28:50,985 --> 00:28:54,175
ignorant of the Truth, You are ignorant
of the reality,

323
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:57,198
and that You are an uneducated person.

324
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:01,850
You have not read books on ‘shocks
for future’ and things like that.

325
00:29:04,514 --> 00:29:10,131
I said: ‘All right’. But then I really
lashed all the French on that,

326
00:29:10,307 --> 00:29:13,256
and they laughed and laughed at themselves.

327
00:29:13,457 --> 00:29:16,694
‘Les Miserables’, I said, ‘you people,
everybody is miserable because of you’.

328
00:29:16,895 --> 00:29:20,005
Any Frenchman coming anywhere, the people
don’t know where to sit,

329
00:29:20,206 --> 00:29:23,381
they don’t know this camel, which side
it is going to sit,

330
00:29:23,582 --> 00:29:27,672
on whose head it is going to sit, and
the camel is very miserable.

331
00:29:27,873 --> 00:29:31,321
And here everybody is frightened
of the camel, how he is going to behave.

332
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:34,435
Very difficult person if he’s French.

333
00:29:34,636 --> 00:29:38,793
Everywhere internationally they are known
to be difficult.

334
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:41,467
And now, here you are, what are you
miserable about?

335
00:29:41,668 --> 00:29:44,727
And English have taken certain qualities
from Americans,

336
00:29:44,928 --> 00:29:48,298
which they need not have taken, and some
from French.

337
00:29:48,499 --> 00:29:52,544
They don’t understand their quality of mind
is the best.

338
00:29:52,745 --> 00:29:54,801
They have taken from here and there,

339
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:58,377
and that’s how they are also becoming
French you see.

340
00:29:58,578 --> 00:30:02,840
Bathroom culture, that’s what it is.

341
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:05,367
And you don’t have to learn anything from
them.

342
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:09,321
It is they, they are who have to learn from
you. What have they got?

343
00:30:09,522 --> 00:30:12,331
Have they got any scholars?

344
00:30:12,818 --> 00:30:15,001
Very few.

345
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:21,533
And you, your this weakness for becoming
miserable, and guilty, and all that,

346
00:30:21,734 --> 00:30:27,294
is coming from where? I really can’t
understand, what is there to be miserable?

347
00:30:27,495 --> 00:30:30,574
If you don’t have a job, you get a dole.
Nowhere in the world people get doles.

348
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:37,986
Do you know that? Nowhere!
Nowhere people get doles.

349
00:30:38,187 --> 00:30:42,516
While you get your doles quite all right,
it will mean... you don’t starve.

350
00:30:42,858 --> 00:30:48,159
Germany, France, anywhere, you don’t get
a good dole.

351
00:30:50,172 --> 00:30:54,542
 So what is there to be miserable? At least
you people be happy people.

352
00:30:54,743 --> 00:31:00,458
At least the English should show the way.
Feel happy within yourself.

353
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:04,168
Then only you’ll be able to see the Spirit.

354
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:08,432
Don’t be miserable. There’s nothing to be
miserable.

355
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:13,463
We are special people, who have got
the blessings of our Spirit.

356
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:20,417
We should all sing, laugh, enjoy, be
[sprinkling? Indistinct] with vitality.

357
00:31:20,618 --> 00:31:22,626
There’s nothing to feel miserable.

358
00:31:22,827 --> 00:31:27,580
I mean, after some time you’ll find really
ou’ll have to act to be miserable.

359
00:31:27,781 --> 00:31:33,057
It will be difficult for you to be miserable
for more than five minutes.

360
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:37,564
I can bet on that. With Me, same problem.
I find it impossible, you see.

361
00:31:37,765 --> 00:31:41,160
 I try to be very serious: ‘I’m going to
now say something serious’ -

362
00:31:41,361 --> 00:31:45,532
suddenly I burst out laughing, because
to Me the whole thing is nothing

363
00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:48,377
but a big joke on.

364
00:31:48,678 --> 00:31:51,622
So don’t have these French ideas in your
head of becoming miserable

365
00:31:51,823 --> 00:31:57,643
for nothing at all. Be a happy people. Emit
happiness, joy to others.

366
00:31:57,844 --> 00:32:03,511
There’s nothing like ‘future shock’,
for you at least.

367
00:32:03,712 --> 00:32:11,498
There’s nothing like future problems.
Future is beautiful, just you have no idea.

368
00:32:11,699 --> 00:32:18,240
But do not lag behind with a big stone
tied to your necks.

369
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:23,319
For people who know that they have found
the Spirit,

370
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,135
they should know that they have found
the joy.

371
00:32:27,336 --> 00:32:32,347
Spirit is the source of joy, and that
should be evident when you talk.

372
00:32:32,548 --> 00:32:38,179
No inhibitions, no curbing, it’s complete
freedom.

373
00:32:38,931 --> 00:32:43,951
But do not try to mold yourself into the
molds of the people who are not realized.

374
00:32:44,152 --> 00:32:48,363
Now you are different, you are changed,
it is irreversible.

375
00:32:48,564 --> 00:32:50,998
Whatever you may try, say after two years
or three years,

376
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:55,601
all of you will be bubbling with laughter.
But why not do it now?

377
00:32:56,016 --> 00:33:00,196
If it is going to happen later, why not
have the blossom time now?

378
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:04,222
We start thinking about it, we start
worrying about it,

379
00:33:04,423 --> 00:33:07,004
there’s nothing like that.

380
00:33:07,205 --> 00:33:11,826
Our problems are solved, our lives are
beautified,

381
00:33:12,027 --> 00:33:16,078
everything is so nice and good, just
to make you happy.

382
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:20,564
Still if you are not happy, still if you
are worried,

383
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:25,154
then the Divine recedes, it recedes.

384
00:33:25,355 --> 00:33:32,684
It’s like sunshine. If you do not want 
to face the sunshine, you do not get it.

385
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:37,087
You have to face the sunshine. You just
don’t get it.

386
00:33:37,288 --> 00:33:42,722
Every tree moves to the sunshine, every
leaf tries to be towards the sunshine.

387
00:33:42,923 --> 00:33:48,592
They have innately built wisdom,
in the same way you should be,

388
00:33:48,888 --> 00:33:52,553
and you will see that with this – your life
will change completely.

389
00:33:52,754 --> 00:33:58,382
Every moment you’ll enjoy. Every minute
of life you’ll enjoy.

390
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:04,019
Everything that you do you’ll enjoy. Every
small thing you do you’ll enjoy.

391
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:12,461
People are sometimes amazed with Me, also.
Once I climbed up a place called Palitana

392
00:34:12,662 --> 00:34:17,404
which is about seven miles one has to walk,
with My son-in-law, daughter,

393
00:34:17,605 --> 00:34:20,252
and they said: ‘If You cannot go up You’d
better sit on those palanquins

394
00:34:20,522 --> 00:34:23,500
and all that’. ‘No, no’ - I said - ‘I can
walk, let’s go, I’ll walk’.

395
00:34:23,701 --> 00:34:26,582
And I was just enjoying, you know, I never
felt I was walking on a thing like that,

396
00:34:26,783 --> 00:34:29,002
because I was enjoying the Nature, I was
enjoying the people,

397
00:34:29,203 --> 00:34:32,311
how they were coming down, and how
the people were going up and all that,

398
00:34:32,512 --> 00:34:35,041
and their gaits and things, and I was just
enjoying all that.

399
00:34:35,203 --> 00:34:38,601
And when we reached there, these people
who were going with Me,

400
00:34:38,802 --> 00:34:42,191
absolutely fagged out and tired, they sat
down: ‘Haaaa’.

401
00:34:42,392 --> 00:34:45,945
And I also sat down with them, I looked up,
I said: ‘Look at these –

402
00:34:46,146 --> 00:34:50,995
so many elephants of - they made, and
everybody’s tail is differently twisted.

403
00:34:51,196 --> 00:34:54,438
How they must have thought of so many
permutations and combinations?’.

404
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,130
 My son-in-law said: ‘How could You see
the tail of an elephant

405
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:02,473
when we are so very tired here?’.

406
00:35:02,674 --> 00:35:05,526
You see, I just - spontaneously I saw
the thing,

407
00:35:05,727 --> 00:35:09,888
I said: ‘How surprising that they have
twisted the tail of the elephants’ –

408
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:13,327
 there were many elephants created, you
see, at least there must be about

409
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,991
hundred elephants in that pattern,
everybody’s tail was twisted differently.

410
00:35:17,192 --> 00:35:20,737
I said: ‘It’s so, I mean, imagine, one
hundred elephants with twisted tails

411
00:35:20,938 --> 00:35:23,821
in different ways, hundred ways. It’s
remarkable for Me’.

412
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:29,376
They said: “How could you see the tail?
We are so tired, we want some water!”.

413
00:35:30,886 --> 00:35:37,007
That’s what it is. This is inexhaustible.
This power of enjoyment is inexhaustible.

414
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:42,506
I want you all to enjoy that, to drink that
nectar of your Spirit,

415
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:46,431
and to forget about all these artificial
problems that you have.

416
00:35:46,632 --> 00:35:51,534
You just enjoy, because now you are
drenched in your Spirit. So enjoy that.

417
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:56,362
Why worry? Some people haven’t got it,
they will get it also.

418
00:35:56,563 --> 00:35:59,697
Don’t worry about anyone, they will all
get it, they will all have to get it,

419
00:35:59,898 --> 00:36:04,502
all those who are seekers will have
to come. It’s nice you have come earlier,

420
00:36:04,703 --> 00:36:10,682
it’s a nice thing, but now do not stop
your progress by

421
00:36:12,009 --> 00:36:17,333
lingering with this load around your neck.

422
00:36:17,534 --> 00:36:22,096
Let the Kundalini take you up. But she
likes light things -

423
00:36:22,297 --> 00:36:25,867
she’s a light thing herself, that’s why
she rises.

424
00:36:26,068 --> 00:36:28,219
Everything that is heavy within you she’ll
burn,

425
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,855
but do not make yourself additionally
heavy.

426
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:34,411
May God Bless you.

427
00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:49,838
 I’ll have some water please. You brought
this gentleman (a statue) here?

428
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:53,119
You brought him? [Yogi: “Yes, Mother”]
Ah ha.

429
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,506
[Yogi: “Is it the correct place in the
temple…?”] Anywhere, it’s great, you know.

430
00:36:57,707 --> 00:37:00,138
Some thieves came into our house.

431
00:37:00,339 --> 00:37:04,368
And this heavy gentleman had come from
India. He was very vibrated.

432
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:08,025
And the thieves came with some silver put
in the dining room.

433
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:12,437
They had collected all the silver, put it
on a tablecloth,

434
00:37:12,638 --> 00:37:16,043
and put the whole thing on the dining room.

435
00:37:16,244 --> 00:37:21,956
And then suddenly God knows what happened.
They just ran away, leaving that there.

436
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:26,597
And this gentleman was there,
in the passage. They just ran away.

437
00:37:26,798 --> 00:37:29,952
Can you imagine, these thieves - I mean
they are burglars,

438
00:37:30,153 --> 00:37:32,400
competent absolutely, experts -

439
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:37,818
nobody could believe it, except that we saw
some steps and our door was opened out.

440
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:40,789
Otherwise nobody could believe it.
Not here, Oxted.

441
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:44,443
But they did not take even a spoon.

442
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:49,209
God knows what happened.

443
00:37:57,081 --> 00:37:59,920
I was not there.

444
00:38:02,293 --> 00:38:06,427
Recently brought from India. You see,
poor - were very hefty people

445
00:38:06,628 --> 00:38:12,758
who brought our luggage - do, leave it
there - and they brought this one.

446
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:16,172
She said: “This is a very heavy gentleman
from India”.

447
00:38:16,373 --> 00:38:21,958
They were both hot and exhausted, but
their Kundalini had risen up.

448
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:24,816
This is Kartikeya.

449
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:32,167
Hmmm! This is the fire of Christ.

450
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:36,502
This is the one that is going to come.
Really. The fire of Christ.

451
00:38:36,703 --> 00:38:43,118
The destroying power, Rudras. This is one
of the Rudras of Christ.

452
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:52,333
Hmm, it’s quite warm, I think.

453
00:39:02,811 --> 00:39:07,780
Kundalini is working it out. She is rising.

454
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:23,198
How are you here? [Somebody says: “Fine”]
Alright? Alison? Hm.

455
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:26,410
Come, come.

456
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:30,642
I would like to see all the children
on My feet today.
