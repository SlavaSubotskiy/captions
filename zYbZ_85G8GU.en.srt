1
00:00:03,068 --> 00:00:05,988
For the last so many lectures

2
00:00:07,148 --> 00:00:09,868
we have been saying

3
00:00:10,348 --> 00:00:13,228
that you cannot pay for God’s Love.

4
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:16,108
It makes Me laugh sometimes.

5
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:23,348
Human beings can never understand Him,

6
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:27,268
because they live in a very limited sphere.

7
00:00:28,268 --> 00:00:32,148
His Love is unlimited. His forgiveness is unlimited.

8
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:35,268
Even this word “unlimited” and “infinite”

9
00:00:37,348 --> 00:00:39,348
we do not understand

10
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:42,508
because we have not known anything like that.

11
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:46,428
And to say that something is genuine

12
00:00:46,948 --> 00:00:49,468
is also like certifying something that is genuine.

13
00:00:49,948 --> 00:00:51,148
You don’t need a certificate.

14
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:53,348
Even that human beings don't understand.

15
00:00:56,388 --> 00:00:59,068
We live with artificiality,

16
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:04,188
we try to find the truth,

17
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:08,268
again we accept artificiality as truth.

18
00:01:08,828 --> 00:01:10,388
Again we go on fighting.

19
00:01:10,868 --> 00:01:13,348
Then we think this is the truth.

20
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,108
Again that turns out to be something, artificial thing

21
00:01:16,308 --> 00:01:18,868
or some sort of a mental projection.

22
00:01:20,308 --> 00:01:23,468
All these limited endeavours of human beings

23
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:30,108
and the experiences they have

24
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:33,108
made him

25
00:01:34,148 --> 00:01:35,508
so conditioned,

26
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:38,988
that it is not easy to understand God.

27
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:46,028
He made all this universe in His compassion and love.

28
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:51,108
He created you as human beings, also in His compassion and love.

29
00:01:51,308 --> 00:01:53,068
He doesn’t need anything.

30
00:01:54,068 --> 00:01:56,108
But He loves.

31
00:01:57,028 --> 00:02:00,348
And you can’t understand a person who loves beyond any these things,

32
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:07,508
without any reward,

33
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,268
just love because for love’s sake.

34
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:14,468
We can’t think of one human being like that, who can love

35
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:16,348
only for love’s sake.

36
00:02:18,988 --> 00:02:20,828
Only after realization,

37
00:02:21,028 --> 00:02:23,428
as you grow more and more, you realize

38
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:26,988
that loving is the greatest joy.

39
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:34,868
And then you cannot think of money in relation to it.

40
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:39,348
It's something, you'll say but, I think,

41
00:02:39,948 --> 00:02:41,348
even to say this,

42
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,948
"we don't need money or we don't take money" it's rather

43
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:47,148
so low level.

44
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:52,348
It's so, so much gross.

45
00:02:54,948 --> 00:02:59,348
Because money and all these concepts are so low.

46
00:03:02,268 --> 00:03:06,148
He didn't make this world to get any fruits out of it.

47
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,828
Nothing.

48
00:03:09,228 --> 00:03:11,348
He just made it because He loved.

49
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:13,028
He wanted to express His Love.

50
00:03:13,228 --> 00:03:15,348
Just to manifest that Love, He made this world.

51
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:18,868
There’s nothing else expected

52
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:21,108
and to put the human mind at that level

53
00:03:21,308 --> 00:03:23,348
is an impossibility, I find, in the beginning.

54
00:03:24,148 --> 00:03:26,108
But gradually they start understanding

55
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:28,348
how forgiving He is,

56
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:31,348
how kind He is, how nice He is.

57
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:35,308
So the first problem I have to face in the West always

58
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:39,148
even in Paris this was the problem that I faced

59
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:43,308
was that human beings feel guilty.

60
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:48,948
And this guilt is such a big problem in the West,

61
00:03:49,148 --> 00:03:50,948
I just don't understand.

62
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:52,948
You see, why do you feel guilty so much,

63
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:56,068
as that is one of the hurdles of Sahaja Yoga, I've seen,

64
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:58,148
that people start feeling guilty.

65
00:03:58,348 --> 00:03:59,908
To such an extent

66
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:03,188
that they don't believe that they can get realization.

67
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,948
They think they are sinners born, outright,

68
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:10,348
permanently, branded as sinners,

69
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:13,828
and they can never take their realization.

70
00:04:14,028 --> 00:04:15,988
I mean, just a brand.

71
00:04:16,268 --> 00:04:17,908
It's beyond self pity also,

72
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:20,908
I would say it's even self-destructive.

73
00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:25,868
Today I've taken up this subject of left Vishuddhi,

74
00:04:26,068 --> 00:04:30,108
because I felt that I must one day speak on this subject,

75
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:33,028
that this is absolutely,

76
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:37,908
not inteligible to God that you are

77
00:04:38,108 --> 00:04:40,148
guilty. For what?

78
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:45,148
Guilty for what are you?

79
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:48,148
If you ask yourself, you'll say, "Oh, we are guilty,

80
00:04:48,348 --> 00:04:50,948
because we've crucified Christ" at the most.

81
00:04:51,148 --> 00:04:54,868
That is the maximum guilt a human being, let's say, on his head.

82
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:58,068
"We crucified Christ, we tortured all the

83
00:04:58,268 --> 00:05:00,308
saints". All right.

84
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:06,268
But by being guilty what do you get?

85
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:11,148
Do you get Him back, can you go back and correct that situation?

86
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:12,868
You cannot.

87
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:17,348
But harping upon that you do get into your subconscious mind.

88
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:22,948
You get into a position where you are no more normal to see

89
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:24,988
the Love of God.

90
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:29,028
You recede into a corner of your mind,

91
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,948
which is darkness,

92
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:33,348
which is ignorant, which is blindness,

93
00:05:34,188 --> 00:05:37,348
where you cannot receive that beautiful reign,

94
00:05:38,268 --> 00:05:40,268
that eternal

95
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:42,348
flow,

96
00:05:42,948 --> 00:05:44,348
that's coming in.

97
00:05:45,188 --> 00:05:47,828
You hide yourself, at the back,

98
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:49,788
and then you say,

99
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:51,348
"What about the sun?

100
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:54,988
I cannot receive it because I don't deserve it."

101
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:01,348
Behind all this ego orientation in the West....

102
00:06:01,948 --> 00:06:05,988
Oh, I think, I wish they were purely egoistical. They are not.

103
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:09,868
All this ego recedes back,

104
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:13,388
into that little pouch, what we call the guilt.

105
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:17,188
You say something to someone.

106
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:20,388
It's not to say that point, that stage,

107
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:22,108
that "I've said it. All right, I've said it.

108
00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:25,308
I can take the responsability, it is good." Not.

109
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:29,348
But you come back coward, "Oh, I should not have said that".

110
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:33,268
So you wobble between one

111
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:36,148
kind of action into another kind,

112
00:06:36,868 --> 00:06:39,468
from say, into an aggressive

113
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:42,348
to another one, for this is the time.

114
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:45,348
And this wobbling really,

115
00:06:46,028 --> 00:06:48,108
is very, very troublesome.

116
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,188
It can go on too much.

117
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:52,868
The oscilation could be so much.

118
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:56,068
that it can make you absolutely frantic,

119
00:06:56,268 --> 00:07:00,348
diffident, and sometimes, useless.

120
00:07:04,948 --> 00:07:06,868
On the contrary,

121
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:09,268
God wants to find human beings,

122
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:11,108
who are cheerful people,

123
00:07:11,308 --> 00:07:13,068
who are happy people,

124
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:15,868
who are thankful to Him for His blessings.

125
00:07:18,268 --> 00:07:21,428
The most unhappy animal in this world,

126
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,108
is the human being, can you believe it?

127
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:29,188
Animals, don't know happiness and unhappiness, also a good point is.

128
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:33,268
But the most unhappy human being,

129
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:36,068
and the most complicated human being,

130
00:07:36,948 --> 00:07:39,428
he has become so over you see, self-destructive,

131
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:42,308
that the destruction force is built within himself.

132
00:07:45,028 --> 00:07:46,148
Now think,

133
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:49,828
of that force that has built you up into a human

134
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:53,068
how with care and love,

135
00:07:53,268 --> 00:07:56,068
without your knowledge, without troubling.

136
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:59,108
Even when you were born you never knew what was the pain,

137
00:07:59,308 --> 00:08:01,348
of the birth. Your mother [took over it].

138
00:08:02,268 --> 00:08:04,188
He's made you a human being.

139
00:08:04,988 --> 00:08:08,188
So carefully, delicately He built you up.

140
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:12,348
For what?

141
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:15,268
What is the fruit of this beautiful flower?

142
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:20,148
Why the flowers start hitting itself?

143
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:22,268
Have you ever heard of anyone like that?

144
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:27,828
This is the worst disease, which

145
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:31,428
we in the West suffer.

146
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:35,068
French there's,

147
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,228
we had at least double the number of people

148
00:08:37,428 --> 00:08:39,268
that we have here today, surprisingly.

149
00:08:39,468 --> 00:08:41,988
But, also they have the same problem,

150
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,308
and I think all their psychologists,

151
00:08:46,508 --> 00:08:48,508
psychoanalists,

152
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:52,428
or we can say the, all the books,

153
00:08:52,868 --> 00:08:55,028
all the writers, their philosophers,

154
00:08:55,228 --> 00:08:58,308
everyone has [unclear] to them.

155
00:08:59,988 --> 00:09:02,348
They have given these ideas,

156
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:05,148
and everybody accepts them.

157
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:09,108
And they curse themselves morning till evening,

158
00:09:09,988 --> 00:09:12,868
walking with so many wrinkles on the forehead.

159
00:09:13,468 --> 00:09:15,148
When you ask them, they will say,

160
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:17,908
"Mother we are very unhappy people".

161
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:20,268
It's like asking unhappiness

162
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:23,148
to come and decorate you.

163
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:30,908
But it has a subtler meaning,

164
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:33,268
of which people are not aware.

165
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,348
These are the times,

166
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:41,108
when you have to get your realization.

167
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,828
This mass realization has to work out.

168
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:45,868
It's all prophesized,

169
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:48,228
and very modern times are these.

170
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:52,188
All the stars are acting to help us.

171
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:55,188
The whole universe is helping us.

172
00:09:56,348 --> 00:09:58,468
All the elements are helping us.

173
00:09:58,988 --> 00:10:00,988
We are on the stage.

174
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:05,348
But when the actors arrive on the stage,

175
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:07,948
they are finished, they can't act.

176
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:10,948
They can't do anything, they can't play their game.

177
00:10:11,268 --> 00:10:14,988
They are so involved in their different roles.

178
00:10:18,228 --> 00:10:21,268
And that is why one has to understand the subtler of the topic,

179
00:10:21,468 --> 00:10:23,828
then only you will get rid of this guilt.

180
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:27,228
You are playing into the hands of negative forces.

181
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:30,428
They are

182
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:34,868
not less than any atomic bombs,

183
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,908
built within yourselves.

184
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:39,468
Now what is the main thing works out,

185
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:41,788
I think people do not realize.

186
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:44,108
It's a very subtle method.

187
00:10:44,348 --> 00:10:45,948
Let's see the atomic bomb,

188
00:10:46,148 --> 00:10:49,228
hidrogen bomb, what do we do then?

189
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:54,348
They will separate something which should not be separated.

190
00:10:57,148 --> 00:10:58,868
We break

191
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:01,868
atom, which is not divisible,

192
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:04,028
into its divisible parts.

193
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:08,108
So we put a pressure

194
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:11,268
to break them.

195
00:11:11,468 --> 00:11:13,948
And when that breaking force,

196
00:11:14,148 --> 00:11:15,988
that's aggression I would say,

197
00:11:16,188 --> 00:11:18,188
is worked out,

198
00:11:19,508 --> 00:11:23,108
that becomes another destructive force.

199
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:28,028
So whatever effort we have put into that,

200
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:31,468
multiplies, it's not the same force.

201
00:11:33,348 --> 00:11:36,268
And that's we use for our destruction.

202
00:11:36,468 --> 00:11:38,228
I mean it's only human beings can do,

203
00:11:38,428 --> 00:11:40,348
to create things to destroy others.

204
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:46,148
But this force, which works within our minds,

205
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:48,228
within ourselves, within our being,

206
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:52,188
where we actually really hate ourselves sometimes I feel,

207
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:54,868
the way we are destroying ourselves,

208
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:57,468
this force

209
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:00,428
we build within ourselves thanks to  many

210
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:03,108
nonsensical writers, their conditionings,

211
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:06,828
and people with wrong conditionings, create conditioning much worse.

212
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:10,428
We should be singing and chanting like a bird.

213
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:14,228
We should be loving and enjoying like a flower.

214
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:17,108
But I find human beings,

215
00:12:17,308 --> 00:12:20,228
all, looking so very unhappy.

216
00:12:21,348 --> 00:12:23,228
What's the reason?

217
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:27,948
The reason is you are separated from your own being,

218
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:34,148
the being that integrates you. You are completely desintegrated.

219
00:12:35,148 --> 00:12:37,264
When you desintegrate the

220
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:39,268
hidrogen

221
00:12:40,148 --> 00:12:41,348
atom,

222
00:12:42,148 --> 00:12:45,108
you form a very big force built into it.

223
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:48,148
In the same way you are the seed

224
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:50,868
integrated in your being.

225
00:12:51,388 --> 00:12:55,148
Your physical being on one side, your mental being on another side

226
00:12:55,348 --> 00:12:58,988
your spiritual being on another side, there's no integrity point to.

227
00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:03,068
And when you cannot

228
00:13:03,268 --> 00:13:05,228
feel that integration,

229
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,188
you feel guilty,

230
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:10,068
but that guilt is just a symptom of

231
00:13:10,268 --> 00:13:13,308
a very big destructive force built in you.

232
00:13:16,348 --> 00:13:21,188
This, is the way we are going to destroy ourselves.

233
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:24,948
Nor do we,

234
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:27,828
our destruction is not going to come to us from outside.

235
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:29,908
That can be controlled.

236
00:13:30,868 --> 00:13:32,948
It's going to come from within,

237
00:13:33,148 --> 00:13:35,348
within ourselves.

238
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:40,348
Everything we do now, after desintegration,

239
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:42,988
it's further desintegration,

240
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:47,868
or further buiding up that negative force within ourselves.

241
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:54,468
But integrated,

242
00:13:56,308 --> 00:14:00,348
to make you feel complete integration with all your being,

243
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,068
it's only possible

244
00:14:04,828 --> 00:14:06,508
if you can somehow other

245
00:14:06,948 --> 00:14:08,868
get to that integrating force

246
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:12,308
which is still there and it's quite deep.

247
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:22,228
That's the last chance I would say now, that has to work.

248
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:25,428
The way the negative forces have set in motion

249
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:29,148
of which you may not be aware at all, you may not be aware,

250
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:31,348
you don't know what darkness is there.

251
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:38,908
And to fight it, what one has to do

252
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:43,108
is to bring that light of the spirit,

253
00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:46,188
which integrates.

254
00:14:46,388 --> 00:14:48,348
The darkness always desintegrates.

255
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:51,228
For example there's complete darkness, all right?

256
00:14:51,428 --> 00:14:54,428
I can't feel you, I don't know who you are, where you are sitting.

257
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:56,268
We are all separate.

258
00:14:56,468 --> 00:14:59,388
I can't see you, I don't know who you people are there.

259
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:02,868
I wouldn't know where is the window, where is the door.

260
00:15:03,428 --> 00:15:06,068
I hold this and say: "This is the truth".

261
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:09,348
All desintegrated personalities,

262
00:15:10,228 --> 00:15:11,468
and desintegrated people,

263
00:15:11,908 --> 00:15:14,268
always see aberrations. They see different things,

264
00:15:14,468 --> 00:15:16,348
different auras, different things.

265
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:21,468
Now, this is a very vicious circle.

266
00:15:22,348 --> 00:15:23,868
You should think of it.

267
00:15:24,148 --> 00:15:27,348
There's a very great vicious circle we have.

268
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:31,508
The vicious circle is

269
00:15:32,908 --> 00:15:33,988
that

270
00:15:35,508 --> 00:15:38,188
we try to think about it,

271
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:40,148
which is limited.

272
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:43,388
Supposing I have a limited vision, there's darkness

273
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:45,428
what will I feel?

274
00:15:47,908 --> 00:15:50,388
You start thinking about it and thinking about it,

275
00:15:50,828 --> 00:15:52,268
pondering over you.

276
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:55,108
The more you think about it the worse it becomes.

277
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:04,468
Another way, could be people who may try to solve this problem,

278
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:07,388
who think that we are desintegrated,

279
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:11,388
is to talk of big things "we are all brothers and sisters",

280
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:14,948
"Let's form U.N. counseling",

281
00:16:15,428 --> 00:16:18,508
"Let's do world organization".

282
00:16:19,348 --> 00:16:22,788
All blind people doing world organization will end up

283
00:16:22,988 --> 00:16:25,868
at the most at the labour,

284
00:16:26,908 --> 00:16:29,268
what you call, labour department.

285
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:31,948
That's all.

286
00:16:33,388 --> 00:16:35,428
With all these

287
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:39,428
institutions working in the big name,

288
00:16:41,428 --> 00:16:43,068
where are we?

289
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:45,508
Actually when we become

290
00:16:47,268 --> 00:16:49,348
aware, we don't need them.

291
00:16:50,508 --> 00:16:52,508
We don't need at all.

292
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:57,908
So this awareness is nothing but

293
00:16:58,108 --> 00:17:00,988
it is the light of the spirit within you which is missing.

294
00:17:02,908 --> 00:17:05,068
The spirit is watching you, all right.

295
00:17:05,268 --> 00:17:06,908
It goes up to a point

296
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:09,868
to see your stupidity and your limitedness.

297
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:16,908
And it goes up to a very great extent I should say,

298
00:17:17,348 --> 00:17:18,508
It's finished.

299
00:17:19,028 --> 00:17:22,148
It disappears when a person dies,

300
00:17:22,428 --> 00:17:25,188
or he gets into trouble, he becomes creazy, mad,

301
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:26,828
whatever you may call him.

302
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:30,388
He develops other diseases like cancer,

303
00:17:33,028 --> 00:17:36,908
which are caused by another problem here, as you know, Ekadesha.

304
00:17:39,508 --> 00:17:42,508
So these forces are built within us,

305
00:17:45,268 --> 00:17:47,268
of the negativity,

306
00:17:47,508 --> 00:17:51,188
when we go to the extremes of negativity.

307
00:17:53,388 --> 00:17:55,508
So in the Kundalini Shastra,

308
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:58,228
we can say that the left and right side

309
00:17:59,348 --> 00:18:01,348
when used too much,

310
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,188
you build up these forces in the head of eleven Rudras,

311
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:07,388
the eleven distructive forces.

312
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:12,068
A cancer patient develops it.

313
00:18:12,268 --> 00:18:15,148
But even before developing cancer people can develop it.

314
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,988
And there are so many things,

315
00:18:19,188 --> 00:18:21,148
that can create this,

316
00:18:23,348 --> 00:18:27,028
that sometimes one could feel, in this vicious circle that

317
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:30,388
that how are you going to [unclear] the whole society.

318
00:18:31,868 --> 00:18:34,188
And there's only one thing,

319
00:18:35,988 --> 00:18:39,268
that will save the situation, is Self-realization.

320
00:18:42,228 --> 00:18:45,348
All other things are destroying,

321
00:18:49,268 --> 00:18:51,148
are absolutely confusing.

322
00:18:51,868 --> 00:18:54,348
But there's only one thing if you can do,

323
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:58,348
that saves the whole, like putting on the light, finished.

324
00:19:01,868 --> 00:19:04,868
But people don't understand the importance,

325
00:19:05,428 --> 00:19:08,308
of Self-realization, because some people ask Me

326
00:19:08,508 --> 00:19:11,028
"What's the use of getting the cool breeze in the hand?"

327
00:19:12,428 --> 00:19:15,428
Now, see the big canvas of the whole thing, the whole cosmos,

328
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,308
whereas you are a party.

329
00:19:17,508 --> 00:19:20,148
See what's happening to human beings today,

330
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,148
and if they are to be saved,

331
00:19:25,228 --> 00:19:27,108
no use being unhappy.

332
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:29,388
Like in France they said, "You cannot,

333
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:32,028
Mother, say, you are very happy person".

334
00:19:32,228 --> 00:19:33,268
I said, "Why?"

335
00:19:33,468 --> 00:19:35,868
Because that means you are ignorant,

336
00:19:38,348 --> 00:19:40,348
of the shocks."

337
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:43,828
See, I have to say, I am here,

338
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:46,108
I have to paint some lines here to show you,

339
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:48,788
that I'm very deeply concerned,

340
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,908
worried about the world.

341
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:55,348
But what is the solution have you got?

342
00:19:56,348 --> 00:19:58,908
You want Me to be like you only?

343
00:19:59,268 --> 00:20:00,428
Is that the solution?

344
00:20:00,948 --> 00:20:03,988
That if ten people are weeping you also join them weeping?

345
00:20:04,188 --> 00:20:05,868
Is that the solution?

346
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:10,468
And the...

347
00:20:11,268 --> 00:20:14,468
one and only method that we have

348
00:20:16,428 --> 00:20:19,468
which has been already told, prescribed, and

349
00:20:19,948 --> 00:20:22,348
has been prophesized,

350
00:20:24,428 --> 00:20:26,068
nobody seeks it.

351
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:28,228
No one seeks the truth.

352
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,948
See now, in the Bible, you have to be born again,

353
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,988
Christ to be born in your heart.

354
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:35,508
I mean they do it even before solving the whole drama

355
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:38,068
they do it by giving you the second birth,

356
00:20:38,268 --> 00:20:40,868
by Christening so called.

357
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,988
Hindus they believe without yoga is there's no sense.

358
00:20:45,188 --> 00:20:47,908
"Yoga kshema vahamyam". Krishna said. "All the time that you seek

359
00:20:48,108 --> 00:20:49,188
yoga, what are you seeking?"

360
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:51,388
All these treatise and all these big books

361
00:20:51,828 --> 00:20:54,428
and all the scriptures are aiming at what?

362
00:20:55,148 --> 00:20:57,948
Even, those who talk you must live with Dharma [?]

363
00:20:58,148 --> 00:20:59,908
give you bad ideas. For what?

364
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:01,308
Why do you do it?

365
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:03,868
What is the destination?

366
00:21:04,188 --> 00:21:06,348
And the destination is the spirit.

367
00:21:08,108 --> 00:21:10,148
And today

368
00:21:10,868 --> 00:21:14,828
the background is so black, is so dark,

369
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,148
that this solution is

370
00:21:17,348 --> 00:21:20,068
the end of everything.

371
00:21:22,268 --> 00:21:24,228
But do we realize it?

372
00:21:26,348 --> 00:21:29,308
On the contrary the vicious circle builts in, within us

373
00:21:29,508 --> 00:21:31,028
all the time.

374
00:21:31,348 --> 00:21:34,348
"Oh, see how the world is miserable.

375
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:37,268
Then how can I be happy?

376
00:21:40,308 --> 00:21:42,108
I'm so unhappy in life."

377
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:44,428
I'm yet to come across a person before realization

378
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:46,268
saying that, "I am a happy person".

379
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:50,148
Maybe is ego-oriented.

380
00:21:50,348 --> 00:21:52,428
People might say, "I'm happy, meaning my ego is

381
00:21:52,868 --> 00:21:54,308
you see, if he goes in a certain car,

382
00:21:54,508 --> 00:21:57,988
or something like that, he's very happy, on top of the world.

383
00:21:59,148 --> 00:22:01,308
After ten minutes, you see him...

384
00:22:04,308 --> 00:22:06,868
and this vicious circle is set in.

385
00:22:07,068 --> 00:22:10,348
This ego-oriented circle, or another one, it sets in.

386
00:22:11,028 --> 00:22:13,788
Another vicious circle and another vicious circle

387
00:22:13,988 --> 00:22:16,308
and another vicious circle, we go on

388
00:22:16,508 --> 00:22:18,028
from one to another,

389
00:22:18,348 --> 00:22:20,988
moving on the wheels after wheels

390
00:22:23,028 --> 00:22:26,028
without realizing that where we are going.

391
00:22:32,068 --> 00:22:34,268
And this vicious circle has to be broken

392
00:22:35,468 --> 00:22:37,228
by one faith,

393
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:39,388
by one understanding,

394
00:22:41,948 --> 00:22:44,388
that God is forgiveness.

395
00:22:45,308 --> 00:22:47,308
God is Love.

396
00:22:50,348 --> 00:22:52,268
When we feel love for anyone,

397
00:22:52,468 --> 00:22:54,388
without any lust and greed,

398
00:22:54,868 --> 00:22:56,948
then that is God’s Love within us.

399
00:23:00,188 --> 00:23:03,028
That He is the embodiment

400
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,948
of that pure Love,

401
00:23:07,348 --> 00:23:09,228
which just loves,

402
00:23:11,148 --> 00:23:13,148
which has given you this beautiful human life

403
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:15,948
and wants to make you more beautiful.

404
00:23:18,868 --> 00:23:21,308
He created all this creation for you

405
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:25,188
and that He wants to enjoy the bounteousness of this creation.

406
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,828
He wants you to enjoy the citizen of His Realm

407
00:23:30,028 --> 00:23:32,828
and the Kingdom of His Grace.

408
00:23:37,268 --> 00:23:39,508
Do we go to see someone

409
00:23:39,948 --> 00:23:43,348
who is highly placed, with a morose face? Do we?

410
00:23:44,148 --> 00:23:46,308
That day we'll specially brush up the hair,

411
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,908
see, make our hair into a beautiful thing,

412
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:50,508
make our face nice,

413
00:23:50,948 --> 00:23:53,348
dress up well. It looks that we are well, you see.

414
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:57,348
That’s outside.

415
00:23:59,308 --> 00:24:02,988
Inside, if you just feel how kind He is,

416
00:24:06,188 --> 00:24:07,868
how He has

417
00:24:08,348 --> 00:24:09,948
worked out meticulously

418
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:13,148
in this blissful life of a human being.

419
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:16,908
But think how much He has done for you.

420
00:24:18,028 --> 00:24:20,148
Instead of that, if you are all good type to say,

421
00:24:20,348 --> 00:24:22,468
“I am very unhappy in life.”

422
00:24:22,908 --> 00:24:25,108
I mean, think of the One who does everything for you

423
00:24:25,308 --> 00:24:26,828
and you can just come back saying,

424
00:24:27,028 --> 00:24:29,108
“Oh, I am a very unhappy person.”

425
00:24:29,308 --> 00:24:30,868
What is He going to feel about it?

426
00:24:31,068 --> 00:24:32,868
No gratitude.

427
00:24:33,228 --> 00:24:35,348
Count your blessings one by one.

428
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,348
That’s what one has to do,

429
00:24:38,948 --> 00:24:40,028
is to have

430
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:43,348
complete understanding that He is

431
00:24:43,988 --> 00:24:45,308
God Almighty.

432
00:24:45,508 --> 00:24:47,868
He can do anything that He likes.

433
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:51,828
and we are

434
00:24:52,108 --> 00:24:54,348
the recipient of His Allmighty.

435
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:59,228
He is the Ocean of Love,

436
00:24:59,428 --> 00:25:03,348
and we are the recipient of His Love.

437
00:25:06,268 --> 00:25:08,268
Let us feel that, within ourselves,

438
00:25:08,468 --> 00:25:11,868
and understand logically with wisdom.

439
00:25:13,348 --> 00:25:16,028
If this sets into your mind,

440
00:25:16,228 --> 00:25:19,228
that’s the best conditioning I think human beings can have,

441
00:25:20,828 --> 00:25:22,828
what you call in Sanskrit as  "Susamskara",

442
00:25:23,028 --> 00:25:25,948
means the auspicious conditionings.

443
00:25:26,148 --> 00:25:29,308
You see, we don't have only conditioning and ego.

444
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:32,908
We have third thing called also good conditioning.

445
00:25:34,988 --> 00:25:39,348
The conditionings that are ruining your chances of enjoyment,

446
00:25:39,908 --> 00:25:42,308
let it be brought round.

447
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:47,148
And see for yourself, logically you can see

448
00:25:47,348 --> 00:25:49,908
how much is done for.

449
00:25:54,308 --> 00:25:57,948
I mean none of the animals were that comfortable and [enjoying].

450
00:25:58,148 --> 00:26:00,148
They don't know the idea of comfort. I mean they have never had car,

451
00:26:00,348 --> 00:26:02,348
even chairs to sit.

452
00:26:07,268 --> 00:26:10,148
It's easy to say, "nice to be like animals".

453
00:26:10,348 --> 00:26:12,788
See, but just go and see the way they live poor things, you know.

454
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:17,068
Even the king of the forest, how he lives, one should go and see.

455
00:26:18,388 --> 00:26:19,868
But he's happy.

456
00:26:20,468 --> 00:26:22,188
He's full of joy.

457
00:26:23,108 --> 00:26:25,108
How has to kill an animal, he'll kill it,

458
00:26:25,308 --> 00:26:26,988
if it is dignity eat

459
00:26:27,188 --> 00:26:28,988
one or two days, finish. Then,

460
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:31,148
he lives for ten days without food.

461
00:26:31,348 --> 00:26:34,508
Whenever he feels hungry he goes, he's not bothered.

462
00:26:35,228 --> 00:26:36,788
He doesn't feel guilty for killing anybody,

463
00:26:36,988 --> 00:26:39,268
he is hungry, has to eat, he eats, finished.

464
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:44,468
But human beings as they are,

465
00:26:44,908 --> 00:26:47,308
they will eat someone without the need,

466
00:26:47,508 --> 00:26:49,268
and they'll feel guilty.

467
00:26:50,468 --> 00:26:52,068
This is the problem.

468
00:26:56,508 --> 00:26:59,868
He has made you in His own image.

469
00:27:00,068 --> 00:27:02,148
He's done everything beautifully.

470
00:27:03,868 --> 00:27:06,908
After realization you start understanding yourself

471
00:27:07,108 --> 00:27:09,108
and enjoying yourself as you enjoy others.

472
00:27:09,988 --> 00:27:12,108
The fragrance of others you start enjoying.

473
00:27:15,188 --> 00:27:18,428
Self-realization is the only way,

474
00:27:18,908 --> 00:27:21,148
you can get the light in.

475
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:25,468
Enlightenment. Everybody talks of enlightenment, enlightenment.

476
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:29,468
Enlightened means, means for some people is that you start jumping.

477
00:27:30,508 --> 00:27:33,028
Is it enlightenement to be abnormal like that?

478
00:27:33,228 --> 00:27:34,148
Or take out your clothes?

479
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:36,948
I mean, just think of it, I mean how does it go into your brains,

480
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:40,108
I can't understand, that doing all these nonsensical things,

481
00:27:40,308 --> 00:27:42,388
how can there be enlightenment?

482
00:27:44,028 --> 00:27:46,108
Or taking to alcohol, drinking or

483
00:27:46,308 --> 00:27:49,068
drugs or anything. How can that give you enlightenment?

484
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:51,268
Has it given to anyone so far?

485
00:27:53,148 --> 00:27:55,988
It might be some sort of a funny strnge experience  you might get,

486
00:27:56,188 --> 00:27:57,428
but not enlightenment.

487
00:27:57,908 --> 00:28:00,068
In enlightenment you get integrated,

488
00:28:00,268 --> 00:28:02,788
you see your way through, you know where you are standing

489
00:28:02,988 --> 00:28:06,028
and how you are moving in relationship to others.

490
00:28:08,948 --> 00:28:11,908
So the illogical method,

491
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:15,828
I would say, unwise method, the way we deal with life,

492
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:27,028
becomes a kind, of a, possession.

493
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:33,988
and we are possessed by this negative force which is eating us up.

494
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:37,388
And we want to live in with that idea,

495
00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:39,268
enjoing that idea,

496
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,108
that we are miserable people

497
00:28:41,308 --> 00:28:42,828
we are unhappy,

498
00:28:43,028 --> 00:28:45,828
we are helpless. I mean I've seen people sitting on the streets,

499
00:28:46,028 --> 00:28:48,268
and discussing, "Oh, thank God, there's going to be

500
00:28:48,468 --> 00:28:52,308
eight stars coming in, we'll be all destroyed". I mean just imagine.

501
00:28:56,228 --> 00:28:59,228
But we have to think about the One who has created us.

502
00:28:59,428 --> 00:29:03,388
Is He waiting for your destruction, will He be happy with that?

503
00:29:05,868 --> 00:29:08,148
How much are you cooperating with Him?

504
00:29:09,988 --> 00:29:11,348
With what?

505
00:29:12,348 --> 00:29:15,948
Care, love He has created us with what hopes for the livings?

506
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:17,988
What does He want to do for us?

507
00:29:18,268 --> 00:29:20,348
That you are sitting down and feeling guilty.

508
00:29:20,868 --> 00:29:23,068
And now, I have to tell openly,

509
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:26,188
that it has come to you also through other vechicles,

510
00:29:28,188 --> 00:29:31,988
apart from the psychologists, psychoanalysts.

511
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:35,308
Psychoanalysts, the other day we had a girl,

512
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:36,948
she came to see Me.

513
00:29:37,148 --> 00:29:40,148
She's French, her English was wonderful,

514
00:29:40,428 --> 00:29:41,828
and she said,

515
00:29:42,028 --> 00:29:45,068
"Horrible psychologists, they make me mad."

516
00:29:45,268 --> 00:29:48,108
"Why?" She said, "I have bad relationship with my mother,

517
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:49,948
I have bad relationship with my father,

518
00:29:50,148 --> 00:29:52,028
bad relationship with every third person.

519
00:29:52,228 --> 00:29:54,308
I don't have that, absolutely pure relationship.

520
00:29:54,508 --> 00:29:56,308
They try to put that idea into my head

521
00:29:56,508 --> 00:29:58,908
that there's something abnormal, pathological about me

522
00:29:59,108 --> 00:30:00,268
which I am not.

523
00:30:01,308 --> 00:30:03,948
And they are making my brother's relationship also

524
00:30:04,148 --> 00:30:07,148
funny by telling him that I have bad relations with him.

525
00:30:09,188 --> 00:30:10,348
This is it.

526
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:13,268
So hit at the point to pure love.

527
00:30:13,468 --> 00:30:15,188
Desintegrate,

528
00:30:15,388 --> 00:30:18,148
You can't have good relationship with your own mother,

529
00:30:18,348 --> 00:30:21,908
with your own father, with your own sister, with your brother,

530
00:30:22,108 --> 00:30:25,068
and nobody, because you cannot love except for, you are sex points.

531
00:30:25,268 --> 00:30:26,508
You have just relationship of sex.

532
00:30:26,948 --> 00:30:29,148
Even animals have better relationship then we have,

533
00:30:29,348 --> 00:30:31,428
if you have to accept the psychologists.

534
00:30:32,908 --> 00:30:33,868
And they take money

535
00:30:34,068 --> 00:30:36,948
to suggest all these nonsensical ideas into your head.

536
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:40,188
There are some here sitting. I will face them later on.

537
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:45,788
This is how they put in ideas into your heads

538
00:30:45,988 --> 00:30:48,948
that you are a person who has no,

539
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:50,348
no purity,

540
00:30:50,988 --> 00:30:52,388
and that you are a sinner,

541
00:30:52,828 --> 00:30:56,148
you are a damned person and any person you look upon,

542
00:30:56,348 --> 00:30:59,148
you have only sex relationships, no feelings.

543
00:30:59,348 --> 00:31:01,348
I mean are you sex points?

544
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:05,148
With all this evolution God has made us into

545
00:31:05,348 --> 00:31:08,148
a sex point that's what we have done to ourselves.

546
00:31:08,348 --> 00:31:10,868
Reduced ourselves to that point only.

547
00:31:14,348 --> 00:31:18,228
He has created you in your own glory and in your own dignity.

548
00:31:20,988 --> 00:31:22,228
He's not created you

549
00:31:22,428 --> 00:31:25,868
to be only wasted like this

550
00:31:26,108 --> 00:31:29,828
Then the second thing that desintegrates us very much more,

551
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:32,108
is the idea,

552
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:35,348
that we are here, you see,

553
00:31:36,268 --> 00:31:38,188
to live in a gross way,

554
00:31:38,988 --> 00:31:40,828
somehow fighting,

555
00:31:41,188 --> 00:31:43,348
political, economic,

556
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:45,508
all these nonsensical,

557
00:31:46,348 --> 00:31:49,348
progress that we are making.

558
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:52,108
And everything is explained,

559
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:54,948
all destructive forces are explained in the name

560
00:31:55,148 --> 00:31:58,148
of political or economic growth.

561
00:31:58,868 --> 00:32:01,988
I don't know if it is growth or whatever it is,

562
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:06,068
but definetely it is not love, take it from Me.

563
00:32:06,268 --> 00:32:08,268
It is not love.

564
00:32:09,508 --> 00:32:12,348
That's why economics of God is to be understood.

565
00:32:15,148 --> 00:32:16,988
Politics of God is to be understood.

566
00:32:17,948 --> 00:32:21,828
And for human beings to understand they must have Self-realization.

567
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:24,508
Innate economics,

568
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:28,068
generosity is the key note.

569
00:32:30,308 --> 00:32:33,068
He enjoys His generosity.

570
00:32:35,228 --> 00:32:39,268
Material things are to express your generosity, isn't it?

571
00:32:42,148 --> 00:32:44,028
What are they for?

572
00:32:44,348 --> 00:32:48,148
The most enjoyable thing is to give,

573
00:32:48,348 --> 00:32:50,348
and when you give,

574
00:32:51,148 --> 00:32:53,148
you will think your economic

575
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:56,028
problems will be solved completely.

576
00:32:56,348 --> 00:32:59,068
Because you are here to live, not to take,- no problems.

577
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,948
The problems are because you want to grab.

578
00:33:05,348 --> 00:33:07,828
And once you start giving you get it,

579
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,508
as much as you want, because

580
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:11,348
if there's no outlet,

581
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:16,268
there's no joy, there's no happiness, there's no release.

582
00:33:16,468 --> 00:33:19,188
from the material domination on you.

583
00:33:20,388 --> 00:33:22,468
But giving is the way

584
00:33:22,908 --> 00:33:26,468
you can get rid of that material domination on your head.

585
00:33:27,188 --> 00:33:28,348
That you give away.

586
00:33:30,868 --> 00:33:32,148
Give away everything that you have

587
00:33:32,348 --> 00:33:35,228
and you'll be surprised how it works.

588
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:40,988
Now, when I say, it is fantastic the way it acts.

589
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,108
Fantastic, the way it acts.

590
00:33:43,308 --> 00:33:45,828
The way, I mean it's easy to sort of say that,

591
00:33:46,028 --> 00:33:47,868
"It's Mother saying something,

592
00:33:48,348 --> 00:33:50,148
which is,

593
00:33:51,348 --> 00:33:53,268
something miraculous."

594
00:33:53,468 --> 00:33:57,828
But what do you think of Moses crossing the river, crossing the sea?

595
00:33:58,028 --> 00:33:59,828
You mean, it was miraculous,

596
00:34:00,028 --> 00:34:03,828
or it was a false stoy or what do you think of it?

597
00:34:06,028 --> 00:34:08,388
It was absolutely true,

598
00:34:08,868 --> 00:34:10,308
that he did cross

599
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:13,348
the sea with the help of God, he could do it.

600
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:18,188
What about Christ walking on the water?

601
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:20,948
He did because by His nature He did it.

602
00:34:22,028 --> 00:34:25,068
What about all the miracles that were done by this Incarnation?

603
00:34:25,268 --> 00:34:29,228
It's absolutely true, I'm here to prove all of them.

604
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,948
But you must get your realization.

605
00:34:34,148 --> 00:34:36,028
It's not because that I cannot prove it.

606
00:34:36,228 --> 00:34:37,948
You must enter into that realm of awareness

607
00:34:38,148 --> 00:34:39,948
otherwise I cannot prove it.

608
00:34:40,268 --> 00:34:42,828
It's true, the other day somebody was saying that Rama is a fiction.

609
00:34:43,028 --> 00:34:44,268
I said, "How do you say?"

610
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:46,988
He said, "Because He looks like a fiction".

611
00:34:47,188 --> 00:34:50,388
I said, "To human mind they cannot understand God,

612
00:34:50,868 --> 00:34:52,148
who has

613
00:34:52,348 --> 00:34:54,868
millions and millions of hands and eyes

614
00:34:55,068 --> 00:34:56,348
to work out His plans."

615
00:34:57,108 --> 00:34:59,068
So naturally Rama is a fiction, Krishna is a fiction,

616
00:34:59,268 --> 00:35:01,108
everybody is a fiction.

617
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:04,068
Because we ourselves are fictitious I think.

618
00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:09,468
Is not that it is a fiction but we are

619
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:13,228
incapable of grasping that is miraculous, which is divine.

620
00:35:13,428 --> 00:35:15,988
and that's why we just call it, "Oh".

621
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:21,148
No, everything is true, believe Me, everything is true.

622
00:35:21,348 --> 00:35:23,348
Now, Rama, say, [simplest of them].

623
00:35:23,868 --> 00:35:25,868
Simple being, like Rama, all right?

624
00:35:26,348 --> 00:35:28,028
Rama is a fiction.

625
00:35:28,228 --> 00:35:30,148
Many, even Indians are very anglicised now,

626
00:35:30,348 --> 00:35:32,148
very westernized you see,

627
00:35:32,348 --> 00:35:34,228
so they want to say, "We don't believe in all these fictions",

628
00:35:34,428 --> 00:35:36,148
so they become English.

629
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:42,948
For them to become English is the last epitome, it's the last world.

630
00:35:43,868 --> 00:35:46,108
So we don't believe in Rama, nothing, we say, "All right,

631
00:35:46,308 --> 00:35:48,828
it's all other, old style everything."

632
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:51,348
But He exists and He's within us.

633
00:35:51,868 --> 00:35:53,268
Can we prove it?

634
00:35:53,828 --> 00:35:55,308
With your Kundalini awakening.

635
00:35:55,508 --> 00:35:57,988
If a person who has got asthma.

636
00:35:58,268 --> 00:35:59,868
who suffers from asthma,

637
00:36:00,348 --> 00:36:02,348
catches on the right heart,

638
00:36:03,148 --> 00:36:05,348
you have to take the name of Rama,

639
00:36:06,348 --> 00:36:07,428
to cure him.

640
00:36:07,908 --> 00:36:09,348
Nothing else can cure him.

641
00:36:11,308 --> 00:36:12,348
The simplest thing.

642
00:36:13,348 --> 00:36:16,068
The Kundalini stops here.

643
00:36:16,268 --> 00:36:18,908
Many people don't believe in Christ.

644
00:36:19,108 --> 00:36:21,908
"We don't believe in Christ",[?] you don't believe in Christ

645
00:36:22,108 --> 00:36:26,348
but under what circumstaces? Why, why don't you believe in Christ?

646
00:36:29,908 --> 00:36:32,988
Because you see, we don't think He existed, how can it be possible?

647
00:36:33,188 --> 00:36:35,148
"We don't believe in Moses, we don't believe in Christ,

648
00:36:35,348 --> 00:36:37,188
we don't believe in anybody", all right.

649
00:36:37,388 --> 00:36:39,348
Do you believe in yourself?

650
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:42,308
Perhaps that is missing.

651
00:36:44,348 --> 00:36:46,188
Because the Self is not there.

652
00:36:47,348 --> 00:36:50,468
If you know your Self you should believe in Him.

653
00:36:51,068 --> 00:36:54,908
Because when Kundalini rises, at this point you'll be amazed,

654
00:36:55,148 --> 00:36:57,948
at this point, whether you believe in Christ or not,

655
00:36:58,148 --> 00:36:59,948
at this point,

656
00:37:00,148 --> 00:37:03,068
at the Agnya chakra, where you see the crossing of it,

657
00:37:03,908 --> 00:37:06,348
you have to say Lord's Prayer.

658
00:37:06,988 --> 00:37:08,268
You have to take the name of Christ

659
00:37:08,468 --> 00:37:09,948
otherwise Kundalini doesn't rise.

660
00:37:10,148 --> 00:37:12,908
Now most of the people who are here, who are realized, know this.

661
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:14,868
It has been proved to them.

662
00:37:16,348 --> 00:37:18,948
In the Nabhi, in this Void, if it is catching,

663
00:37:19,148 --> 00:37:20,508
you have to take the name of Moses.

664
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,948
Whether you are a Jew or not, or a hater of Jews

665
00:37:23,148 --> 00:37:24,108
or whatever you may be.

666
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,148
You'll have to take the name of a Jew,

667
00:37:26,348 --> 00:37:28,148
of Moses.

668
00:37:31,348 --> 00:37:33,508
The whole movement of the Kundalini

669
00:37:33,948 --> 00:37:37,068
is to intergrate all the truths which are

670
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:41,028
treated as miraculous, some people think it's falsehood,

671
00:37:41,348 --> 00:37:43,308
it's good for nothing, useless,

672
00:37:43,508 --> 00:37:46,268
all these things are proved by the

673
00:37:46,468 --> 00:37:49,868
movement of the Kundalini in your central path.

674
00:37:52,988 --> 00:37:55,388
And the greatest of greatest thing that is proved,

675
00:37:55,908 --> 00:37:58,068
is that God exists.

676
00:37:58,268 --> 00:38:01,268
Not only exists but He's active,

677
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:05,148
that He does everything for us,

678
00:38:06,188 --> 00:38:09,388
that it is He who is the truth and is His Power [Almighty],

679
00:38:09,828 --> 00:38:12,988
He's the truth, the rest is all falsehood and nonsense.

680
00:38:13,908 --> 00:38:18,148
It works in all details too, in small details also.

681
00:38:19,348 --> 00:38:21,828
Now Sahaja Yogis have seen the miracles in Sahaja Yoga,

682
00:38:22,028 --> 00:38:23,828
they cannot complain.

683
00:38:24,028 --> 00:38:25,348
You cannot complain also.

684
00:38:26,148 --> 00:38:28,108
When you will come here, [I mean] you are surprised

685
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:30,068
how you are helped, how you meet people,

686
00:38:30,268 --> 00:38:32,348
how you get to things, how things work out,

687
00:38:32,828 --> 00:38:35,348
and how it works out so smoothly, you just can't imagine.

688
00:38:37,108 --> 00:38:40,268
Even to the smallest detail you can work out,

689
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:42,348
beautifully,

690
00:38:43,348 --> 00:38:47,108
but you have to establish yourself in the kingdom of God.

691
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:50,428
Not with this fanatical ideas, like you go to the Catholic church

692
00:38:50,868 --> 00:38:52,868
and they say, "Now you must confess".

693
00:38:53,068 --> 00:38:55,108
I don't know from where did they get this idea.

694
00:38:55,308 --> 00:38:56,868
I don't think Christ could ever said that

695
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,428
to better go and confess to these priests,

696
00:38:58,868 --> 00:39:01,028
who are not even realized souls.

697
00:39:02,188 --> 00:39:04,268
What are they going to do by confession?

698
00:39:07,268 --> 00:39:09,828
And then the answer came to Me from a priest.

699
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:12,148
I've asked him, he's a nice man, he's a realized soul now,

700
00:39:12,348 --> 00:39:14,388
and he is working for Sahaja Yoga.

701
00:39:14,868 --> 00:39:17,468
But he told Me the reason is in the Bible it's written,

702
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,948
that whatever is corrected in this concern,

703
00:39:20,148 --> 00:39:21,948
will be corrected in the heaven

704
00:39:22,148 --> 00:39:24,148
that's why you better correct it by telling to the priest.

705
00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:26,828
Now, by any logical means do you think these priests

706
00:39:27,028 --> 00:39:28,948
can help you by telling them anything?

707
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:35,268
Whatever is to be granted on this earth is your Kundalini,

708
00:39:35,868 --> 00:39:37,348
and your Chakras.

709
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:40,988
The language comparable has been,

710
00:39:41,828 --> 00:39:43,308
specially the Old Testament,

711
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:46,108
has been extremely,

712
00:39:46,308 --> 00:39:48,388
guarded. It was security measure.

713
00:39:48,868 --> 00:39:50,908
Like the tree of life is nothing

714
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:53,068
but the Kundalini which is enlightened.

715
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:57,068
Absolutely that it looks like that, like a tree.

716
00:39:57,268 --> 00:39:59,468
The other day we were having program and today only,

717
00:39:59,908 --> 00:40:02,148
my children showed Me, "Look the Kundalini".

718
00:40:02,348 --> 00:40:05,388
When they saw they were describing about Moses something,

719
00:40:05,868 --> 00:40:08,148
perhaps, and this was the tree of life, they said.

720
00:40:08,348 --> 00:40:11,228
And My children, grandchildren said, "See, the Kundalini".

721
00:40:14,108 --> 00:40:16,988
The language they used may be

722
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,348
for security measures may be,

723
00:40:20,868 --> 00:40:24,228
but not the word meaning,

724
00:40:24,908 --> 00:40:28,348
if it is now changed by human beings, it's false.

725
00:40:28,988 --> 00:40:31,988
Human beings can change words, that's a different point,

726
00:40:32,188 --> 00:40:35,348
but you can see, in Sahaja Yoga you can see what is changed,

727
00:40:35,828 --> 00:40:39,068
what is wrong, which is falsehood. You can see all these things.

728
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:41,028
So to desintegrate,

729
00:40:41,228 --> 00:40:45,068
these things are again created in the name of religion, so-called.

730
00:40:45,348 --> 00:40:48,148
I mean these people are there for God or for

731
00:40:48,348 --> 00:40:50,148
making you feel guilty?

732
00:40:51,228 --> 00:40:55,908
Like, say Jews think that Christ was not a saviour,

733
00:40:56,948 --> 00:41:00,348
as they are still waiting for two hundred years. It's not true.

734
00:41:02,188 --> 00:41:05,268
He's the One, without Him you cannot raise the Kundalini.

735
00:41:05,468 --> 00:41:08,268
One should understand that He's the Mahavishnu described.

736
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:10,148
But if I say something,

737
00:41:10,348 --> 00:41:12,508
that doesn't mean that you should believe Me. Not at all.

738
00:41:12,948 --> 00:41:16,108
But you should see for yourself because if you are interested,

739
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:18,148
in the emancipation of the whole world,

740
00:41:18,348 --> 00:41:21,348
you should not get stuck on one, I tell you,

741
00:41:22,868 --> 00:41:24,108
stuck on to one thing,

742
00:41:24,308 --> 00:41:26,428
and say "this is the truth and this is the truth".

743
00:41:26,868 --> 00:41:28,468
No, seek for yourself what is the truth.

744
00:41:28,908 --> 00:41:30,908
And you'll be amazed that they are all one.

745
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:33,028
Like Christ has said, "Those who are not against Me

746
00:41:33,228 --> 00:41:34,988
are the people who are great".

747
00:41:37,348 --> 00:41:41,028
Moses and Christ are one, which can be proved.

748
00:41:42,348 --> 00:41:43,868
Same in other religions.

749
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,068
So religion is another way desintegrated.

750
00:41:46,268 --> 00:41:50,348
You hate each other. Fundamentalists, fighting for what?

751
00:41:51,188 --> 00:41:53,028
Fundamental difference you know.

752
00:41:53,228 --> 00:41:55,308
Can you imagine? What is the fundamental

753
00:41:55,508 --> 00:41:58,068
of these religions? If they are spirit, isn't it?

754
00:41:58,268 --> 00:42:01,268
Is it that different between the spirit of one and another?

755
00:42:02,148 --> 00:42:04,188
Fundamentalists are...

756
00:42:05,188 --> 00:42:07,148
Their God is one, He's created us

757
00:42:07,348 --> 00:42:08,468
and what are you fighting about?

758
00:42:08,948 --> 00:42:10,508
Fundamental difference you know, fundamental difference,

759
00:42:10,988 --> 00:42:13,268
where there exists no difference at all.

760
00:42:14,188 --> 00:42:16,108
So we have psychologists,

761
00:42:16,308 --> 00:42:20,388
we have religious leaders, teaching us how to fight and hate

762
00:42:20,868 --> 00:42:25,348
God and your fellow being, in the name of God.

763
00:42:27,348 --> 00:42:30,348
This is another desintegrated, that sets into us.

764
00:42:30,828 --> 00:42:33,348
So you people who are thinking,

765
00:42:34,268 --> 00:42:35,508
should understand

766
00:42:35,948 --> 00:42:38,828
that anything that creates such limitation within us

767
00:42:39,028 --> 00:42:40,948
any kind of fanaticism,

768
00:42:41,148 --> 00:42:44,308
is dangerous not only to you but to the whole society,

769
00:42:44,508 --> 00:42:46,148
and if you support it, even this much,

770
00:42:46,348 --> 00:42:48,068
you are supporting their destruction.

771
00:42:52,868 --> 00:42:54,428
With Sahaja Yoga we can establish,

772
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:57,188
this that anybody who is a fanatic,

773
00:42:57,388 --> 00:43:00,308
has problems and sufferes from many diseases

774
00:43:00,508 --> 00:43:02,148
which normal people don't.

775
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,788
Then there are another type of people who

776
00:43:06,988 --> 00:43:09,868
say that, "All right, we don't believe in God".

777
00:43:10,228 --> 00:43:13,108
Because how can God create this fanaticism?

778
00:43:13,348 --> 00:43:15,148
How can you blame God for fanaticism,

779
00:43:15,348 --> 00:43:17,228
I just can't understand, He never created it.

780
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,388
Actually He never created any difference between you people,

781
00:43:20,828 --> 00:43:23,348
just a variety, just to make it beautiful, that's all.

782
00:43:24,348 --> 00:43:27,148
See, He didn't create England separately, this separately,

783
00:43:27,348 --> 00:43:30,348
to that extent the way you think but He created them

784
00:43:30,868 --> 00:43:33,188
because they are different organs in the body of God.

785
00:43:35,188 --> 00:43:37,428
Do we take out an eye, and say "This is an eye

786
00:43:37,868 --> 00:43:40,348
so I do not have any duty to it". Can we?

787
00:43:42,108 --> 00:43:43,868
It's like that.

788
00:43:44,068 --> 00:43:46,428
It's simple as that, it's so simple.

789
00:43:46,908 --> 00:43:50,348
The truth is so simple and so stark before you

790
00:43:50,988 --> 00:43:53,468
that we are doing all these things,

791
00:43:54,268 --> 00:43:56,348
fighting, quarelling,

792
00:43:57,348 --> 00:44:00,148
all the time within ourselves and without.

793
00:44:02,988 --> 00:44:06,028
Now, for that Self-realization,

794
00:44:06,228 --> 00:44:09,268
God has placed this wonderful thing, Kundalini within us,

795
00:44:09,468 --> 00:44:12,348
very beautifully, in the best possible position.

796
00:44:13,348 --> 00:44:15,868
It could not be better anywhere.

797
00:44:16,348 --> 00:44:19,188
To create this happening within us, in our awareness,

798
00:44:19,388 --> 00:44:22,348
the Kundalini has to rise and give us realization.

799
00:44:23,108 --> 00:44:25,428
Now, people ask questions to God also, can be.

800
00:44:25,868 --> 00:44:27,108
They can say, "Why did He do it?

801
00:44:27,308 --> 00:44:29,188
Why didn't He make us wise within Him?"

802
00:44:29,388 --> 00:44:30,908
There are many like that.

803
00:44:31,308 --> 00:44:33,108
He should have just make us wise,

804
00:44:33,308 --> 00:44:35,828
just from monkeys, dipped into some wisdom

805
00:44:36,028 --> 00:44:37,868
powder,and lift us out as

806
00:44:38,068 --> 00:44:40,868
wise people living in the kingdom of God.

807
00:44:43,228 --> 00:44:46,108
Why didn't He do it in our evolution, why did He make us

808
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,388
so stupid?

809
00:44:48,828 --> 00:44:50,268
One can say to God, you see, why, why

810
00:44:50,468 --> 00:44:52,148
did He create these problems, talking to God.

811
00:44:52,348 --> 00:44:55,028
But who are we to ask Him questions. You see, He does what He likes.

812
00:44:55,228 --> 00:44:56,348
But,

813
00:44:58,148 --> 00:44:59,348
there's a reason.

814
00:45:00,188 --> 00:45:02,148
If you have to enter into that complete freedom

815
00:45:02,348 --> 00:45:04,348
you must know how to be free.

816
00:45:06,188 --> 00:45:09,148
If you are just abandoned people, you have no sense of freedom,

817
00:45:09,348 --> 00:45:13,028
you don't know how to be choosy about the good and the bad,

818
00:45:13,228 --> 00:45:15,948
and you do not understand the value

819
00:45:16,148 --> 00:45:18,268
of your own wisdom,

820
00:45:19,868 --> 00:45:22,268
and if you are put in charge, imagine,

821
00:45:22,468 --> 00:45:25,988
some mad people put in charge in government, what will happen?

822
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,508
So you have to grow up to that point

823
00:45:28,948 --> 00:45:31,028
to feel your freedom that in your freedom,

824
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,308
you are great, it's in that freedom,

825
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:38,348
you are kind, in that freedom.

826
00:45:39,068 --> 00:45:40,348
You are,

827
00:45:41,148 --> 00:45:43,948
absolutely balanced.

828
00:45:46,348 --> 00:45:49,148
And when that happens to you,

829
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:52,908
then only the higher freedom is given to you.

830
00:45:53,108 --> 00:45:54,908
Because that's completely free.

831
00:45:55,348 --> 00:45:58,068
And once that high freedom comes into you,

832
00:45:59,348 --> 00:46:02,348
then you can feel,

833
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:08,308
the responsibility, the responsibility,

834
00:46:09,028 --> 00:46:10,268
to be,

835
00:46:11,188 --> 00:46:14,868
responsible for your freedom.

836
00:46:16,948 --> 00:46:19,228
To put this beautiful responsability onto you

837
00:46:19,428 --> 00:46:22,108
you have to know how to use your freedom.

838
00:46:22,308 --> 00:46:24,988
This is only transition which has led all of us,

839
00:46:25,188 --> 00:46:27,148
into this feeling, guiltness,

840
00:46:27,348 --> 00:46:29,908
or this agression. Can you imagine?

841
00:46:30,108 --> 00:46:32,268
You could have waited for a burial,

842
00:46:33,348 --> 00:46:36,228
without feeling so sick.

843
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:40,908
I mean sometimes I feel the people are

844
00:46:41,348 --> 00:46:43,148
going for a funeral.

845
00:46:43,348 --> 00:46:46,148
the way they look miserable.

846
00:46:46,868 --> 00:46:50,868
The rest are busy, creating such things.

847
00:46:51,228 --> 00:46:53,868
So there are only two types of people, if one sees,

848
00:46:54,068 --> 00:46:58,068
some who are being victims and another who are victimizing also.

849
00:47:00,908 --> 00:47:04,828
So to have the balance in the center, to stand in the center,

850
00:47:05,348 --> 00:47:07,348
God has created

851
00:47:08,188 --> 00:47:11,308
this little tide where you have to just learn,

852
00:47:11,508 --> 00:47:14,228
how to gain your freedom. He gave you freedom, you know,

853
00:47:14,428 --> 00:47:17,188
and this freedom is the only thing that has created,

854
00:47:17,388 --> 00:47:21,068
all the problems you face, not God. God didn't create,

855
00:47:21,308 --> 00:47:25,068
any problems for you. No, He wanted to make a very smooth ascent.

856
00:47:26,188 --> 00:47:28,308
He's made your machines so beautifully.

857
00:47:29,268 --> 00:47:32,948
Despite all these things you do get your realization, no doubt.

858
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:36,508
But because of habits you may run down again to it.

859
00:47:37,148 --> 00:47:39,428
Again you will have your ascent, again go down.

860
00:47:39,868 --> 00:47:41,508
It happens to some people, doesn't matter.

861
00:47:41,988 --> 00:47:45,348
But if you are steady, it is going to work out.

862
00:47:46,228 --> 00:47:48,028
It has to work out.

863
00:47:48,348 --> 00:47:52,108
God has to save His creation. He has to do it.

864
00:47:53,028 --> 00:47:55,148
Only thing how many are going to cooperate

865
00:47:55,348 --> 00:47:58,148
and take advantage of His compassion is to be seen.

866
00:47:59,348 --> 00:48:03,188
That is the most important thing, how many are going to be wise,

867
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,868
to see to their own advantage,

868
00:48:08,348 --> 00:48:10,348
to their own ascent.

869
00:48:12,068 --> 00:48:13,828
It's the only choice.

870
00:48:15,348 --> 00:48:18,188
May God bless you.

871
00:48:20,348 --> 00:48:22,508
If you have any questions you may ask Me,

872
00:48:23,028 --> 00:48:26,868
and then we are going to give realization.

873
00:48:30,868 --> 00:48:34,228
Mother, how the negative force is created?

874
00:48:34,868 --> 00:48:35,508
What's it?

875
00:48:35,948 --> 00:48:38,508
How this negative force is created, within?

876
00:48:38,988 --> 00:48:40,308
What is he saying?

877
00:48:40,988 --> 00:48:44,148
How the negative force is created, within us?

878
00:48:45,308 --> 00:48:47,988
By the great human beings.

879
00:48:52,108 --> 00:48:54,348
Who has created atom bomb?

880
00:48:54,868 --> 00:48:56,348
Same type.

881
00:48:57,228 --> 00:49:00,348
From the very begining they started creating this negative force.

882
00:49:01,348 --> 00:49:02,868
All right.

883
00:49:05,188 --> 00:49:08,388
In seeking as I told you, in the seeking,

884
00:49:09,148 --> 00:49:12,348
they settle in this vicious circle

885
00:49:12,948 --> 00:49:16,948
which started creating, and think you see, the mistake is small.

886
00:49:17,148 --> 00:49:20,348
What is the mistake in separating a hydrogen

887
00:49:20,868 --> 00:49:22,068
atom, isn't it?

888
00:49:22,268 --> 00:49:24,788
Just they did it, you see, for fun sake maybe.

889
00:49:24,988 --> 00:49:26,348
I don't know why they did it.

890
00:49:27,948 --> 00:49:29,268
But now it has become like a devil,

891
00:49:29,468 --> 00:49:31,028
sitting on everybody's head and everybody...

892
00:49:31,228 --> 00:49:34,348
"Thank God only, whatever they create frightens them, thank God.

893
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:37,948
So they are not going to use it, but

894
00:49:38,148 --> 00:49:40,348
who has created that? Human beings.

895
00:49:41,988 --> 00:49:45,188
In ignorance they have done it. As a Mother I have to save.

896
00:49:46,228 --> 00:49:49,188
I cannot say that it was deliberated.

897
00:49:49,388 --> 00:49:51,148
It's a dangerous situation then.

898
00:49:57,868 --> 00:50:00,948
It's obvious, in your life, ten people have created atom bombs.

899
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:02,348
What was the need?

900
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:07,228
I mean for a stranger like Me, I don't understand what is the need

901
00:50:07,428 --> 00:50:09,348
to create an atom bomb, what is the need?

902
00:50:14,028 --> 00:50:17,308
Who are them to create this kind of a democracy and this kind of

903
00:50:18,908 --> 00:50:23,148
communism, and this kind of all nonsensical institutions,

904
00:50:23,348 --> 00:50:25,348
which just make the people fight?

905
00:50:34,308 --> 00:50:36,148
Any other questions please?

906
00:50:36,348 --> 00:50:38,388
And you can't blame God for that.

907
00:50:38,868 --> 00:50:41,348
At least God didn't tell you to make atom bombs.

908
00:50:50,228 --> 00:50:52,148
Any other question please?

909
00:50:53,068 --> 00:50:54,068
I have got one.

910
00:50:54,268 --> 00:50:54,868
Yes.

911
00:50:55,068 --> 00:50:57,148
Why do you think, are people

912
00:50:57,348 --> 00:51:00,148
all the time so afraid of losing things,

913
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:05,108
of losing their ego, of losing their, their relatives, or

914
00:51:05,868 --> 00:51:07,348
but not losing, but

915
00:51:09,348 --> 00:51:12,348
losing their, what they have built up in themselves,

916
00:51:12,828 --> 00:51:14,948
their identity that they think they are.

917
00:51:15,148 --> 00:51:17,148
They are afraid of losing it.

918
00:51:17,868 --> 00:51:19,308
Why they are afraid?

919
00:51:19,508 --> 00:51:20,268
Yes.

920
00:51:20,468 --> 00:51:22,948
They have been crocked up like that, you know.

921
00:51:23,348 --> 00:51:25,868
They are told like that, they are conditioned like that.

922
00:51:26,148 --> 00:51:27,388
What can they do?

923
00:51:27,868 --> 00:51:29,948
You see, they are all the time, if somebody tells you

924
00:51:30,148 --> 00:51:32,148
that you are going to lose, "it's very precious, very precious",

925
00:51:32,348 --> 00:51:34,348
you see, you'll hold on to it.

926
00:51:34,948 --> 00:51:37,348
But one must know in growth, in life,

927
00:51:37,948 --> 00:51:40,188
when a flower becomes a fruit,

928
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,948
it looses power to fruit, [?]

929
00:51:43,348 --> 00:51:45,348
to go into it.

930
00:51:46,148 --> 00:51:48,148
When an egg breaks,

931
00:51:48,348 --> 00:51:51,868
its shell falls off and the bird comes out.

932
00:51:52,348 --> 00:51:54,828
It's not a moving, it is growth.

933
00:51:58,028 --> 00:52:00,508
You have been fighting, what can you do?

934
00:52:01,988 --> 00:52:03,508
From the very beginning.

935
00:52:05,348 --> 00:52:08,508
What is there to loose if you are not holding on to anything?

936
00:52:10,228 --> 00:52:11,388
All right?

937
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:14,028
What is there to lose, you just tell Me?

938
00:52:14,268 --> 00:52:16,148
If the whole is all something,

939
00:52:16,348 --> 00:52:18,508
Then, then, if there's no catch on anything,

940
00:52:18,948 --> 00:52:20,028
what are you going to loose?

941
00:52:20,228 --> 00:52:22,148
You are just enjoing on giving.

942
00:52:25,988 --> 00:52:27,868
What do we take from Him?

943
00:52:29,348 --> 00:52:31,828
When we go our hands are like this,

944
00:52:32,188 --> 00:52:34,028
when we come our hands are like this.

945
00:52:35,028 --> 00:52:39,348
Our hands are open, when we go. We can't take anything we confess it.

946
00:52:40,948 --> 00:52:45,148
Even ego we leave here. Everything we leave here.

947
00:52:48,388 --> 00:52:50,988
All myths, so many myths have been created,

948
00:52:51,188 --> 00:52:53,028
and man is living with the mythical ideas.

949
00:52:53,228 --> 00:52:56,068
I tell you, he's living, he's compromizing with the myth.

950
00:52:56,268 --> 00:52:58,228
All the time, he doesn't accept the myths that means

951
00:52:58,428 --> 00:53:00,148
he is not a sane person.

952
00:53:00,868 --> 00:53:03,188
All sorts of, and then many myths set in.

953
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:07,028
People start copying others blindly.

954
00:53:07,308 --> 00:53:09,508
All it's, to a

955
00:53:10,148 --> 00:53:11,828
ignorant person like Me,

956
00:53:12,028 --> 00:53:14,308
it's something I just don't understand what is the need.

957
00:53:20,068 --> 00:53:23,268
But I am talking of the real world where you have to be.

958
00:53:23,988 --> 00:53:25,308
It is reality.

959
00:53:25,508 --> 00:53:28,308
And you know reality is love.

960
00:53:30,988 --> 00:53:32,268
It's love.

961
00:53:33,348 --> 00:53:36,348
But not the way human beings understand love.

962
00:53:36,948 --> 00:53:39,868
But love which flows,

963
00:53:41,228 --> 00:53:44,468
which thinks, which cooperates,

964
00:53:45,028 --> 00:53:47,228
and generates the feeling of joy.

965
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:53,468
It's a very different world that we have to adjust to.

966
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,068
But what will you do?

967
00:53:56,268 --> 00:53:58,468
What have you got?

968
00:53:59,108 --> 00:54:01,348
What you have, that is lost?

969
00:54:02,988 --> 00:54:04,108
That's your spirit.

970
00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:06,348
And what you don't have, you are only born with.

971
00:54:09,068 --> 00:54:10,828
There's nothing to lose. That's very true,

972
00:54:11,028 --> 00:54:12,868
they are so fightened, you don't know.

973
00:54:14,228 --> 00:54:15,948
Very frightened.

974
00:54:22,028 --> 00:54:25,908
They are made like that, what can you do?

975
00:54:27,948 --> 00:54:29,988
But they lose everything to a person

976
00:54:30,188 --> 00:54:33,348
who knows how to handle this condition in the real sense.

977
00:54:34,028 --> 00:54:36,388
You can just become like a cabage with some people.

978
00:54:36,868 --> 00:54:39,348
Really they can make you a cabbage.

979
00:54:41,828 --> 00:54:44,148
In the name of God, in the name of enlightenement, they can.

980
00:54:44,348 --> 00:54:46,228
Yes, they can harm you.

981
00:54:51,868 --> 00:54:52,948
Then they are not worried.

982
00:54:53,148 --> 00:54:55,268
I don't know how they get this confidence into that.

983
00:54:56,108 --> 00:54:59,108
Like the other day we had somebody from Charismatic Movement.

984
00:54:59,308 --> 00:55:01,148
You remember that, Norman.

985
00:55:01,348 --> 00:55:03,948
And I hope you have not taken anything.

986
00:55:04,148 --> 00:55:05,828
Photographer was [?].

987
00:55:06,028 --> 00:55:08,028
You were also worried about him.

988
00:55:08,228 --> 00:55:11,348
And he went into such movements of the body,

989
00:55:12,068 --> 00:55:15,068
for at least half an hour

990
00:55:15,268 --> 00:55:17,908
he was so much in a very funny type of epilepsy, you see.

991
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,828
All his body was moving and

992
00:55:21,028 --> 00:55:22,868
terrible he was crying, weeping

993
00:55:23,068 --> 00:55:25,268
he fell down on the ground, you can't imagine.

994
00:55:27,348 --> 00:55:30,108
And he said, "This I've been doing and so many are doing like this,

995
00:55:30,308 --> 00:55:32,068
and they think they are getting into Holy Ghost".

996
00:55:32,268 --> 00:55:34,108
I said, "Holy Ghost?"

997
00:55:34,308 --> 00:55:37,148
What an unholy thing it is to be like that.

998
00:55:38,348 --> 00:55:41,108
Holy Ghost? Can you imagine?

999
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:52,308
He wanted to get out of it. He could not.

1000
00:55:52,508 --> 00:55:53,908
Now, he's all right, perfectly all right.

1001
00:55:54,108 --> 00:55:56,108
He's like a small little child.

1002
00:55:56,308 --> 00:55:59,348
I wish you could see that joy.

1003
00:56:00,068 --> 00:56:02,868
You should have seen it, really.

1004
00:56:04,348 --> 00:56:08,348
Shocking, much more than TM I tell you, much worse.

1005
00:56:10,028 --> 00:56:12,308
Because the movement was so fast.

1006
00:56:14,348 --> 00:56:17,308
[Under they make] very fast movements.

1007
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:21,268
Whole body was gesticulating and this was too much.

1008
00:56:27,108 --> 00:56:28,988
He got cured.

1009
00:56:36,948 --> 00:56:38,348
Any other question?

1010
00:56:46,508 --> 00:56:50,268
Ego is one problem, I must say it's a very big problem.

1011
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:54,388
And for ego,

1012
00:56:55,388 --> 00:56:59,068
like some people say,  "Mother, why You should do it?"

1013
00:56:59,348 --> 00:57:02,028
I said, "You better do it, it's very good idea".

1014
00:57:02,228 --> 00:57:04,388
I would like to retire...

1015
00:57:04,828 --> 00:57:07,148
But you can't do it, what to do? See.

1016
00:57:07,348 --> 00:57:10,308
All right, now you do so many things, I don´t feel bad.

1017
00:57:10,508 --> 00:57:12,308
Why should you feel bad if I know something.

1018
00:57:12,508 --> 00:57:15,348
You know one thing I know is to awaken, awakening of the Kundalini.

1019
00:57:15,868 --> 00:57:17,348
Now, what can I do about it?

1020
00:57:19,148 --> 00:57:21,428
Are you going to crucify Me for that?

1021
00:57:25,348 --> 00:57:27,268
I mean I don't get any,

1022
00:57:27,988 --> 00:57:30,868
what you call, title from your government for that,

1023
00:57:31,068 --> 00:57:32,948
you won't pay Me, nothing.

1024
00:57:36,908 --> 00:57:38,148
So why, why should you feel bad?

1025
00:57:38,348 --> 00:57:40,028
I mean I will make you the same way.

1026
00:57:40,228 --> 00:57:43,148
You will raise others Kundalini also.

1027
00:57:43,348 --> 00:57:45,148
So what's the harm?

1028
00:57:45,348 --> 00:57:48,348
You will, of course you are going to do it yourself.

1029
00:57:49,108 --> 00:57:51,788
Supposing I have the keys with Me. If I give you the keys

1030
00:57:51,988 --> 00:57:54,108
will you feel your ego will be hurt or not?

1031
00:57:54,348 --> 00:57:57,028
If I am a trustee I have, I have to give you isn't it?

1032
00:57:57,988 --> 00:58:00,948
Do you feel your ego hurt, if I give you, your keys?

1033
00:58:01,308 --> 00:58:03,348
It's so simple as that.

1034
00:58:08,348 --> 00:58:11,108
This is your own, this is your own property, I've got the keys,

1035
00:58:11,308 --> 00:58:14,068
I give you because I hold them, now what to do?

1036
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,148
If you accept that's very good,

1037
00:58:17,348 --> 00:58:19,268
Nevertheless, so I have to give you.

1038
00:58:22,348 --> 00:58:25,068
What is there to feel hurt about that part?

1039
00:58:26,348 --> 00:58:27,868
Actually I have to work very hard.

1040
00:58:28,068 --> 00:58:29,508
You don't have to work hard at all.

1041
00:58:29,988 --> 00:58:31,868
To begin with, then up to you.

1042
00:58:40,908 --> 00:58:42,348
Any other question?

1043
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,508
I would like Sahaja Yogis to ask the question,

1044
00:58:47,988 --> 00:58:51,028
for one reason, because when they are faced with life, and

1045
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:52,428
other people will ask the questions,

1046
00:58:52,868 --> 00:58:55,068
so any questions which you have not been able to

1047
00:58:55,268 --> 00:58:57,988
ask, you can ask Me and then we have our realization.

1048
00:59:03,068 --> 00:59:06,948
Mother, what's, what is we are perished,

1049
00:59:07,148 --> 00:59:08,268
for the Christian Church?

1050
00:59:08,468 --> 00:59:09,828
What is it?

1051
00:59:10,028 --> 00:59:13,348
What it's our approach for the Christian Church.

1052
00:59:13,868 --> 00:59:15,308
Have pity for them.

1053
00:59:21,228 --> 00:59:24,348
See I took My birth in the Christian religion in India,

1054
00:59:26,348 --> 00:59:29,148
and first the Hindus, you see, they were very upset

1055
00:59:29,348 --> 00:59:31,148
that "how could She take birth

1056
00:59:31,988 --> 00:59:35,348
in a Christian religion", I mean so called Christian.

1057
00:59:37,348 --> 00:59:41,508
And I must tell you I was baptized forcibly by

1058
00:59:41,948 --> 00:59:44,428
a Lutheran Church.

1059
00:59:44,988 --> 00:59:46,068
All right?

1060
00:59:49,068 --> 00:59:50,868
The simple answer is

1061
00:59:51,228 --> 00:59:54,108
that Christians are the most fanatic.

1062
00:59:56,268 --> 00:59:59,028
And the Indian Christians are the worst

1063
00:59:59,868 --> 01:00:02,348
because they think Christ was born in England.

1064
01:00:04,148 --> 01:00:06,948
Really they think so. You see if you have an English name

1065
01:00:07,148 --> 01:00:09,468
then you are a real Christian otherwise you are not.

1066
01:00:09,948 --> 01:00:12,868
You can't imagine how ignorant they are.

1067
01:00:13,348 --> 01:00:17,348
And how the Christans are most fanatic. Looks funny but it is so.

1068
01:00:18,188 --> 01:00:22,868
Because their fanatism is so beautifully managed.

1069
01:00:23,948 --> 01:00:27,348
It is not like Khomeini is, which has start open fanaticism.

1070
01:00:28,148 --> 01:00:31,348
You know, Khomeini is that and he has to accept he is.

1071
01:00:32,068 --> 01:00:34,308
But this way it is very well polished, you know,

1072
01:00:34,508 --> 01:00:36,348
beautifully done.

1073
01:00:36,988 --> 01:00:39,508
Others can, may say they are troves

1074
01:00:39,828 --> 01:00:42,988
but this is like a diamond artificially made.

1075
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,868
They do social work.

1076
01:00:47,028 --> 01:00:48,028
This Christian way.

1077
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:51,108
Now for example if you ask somebody, a man in England,

1078
01:00:51,308 --> 01:00:53,388
it's a Christian way to tell the way you see.

1079
01:00:53,868 --> 01:00:56,348
What God has got to do with this, just tell Me?

1080
01:00:57,268 --> 01:00:59,188
They have mixed up God with all these things.

1081
01:00:59,388 --> 01:01:01,348
Such a big mixture they have made,

1082
01:01:01,948 --> 01:01:04,148
that the fanaticism of Christianity is

1083
01:01:04,348 --> 01:01:06,348
very much in delusion.

1084
01:01:09,268 --> 01:01:13,868
For them, begging in the name of God is also Christian.

1085
01:01:16,988 --> 01:01:18,388
It's a very dangerous game,

1086
01:01:18,868 --> 01:01:21,268
because they are the cleverest of all, they think.

1087
01:01:22,308 --> 01:01:25,868
So, the way they have entangled themselves into,

1088
01:01:26,348 --> 01:01:30,988
it's so much dogmatic and so beautifully philosophised.

1089
01:01:31,348 --> 01:01:32,908
It's a philosophy,

1090
01:01:33,348 --> 01:01:35,468
to know if you have to get out of it.

1091
01:01:36,028 --> 01:01:39,868
It is so beautiful, you can't imagine. It's so beautiful.

1092
01:01:41,988 --> 01:01:45,228
And so believe they are the most,

1093
01:01:46,108 --> 01:01:48,948
kindest people, compassion personified,

1094
01:01:49,148 --> 01:01:51,228
great people, Christians.

1095
01:01:51,428 --> 01:01:53,428
And the Christains believe it.

1096
01:01:53,868 --> 01:01:55,868
Christ never asked you to beg.

1097
01:01:56,348 --> 01:02:00,148
He never asked you to collect money for the poor.

1098
01:02:00,348 --> 01:02:03,908
Nothing of the kind. He is from [?],you see.

1099
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:07,148
He wanted you to get your realization.

1100
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:09,148
That's what He wanted.

1101
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,268
You have created the poor.

1102
01:02:13,148 --> 01:02:16,028
And you better look after them. That's not God's job.

1103
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,988
Communists are maybe the greatest Christians there,

1104
01:02:20,268 --> 01:02:22,988
the way they look after their poor.

1105
01:02:23,348 --> 01:02:26,948
God's job is one, is to give you realization for the [living].

1106
01:02:29,828 --> 01:02:33,868
To take you away from this ignorance and mire of life,

1107
01:02:37,348 --> 01:02:39,468
into that beautiful, blissful,

1108
01:02:40,188 --> 01:02:43,828
kingdom of God. That is the work of God.

1109
01:02:45,148 --> 01:02:47,868
And not these things which you describe back.

1110
01:02:48,068 --> 01:02:49,148
But it looks so idealistic, you know.

1111
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:51,948
The whole thing is such an idealism.

1112
01:02:53,828 --> 01:02:55,988
That's right, very, very dangerous.

1113
01:02:56,188 --> 01:02:58,348
And it's so well organized.

1114
01:03:01,868 --> 01:03:03,428
So well organized, you know.

1115
01:03:04,228 --> 01:03:05,508
So well organized.

1116
01:03:06,108 --> 01:03:07,948
Even the hymn numbers, everything,

1117
01:03:08,148 --> 01:03:10,308
done so well, every book done so well,

1118
01:03:10,508 --> 01:03:12,468
stand up to say, sit down,

1119
01:03:12,948 --> 01:03:14,948
so regimented, beautifully.

1120
01:03:15,148 --> 01:03:17,148
No one can realize even that this is,

1121
01:03:17,348 --> 01:03:19,268
we are going all to madness, you see.

1122
01:03:20,348 --> 01:03:23,348
It's a very wonderful illusion.

1123
01:03:24,028 --> 01:03:26,228
We are not supposed to look this side or that side.

1124
01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:29,028
It's all right. In England I have Christians,

1125
01:03:29,308 --> 01:03:31,428
many [of them] have been Christians you see.

1126
01:03:31,868 --> 01:03:33,508
I have Christians, Jews, or like this [unclear].

1127
01:03:33,948 --> 01:03:36,508
Indian Christians, I don't have to even one, except for

1128
01:03:36,948 --> 01:03:38,268
of course, my family belongs to them

1129
01:03:38,468 --> 01:03:40,428
because they have known My childhood, they know Me.

1130
01:03:40,868 --> 01:03:43,868
But the rest of them, for them I am a healer.

1131
01:03:47,828 --> 01:03:49,348
Oh, yes, believe Me.

1132
01:03:54,148 --> 01:03:56,988
Hindus are My disciples, then Muslims are but not Christians.

1133
01:03:58,988 --> 01:04:01,908
Not one, I knew this.

1134
01:04:05,348 --> 01:04:07,348
and when I went to America,

1135
01:04:08,868 --> 01:04:12,308
they pronounced "a Christian mystic has come".

1136
01:04:12,508 --> 01:04:14,988
That gave Me good marks, you know.

1137
01:04:18,868 --> 01:04:22,028
People came to see Me because of the Christian mystic,

1138
01:04:22,348 --> 01:04:25,348
properly baptized. I must get my certificate also.

1139
01:04:32,348 --> 01:04:36,348
So our attitude should be of simply pity towards them.

1140
01:04:37,148 --> 01:04:40,028
Like Blake has said, "The priest cursed,

1141
01:04:40,948 --> 01:04:43,788
cursed my [unclear] when he baptized me."

1142
01:04:43,988 --> 01:04:45,308
Something like that, he said really.

1143
01:04:45,508 --> 01:04:48,148
We should have really simple pity for all the people,

1144
01:04:48,348 --> 01:04:52,148
who go to churches where there are all the graves.

1145
01:04:52,348 --> 01:04:56,148
They sit on the graves, take all the spirits into themselves.

1146
01:04:56,348 --> 01:04:58,268
God save them.

1147
01:05:02,348 --> 01:05:03,428
I don't know.

1148
01:05:03,948 --> 01:05:06,948
While Christians, everyone is just like that.

1149
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:15,988
But, among the Christians only I am sure,

1150
01:05:16,228 --> 01:05:20,148
only Sahaja Yoga will come up, very well.

1151
01:05:22,028 --> 01:05:24,348
That's the power of Christ. I hope so.

1152
01:05:25,828 --> 01:05:27,988
I hope so.

1153
01:05:33,988 --> 01:05:35,428
Mislead,

1154
01:05:35,868 --> 01:05:38,988
and mislead people also,

1155
01:05:39,188 --> 01:05:41,388
who are enjoying that misleading

1156
01:05:41,868 --> 01:05:44,308
are most difficult I mean, don't you think so?

1157
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:46,348
How can you talk to them?

1158
01:05:48,108 --> 01:05:49,348
Who can break it?

1159
01:05:56,988 --> 01:05:59,948
When I go to India, I can speak,

1160
01:06:00,268 --> 01:06:04,148
in a cenacle that means Catholic, sankar cenacle means Catholic,

1161
01:06:04,348 --> 01:06:05,988
temple,

1162
01:06:06,188 --> 01:06:09,148
and thousands of people come to take marriage there.

1163
01:06:09,348 --> 01:06:11,428
And they respect Me as a saint.

1164
01:06:12,148 --> 01:06:15,428
Do you think in any church whatsoever,

1165
01:06:15,988 --> 01:06:17,428
I could be respected like that,

1166
01:06:17,908 --> 01:06:19,988
except for one "Unity Church" we had,

1167
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:23,068
where all kinds of bhoots are respected.

1168
01:06:23,268 --> 01:06:26,828
So I was also called to give a lecture.

1169
01:06:27,348 --> 01:06:29,508
It was I think a, more of a

1170
01:06:29,988 --> 01:06:32,508
I don't know, money-making proposition whatever it was.

1171
01:06:33,228 --> 01:06:35,108
Whatever it was.

1172
01:06:37,108 --> 01:06:41,028
But in India, that's the, that's the blessing

1173
01:06:41,268 --> 01:06:43,308
of the Hindus that they are not organized.

1174
01:06:43,508 --> 01:06:46,868
For them saint is a saint.

1175
01:06:47,868 --> 01:06:52,308
Even the prime minister, even the I would say, the

1176
01:06:55,028 --> 01:06:57,268
president of India will stand for a saint.

1177
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:00,308
They won't sit.

1178
01:07:03,148 --> 01:07:05,228
This ideas are not here.

1179
01:07:06,148 --> 01:07:09,148
They are too organized to get out of

1180
01:07:09,348 --> 01:07:12,468
this organized way, to find out

1181
01:07:13,028 --> 01:07:16,228
what is beyond. You see, we just avoid our spirituality.

1182
01:07:16,428 --> 01:07:18,988
Is satisfied by going to Sunday church, finished.

1183
01:07:19,228 --> 01:07:21,308
Or to give some money for the feed.

1184
01:07:21,508 --> 01:07:23,948
That's all. That's not the way it is.

1185
01:07:24,148 --> 01:07:26,228
It's much, much, much more.

1186
01:07:27,348 --> 01:07:30,188
But be careful,

1187
01:07:30,948 --> 01:07:33,068
Christ has said, "You'll be calling Me, Christ, Crist.

1188
01:07:33,268 --> 01:07:34,988
I won't recognize you"

1189
01:07:35,348 --> 01:07:40,228
That's what they are. I'm sorry for them, really sorry.

1190
01:07:46,348 --> 01:07:47,988
Any other question?

1191
01:07:49,988 --> 01:07:52,348
Can everybody within our [unclear] at the most

1192
01:07:52,988 --> 01:07:54,988
[unclear]  rise enough?

1193
01:07:55,188 --> 01:07:58,028
Yes, everybody can.

1194
01:07:58,268 --> 01:08:01,108
But everybody doesn't mind, want it.

1195
01:08:01,348 --> 01:08:05,348
You see, they don't want it. See how many people are here.

1196
01:08:07,228 --> 01:08:09,468
But if it was some sort of a falsehood,

1197
01:08:09,948 --> 01:08:11,948
if I come with two horns,

1198
01:08:12,148 --> 01:08:14,348
there could have been three halls big like these.

1199
01:08:16,868 --> 01:08:20,068
People don't want reality, my child, they don't want it.

1200
01:08:20,348 --> 01:08:22,348
They never wanted it.

1201
01:08:22,988 --> 01:08:24,988
You always crucified it.

1202
01:08:26,348 --> 01:08:29,148
But now at least there are some who really want it.

1203
01:08:29,348 --> 01:08:31,468
And I am happy you think of others also.

1204
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,348
Very happy to know that.

1205
01:08:35,348 --> 01:08:39,228
It was a difficult task.

1206
01:08:40,308 --> 01:08:42,348
I have to work very hard.

1207
01:08:44,988 --> 01:08:47,948
They don't want reality because in Sahaja Yoga it is a becoming,

1208
01:08:48,148 --> 01:08:50,228
It is not just to come and filling a form,

1209
01:08:50,428 --> 01:08:53,828
"All right, you are the member", or you pay supposing a one pound,

1210
01:08:54,028 --> 01:08:57,908
memebership. It's this o.k.? It's your becoming, what you become.

1211
01:08:58,908 --> 01:09:02,468
It's your thing, that must happen. You must get your properties.

1212
01:09:03,268 --> 01:09:04,988
This is the problem.

1213
01:09:09,868 --> 01:09:12,028
You have to give up [independence].

1214
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:14,348
It's easy to give up.

1215
01:09:17,228 --> 01:09:19,988
It's very easy but I never talk about it before realization.

1216
01:09:20,188 --> 01:09:22,148
Because after realization you just give up things.

1217
01:09:22,348 --> 01:09:23,908
If I tell you, half of you might go away

1218
01:09:24,108 --> 01:09:25,268
so I'm not going to tell you.

1219
01:09:25,468 --> 01:09:28,308
You better get your realization. It will work it out.

1220
01:09:28,508 --> 01:09:32,148
It will establish a new priority within yourself, natural.

1221
01:09:32,348 --> 01:09:34,268
Because if you have light you see.

1222
01:09:35,988 --> 01:09:38,348
You see snake as snake and rope a rope.

1223
01:09:39,148 --> 01:09:41,028
So I don't have to tell you, you just see, you just feel,

1224
01:09:41,228 --> 01:09:42,308
it happens to you.

1225
01:09:44,108 --> 01:09:46,148
Yes, I know, I know. I wish I could.

1226
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,028
It can be done.

1227
01:09:48,348 --> 01:09:51,188
To all the new people, whatever race you may belong.

1228
01:09:51,388 --> 01:09:53,348
It can. But how many are there?

1229
01:09:56,348 --> 01:09:58,148
It's a very slow movement.

1230
01:09:58,348 --> 01:10:01,348
For four years I had only seven Britains with Me.

1231
01:10:02,228 --> 01:10:05,828
I was struggling with them. Four years, can you imagine? In England.

1232
01:10:12,148 --> 01:10:13,948
Such tremendous task.

1233
01:10:15,348 --> 01:10:17,508
All right, so you get your realization now.

1234
01:10:17,948 --> 01:10:19,268
Let's see how many you bring in.

1235
01:10:22,188 --> 01:10:23,268
Yeah?

1236
01:10:24,268 --> 01:10:26,188
Divine Holy Mother,

1237
01:10:26,868 --> 01:10:32,068
after Self-realization, how long in this most difficult times

1238
01:10:32,268 --> 01:10:34,308
is it possible to stop reincarnating

1239
01:10:34,508 --> 01:10:36,308
and seek perfection?

1240
01:10:36,948 --> 01:10:41,108
Is it easy [unclear], what did he say?

1241
01:10:44,348 --> 01:10:47,388
Is it easy to [unclear], what do you say?

1242
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:51,148
I was saying after realization is it possible

1243
01:10:51,348 --> 01:10:54,148
to stop reincarnating

1244
01:10:54,348 --> 01:10:59,148
and to be perfect in these trouble times?

1245
01:10:59,348 --> 01:11:03,148
You are reincarnated by Self realization itself.

1246
01:11:05,348 --> 01:11:07,868
And to stop having rebirth and birth?

1247
01:11:08,068 --> 01:11:10,268
You don't think of these things afterwards.

1248
01:11:11,028 --> 01:11:14,868
Because you are not futuristic anymore. You live in the present.

1249
01:11:18,068 --> 01:11:20,108
You see these ideas of rebirth and

1250
01:11:20,308 --> 01:11:22,948
this frightening staff we should not have rebirth.

1251
01:11:23,188 --> 01:11:24,348
Why not?

1252
01:11:25,988 --> 01:11:30,508
I mean, you create a beautiful house, everything,

1253
01:11:30,988 --> 01:11:33,268
and then you say that you don't live in it?

1254
01:11:35,348 --> 01:11:39,068
When you become a rich man you want to enjoy your wealth isn't it?

1255
01:11:40,268 --> 01:11:43,148
But we are not Buddha's state

1256
01:11:43,348 --> 01:11:46,148
birth is suffering, death is suffering.

1257
01:11:46,348 --> 01:11:49,868
Yes, that's true, but not realization.

1258
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:58,428
You see, what he has said is,

1259
01:11:58,988 --> 01:12:00,508
Buddha has asked you to

1260
01:12:00,988 --> 01:12:03,428
limit your desires

1261
01:12:03,948 --> 01:12:07,108
of ascent. Because people talk of God, once

1262
01:12:07,308 --> 01:12:10,268
they talked of in India when somebody talked of the deities.

1263
01:12:10,468 --> 01:12:13,508
That was a problem, because it became a talk again.

1264
01:12:13,988 --> 01:12:16,228
Then they talked of God,

1265
01:12:16,428 --> 01:12:18,468
God was so that abstract,

1266
01:12:18,908 --> 01:12:21,308
like they said Yehova and other things,

1267
01:12:21,508 --> 01:12:23,508
because they wanted people to,

1268
01:12:24,348 --> 01:12:25,948
get over their

1269
01:12:27,348 --> 01:12:30,508
stuck-up points you see. Nothing worked you see.

1270
01:12:31,988 --> 01:12:33,868
So Buddha said, "All right, let's talk only about

1271
01:12:34,068 --> 01:12:35,948
the Self-realization, nothing else. Not even of God.

1272
01:12:36,148 --> 01:12:37,868
Let's talk of that.

1273
01:12:38,068 --> 01:12:40,988
Let people get to Self realization, then we'll talk about God.

1274
01:12:42,948 --> 01:12:46,268
So He said, "All right. Only Self realization. No God, nothing."

1275
01:12:47,388 --> 01:12:50,988
That was His job. Fix you up with the idea of Self-realization.

1276
01:12:51,988 --> 01:12:53,068
He said, "No question [permitted],

1277
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:55,308
no worship, get your Self realization.

1278
01:12:56,028 --> 01:12:59,468
They are worshipping everything under the sun

1279
01:12:59,948 --> 01:13:01,348
these Buddhists.

1280
01:13:02,348 --> 01:13:04,828
What am I to do?

1281
01:13:07,228 --> 01:13:10,948
So whatever Buddha has said is, everything is re-said

1282
01:13:11,148 --> 01:13:12,348
in Sahaja Yoga.

1283
01:13:16,268 --> 01:13:18,268
"Buddham Sharanam Gachami"

1284
01:13:19,308 --> 01:13:21,428
I surrender myself,

1285
01:13:21,908 --> 01:13:23,148
to the enlightened One.

1286
01:13:23,348 --> 01:13:27,108
The One which is enlightened is your spirit.

1287
01:13:29,188 --> 01:13:31,308
"Sangham Sharanam Gachami"

1288
01:13:31,508 --> 01:13:33,908
I surrender myself to the collectivity.

1289
01:13:34,108 --> 01:13:36,388
Unless and until you are a collectively conscious person,

1290
01:13:36,828 --> 01:13:38,068
how can you surrender?

1291
01:13:40,988 --> 01:13:43,948
Buddha or whatever He said, is not understood before realization.

1292
01:13:44,148 --> 01:13:46,948
You cannot. "Dharmam Sharanam Gachami".

1293
01:13:47,148 --> 01:13:48,428
Is the sustanance within us.

1294
01:13:48,868 --> 01:13:51,228
Sharanam means you become that.

1295
01:13:52,068 --> 01:13:54,828
It's not a mental thing, "Oh, I surrender myself".

1296
01:13:55,028 --> 01:13:56,868
But you just become.

1297
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:02,148
You become the enlightened one.

1298
01:14:02,348 --> 01:14:05,988
You become the collectively conscious, you become [....Dharma]

1299
01:14:06,188 --> 01:14:09,148
the sustanance, the religion. You see, become.

1300
01:14:11,348 --> 01:14:13,148
That's what He wanted.

1301
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:16,468
But for them "Sharanam Gachami" means take a wheel in the hand

1302
01:14:16,948 --> 01:14:19,508
go on "Buddham Sharanam Gachami".

1303
01:14:20,228 --> 01:14:23,508
What this wheel is going to do I just don't understand, you know.

1304
01:14:25,308 --> 01:14:27,828
They'll go on hours together, they'll go mad.

1305
01:14:28,028 --> 01:14:31,188
They will end up into lunatic asylum, beieve Me.

1306
01:14:32,348 --> 01:14:35,388
Or like mad you have to say something, all the time praying.

1307
01:14:35,868 --> 01:14:38,908
Is that the way you are becoming?

1308
01:14:39,348 --> 01:14:42,348
They don't even know where is Buddha placed into yourself.

1309
01:14:48,348 --> 01:14:52,348
But Sahaja Yogis know where He is placed and how to please Him.

1310
01:14:54,028 --> 01:14:55,788
Whatever He said is nothing but Sahaja Yoga,

1311
01:14:55,988 --> 01:14:57,828
absolutely hundred percent.

1312
01:15:04,308 --> 01:15:06,508
Actually Buddha was nobody else

1313
01:15:08,108 --> 01:15:10,908
but an Incarnation, who reincarnated Himself

1314
01:15:11,108 --> 01:15:14,228
as Adi Shankaracharya. You can see, clearly in your being,

1315
01:15:14,428 --> 01:15:16,388
and can be proved on Kundalini again.

1316
01:15:16,828 --> 01:15:18,348
You see, how can I prove it?

1317
01:15:23,348 --> 01:15:26,148
To understand them, first you get your realization.

1318
01:15:26,348 --> 01:15:29,868
Again, I am talking like Buddha only.

1319
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:34,228
He tried something by which

1320
01:15:34,428 --> 01:15:37,148
He thought people will take to realization.

1321
01:15:38,348 --> 01:15:40,268
But human beings as they are...

1322
01:15:41,908 --> 01:15:44,108
He thought they are very much involved in materialism,

1323
01:15:44,308 --> 01:15:47,348
take them out, try this, try that. Nothing works out.

1324
01:15:47,908 --> 01:15:49,268
Nothing.

1325
01:15:50,028 --> 01:15:52,988
Only thing that works out, the real happening, nothing else.

1326
01:16:00,268 --> 01:16:01,308
So you...

1327
01:16:03,348 --> 01:16:04,868
What's it?

1328
01:16:06,348 --> 01:16:08,068
Say it loudly.

1329
01:16:14,148 --> 01:16:15,348
All right?

1330
01:16:19,348 --> 01:16:23,228
Is there somebody else saying something which I didn't hear?

1331
01:16:23,428 --> 01:16:27,268
See, the vibrations are so much that really we were in fact...

1332
01:16:28,308 --> 01:16:29,788
You can't imagine.

1333
01:16:29,988 --> 01:16:32,148
I don't know how I will sleep with what you are talking.

1334
01:16:32,348 --> 01:16:34,948
It's really too much showing out.

1335
01:16:35,148 --> 01:16:37,228
Unbelieving. Why?

1336
01:16:37,428 --> 01:16:40,268
There must be some great seekers who must have come today.
