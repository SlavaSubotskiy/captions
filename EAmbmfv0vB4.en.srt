1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,700
If you discover your inner energy  you will also discover yourself.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,020
You will become a very good, peaceful person.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,400
You will not suffer.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,160
Shri Mataji is an Indian yoga master.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,400
Millions of people deem Her holy.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,000
Among those millions are Americans, English and also Turkish.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,880
Shri Mataji, staying is Swiss Otel, came to the hotel just when it had been seized by Chechen terrorists.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,000
Just at the first minutes of the siege.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,180
Two bullets hit our door.

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,840
We were not worried.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,200
I new that this action would not last long because it was stupid.

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,760
All night we were listening to the music and watching TV.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,880
In any case, nothing happened.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:49,020
Mataji explains the siege as an ordinary event without any excitement.

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:55,000
But a little later we understand that this is Mataji's normal state.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,340
Mataji always speaks as if She has departed from the worldly troubles and has passed to a different dimension.

17
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,200
Maybe this is what influences those who meet Her.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:10,240
With this thought in mind we ask Mataji what does yoga give to the people.

19
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,200
Love, pure love.The secret is just love.

20
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,800
When we told Her that the approach to yoga in Turkey is somehow like a kind of fashion,

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,780
a light smile appears on Her face.

22
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,080
The aim of yoga is to beatify your spirit, not your body.

23
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,400
"Fashion comes and goes but yoga beatifies your spirit and does not take any money."

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,200
According to Her love is the key to everything.

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,180
Well, what is Her approach to love?

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,000
Did you ever fall in love?

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No, I am not that kind, I am not romantic.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,500
Because, if you run just after one person you will restrict yourself.

29
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,600
But if you love the whole world, you will never be disappointed.

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,200
Mataji explains how much She loves Turkey and Turks.

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,600
But, according to Her Turkey has one problem - men.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,360
If you women come forward your problems will be solved easier.

33
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,040
Men consider themselves too clever but one can say they are successful.

34
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,960
According to Shri Mataji, there is one more problem in Turkey -

35
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,020
"You don't know how to make business,

36
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,200
also you don't know how to use money properly.

37
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,000
When such a person of love speaks about money it sounds quite surprising.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,600
And we ask Mataji how does she earn money, how does She spend it?

39
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,400
My husband has always had money, my children too.

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,000
We did not have this kind of difficulty.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,800
Mataji says that She does not need money.

42
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,200
That is why, like in all other places,

43
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,000
She does not take money for Her seminars in Turkey.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,300
Now the turn comes to us to get our realization.

45
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,000
That is to discover our inner energy.

46
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,300
Mataji is working quite long on us.

47
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,500
The energy we take from Her is very positive.

48
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,700
Is it because we really feel lighter or because of Mataji's influence, we don't know.

49
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,000
But we depart from this interesting lady with a smile on our faces.
