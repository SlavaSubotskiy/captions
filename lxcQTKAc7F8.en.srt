00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,440
Public Program The Nabhi Chakra

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,120
New Delhi – India January 31, 1983

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,080
The music was very fine and elevating to all of you.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,760
The effect of music in Sahaja Yoga is tremendous,

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,680
and if a Sahaja Yogi sings the song

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,760
it's so great that it acts like a mantra upon My being.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,000
So I'm very thankful to Mrs. Venogopalan

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,280
for singing such a beautiful song today. It stirred Me completely.

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,320
Then Gavin Brown was very sweet. He's an Englishman, very gentle

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,160
and a very steady Sahaja Yogi.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,920
He's one of the first Western Sahaja Yogis I met.

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,560
Today I will tell you about the Nabhi Chakra which deals

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,400
with this honesty of seeking.

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,040
Nabhi Chakra is the center which controls

15
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,720
or manifests outside in the gross as

16
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:35,200
Solar Plexus. Nabhi Chakra has two sides: one is the left,

17
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,720
another the right, and one in the center.

18
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,520
So on the left hand side is the Gruha Lakshmi,

19
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,440
on the right hand side is the Raja Lakshmi or Gaja Lakshmi

20
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,960
and in the center is the Lakshmi which ascends into Mahalakshmi.

21
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,480
When the seeking starts,

22
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:18,440
a human being first starts seeking food.

23
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,800
Food is very important for all the animals.

24
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,880
If they have no food

25
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,440
then they cannot exist.

26
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,640
So the seeking starts with food,

27
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:46,560
and when the shelter is sought, they try to find the water.

28
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,960
So this center is made of water

29
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:11,320
and in this center resides the Deity of Shri Vishnu or Narayana;

30
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:23,680
and His power, as I told you, is Lakshmi and then Mahalakshmi.

31
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,120
You will find out in Sahaja Yoga

32
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:35,960
that gradually you start developing one power and then the other.

33
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,000
Everyone who comes to Sahaja Yoga, if they are truthful

34
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,520
and not involved with any wrong things,

35
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,200
then definitely they are helped in Lakshmi Tattwa,

36
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,320
means their well-being is looked after.

37
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,480
As Krishna has said, "yogakshema vahaamya."

38
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,440
So He looks after the kshema part of it.

39
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,560
Everyone who has been to Sahaja Yoga

40
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,720
has been helped miraculously

41
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,400
also in the Lakshmi Tattwa, that means materially.

42
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,640
In so many ways they are helped,

43
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,120
that one has to just see for themselves

44
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,520
how these miracles take place.

45
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:31,720
An example is of a villager who had a small little holding of land

46
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:38,560
and he was living hand to mouth every day.

47
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,960
When he came to Me, after some time I found

48
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,960
he would bring one garland,

49
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,640
big garland, for Me every evening.

50
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,040
And he was away in the village every day he would attend My program.

51
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,840
I was quite surprised that how could he afford it, and I asked him,

52
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,680
"How can you afford a garland for Me every day?

53
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,560
You shouldn't bring it, it's not proper."

54
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,520
So he said, "Mother, You know everything."

55
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,160
I said, "Why, what happened?"

56
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,120
He said, "I have a plot of land next to mine

57
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,760
which we never used because it was absolutely a barren land -

58
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:24,840
little bit, not much big land, but a small land, piece of land.

59
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,800
And after Realization I used to always go

60
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,240
walk over it bare feet to plough this little

61
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,680
piece of land that I had.

62
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,080
After some time when I was coming here after that,

63
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,720
one gentleman came to see me and he said that

64
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,080
“This piece of land that you have is very precious.“

65
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,320
I said, “What's the problem?” He said that

66
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:58,960
“I have a kiln of bricks, and I have seen that even

67
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:07,200
by chance – Sahaja - we mixed a little clay from this soil,

68
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,320
from this part of the land that you have,

69
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,480
and we found that our bricks have become so good and so strong

70
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,480
that we would like to purchase this clay from you

71
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,200
at the price of seers."

72
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,520
And that's how he started getting money sufficient for him

73
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,960
and he became much better off.

74
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,320
But in Sahaja Yoga one has to remember you don't go to extremes,

75
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,000
in any principle.

76
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,640
That is one thing people should know, that you don't go to extremes.

77
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,360
You don't become extremely rich.

78
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,880
I've seen those people who are extremely rich,

79
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,520
when they come to Sahaja Yoga, they are a big headache,

80
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,280
very big headache.

81
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,440
If they are sick, if you cure them of their heart trouble,

82
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,520
then they try to possess you.

83
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,960
They will get all the heart patients, they will get

84
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,800
all kinds of patients to you,

85
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,760
you go on tolerating it, they try to possess you.

86
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,120
They immediately start talking about their cures

87
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,040
to everyone, they publish in papers, this thing, that thing,

88
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,880
it's impossible. And they just try to overpower you.

89
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,880
Without any appointment they'll arrive

90
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,840
and they would expect you to attend to them immediately,

91
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,800
it's terrible.

92
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,080
And then they’ll send all their relations for cure

93
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,960
and you have to show all patience,

94
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,120
all their friends, they become like agents.

95
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,720
All their patients, all their relations, all their friends,

96
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,360
they want to oblige them and spare

97
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,480
no love, no affection, nothing further.

98
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,280
The Sahaja Yogis, if they try

99
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,240
to say that “No, you shouldn't do like that and all that,"

100
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,200
they feel insulted.

101
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,920
And they all try curing much faster

102
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,480
than anybody else does.

103
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,680
They themselves are weak, they are sick people themselves,

104
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,800
heart patient, this patient, that,

105
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,400
but if you tell them, “Don't cure,” they'll feel bad.

106
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,080
If you don't tell them, they'll get sick

107
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,120
and you'll have another problem.

108
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,480
They never try to understand Sahaja Yoga in it's big way.

109
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:34,080
They just want to see it according to their own way of ego

110
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,360
that they have accumulated with their money,

111
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,320
and they never know how they go on hurting

112
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,320
everyone by overpowering Me all the time.

113
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,520
It's very amazing, whenever I cure a rich man,

114
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,640
I've been wanting to run away from that person.

115
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,120
I would never go to their house, I would not like to eat in their house.

116
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,360
It's a very bad thing.

117
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,520
So too much of riches is also not okay

118
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,920
because it gives you a tremendous

119
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,680
ego that you don't see yourself,

120
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,440
and anybody tries to say anything protect oneself,

121
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,720
then such a person feels insulted or humiliated.

122
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,680
Not only that, but they try to hold Me and hold the whole thing

123
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,600
according to their business ways which is impossible.

124
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,200
See, they have to gain money,

125
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,680
they have another attitude because they are miserly.

126
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,960
I don't have to earn money or anything.

127
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,920
If I am doing anything, I’m, really, in a way,

128
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,320
I'm obliging. Isn't it?

129
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,760
But they will force on Me all their rules and regulations, everything,

130
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,480
without having their own discipline.

131
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,320
So very rich people in Sahaja Yoga

132
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,640
so far have been extremely troublesome,

133
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,120
I should say, to Me and to the whole organization.

134
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,640
They are very narrow-minded.

135
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,280
They cannot see the big vision that I have before Me.

136
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,560
Whatever little ideas they have about themselves and about their

137
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,200
own thinking, reading, they will try to push onto Sahaja Yoga.

138
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,040
It's not My experience once, but many a times.

139
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,920
Then somehow or other it so happens that they drop out.

140
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,720
So, too much richness gives you a tremendous ego, worse than

141
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,560
even, I would say, a bulldog.

142
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,040
It’s impossible for a rich man to see

143
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,160
that all these riches are outside him. They are not inside him.

144
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,360
He has to be rich in heart to understand compassion.

145
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,840
Compassion doesn't mean that you give alms to others,

146
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,600
or if you give money to others, it's not that.

147
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,680
On the contrary, you just have beggars by doing that.

148
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,640
Compassion is that works,

149
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,920
compassion is that flows,

150
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,200
compassion is that manifests.

151
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,960
It is not in compassion where you can make it materialize it,

152
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,320
“All right, come along I'll give you a hundred rupees.”

153
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,160
On the contrary, giving somebody a hundred rupees is the worst thing.

154
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,960
I have tried this with some Sahaja Yogis who were with Me.

155
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,600
I tried to give them some money some time as they were very poor.

156
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,280
They became horrid.

157
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,720
Some of them started drinking,

158
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,200
some of them took to some other ways and they became

159
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,880
sort of addicted to money. It was impossible.

160
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,960
And they tried to spoil as many Sahaj Yogis as they could.

161
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,400
So such people if they come, it's impossible to manage them.

162
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,840
They are not Sahaja Yogis because they are asahaja.

163
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,440
They are still sticking to the idea that they have so much money,

164
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,080
that they are so rich and they can overpower everyone with money.

165
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,360
Not Me, I'm sorry.

166
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,160
But only thing I feel sorry for them

167
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,400
that they cannot get to God.

168
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,600
There is no honesty of seeking in them,

169
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,640
there is no honesty of seeking.

170
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,760
The elite people whom I have addressed

171
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,360
so many places like this, because

172
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,480
some people whom I have cured wanted Me to address the elite,

173
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,160
so-called. I think they are elated, to Me what they are.

174
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,320
They don't want to be in Sahaja Yoga.

175
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,760
They are already eliminated, I sometimes feel.

176
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,880
Thousands of them I've addressed, I've wasted My time with them.

177
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,080
They are good for nothing, absolutely empty people.

178
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,760
They are very happy because they have a few cars,

179
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,640
or some houses or something like that.

180
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,600
I too have all these things, I would say so-called riches.

181
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,960
I have always seen from My father's side

182
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,120
and from My husband's side.

183
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,360
I don't understand what is there to be proud of this emptiness.

184
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,760
But human beings are such,

185
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,600
a empty vessel makes a big sound,

186
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,200
in the same way, an empty rich man makes a very big sound.

187
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,920
Not that the very poor are also good,

188
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,200
because those who are extremely poor

189
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,680
are busy with their food problems.

190
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,920
They have little, little problems and their values are still have to

191
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,600
come up to a point.

192
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,240
It's only in the middle you can work out Sahaja Yoga better.

193
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,840
Those who are extremely rich and proud

194
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,880
cannot come to Sahaja Yoga easily.

195
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,480
Those who are very poor also cannot come to Sahaja Yoga.

196
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,760
But when this middle part of the river is enriched

197
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,480
and starts flowing well, then it spreads on the sides

198
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,280
and then it can engulf.

199
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,320
But you cannot  start it the other way round. I have tried.

200
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,360
I have tried both ways and I have told you what happened.

201
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,200
Whom I gave money,

202
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,880
whom I tried to help through giving money

203
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,680
became wayward, useless, frivolous people,

204
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,560
got lost to Sahaja Yoga. And those whom

205
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,560
I thought were moneyed and satisfied people

206
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,920
had another role to play is to possess Me all the time,

207
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,720
to use Me all the time whenever they wanted,

208
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,280
for whatever purpose they wanted to use Me.

209
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,760
And they must know, you cannot possess Me, you cannot possess Me,

210
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,600
but this kind of an ignorance still in their minds

211
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,680
is that they can possess God, they can possess everyone.

212
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,920
For such people there are no reasons

213
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,240
to come to Sahaja Yoga, to be very frank.

214
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,200
And even if they come to Sahaja Yog

215
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,080
they have to know that for Mother richness of heart,

216
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,680
understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

217
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,440
humility, non-possessiveness are very important.

218
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,760
In this ascent of yours,

219
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,960
money is not important at all.

220
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,520
Even if you are poor or rich, you get your Realization.

221
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:52,280
For example, I went to Maharashtra, most of them are,

222
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,480
I would say, very poor people in the sense that

223
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,160
they are not middle class at all. They are not educated,

224
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,720
they are sometimes factory workers

225
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,480
or they have small holdings. Not very rich.

226
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,800
But they are very good Sahaja Yogis, excellent Sahaja Yogis.

227
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,960
They have such beautiful eyes

228
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,640
and such beautiful feeling and such compassion

229
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:30,160
that Lakshmi Tattwa is absolutely balanced in them.

230
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,360
You know that Lakshmi is shown to be a lady,

231
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,560
and lady who is a mother.

232
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,400
Mother doesn't care whether you are rich or poor.

233
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,960
If her one son is rich and another is poor,

234
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,680
she'll pay more attention to the poor and ask the rich

235
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,720
to give his money to the poor also.

236
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,280
She is not bothered. If somebody is in need,

237
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,760
she will be the first to help the person who needs.

238
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,440
Now this is a spiritual thing in the spiritual life.

239
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,520
The person who is a real seeker,

240
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:13,080
who is a truthful seeker, the Mother will go out of the way

241
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,480
to be with that person. And those who are not honest about it,

242
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,640
Mother will try somehow or other cut them short.

243
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:32,520
The problem that lies with human beings is

244
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,600
that they do not know what they want.

245
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,000
They think they want first of all money.

246
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,840
But those who have money,

247
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,480
they think they must have power.

248
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,760
If they have too much money, they think that they must go into politics

249
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,760
because they have had no power.

250
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,480
Then they fail in politics,

251
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,720
or say they become too much in politics, whatever it is,

252
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,560
then they want love from their children which they can't get,

253
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,520
because they are too busy or something like that.

254
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,920
So they don't know what they want.

255
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,440
Those who believe that by having money will be better off,

256
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,280
should listen to all these people who have come from affluent countries

257
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,400
and they will tell you how things have gone wrong there,

258
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,920
how people are ruined, what's going wrong with them,

259
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,760
absolutely they are in a bad shape.

260
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,320
You cannot call them human beings

261
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,760
because they are so cruel, they kill even their own children,

262
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,640
and that society tolerates such people.

263
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,520
In India if you hear somebody killing a child,

264
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,880
I have never heard so far in the sixty years of My life,

265
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,120
but supposing you hear someone has killed his daughter or son,

266
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,560
nobody will ever look at that person.

267
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,680
He will not be allowed in the society, nobody will even

268
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,720
give any girl in the marriage to

269
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,840
his daughter or a son. He'll be absolutely barred from the society.

270
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,080
No one can think of such a relationship between children and parents.

271
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,600
And then there are funny relationships also,

272
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,240
it's something so absurd,

273
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,840
on both the sides on cruelty and on morality,

274
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,800
they are so absurd, it's impossible to understand.

275
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,640
So money has given this ego and they say, “What's wrong?

276
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,840
What’s wrong?” It's absolutely malignant attitude.

277
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,880
When you say, “What's wrong?” that means

278
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,800
you do not want to keep your relationship with the whole.

279
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,240
You do not want to keep your relationship

280
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:41,960
with the Primordial One, the One who has you,

281
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,600
everyone within Himself. You are part and parcel of the whole,

282
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,680
and how can you say, “What's wrong? I do what I like.”

283
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,840
You just become like a malignant cell.

284
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,280
So at the Nabhi Chakra one has to know

285
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,120
that one should not hanker after money too much.

286
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,800
Now those who hanker too much after money,

287
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:14,120
may develop their right side better, they may have money, no doubt.

288
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,280
But they miss their left side. Left side is Gruha Lakshmi,

289
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,840
they have no Gruha Lakshmi in their house.

290
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,800
They are very hectic people, they run about,

291
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,960
they run the rat race, they get heart attacks,

292
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,600
if not heart attacks, they will get leukemia,

293
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,920
they'll get diabetes, liver, all such things,

294
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,120
because their attention is on money and not on God.

295
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,080
So either you are on the right or on the left.

296
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,840
Those who are very emotional people,

297
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,640
extremely emotional, more worried about their family;

298
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,680
for them family is everything,

299
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,480
the relations are everything, they are like that,

300
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,000
they may not have so much of Lakshmi because they distribute

301
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,800
all the Lakshmi. But still they are better people.

302
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,320
But sometimes

303
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,720
such people who sacrifice so much for others,

304
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,160
give up everything that they have, can become crazy

305
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,080
because they’ll find people do not reciprocate,

306
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,080
they do not return their love,

307
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,240
they do not understand what they have done.

308
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,760
So going to the extreme of helping others can cause

309
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,680
trouble to the person who does this job, and also trouble to people

310
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,520
who have taken free money from him,

311
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,120
because if you distribute free money to people what will happen?

312
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,160
I'll give you a simple example of America helping India.

313
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,400
When Americans helped India,

314
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,080
they thought they were doing a great favor to Indians,

315
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,760
which was wrong. Because whatever they did

316
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,480
whatever they did was lost in the wilderness.

317
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,880
Nobody tried to maintain it, it was free.

318
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,320
But by giving that they showed the contempt,

319
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,880
and when they gave some wheat and rice to India

320
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,200
there was no grace about it, because

321
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,960
then put some sort of a seed in it

322
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,440
which creted two horrible things in the villages.

323
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,400
One was called as congress grass

324
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,720
because it came from America.

325
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,600
And another was called as a mad acacia.

326
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,680
Babool, as we call it, mad babool.

327
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,120
These trees have grown so much in the villages

328
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,160
that they don't know what to do with them.

329
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,960
They have such big, big thorns that anyone who is stung by them

330
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,040
can even die. They are very poisonous

331
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,240
and if the children get it, they get such poisonous problems

332
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,480
that they cannot be cured.

333
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,440
This is how American government has helped us.

334
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,360
Now who's going to tell them what you have done so ungraciously?

335
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,080
It was better to starve than to get any help from anyone.

336
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,960
Long time back I had said that it is better to starve in this country

337
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,480
than to get any help from these wretched, horrible

338
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,280
Western countries who think no end of themselves.

339
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,280
You just pamper their ego for nothing at all.

340
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,920
What have they got? They have just plastic affluence.

341
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,320
But this ego out of money makes them so stupid

342
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,760
that they don't know what's happening in their own country.

343
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,760
How their country’s going down in every way.

344
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,400
How their people are going down. Either they are in

345
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,040
fear or they are abandoned.

346
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,360
Otherwise they are communist

347
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,640
or they are so-called capitalist

348
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,960
where they are just abandoned.

349
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
If you go and see that country,

350
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,560
I mean you can't sit like this anywhere and talk in the outside,

351
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,840
somebody might come and murder somebody.

352
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,120
If you walk in the dark you can be murdered.

353
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,360
In America, so called advanced country of America, in New York City.

354
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,920
So this kind of riches we are trying to aspire, especially

355
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,720
people in Delhi are very anxious to aspire lot of money.

356
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,480
I don't know why Punjabis, Gujaratis

357
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,560
and Maarwadis have taken to this.

358
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,960
Maarwadis are another style.

359
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,360
How the Punjabis and the Gujaratis

360
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,880
are trying to acquire the money.

361
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,360
And when I see them abroad I

362
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,640
just don't know if they are anywhere near India.

363
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,240
Horrid people they.

364
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,600
They have no culture left in them that is Indian.

365
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,840
They are absolutely outward.

366
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,320
They think no end of themselves,

367
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,160
they think they have reached the heavens.

368
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,480
Then if you see their Nabhi Chakra,

369
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,040
you'll be amazed, all of them suffer from horrible livers,

370
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,800
high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attacks

371
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,320
and they drink like fish, especially Sardargis.

372
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,960
I was surprised who are supposed to be in the name of God,

373
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,360
they drink like fish.

374
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,240
They are very particular about wearing a Puggadi and a Dhari,

375
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
but while drinking they don't mind.

376
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,160
Every Sardargi you go to has a big bar in his house,

377
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,360
where even a lord

378
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,760
does not have because it is regarded as very vulgar in England.

379
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,720
Without learning any aesthetics of that country,

380
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,840
they have become just like a agriculture there is no culture

381
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,480
is the fact,

382
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,920
this is what money has done to them, they have

383
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,560
no respect for themselves.

384
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,080
So this Lakshmi Tattwa is to be balanced.

385
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,840
Same about these Gujaratis who have gone.

386
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,160
Another kind lives here, the Maarwadis.

387
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,480
Less said the better about these horrible Maarwadis.

388
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,440
I don't think anyone of them will ever get Realization

389
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,040
or a place in the Kingdom of God.

390
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,680
They are blood suckers.

391
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,080
They are not human beings. For money's sake, they'll

392
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,520
suck the blood like juice, suck the blood,

393
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,720
and now they had a nice time.

394
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,200
This is not a world for you to seek money.

395
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,280
You have come on this earth as a human being to seek God,

396
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,960
to seek your Spirit, to be one with your Self,

397
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,960
to be in that peaceful place

398
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,840
which is the Kingdom of God, which is the Kingdom of Heaven,

399
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,480
and not to jump into a mire which looks very beautiful

400
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,800
but is not really beautiful.

401
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,640
It's agonizing, it's terrorizing.

402
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,760
People can't sleep if they have too much money,

403
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,760
because they don't know what to do with that.

404
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,400
Here also all those who have got money,

405
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,240
they don't know when the income tax will come on them.

406
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,760
I have solved My income tax problem by having no income at all.

407
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,320
I have no income, no income tax,

408
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,920
so I'm not worried about the Income Tax Commissioner.

409
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,040
He cannot control Me.

410
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,800
Best is not to have more income

411
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,640
that is to be taxed, otherwise you’ll have

412
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,840
to have another income tax

413
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,080
lawyer that My brother is. I told him,

414
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,200
“I don't need you at all, all My life, thank you very much.”

415
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,480
You get so absolutely free,

416
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,840
on top of the world if you have no income.

417
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:58,360
Like if you want to solve your car problem, never learn driving.

418
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:04,680
Somebody drives you down or nothing, you can walk with your feet.

419
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,440
The accumulation of all these nonsensical things

420
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,480
have caused us all this tension, so-called:

421
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,240
“How much we have to pay, what is the income tax,

422
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,640
tomorrow the police is going to come in my house?”

423
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,600
If they come to Me I'll say, “All right,

424
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,200
have everything that you can. Nothing there,

425
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,440
certain bills which I have not paid, that's all.”

426
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,480
Just let them pay.

427
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,000
One has to live with complete freedom in this world.

428
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,880
And to achieve that freedom, one has to know that

429
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,760
the priorities should be all right. If money is your priority,

430
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:52,080
you have it. No, not Me. If you want to give Me money,

431
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,360
“No Sir,” I won't at any cost.

432
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:01,160
You can give Me flowers, this, that, all right, but no money at all.

433
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:07,440
I don't want to know about money at all, it's a headache.

434
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:17,960
In the same way, we do not realize that having relationships -

435
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:24,320
brother, sister or son, this and that - is another big headache.

436
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,160
That doesn't mean that you should start beating them,

437
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:34,200
but people can sell their country for the sake of their children.

438
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,920
It’s a very dangerous thing, horrible,

439
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,520
that kind of an attachment, the mamatva (ownership).

440
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,000
This is my son, finished.

441
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,880
If he's your son then you can murder anyone you feel like,

442
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,560
you can do what you like because he is your son.

443
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,960
He is not somebody's son whom you are murdering?

444
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,240
This mamatva that comes - “My husband.”

445
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,760
Specially our Indian women.

446
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,720
“My husband” immediately starts problem.

447
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:15,920
All this comes out of ignorance. Of course, love has to be there.

448
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,840
But love never gives you attachment,

449
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,800
because it is wise, it is wisdom.

450
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,960
Supposing in a tree the sap of the tree

451
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,320
goes and gets fixed in one fruit because it loves. “It's mine.”

452
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,600
Then what happens to the rest of the tree? It dies

453
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,120
and that fruit also dies.

454
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,240
So this mamatva has to go out.

455
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,160
But by telling it will not go,

456
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,440
by just advising it will not go.

457
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,840
Even if you suffer, I have seen so many people coming to Me,

458
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,760
“My own father deceived me.

459
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,080
My own son deceived me.” I said, “Which one is your own?

460
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,160
The one who deceived you is not your own.”

461
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,400
“My husband.”

462
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,200
There are some ladies who eat My head out of their husbands.

463
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,440
“My husband did this, my husband did this, my husband did this.”

464
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,760
Baba, why don't you hit him hard and finish with it?

465
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,840
But it's so much accepted,

466
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,720
this mamatva, this attachment.

467
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:43,240
Attachment to money, attachment to people, attachment to this

468
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:51,240
is nothing but a hook which hooks you to baser levels.

469
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,800
You have to rise above,

470
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:01,720
and then you really enjoy the beauty of richness.

471
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,040
As I told you the other day, I see all beautiful things.

472
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,760
It's nice I don't possess them.

473
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,560
See now these carpets are spread here.

474
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,960
If they were Mine, I should worry, “Oh God, now

475
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,720
I hope they are not going to be spoilt.

476
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,840
I hope nobody sits on them.

477
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,800
I hope they are insured, so nobody runs away with that.”

478
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,440
But when they don't belong to Me, I'm enjoying them better.

479
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,160
Other people's things is a better idea.

480
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:40,120
This myth carries us to such an extent of stupidity

481
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,880
that sometimes I feel whether these human beings are human beings,

482
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,760
or they are their possessions.

483
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,840
Their Spirit is lost,

484
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,120
everything is lost, they're not bothered.

485
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,960
But if their little position is lost, they weep and wail,

486
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:07,240
as if they are dead, their forefathers are dead hundred times.

487
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,880
But people like Me are just batchas, emperors.

488
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:22,520
They are not bothered. To them comfort cannot capture,

489
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:27,040
they don’t need any comfort. If you have comfort

490
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,520
it crawls upon you, it makes you a slave, too.

491
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,400
If you seek comfort you are in for enslavement,

492
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,120
take it from Me. Any kind of comfort.

493
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,560
It's only human beings who can become really so crazy.

494
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,280
No animal can become. There is another type of a comfort,

495
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,760
is that a mental idea

496
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,400
that everybody must appreciate,

497
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,120
and that you should be able to overpower others.

498
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,240
This also comes I think from Nabhi Chakra.

499
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,040
Is a kind of a feeling

500
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,640
that you should be able to overpower many people,

501
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,960
they should look at you.

502
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,440
These days in London there are women who are suffering from

503
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,840
a funny disease called anorexia, where they just don't eat.

504
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,560
Women just don't eat because they should be thin and skinny.

505
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,520
For what? For what you should be thin and skinny?

506
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,560
Because you look attractive, but for what?

507
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,680
I don't think skinny people look attractive by any chance.

508
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,800
Horrible they are. They create only pity

509
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,880
and you feel you know repulsive about the whole stuff.

510
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,400
Once a beauty queen came to see Me.

511
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,080
I thought she was a T.B. patient.

512
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,200
And I said, “You look all right but

513
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400
it seems you are a T.B. patient.”

514
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,680
She said, “No Mother, I've got a beauty prize.” “Yes?

515
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,400
Who were the people? Doctors must have given it

516
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,760
because they want some patients there.”

517
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,440
This is the trouble,

518
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,400
we go out of the way to trouble our Nabhi,

519
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,600
not to eat your food, fasting.

520
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,600
If you want to fast this life, next life you will not have any food.

521
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,720
Thank you very much. No food.

522
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,320
Fasting? All right,

523
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,080
you’ll have a permanent fasting. What do you say?

524
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,480
You don't have to do any fasting. Why do you want to fast?

525
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,560
And even if you want to fast

526
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,480
because you want to change the timing or maybe

527
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,240
for your health's sake, it's all right.

528
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,320
But why in the name of God you want to malign Me?

529
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,320
You have got everything to eat and you don’t want to eat.

530
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,800
Those who have got food to eat, they don’t want to eat.

531
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:59,040
Next life they become poor and then they blame the rich.

532
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,960
But in last life you'd been wanted to fast,

533
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:08,680
so this life you are not given any food, because you asked for it.

534
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,400
And that is how also the Nabhi Chakra gets you twisted,

535
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,800
when you fast like mad.

536
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,960
There is no need to fast in the name of God.

537
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:24,520
God has given you all the wealth, all the beauty,

538
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,240
all the love. Actually in Sahaja Yoga

539
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,760
if you fast in My name, I think it's horrible

540
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,120
because if you want to trouble your Mother

541
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,240
or to make Her uneasy, or to take a revenge on Her,

542
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,360
then you say, “Mother, I'm not going to eat my food.”

543
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,520
Then Mother is finished. That's the best way to conquer Her.

544
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,440
To say, “Mother I'm not going to eat my food.”

545
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,720
So this kind of a mad fasting

546
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,880
is also very bad for your Nabhi and when you do that

547
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,880
then you have a problem because you are invaded

548
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,880
by your left-sided, what you call, beyond

549
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,880
the Ida Nadi, you have the collective subconscious;

550
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,520
and you are invaded by them.

551
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:20,880
And you are in for trouble, physically, mentally, emotionally.

552
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,640
And mostly those people who fast are very hot tempered.

553
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,840
The day they are fasting day is there, never go near them.

554
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,280
Because they are already planning what they are going to eat.

555
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,480
And in the morning they plan and they don't get it,

556
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,160
so they are very angry for that part.

557
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,200
All these asahaja things are not going to help you.

558
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,760
You have to be normal people.

559
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,320
You don't have to put up into tension yourself for Sahaja Yoga,

560
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,760
Nothing. Be normal. Be nice people.

561
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,560
Don't torture yourself.

562
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,560
That is one point on the Nabhi on the left hand side

563
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,040
and on the right hand side: don't get into indulgences.

564
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Don't pamper yourself.

565
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,680
Both things are the same for Sahaja Yoga.

566
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:16,240
Whether you starve or you overeat, is the same.

567
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,880
There is no difference between the two,

568
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,640
because if you are not on the seat,

569
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,920
whether you are on the left

570
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,560
falling on the right, does it make any difference?

571
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,960
So to be on the seat is to be

572
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,560
in the blessings of Shri Lakshmi.

573
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,760
And I have described to you how Shri Lakshmi is a lady

574
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,800
and in Her left hand She has got two lotuses and the right,

575
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:50,240
one lotus, and right hand another lotus on top, which shows a person

576
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,800
who is balancing. She’s balancing on a lotus.

577
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,360
Imagine. She’s standing on a lotus. That means She is balancing.

578
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,400
And She’s balancing, She’s standing there

579
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,520
and She is holding two lotuses in Her hand showing

580
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,120
that She’s like a lotus.

581
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,440
A person who is a rich man, Lakshmi Pati,

582
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,520
has to be like a lotus, warm, pink, warm.

583
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,320
And even a horrible thing, like

584
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,400
wasp-like thing. I don’t know what you call it in English,

585
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,200
you don’t have that black thing.

586
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,200
We have a very black wasp, you see, which is hard,

587
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,920
hard like nut and has angular thorny legs.

588
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,280
That black thing comes in

589
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,680
and is good for nothing, but it comes in

590
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,240
for the residence, for the ashraya,

591
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,400
the lotus keeps it

592
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,040
on top of it’s corolla, which is a very, very soft thing,

593
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,720
with all love.

594
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,960
And in the night it closes down so that

595
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,120
the poor insect who is just like a nut

596
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,120
should not get any trouble from the outside weather.

597
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:29,360
Like a mother who takes the child in the armchair,

598
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,040
that love should be there for a Lakshmi Pati.

599
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,320
How many are Lakshmi Pati’s like that? Have you seen any?

600
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,240
If they see somebody who is coming with money propositions,

601
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
then they may open their doors.

602
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,000
Otherwise, they have no love for anybody.

603
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:54,800
For those who come for their ashrayas, for their help,

604
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,560
they are not there.

605
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,680
On the other side are the people

606
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:11,640
who are so repulsive. They are not like lotus.

607
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,720
There is no fragrance. They are such miserly people

608
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,280
that they stink of miserliness.

609
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,120
While the lotus gives its fragrance

610
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,520
through that mud, to that horrible thing

611
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:36,520
that even the little worms which crawl upon

612
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:44,640
those lotus petals smell of this beautiful fragrance.

613
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,440
This is what it has to be. It has to give.

614
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,640
It has to be beautiful. It has to be cozy.

615
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,960
It has to be welcoming.

616
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,440
Then another hand is giving.

617
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,360
The Lakshmi is always giving. She doesn’t receive;

618
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,240
She just gives.

619
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,200
If you are really a Lakshmi Pati

620
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,320
you don’t want to have anything from anyone. You don’t receive.

621
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,760
If you are really rich, who can enrich you more?

622
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:21,320
What can you give to a person who is fully rich? There is no

623
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,600
way of entering into it now it’s all up to the brim.

624
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,200
He’s rich up to the brim. Then what will you give?

625
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,120
You cannot give anything.

626
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,880
But where you have to give means that he’s a beggar –

627
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,920
he’s still a beggar.

628
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,960
All of these so-called rich people who still are hankering money

629
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,240
are still beggars, they are not rich.

630
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,840
They may think themselves. Empty vessels, but they are not rich

631
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,360
because they are still expecting money.

632
00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:01,760
So, it is important that we should understand,

633
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,520
the money is not the way.

634
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,880
Money takes us away from dharma.

635
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,640
It takes us away from God. It takes us away from reality.

636
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,160
It covers our eyes. We don’t think

637
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,560
that we have to follow a path of righteousness and of virtue

638
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,480
because we think we are rich, God is going to be afraid of us.

639
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,960
We can even purchase Him and can

640
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,000
manage Him by giving some bribes.

641
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,720
That’s not so.

642
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,600
You must face yourself. You have to face yourself.

643
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:42,320
That it’s not the money that’s going to give you that elation,

644
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:51,280
that higher life, but it is the love of God,

645
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,720
the honesty of seeking, honesty.

646
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,400
That is the quality of this chakra is the Satya,

647
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,720
Vishnu, is the Satya.

648
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,560
He’s the Narayana. Narayana means Satya.

649
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,600
So there cannot be Satya Narayan, isn’t it?

650
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,960
Narayan is Satya, then how can there be Satya Narayan?

651
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,280
But we have many Satya Narayana Pujas.

652
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,080
For all these Satya Narayanas, Sahaja Yogis are not supposed to go.

653
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,960
They can only go to Narayana Puja

654
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,840
because Satya Narayana is that path which is added to it

655
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,560
for camouflaging, is meant for these

656
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,760
horrible Brahmins who make you pay. For what?

657
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,560
Sahaja Yogis are not allowed to go to Satya Narayana Puja.

658
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,200
They can have Narayana Puja.

659
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,520
And what is Narayana ultimately becomes?

660
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,720
In the Nabhi Chakra

661
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:01,360
Narayana existed since He was created by the Devi.

662
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,960
And It looks after

663
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,120
the seeking, the nourishing of the seeking like a father,

664
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,920
and then It incarnates again and then It incarnates again

665
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,600
to help our seeking to a higher position and a higher position

666
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:28,200
till it reaches a point where you start seeking God Almighty.

667
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:33,640
Then you jump into the Shakti of Mahalakshmi.

668
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,360
Then you are in the hands of Mahalakshmi Shakti.

669
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:43,400
Means Lakshmi evolves into Mahalakshmi principle.

670
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,840
Now this Mahalakshmi principle resides

671
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,080
in the central path of Sushumna.

672
00:45:55,120 --> 00:46:04,440
And this central path of Sushumna is to be established fully

673
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,120
and awakened when the Kundalini rises.

674
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,400
When the Kundalini does not rise,

675
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,840
this path is kept absolutely black.

676
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,800
It is absolutely black, there is nothing in it

677
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,560
except for the deities

678
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:27,280
who are lying without any light.

679
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:32,920
When the Kundalini rises, then only these deities get awakened

680
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,800
and when they get awakened this Sushumna path,

681
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:44,400
this central path of Mahalakshmi starts acting

682
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:50,480
as the balancing power, to begin with at the Nabhi chakra.

683
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,440
So Nabhi Chakra is surrounded by ten Gurus, the Prophets

684
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,360
who give you the balance,

685
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:03,320
who come on this earth again and again to give you balance in life.

686
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,200
They tell you, “don’t do this, don’t do that.”

687
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,640
But we don’t listen, we don’t accept it. We may say

688
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,240
that we follow such guru, such guru. Like,

689
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,280
you know Muslims are. They say, “We follow Mohammed Sahib.”

690
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,240
Now if Mohammed Sahib has said

691
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,360
anything it is that don’t drink, is the thing he said.

692
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,560
But I’ve yet to come across a Muslim who doesn’t drink.

693
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,000
They may not drink in Riyad because they’ll be killed there.

694
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,040
But if they come to London, they drink.

695
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,640
Actually, when My husband went to Saudi Arabia they said,

696
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,960
“You are the only Muslim we have ever come across.”

697
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,280
It’s true.

698
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,880
Whatever is said to them, they do just the opposite of that.

699
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,720
At that time there were no cigarettes, no tobaccos,

700
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,440
so He didn’t say about that so they have found a loophole.

701
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,040
Muslims smoke, doesn’t matter, because Mohammed Sahib never said.

702
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,440
Mohammed Sahib had to take another birth

703
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,840
to come as Guru Nanaka to tell them, “Oh, God.

704
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,960
Now you are smoking this horrible thing has come,

705
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,320
now you don’t smoke.”

706
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,800
But who will accept that Nanaka

707
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,880
and Mohammed Sahib were the same people?

708
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:20,040
No difference. Same thing it was. We can prove it in Sahaja Yoga.

709
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,720
We can prove it, how important it is that we should know

710
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,960
that they were all the same,

711
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,760
and that they stood for the same thing, but at a period.

712
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,520
Now today you have got ganja,

713
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,200
I don’t know the names also of all these things what you

714
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,560
drink and smoke, God knows what.

715
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,320
Human beings are really clever

716
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,360
to get everything that can destroy you. It's like,

717
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,880
call a bull, “come and hit me.” It's like that. If there’s

718
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,360
then you’ll like ask a buffalo, “come and hit me.”

719
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,440
Now there's no buffalo, all right,

720
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,960
you ask an elephant, “come and stampede me.” It's like that.

721
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,040
Human beings are so stupid.

722
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,480
So now supposing, I say

723
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,720
if I write down a list of all the thing you drink and smoke,

724
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,160
I don't know how many things there are in this world,

725
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,840
then you'll find out the third thing when I die,

726
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,600
that “Mataji didn't say this one.” So we should do it.

727
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:18,600
Very intelligent. All the time destroying your central path,

728
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,120
and nicely managing through that.

729
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:26,480
Is this the way are you going to go to God by any chance?

730
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,560
Is this the way are you following

731
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,720
the great incarnations who came on this earth?

732
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,640
So the balancing comes through Nabhi

733
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:45,720
and Nabhi looks after you and teaches you how to behave.

734
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:51,360
For example, now your left Nabhi is Gruha Lakshmi.

735
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,400
Gruha Lakshmi is the Deity of the household.

736
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:00,040
But if you have too much outward type, you're running a madness.

737
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,760
So early in the morning you get up, read the newspapers.

738
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,720
Is against Sahaja Yoga again.

739
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,280
Not to read newspapers in the morning time.

740
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,200
You can read it in the night,

741
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,960
but not in the morning. Because if you read it in the morning,

742
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,840
you'll get upset.

743
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:20,840
And poor this spleen has to pour in more red blood corpuscles

744
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,160
and it becomes mad and fails you.

745
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,760
On the contrary, in the morning talk to your wife,

746
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,880
talk to your children, look after your Gruha Lakshmi Tattwa.

747
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,280
The wife also has to be a Gruha Lakshmi as I told you.

748
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,120
Then you have your food properly.

749
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,840
Sit down and eat properly.

750
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,920
But no, just after that, upsetting that Nabhi,

751
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,720
you jump into your car,

752
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,720
taking your breakfast in your hand, eating on the way,

753
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,560
honking at people, getting angry with them,

754
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,840
the wife is calling, “Come along you have your breakfast!”

755
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:00,080
Nothing doing. You are on your way on a special work,

756
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,240
you end up with leukemia at least, minimum of minimum,

757
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,440
if not with heart attack.

758
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:14,080
Leukemia comes from left Nabhi, when your Gruha Lakshmi is ruined.

759
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,080
The Deity of Gruha Lakshmi is Fatimabai,

760
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,320
the daughter of Mohammed Sahib,

761
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:31,160
while the sister

762
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:39,120
of Nanak Sahib is on the left Vishuddhi. You'll see that.

763
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,920
Nanaki.

764
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:47,080
Now this aspect of life we never think about.

765
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,520
When you get leukemia, then you'll come to Mother, “please cure me.”

766
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,160
And if you are rich, you will see to it that I cure that person.

767
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,000
If I don't cure you will sit on My head.

768
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,720
You'll be in ten times on My head

769
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,720
unless and until I cure your leukemia.

770
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,480
But if I tell you, “My son, you take it easy,

771
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,080
life is not for getting wretchedness out of you.

772
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,240
What have you gained out of all this running about?

773
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,240
Nothing. But this horrible left Nabhi

774
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,480
by which you are suffering, your family people are suffering.

775
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,200
Only person who has gained is the doctor

776
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,720
or the doctors or the hospitals.”

777
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,240
They won't listen.

778
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,280
And you know leukemia is such a fast developing disease of cancer

779
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,360
that one can pass out within one month,

780
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,600
doctors will tell you,

781
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,960
at the most you'll live for one month, that's all.

782
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,680
They'll take all the money to give this certificate, very nicely.

783
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,600
But why have that?

784
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,960
Be patient with yourself.

785
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,680
Be kind to your Nabhi, look after your Gruha Lakshmi.

786
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,880
All kinds of diseases of the stomach

787
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,800
come from this imbalance this way or that way.

788
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,160
All these great gurus came on this earth

789
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,400
to give us balance, to teach us balance and tell us,

790
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:11,440
“Don't do this and don't do that.” All the Ten Commandments.

791
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:16,880
But to us these Ten Commandment have no meaning.

792
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,760
Now I’ll touch a point which is very important today

793
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,080
for you people to understand

794
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,400
about non-vegetarianism and vegetarianism.

795
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,000
Because this subject I wanted to handle,

796
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:34,040
because if they are vegetarians they can’t bear to see

797
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,880
that Mother says it doesn't matter if you are a non-vegetarian,

798
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,880
because it doesn’t go against your awareness. It does not.

799
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,960
But drinking does.

800
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,960
Drinking does go against your awareness.

801
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,840
But not eating meat or not eating meat.

802
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,120
But one has to understand.

803
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,440
Now somebody told Me that in Gita it is written that

804
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:04,480
those who eat meat are Tamo Gunis.

805
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,400
I am surprised at Gita itself.

806
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:11,880
Because Shri Krishna Himself in the very beginning,

807
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:17,480
has told Arjuna that you should go all out to kill all these people,

808
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,400
even your relations, kill, actually kill human beings.

809
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,600
Your relations and your guru also is to be killed,

810
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,520
because I have already killed.

811
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,920
Nothing is going to be killed by you

812
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,240
because they are already killed.

813
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:38,640
And He gives so many explanations that it should not be done,

814
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:42,200
but He said, “No, I tell you, you have to go and kill.

815
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,600
Surrender yourself to Me and I'll take care of them.”

816
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,440
So how did He preach this, I just don’t understand, in Gita.

817
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,760
Now this seems to be a new introduction

818
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,960
that the people who eat (meat) are Tamo Gunis. They are not,

819
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:58,160
they are never. They are Rajo Gunis.

820
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:02,440
If you eat meat you become Rajo Gunis not Tamo Gunis.

821
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,960
Tamo Gunis are the people who eat carbohydrates,

822
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,920
we have seen it in Sahaja Yoga.

823
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,880
We have two types of diseases,

824
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:14,320
one is lethargic organs and one is active organs.

825
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:22,880
So those who are lethargic having too much carbohydrates

826
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:28,400
and those who are overactive are having too much proteins in them.

827
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,520
I mean if you take proteins, in the science, scientifically,

828
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:37,520
will you become lethargic? I mean ask any doctor.

829
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,720
And then the doctor says Gita is all humbug

830
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,960
because it doesn't understand what it is saying.

831
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,680
And while you say like this that “We must follow Gita.”

832
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,960
I think somebody has gone wrong there

833
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,600
and has written something wrong in Gita

834
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,960
as they have written in Bible, they have written in every book.

835
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,560
I'll tell you what they have written wrong in

836
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,480
Bible later on when it comes to Christ.

837
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,040
I think just some people have put it there for oppose.

838
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,800
If you eat too much meat you get Raj Gunis

839
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,720
and Raj Gunis become as I have told you right-sided people,

840
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,440
become very aggressive

841
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,320
and they become ahamkaris and they can harm.

842
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,800
But the people who just eat grass can become

843
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,840
lethargic, absolutely lethargic.

844
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,440
They will have lethargic heart if not active one,

845
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,560
they will also get heart attack.

846
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,240
They will have lethargic intestines by which they will get

847
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,800
tremendous all the time passing out of the stools,

848
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,960
they'll never be able to digest any food,

849
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,120
they'll be very weak people.

850
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:41,560
So those people who have a lethargic heart or a lethargic

851
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:51,560
liver or lethargic intestines should take to proteins.

852
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,840
I'm not saying meats, but proteins.

853
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,320
But a vegetarian doesn't take so much proteins.

854
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,360
It's easier to take meat, there's no harm.

855
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,880
But those who are active people should take

856
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,640
more to vegetables. It’s sensible.

857
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,280
Guru Nanaka ate all the meats, was he a bad man?

858
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:17,920
These Maarwadis who are supposed to be absolutely abstaining

859
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,360
from even from lahasoon (garlic) and pyaj (onion).

860
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,720
Was He worse than them by any chance?

861
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,920
What about Buddha, Himself? He ate meat

862
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:32,160
because He died of eating raw meat, Himself.

863
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,640
Only thing you should not eat the meat

864
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,640
of animals which are bigger than you,

865
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,680
and not of a cow which is an Indian cow.

866
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,320
Specially Indian cow.

867
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,200
Also bigger cows are not good

868
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,480
because they give you a problem on the teeth.

869
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:54,960
But smaller animals, even with Jainism

870
00:57:55,120 --> 00:58:03,800
they said that you must save the bullocks, the cows,

871
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,520
and you must save other animals,

872
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,120
but they never said you must save goats

873
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,240
and you must save chickens.

874
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:18,080
Because Mahavira knew we cannot give Realization to chickens.

875
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,760
What is the use of saving chickens and mosquitoes

876
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,520
and also bugs?

877
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,360
Of course they are doing like that.

878
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,760
Some Jain people save bugs and

879
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:36,520
put it on a human being, and they take the blood of those

880
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,960
human beings and they are paid for it.

881
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,760
It's absurd but they do it.

882
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,000
For them bugs are more important than human beings.

883
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:49,640
Billions and billions of bugs cannot make a human being.

884
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,440
All these absurd ideas we have in this country.

885
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,640
So when I say you are not to be a vegetarian

886
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,960
or non-vegetarian, you have to see what you need and eat that.

887
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:07,320
But all the time your attention is in food itself is wrong.

888
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:13,040
So there is no good in you people

889
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,960
getting into these problems of vegetarianism and non-vegetarianism.

890
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,160
Of course in the Western countries people should take

891
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:25,880
to vegetarian food, not absolutely, but more than what they have,

892
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,280
while the people who are in India who are vegetarians

893
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,400
will have to later on take to meat. Otherwise

894
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,240
they will have lethargic heart.

895
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,720
I’ll cure them once again they will have problem,

896
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:40,360
then they will have to go for a by-pass. Save money there?

897
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:45,280
You cannot. You will have lethargic intestines,

898
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:52,040
then you will have lethargic liver. You will have all kinds of

899
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,120
cirrhosis, or maybe on the hand you might get

900
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:02,320
all kinds of rashes and things like that, allergies,

901
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,960
all these problems will come. And then ultimately such people

902
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,120
look so peaceful because you see, they are like cabbages.

903
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:17,360
Yes. If somebody is like a cabbage

904
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,840
then how do you give him Realization?

905
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,040
You can't give Realization to cabbages can you?

906
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,120
We have to have here chivalrous people,

907
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,560
brave people, warriors.

908
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:33,640
You have to fight the evil forces, and what can

909
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:39,480
these people who are cabbages going to do for it?

910
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:49,080
One has to understand yatharth, the reality

911
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:54,680
and not put your conception. Because you are born in a Jain family

912
01:00:54,840 --> 01:01:03,600
and that's why you want everybody to eat grass, is wrong , is wrong.

913
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:09,080
The one who has to eat protein must eat protein.

914
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,960
Now what is the food for Sattvic people?

915
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,400
That one should eat. You can’t live with it.

916
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:20,120
So what I eat? Channa.

917
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,840
Can you live with channa? Is protein.

918
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,600
Channa, or you can eat meat.

919
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:33,120
But not very heavy meats, lean meats and ghee,

920
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:46,480
and what I eat the most is honey.

921
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:54,320
That's My food. Honey I eat, you know that, honey I drink.

922
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:59,800
That's. But you can't live with that can you?

923
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,120
So you have to eat little carbohydrates. Doesn't matter,

924
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:08,120
but you balance yourself in Nabhi Chakra

925
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:13,680
But there should be no attention on food at all.

926
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,280
Actually if you ask Me what I ate

927
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,960
in the morning, I won't be able to tell you.

928
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,080
Really I'm very bad

929
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,840
because I have no attention on it.

930
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,360
Whatever one gets, eat it, and you don't feel like eating, don't eat.

931
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:31,520
What's so important is to enjoy every moment of your life.

932
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,920
If a person is finicky about food, specially Indians are,

933
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:37,640
is very dangerous for Nabhi Chakra.

934
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:41,280
Because those who are mad after food

935
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,640
and about Nabhi Chakra

936
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,080
are extremely hot-tempered, I think and...

937
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,320
I don’t know the word in English is but in

938
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,560
Hindi we call it chichode,

939
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:01,960
irritable, irritable, and these chichode

940
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,160
will make their wives’ lives miserable.

941
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:08,800
They will come and tell, “In that house I ate very good curry nuts.”

942
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,800
So that poor lady is running after the curry nuts.

943
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:15,240
We Indians are so much food-minded.

944
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,800
You can't imagine, they won't believe we are supposed to be

945
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,440
starving people.

946
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,080
But we are so food-minded

947
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,440
that once there was for these Bengalis,

948
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,600
supposed to be Mukha Bengalis, I must tell you about them.

949
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,680
They had raw fish, raw fish which they get it from the Central India

950
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,800
and people couldn't get fish so they were starving.

951
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,040
So Bombay people very graciously sent one shipload,

952
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,640
because I know that, I was part of it,

953
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:45,520
to them as a gracious act that let the Bengalis eat the fish.

954
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,680
They said, “What? We are not going to eat sea fish,

955
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:51,200
we are Bangladeshis.”

956
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,800
Threw all the fishes in the sea.

957
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:57,080
It all become sardana (rotten) and it was thrown into the sea.

958
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,720
Can you imagine? Nobody will believe in the West,

959
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,000
this is how we are fasting and

960
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,800
that is how we are poor people.

961
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:09,600
Can poor people afford to throw away one shipload of fish

962
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:14,280
in the sea because they want raw fish?

963
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:21,240
We are so food-minded that our Nabhis are always like this.

964
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,040
And our women are to be blamed because

965
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:28,520
they know to control their husbands, they are spoilt them.

966
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,360
The job of a woman is to be a Gruha Lakshmi.

967
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,040
To have ideals before the family,

968
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,320
ideals before a husband,

969
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,920
ideals before the children.

970
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,720
The house should be ideal,

971
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:49,640
should be a warm house where everybody's welcome.

972
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:53,040
The wife’s job is to keep her Nabhi all right,

973
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,400
the Nabhi of the children all right and the Nabhi of the husband

974
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:00,280
and Nabhi of all the people who come to her house.

975
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,360
She has to lead a life of auspiciousness,

976
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:07,920
of kindliness, of religious nature.

977
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:11,760
She has to be a soft-natured woman.

978
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,560
But this is all missing, only thing she is worried with,

979
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,480
how to please the husbands.

980
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,560
Because that's one of the big jobs for her.

981
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,720
So to keep our Nabhi all right

982
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,480
we have to understand as Sahaja Yogis

983
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:33,440
that we have not to pay so much attention to food.

984
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:38,320
That doesn't mean you eat all dirty food.

985
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,520
But it definitely means that when you eat your food,

986
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,600
you must see the vibrations of the food.

987
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,280
You must always give vibrations to the food.

988
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,240
Eat the food which is vibrated.

989
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,440
Certain foods, now supposing if

990
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:57,240
I have to go and eat in any one of these big five star hotels,

991
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,920
next moment I vomit, I always vomit.

992
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,600
If somebody invites Me in a hotel,

993
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,960
I start thinking, ‘Baba, now what an ordeal.’

994
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:09,600
Because it is not cooked with love.

995
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:14,120
That's what it says [Marathi],

996
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:18,600
“He likes the little berries of Shabari.”

997
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:25,360
[ Marathi]

998
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,520
Was does that mean?  That means the love

999
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:39,200
that is expressed in that food

1000
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,520
is what we should care for,

1001
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:51,600
and not for the lavishness, not for the show of it

1002
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:55,200
and not at all for your own taste,

1003
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,440
but the taste of food should be

1004
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:03,240
that it should carry love. Let your tongue feel the love.

1005
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,520
That is the best taste,

1006
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:13,760
and whatever is cooked with love always tastes very well.

1007
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:20,160
So when you cook, cook with love.

1008
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:23,720
When you eat, eat with love.

1009
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:28,680
With kind words to the person who has cooked with love

1010
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,720
and above all, count your blessings,

1011
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,520
count your blessings,

1012
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:43,000
and think of others who may not have had food today.

1013
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,160
This is the Lakshmi Tattwa, is where the hand is like this,

1014
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,840
where it gives and there's a hand

1015
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,400
where it gives protection to people who need money.

1016
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,160
But not in a way we do it,

1017
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,560
the way Americans do or Russians do it. We do the way

1018
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,200
Lakshmi does,

1019
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:05,400
that this protection does not get out of hand.

1020
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,760
You give it without telling anyone.

1021
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,280
Just because you have to give you give,

1022
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,280
and actually you do that.

1023
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:15,960
If you have given, as My father said, one rupee to someone,

1024
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:19,720
run away from that person as soon as possible

1025
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,600
with the speed of one mile, he said.

1026
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,640
But if you have given

1027
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:29,680
five rupees, run away from him at the speed of 500 miles.

1028
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,360
It's very practical.

1029
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,440
That is how we have to give.

1030
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,680
This is the Lakshmi Tattwa,

1031
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:41,160
is the Nabhi Chakra about which I have told you.

1032
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:44,840
It's a very important Chakra,

1033
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:51,040
because today you are here, because in your Chakra,

1034
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,960
Mahalakshmi Tattwa was awakened

1035
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,920
because you wanted to seek God.

1036
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,960
Because you wanted to come to God.

1037
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:03,520
You have not come here for money.

1038
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:08,080
You have not come here for anything else but God.

1039
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,520
Your seeking is in God.

1040
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,960
You want to know the truth about God

1041
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,360
and you want to have God.

1042
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,040
You don't want to put your ideas on to this,

1043
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,920
but you want to see how Mother wants

1044
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,080
us to receive the blessings of God.

1045
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:30,160
So become that as we seek the love of God,

1046
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,720
the grace of God.

1047
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:38,960
The Lakshmi has to be gracious and the Mahalakshmi

1048
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:45,280
is the One who is the gracious lady, is the graciousness in you.

1049
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:50,280
The grace that must come evolved into your personality.

1050
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:54,280
Within that grace he feels the hankering of the Father.

1051
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:59,600
The Father, the Narayana. He wants to have His blessings,

1052
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,200
and that is how the first, the truth,

1053
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,840
the seeking of the truth rises in you,

1054
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,120
and that is how the honesty of seeking is blessed

1055
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,480
when the Kundalini rises.

1056
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:15,280
She first gives you - first thing that you get

1057
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:20,360
is the truth, by enlightening your brain.

1058
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,840
When I will tell you about Sahasrara

1059
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:30,560
and about Agnya, I will tell you how this brain becomes

1060
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,920
a receptor of the ultimate truth,

1061
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,600
how truth is spread, you start

1062
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,280
receiving the knowledge of absolute truth.

1063
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,040
How this brain when enlightened

1064
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:54,920
gives you the power to know what is truth and what is not truth,

1065
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,680
and there are no alternatives.

1066
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,400
This I'll tell you later on

1067
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,960
when the Kundalini I'll describe at the brain level.

1068
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:10,960
But for today I think Nabhi Chakra is very important.

1069
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:14,080
For all of us, for India specially,

1070
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,080
our Nabhi Chakra is very important,

1071
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,640
that we should know that God Almighty,

1072
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:24,760
the Narayana, the Vishnu,

1073
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:29,880
is the One who gives the kshema after Yoga.

1074
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,200
He says, “Yoga Kshema Mahatmyam,” He gives the kshema.

1075
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,960
And we are sinning against the God

1076
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:41,400
when we don't believe that honest and

1077
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:45,240
righteous and virtuous life will give us the kshema

1078
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,400
as promised by God Almighty.

1079
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:51,840
You are sinning against our Father, while in the West

1080
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,320
they are sinning against the Mother

1081
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,360
on the left hand side,

1082
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:00,880
because they have forgotten that immoral life

1083
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,120
is an insult to the Mother Power of God.

1084
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,640
So both things are important,

1085
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:11,320
whether in the West or East, is important

1086
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:16,360
that we should not sin against the Father and sin against the Mother.

1087
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,200
I hope I've tried to tell you everything

1088
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,720
in such a way that you do not feel hurt.

1089
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,640
Because all of you come from different, different

1090
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:30,040
types of lives; different, different conceptions;

1091
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:34,840
different, different gurus, and you can get confused about it.

1092
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:38,040
So, in Sahaja Yoga you should

1093
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,560
allow this to work out.

1094
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:44,760
Allow the light to come in and don't get confused, don't get upset.

1095
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,360
Here you are to seek God

1096
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:50,480
and not to sit on what you have known so far,

1097
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,840
or which you have heard so far, or whatever you have followed.

1098
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:58,200
Because that has not given you anything whatsoever.

1099
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:03,600
Like one of My disciples who's a big officer

1100
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,960
and one day he told Me, “Mother,

1101
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,880
I don't know about Gita,

1102
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,840
I don't know about Ramana, Krishna, anyone.

1103
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:16,760
I know You, because You are the One who has given me Realization.”

1104
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:22,880
Of course after knowing Me you will know all of them.

1105
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,280
But it is better you know Me now, because

1106
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:28,360
Those are no more here. It is I Who is sitting here,

1107
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,240
so better know Me first,

1108
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,680
and then you will know Them better

1109
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,200
than what you have known Them before.

1110
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:38,080
So let us compromise in this point:

1111
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,480
that try to understand it through Sahaja Yoga.

1112
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:45,080
Everything can be proved. Whatever I have said is absolute truth,

1113
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,320
nothing but the truth.

1114
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:52,880
But you allow yourself not to be bound by any

1115
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,520
previous ideas and previous conceptions.

1116
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:58,880
But let it be open mind to see what I've said,

1117
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:02,400
it's just a hypothesis, let it become a law.

1118
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,960
When you see it yourself, when it becomes in your heart,

1119
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:09,280
on the vibrations, when you see and judge what I've said,

1120
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:17,160
you'll be amazed that Nabhi Chakra which you feel on these fingers,

1121
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,600
even the children can tell you.

1122
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,160
May God bless you all. Thank you very much.

1123
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:30,880
Tomorrow I'll tell you about other chakra called

1124
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:35,080
the Chakra of the Devi, Herself .

1125
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,520
If there are any questions, I've told you, you better write it down.

1126
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,320
It's always worked out very well.

1127
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:49,760
I think now we should go in for meditation and try

1128
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,240
to get your Realization.

1129
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:10,080
 

1130
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,720
Will you please put your hands towards Me,

1131
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,480
like this, just in humble way.

1132
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:33,320
Because you have not known so far, and you will know it

1133
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:38,440
when you will know it: So you put your hands towards Me like this

1134
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,840
and as I've told you these are

1135
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,680
five chakras, sixth and seventh chakra is here is on our hands.

1136
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,720
Five chakras, sixth and seventh.

1137
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,280
I must tell you today I met

1138
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,440
some Kashmiri Muslims, that's a good idea.

1139
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:56,400
Suddenly they did feel for Me something. I don't know how.

1140
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,120
And they said, “Are You the Mother?”

1141
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,760
I said, “Yes, I am.” They came to Me

1142
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,760
and then said that “You must tell us about Ruh, about Ruh,

1143
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,600
about spiritual life, about Spirit.”

1144
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:10,680
They came to Me. I said,

1145
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,440
“All right, you put your hands towards Me like this.”

1146
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,200
They put their hands towards Me and they felt the cool breeze.

1147
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,360
And they said, “This is what it is. Mohammed has said

1148
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:22,960
that your hands will speak. This is it. That's the truth.”

1149
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:26,040
I said, “Yes,

1150
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,040
when you have your second birth,

1151
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,760
you’ll be rid of all the nonsense of

1152
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,560
these so-called religions which are separating you.

1153
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,720
They were never meant to be separated,

1154
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,480
they were meant to integrate you. But you have done it, doesn't matter.

1155
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:49,560
Now by God's grace Sahaja Yoga has come, you'll have second birth.

1156
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,520
So all the things that are attached to your birth

1157
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:58,960
will be finished and you’ll be a new person having a new life in which

1158
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:03,640
you forget all that is attacking you,

1159
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:06,960
is attached to you, which is dragging you,

1160
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:11,920
which is making you think, think, think but not ascend.”

1161
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:17,960
I'm very happy, these simple Muslims who met Me, they were in a shop

1162
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:21,960
selling something, and they were so sweet and so beautiful.

1163
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,640
They didn't say that “You are not Mohammed.” Nothing of the kind.

1164
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,640
They said, “This is what Mohammed has said,

1165
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,280
that “At the time of the Resurrection, your hands will speak,”

1166
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:37,240
and what are these people fighting for?”

1167
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:44,280
You see. This is what it is.

1168
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,880
May God bless you all!

1169
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:57,160
Let us have now both the hands towards Me and close your eyes

1170
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,320
just close your eyes.

1171
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,640
[Shri Mataji gives Realization.]
