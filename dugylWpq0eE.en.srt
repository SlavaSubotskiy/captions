1
00:00:02,111 --> 00:00:08,089
Today is the sixth day of Navaratri.

2
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:22,720
There have been many incarnations
of the Goddess

3
00:00:22,745 --> 00:00:27,065
for different, different purposes.

4
00:00:31,316 --> 00:00:40,186
But when the great saints
introspect themselves,

5
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:43,727
who were worshipping the Mother,

6
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:54,150
they found out that what
She has done for us.

7
00:00:55,312 --> 00:00:58,752
The other day I told you
the dharma

8
00:00:58,777 --> 00:01:06,322
is the innate valency of human beings.
And they are ten.

9
00:01:06,347 --> 00:01:13,201
This is already established within us,
but we deviate,

10
00:01:13,226 --> 00:01:18,225
deviate from dharma and all
the problems come in,

11
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:25,561
because to leave the dharma
is not a human quality.

12
00:01:27,177 --> 00:01:34,602
But Goddess Herself has done so many
things for us already, within us,

13
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:38,351
though we are not aware of it.

14
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,244
It is said that “ya Devi sarva
bhuteshu” -

15
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:49,427
"all those whom You have created",
- means mostly the human beings -

16
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:56,875
"What do You do? As what do You exist
inside the human beings? ”.

17
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:05,764
Now, just introspect if you have
these qualities within you or not,

18
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:15,328
because they are given to you by
the Goddess, by the Shakti within you.

19
00:02:18,058 --> 00:02:25,614
Like: ”Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
shanti rupena samstitha”.

20
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:33,428
is very important, that You exist
within the human beings as peace.

21
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:40,266
Do you find thus human beings
who are peaceful within and without?

22
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:45,137
Very difficult. But She has given
you that,

23
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:49,914
She has given you that peace
which you have to achieve.

24
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:57,209
Now it comes, because you have fallen
off your human dharmas.

25
00:02:57,234 --> 00:03:01,558
So this peace that She has given you,
you have to achieve

26
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:07,514
through your ascent, through
the Kundalini awakening.

27
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:17,582
You are excited, all right.
Or, you want to take revenge,

28
00:03:17,607 --> 00:03:24,731
you want to hurt others,
you want to trouble others;

29
00:03:24,756 --> 00:03:29,008
you enjoy sometimes,
even as sahaja yogis

30
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:35,675
people enjoy hurting others,
troubling others.

31
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,685
So, the second one She says is:

32
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:46,697
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
pritti rupena samsthita”.

33
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:51,111
Pritti  is the quality of loving,

34
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:58,981
that a human being has been given
the quality of loving.

35
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:02,211
 But, it’s not there.

36
00:04:02,236 --> 00:04:09,267
Because first nonsensical thing
human beings have is jealousy.

37
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:16,038
Now, supposing I give some present
to somebody,

38
00:04:16,063 --> 00:04:18,689
and some present to another one.

39
00:04:18,714 --> 00:04:24,401
Even in Sahaja Yoga they feel
jealous. Very surprising.

40
00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:30,286
How can you, when the Goddess
has given you the quality to love?

41
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:39,128
Very, very common nonsense about it
is that human beings are very jealous.

42
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:42,888
But as sahaja yogis you should
not do,

43
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:48,222
because that quality that the Goddess
has given you is of loving.

44
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:52,205
That quality should be shown -
on the contrary you are very jealous.

45
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:57,782
That means you are not a sahaja yogi,
blessed by Shri Mataji - no.

46
00:04:57,807 --> 00:05:02,443
If you are blessed, then you will have
no jealousy whatsoever.

47
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:07,492
And this jealousy sometimes it goes
to this extent that

48
00:05:07,517 --> 00:05:16,791
"Now, we are, say, from Cabella,
so you are from Albera. Finished!"

49
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:21,373
These so close to each other.

50
00:05:21,398 --> 00:05:29,124
Just like the two nostrils together.
But there will be jealousy.

51
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:33,594
There will be jealousy about,
”Why not Mother come to my country,

52
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:37,463
if You can go to that country”.

53
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:40,783
So this comes also from the ignorance
that

54
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:46,713
“This is mine, this is mine,
this is yours”.

55
00:05:47,578 --> 00:05:56,875
This jealousy starts in such a funny
manner that we do not realize also

56
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:05,870
that She has given us the power to love.
Tremendous power to love.

57
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:12,030
Inauspicious power, our cannot be.

58
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:17,550
But auspicious, dharmic power
to love somebody.

59
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:25,130
Means without any lust and greed,
without any jealousy.

60
00:06:25,155 --> 00:06:29,659
But the human mind has developed
itself so cunning

61
00:06:29,684 --> 00:06:34,836
that it is proud that it can be
jealous of someone.

62
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:40,179
Out of this jealousy only greed
comes in, as I told you.

63
00:06:40,204 --> 00:06:45,930
Is a fact, because you feel jealous
- so you want to buy the same thing.

64
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:49,097
Then you must compete with others.

65
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:55,568
If somebody has got a job better than
yours, then you must compete with him.

66
00:06:57,322 --> 00:07:03,772
These things are all destructive and
the powers of Goddess are constructive.

67
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:12,226
She gives you all the powers
that are absolutely constructive.

68
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:18,052
Then She says, “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu”,
the saints have said it,

69
00:07:18,077 --> 00:07:21,559
- "kshama rupena samsthita”.

70
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:28,118
Kshama is what you call
is the forgiveness.

71
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:31,974
Forgiveness from the heart.

72
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:37,338
All right, somebody has been cruel
to you, has been nasty to you,

73
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:40,320
has exploited you, has troubled you,

74
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:46,197
but you have the power, greater power
to forgive.

75
00:07:46,222 --> 00:07:51,850
Do we use that power to forgive?

76
00:07:55,718 --> 00:08:03,282
Then for relaxing also, what does
She do, that She gives you the sleep.

77
00:08:03,307 --> 00:08:08,498
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
nidra rupena samsthita”.

78
00:08:08,523 --> 00:08:13,498
When you are tired and you
can’t sleep

79
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:19,940
She makes you sleep. She relaxes you.
So the power of relaxation She does

80
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:24,150
because She acts through parasympathetic
nervous system.

81
00:08:24,175 --> 00:08:29,025
The sympathetic nervous system
can excite you, can depress you.

82
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,971
But the parasympathetic relaxes you,
relaxes your heart,

83
00:08:34,996 --> 00:08:39,018
relaxes your body and completely
feel relaxed

84
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:43,044
and sleeping in the lap of your Mother.

85
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:47,522
But there are many people
who cannot sleep.

86
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:55,535
Because they are thinking about
something they have to achieve.

87
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,812
If you cannot sleep, then something
wrong with you.

88
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:04,916
And when you cannot sleep
I also cannot sleep.

89
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:11,870
Whatever collectively happening
also works on Me.

90
00:09:11,895 --> 00:09:18,549
Anything wrong you do, that works
on Me, specially collectively.

91
00:09:18,573 --> 00:09:26,262
So you cannot sleep because you are
thinking of things which are of no value.

92
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:28,652
Now, to overcome that in Sahaja Yoga

93
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:32,133
we know we have to go into
thoughtless awareness.

94
00:09:32,158 --> 00:09:36,434
But when your ego is working or...

95
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:40,998
This child is very disturbing. I've seen
him all the time running about.

96
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:46,287
Better tell him. Whose son is he?

97
00:09:50,445 --> 00:09:55,531
You see, in India you’ll find children
absolutely keeping quiet.

98
00:09:55,556 --> 00:10:03,309
Why? Because the mother takes up
the responsibility to train the child.

99
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:07,084
So many programs you have had,
have you ever seen

100
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:10,797
any child running about? Yesterday also
they were running about here.

101
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:16,639
The reason is mother doesn’t take
responsibility as a mother

102
00:10:16,664 --> 00:10:21,140
to see that the children are properly
brought up.

103
00:10:21,165 --> 00:10:25,440
Even you are so old, but I have
to tell you.

104
00:10:25,465 --> 00:10:31,309
Whatever is good for you, for your
society, a new generation that has come.

105
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:37,203
In this new generation if you still
are not behaving in a proper way,

106
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:41,326
in abnormal way, how can you
impress others?

107
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:44,898
So, Mother has to tell you.

108
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:59,007
The most interesting thing that
the Mother has put in you is

109
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:05,395
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
bhranti rupena samsthita”.

110
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,215
She puts you into delusion,

111
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,957
because sometimes the children
cannot understand

112
00:11:13,982 --> 00:11:20,338
unless and until they face the delusion.
They have to face the delusion.

113
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:25,966
She allows, allows you to go wrong

114
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:30,687
to a point where you discover
you are lost.

115
00:11:30,712 --> 00:11:33,948
Very important it is that She plays,

116
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:37,700
this is the Mahamaya part
as they say.

117
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:41,891
And this is discussed
in every religion

118
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:46,760
that we get lost with this delusion.

119
00:11:46,785 --> 00:11:51,364
Now, what are the delusions
we have?

120
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:55,294
We have the delusions
of ego.

121
00:11:55,319 --> 00:12:00,572
Ego for men as if they are
very powerful,

122
00:12:00,597 --> 00:12:07,147
 that they can do what they like and they
are not going to be punished for it.

123
00:12:07,172 --> 00:12:11,562
For women they too behave
in the same manner.

124
00:12:11,587 --> 00:12:16,428
They don’t understand that
this is a delusion

125
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:24,946
the Mother has given into us for us
to find out that we are in the wrong.

126
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:30,093
Because if you tell somebody,
“This is wrong, you don’t do it”,

127
00:12:30,118 --> 00:12:35,179
still they are not matured enough
so they’ll go on doing wrong things.

128
00:12:35,204 --> 00:12:40,443
So the Mother says, “All right, go on.
Very nice, very good. Very good thing.

129
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:44,835
You’ll jump in the sea? – Jump”.

130
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:51,910
Then when you realize that you
have been in a delusion,

131
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:54,998
then only you can return back.

132
00:12:55,023 --> 00:12:59,332
Otherwise without any problem
you cannot return.

133
00:12:59,357 --> 00:13:10,616
So many of you are so obstinate,
so self-conscious.

134
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:15,381
Whatever one may tell you,
you will not listen.

135
00:13:15,406 --> 00:13:21,967
Whatever way you may try to convince,
on a mental level, you won’t.

136
00:13:21,992 --> 00:13:28,002
So, the bhranti, the delusion,
is beyond the mind.

137
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:31,325
It is beyond the mind.

138
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:38,358
It works out sometimes very well
for difficult people.

139
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:46,010
Now, when you are in a position
of a Mother

140
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:52,964
you don’t want Your child to be ruined, naturally.

141
00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:57,437
She feels responsible,
and She thinks that:

142
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:01,495
“Now they have got connection
with the Divine,

143
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,964
and this connection should not
be broken,

144
00:14:04,989 --> 00:14:10,077
that they should be all the time
blessed and be happy.

145
00:14:10,102 --> 00:14:13,753
All this is within us,

146
00:14:14,391 --> 00:14:20,099
within us, built-in, from our
very childhood,

147
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:26,985
but we forget, slowly, slowly
we start losing it.

148
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:32,078
Maybe the conditioning is such
or maybe the ego is such,

149
00:14:32,103 --> 00:14:39,811
and maybe that they forget that
they are realized souls.

150
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:45,731
I’m talking to you - to people who are
realized souls. I’m not talking

151
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:52,419
to people who are already lost or who
may be on their way to Sahaja Yoga.

152
00:14:52,444 --> 00:14:56,881
But the way you are brought up,
the way you have been told

153
00:14:56,906 --> 00:15:04,639
very sweetly with love, with affection,
with kindness,

154
00:15:04,664 --> 00:15:10,164
and if you don’t understand that,
then you go into bhranti.

155
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:12,298
For example, it is also said that,

156
00:15:12,323 --> 00:15:19,235
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
lajja rupena samsthita”.

157
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:25,671
Lajja, I don’t know how to describe,
it’s not shyness.

158
00:15:25,696 --> 00:15:34,747
It is a kind of a shame about
your body.

159
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:42,711
Now they have beauty contests. India
also they had beauty contest.

160
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:47,314
Why are you writing?
What is he writing?

161
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:52,506
There’s no need to write, there will be
a tape. Alright?

162
00:15:53,557 --> 00:15:56,723
Lajja rupena samsthita:

163
00:15:56,748 --> 00:16:02,915
means you have to have shame
of your body.

164
00:16:03,804 --> 00:16:07,582
That’s specially for women.

165
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:16,238
As a child you will see, women are
very shy.

166
00:16:16,263 --> 00:16:19,319
See, little girls, they are
very shy.

167
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:22,282
That shyness gradually disappears,

168
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:25,782
but in the beginning they are
even shy of Me.

169
00:16:25,807 --> 00:16:30,242
They come before Me, they’ll put down
their head.

170
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:35,393
They’ll not even say Namaste.
Very sweet.

171
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:39,372
And they don’t like people wearing
funny dresses.

172
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:44,611
I remember My granddaughter once,
she saw one magazine

173
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:49,492
in which there was a lady in a swimming
dress. She said, “What are you doing?

174
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:54,588
Better wear your dress, otherwise
my Grandma will come and hit you hard”.

175
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:59,622
To that lady was saying that; and then
she opened and saw a man’s dress

176
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:04,528
with just a small, little knicker.
I don’t know why they do it.

177
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:08,628
And then she said, “This one is, seems
to be absolutely shameless fellow.

178
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,962
He is going to have a bad time now.”
And she closed it.

179
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:15,646
And then she told the maidservant,
“Burn this, burn this off.

180
00:17:15,671 --> 00:17:22,531
I don’t want to see.” Such a little
girl she knew that it was wrong.

181
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:29,708
But the way nowadays we are going
about with the show of our body,

182
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:38,438
and sometimes I feel that all these
designers will die

183
00:17:38,463 --> 00:17:45,858
or will get bankrupt, because people
wear such little clothes these days.

184
00:17:45,883 --> 00:17:50,675
There is no space for any artist

185
00:17:50,700 --> 00:18:00,327
to show his work or to show his art
how he can dress you up.

186
00:18:00,352 --> 00:18:07,392
In Japan I asked them how - this is long
time back, now Japanese are Americans

187
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:11,601
but at that time - I said, “How is it
you wear these dresses, these kimonos,

188
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:19,269
done so well, very expensive and
it takes time to wear that?”.

189
00:18:19,704 --> 00:18:24,917
So they said that, “You see, if God
has made a beautiful body,

190
00:18:24,942 --> 00:18:28,568
then it is His art,

191
00:18:28,593 --> 00:18:36,258
and we have to make our art
decorate it.

192
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:41,235
So what we do is to make our art
to decorate it.”

193
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,494
I really liked it, because in India
same thing.

194
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,103
If there is a lady she has
to wear a sari,

195
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,797
which is being made very artfully,
very beautifully,

196
00:18:52,822 --> 00:18:59,048
just to decorate her body,
just to respect the body.

197
00:18:59,564 --> 00:19:05,346
But this seems to have gone 
with the influence of America,

198
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:09,444
I should say, which are, they are
brainless people, absolutely brainless,

199
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:14,661
nothing to learn from them.
Only two-hundred-year-old people

200
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:18,353
and we start behaving in their
manner,

201
00:19:18,378 --> 00:19:21,404
we don’t see even what is happening
to their country,

202
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:26,787
what sort of people they are,
how they live, what is their idea,

203
00:19:26,812 --> 00:19:31,382
what is their goal in life. Every false
guru has exploited them,

204
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:35,534
because they are brainless.
If they had brains

205
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:38,323
they would never have accepted
them.

206
00:19:38,348 --> 00:19:41,405
Ha, they have brains how to run
a computer

207
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,775
and how to run a television -
mechanical things.

208
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:50,368
But as far as their own body is concerned,
they don’t know how to manage.

209
00:19:50,393 --> 00:19:57,179
In India they had a beauty competition
and many sensible people opposed it,

210
00:19:57,204 --> 00:20:02,070
because it’s like selling your body
and making money.

211
00:20:02,095 --> 00:20:06,518
What is the difference between
prostitution and this?

212
00:20:06,543 --> 00:20:13,090
If you get money by selling your body,
then it’s prostitution.

213
00:20:13,115 --> 00:20:16,744
You are not supposed to sell
your body.

214
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:21,886
That’s not what Goddess has done
to you.

215
00:20:21,911 --> 00:20:27,138
But you should dress up well, different,
different occasions are there,

216
00:20:27,163 --> 00:20:31,052
for those occasions you have to wear
the way it is.

217
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:35,137
The other day I gave a very nice
sari which is,

218
00:20:35,162 --> 00:20:38,613
we call as paithani to one lady
as a present.

219
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:46,679
And we had a function for a book,
was inaugurated,

220
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:50,591
and this lady came there. So I said,
“Why didn’t you wear a paithani?”

221
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:54,689
She said, “What, there is
no wedding on.

222
00:20:54,714 --> 00:21:01,244
How can I wear for this function
paithani? There has to be a wedding.”

223
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:06,673
Very sweet – “in the wedding
I can wear.”

224
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:14,393
It is all, you see occasions, places
which are to be celebrated.

225
00:21:14,418 --> 00:21:17,596
Like in India, when women go
to the temple

226
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:21,200
or to worship the idols or anything,

227
00:21:21,225 --> 00:21:29,655
then they will wear all that is necessary
to face the Goddess, after all.

228
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,365
Imagine people coming for this program
here wearing,

229
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:42,601
I don’t know what they call it, but like
jute, jute clothes - like hippies,

230
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:46,768
what would happen to Me? I would disappear
in thin air, I can tell you this much.

231
00:21:46,793 --> 00:21:49,803
So, one has to have respect
for the body.

232
00:21:49,828 --> 00:21:56,589
That is what She has said first -
that “Lajja rupena samsthita”.

233
00:21:56,614 --> 00:22:02,582
Now you might say that there are people
who are taking the bath in the river

234
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:06,983
and this and that, and give
justification.

235
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:11,566
But you are saints! You are
realized souls!

236
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:14,791
You don’t have to see those people
who are not yet realized

237
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:18,244
and who are misbehaving.

238
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:24,078
You must do what a saint should do.

239
00:22:24,532 --> 00:22:28,729
There are so many qualities that
the Goddess has given you.

240
00:22:28,754 --> 00:22:33,615
Another is kshudha rupena
samstitha.

241
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:40,046
She’s the One who has given us hunger.
We have to eat our food.

242
00:22:40,071 --> 00:22:44,163
Nowadays there’s a fashion of becoming
thin or whatever you may call.

243
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:47,806
And you know so many diseases
have developed.

244
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:53,126
Anorexia, this thing, that thing,
because women want to eat little.

245
00:22:53,151 --> 00:22:57,587
You can change the things
that you are eating,

246
00:22:57,612 --> 00:23:03,212
but it’s not the aim of life to only
look after your body.

247
00:23:03,237 --> 00:23:10,822
Body is not the only important thing.
What is important is your Spirit.

248
00:23:11,217 --> 00:23:15,943
And She is the One who gives you
the Kundalini.

249
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:20,836
She is the One who give you a method
by which you’ll ascend.

250
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:25,201
But all the time worried about
their body.

251
00:23:25,226 --> 00:23:31,877
This is something I can’t understand.
Specially the women who are the shakti.

252
00:23:31,902 --> 00:23:40,307
Then another point is that they
follow a fashion.

253
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:45,244
Fashion is madness.

254
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:52,786
When I was young I used to wear
My blouses like this only.

255
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:55,514
But in India also fashion started.

256
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:59,982
They used to increase the size
of the sleeves,

257
00:24:00,008 --> 00:24:06,613
then decreased the size of the sleeves,
then some went up to here.

258
00:24:06,638 --> 00:24:10,891
I thought, “What is this nonsense?
Why waste money like this?”.

259
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,121
You have a particular design,

260
00:24:13,146 --> 00:24:17,128
and this is traditionally accepted
design, that you should have.

261
00:24:17,153 --> 00:24:20,825
Why do you want to go on increasing
and decreasing

262
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:25,794
the size of your sleeves, according
to the fashion. “This is the fashion”.

263
00:24:25,819 --> 00:24:32,143
Who makes the fashion? Devi?
Devi has made the fashion?

264
00:24:32,168 --> 00:24:39,115
Who has made the fashion? Is these
hungry, greedy people

265
00:24:39,156 --> 00:24:44,140
who are befooling you. And you are
trying to follow fashions.

266
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:48,654
Now, for example, I told that you must
put oil in your head,

267
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:53,746
at least on Saturday put sufficient oil
and then wash your head.

268
00:24:53,771 --> 00:24:58,897
But you’ll not do that and then
you’ll start losing your hair.

269
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:04,191
I can understand if you have no time,
you are a very busy man - but why?

270
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:10,840
Why not do something where it is
needed to look after yourself also.

271
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:14,512
So, you’ll look after your body
to thin down, you’ll lose your hair,

272
00:25:14,537 --> 00:25:17,370
eyesight will be weak, your teeth
will be falling,

273
00:25:17,418 --> 00:25:23,201
and you will become very soon
an old hag.

274
00:25:23,817 --> 00:25:29,831
Same with the men, nowadays men are
also going to beauty parlor, I’m told.

275
00:25:29,855 --> 00:25:33,212
Too much money I think, and stupidity
together.

276
00:25:33,237 --> 00:25:38,830
There is no need. If you lead
a good, healthy life

277
00:25:38,855 --> 00:25:42,711
- you have to exercise and meditate.

278
00:25:42,736 --> 00:25:47,284
If you meditate you become peaceful.

279
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:52,788
With that peace, you’ll be amazed,
you’ll have so much of energy.

280
00:25:52,821 --> 00:26:01,196
So much energy is wasted in thinking.
And what do you think?

281
00:26:01,221 --> 00:26:04,609
If you ask somebody: “What are you
thinking?”

282
00:26:04,634 --> 00:26:09,218
“Everything.” But “everything”
means what?

283
00:26:09,243 --> 00:26:15,071
Why do you think so much?
What is the need to think?

284
00:26:15,096 --> 00:26:22,101
It’s a habit, human habit to go on
thinking about everything.

285
00:26:22,126 --> 00:26:27,403
For example, just now, there are
three carpets here.

286
00:26:27,428 --> 00:26:35,040
Now, if I put attention on it I’ll just
see how nice they are; I’ll just enjoy

287
00:26:35,065 --> 00:26:39,794
- enjoy what the artists have done,
that’s all.

288
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:44,580
No words - nothing. Just the enjoyment
within yourself.

289
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:48,148
But if you ask somebody else,
he’ll just start saying,

290
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,900
“Oh, this is not good.
That’s not good.

291
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:55,327
This much some price, that price,
this thing, that thing.”

292
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:59,223
The joy of that artist is finished.

293
00:26:59,248 --> 00:27:05,244
You cannot get that joy,

294
00:27:06,601 --> 00:27:14,327
that joy about which we are seeking.
What we are seeking is joy,

295
00:27:14,352 --> 00:27:19,563
and even when you have got a way
of doing it you do not achieve it.

296
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:25,441
Because thinking is a reaction,
reaction to everything,

297
00:27:25,466 --> 00:27:28,713
and it makes the life so miserable.

298
00:27:28,738 --> 00:27:33,436
It makes the life of the person who
thinks and of others also.

299
00:27:33,461 --> 00:27:39,249
I’ll give you an example. This whole
thing we got it done

300
00:27:39,274 --> 00:27:44,497
just because it’s very heavy rains
and also we have

301
00:27:44,522 --> 00:27:48,373
problems of sometimes snowing.

302
00:27:48,405 --> 00:27:51,649
So I thought that’s a nice thing
to have a nice thing done

303
00:27:51,674 --> 00:27:55,075
and it’s very well done, we got it.

304
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:01,015
Now, there are thinking people
in this Italy. Lots of them.

305
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:07,676
That’s why it’s not progressing.
Now, we applied three years back.

306
00:28:07,701 --> 00:28:12,959
Three years they kept our money
locked up in the bank, imagine.

307
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:17,545
And first time they said, “All right,
everything is fine, it’s all right.

308
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:23,819
You can have it.” It had seventy
signatures

309
00:28:23,844 --> 00:28:27,520
of these Italians, so-called.

310
00:28:27,545 --> 00:28:31,991
And then they came round to say,
the same people,

311
00:28:32,016 --> 00:28:36,630
“No, no, no, you must change it
to copper”. I said, “Why?”

312
00:28:36,655 --> 00:28:41,423
“Because copper will be aesthetically
very good.”

313
00:28:41,448 --> 00:28:45,935
But don’t they know, stupid people,
that copper will look the same

314
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:53,027
as they are looking? After one month
only they will have the same colour?

315
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,843
This is the idea of aesthetics,
and now I have told them,

316
00:28:56,868 --> 00:29:02,253
“We don’t want your land, you keep it
to yourself, give us back our money.”

317
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:05,885
With a simple thing like that.

318
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:12,844
Why? Because they have a committee,
there is “rejune, bijune, sijune”.

319
00:29:12,869 --> 00:29:16,055
You have to go through all that
nonsense,

320
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,961
because they all sit down on chairs,
very seriously,

321
00:29:18,986 --> 00:29:22,286
“We must discuss, we must consult,
we must ask everyone,

322
00:29:22,311 --> 00:29:27,362
and then this and that”. And ultimately
what comes?

323
00:29:27,387 --> 00:29:32,263
No progress of any kind. There is
no peace.

324
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:36,801
Maybe, I don’t know, maybe some
underhand dealings are needed,

325
00:29:36,826 --> 00:29:42,113
for which they are feeling shy to tell
Me. I don’t know what is the thing is,

326
00:29:42,138 --> 00:29:47,964
but still I can’t understand when
the one office says “Yes”

327
00:29:47,989 --> 00:29:55,685
and again, when it comes back to it,
it says “No”. Three years.

328
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:03,598
So, what I am trying to say that
thinking too much is a sign of ego.

329
00:30:03,623 --> 00:30:08,952
But, they don’t find any solutions,
no solutions of any kind.

330
00:30:08,977 --> 00:30:15,261
They’ll never hit the solution. Because
they are just discussing,

331
00:30:15,286 --> 00:30:22,133
arguing, thinking - they have
no solutions.

332
00:30:28,384 --> 00:30:38,369
Now, it is important that sahaja yogis
have to do introspection,

333
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:46,099
introspection - inward. Introspection
is inward-looking.

334
00:30:46,124 --> 00:30:50,064
Inward-looking. “Why I am thinking?
What am I thinking?

335
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:53,668
What is the need to think?”.

336
00:30:54,419 --> 00:31:01,026
You will become Nirvichara. Don’t allow
your mind to befool you.

337
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:05,274
This mind is like a monkey, I tell you,
it’s really like a monkey.

338
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:09,223
And when it starts working it makes you
jump from this end to that end,

339
00:31:09,248 --> 00:31:14,582
that end to that end. And if you reach
some conclusions, so-called,

340
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:20,622
and if it is not achieved then you are
the most miserable person.

341
00:31:20,647 --> 00:31:30,101
I have seen people thinning down only
thinking about something which is absurd.

342
00:31:30,126 --> 00:31:32,954
And you can see out of this thinking
what comes out

343
00:31:32,979 --> 00:31:39,601
on a global level also. What is
the need to go to the moon?

344
00:31:39,626 --> 00:31:43,286
So many people are starved,
are dying out.

345
00:31:43,311 --> 00:31:47,792
What is the need to go to Mars?

346
00:31:47,817 --> 00:31:52,259
What are they going to get from there?
Because they formed a habit.

347
00:31:52,284 --> 00:31:54,978
First they came to India, then went
to China,

348
00:31:55,003 --> 00:32:01,223
then went to this, then went to that;
they can’t sit down, settle down.

349
00:32:01,248 --> 00:32:05,370
They can’t settle down in the house
also.

350
00:32:05,395 --> 00:32:09,954
Specially men. If you are travelling
by train,

351
00:32:09,979 --> 00:32:15,002
even if the train stops for two minutes
men must get out.

352
00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:18,869
The wife will be worried now. And while
the train will be moving

353
00:32:18,894 --> 00:32:22,278
then they’ll jump in.

354
00:32:22,303 --> 00:32:27,539
It’s a cracked brain, I think, like a -
even why say they are like a monkey?

355
00:32:27,564 --> 00:32:31,608
Because monkeys won’t do that.

356
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:38,623
It’s that they cannot stationary
remain in one place.

357
00:32:38,648 --> 00:32:43,839
Now, in meditation you have
to sit down, in one place,

358
00:32:43,864 --> 00:32:49,119
not to jump from here to there,
there to there. This is very difficult.

359
00:32:49,144 --> 00:32:54,101
Women have other problems.
While cooking they’ll meditate.

360
00:32:54,126 --> 00:32:56,405
They have no time!

361
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:00,670
They have their friends, they have
to go to shopping,

362
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:05,845
to buy things and fill the house
with all kinds of rubbish.

363
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:10,004
They have no time for anything.
They are also very adventurous.

364
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:13,495
They want to do business, they want
to do this, they want to do that.

365
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,942
For meditation they have no time.

366
00:33:16,967 --> 00:33:24,925
So, settling down is very important.
Settle down with yourself.

367
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:32,456
So, once someone told Me, “Mother, if
we settle down, we’ll become very fat.”

368
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:39,665
All right, doesn’t matter -
but you settle down.

369
00:33:40,676 --> 00:33:46,481
All sorts of excuses are there
not to meditate.

370
00:33:46,506 --> 00:33:53,637
“Yes, I meditate, Mother, but you know,
so difficult in these modern times.

371
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:58,741
There are crises in our lives,
there are problems in our lives.”

372
00:33:58,766 --> 00:34:03,180
 But actually you’ll be amazed, when
there’s a crisis, say, in My family

373
00:34:03,205 --> 00:34:07,474
or in Sahaja Yoga, immediately
I become thoughtless.

374
00:34:07,499 --> 00:34:09,743
Spontaneously I become thoughtless,

375
00:34:09,768 --> 00:34:15,726
because the problem will be solved
by the Paramchaitanya.

376
00:34:15,751 --> 00:34:19,894
The Paramchaitanya is going to solve
the problem, why should I think?

377
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:23,043
Forget it. Let the Paramchaitanya
look after.

378
00:34:23,068 --> 00:34:26,057
If you don’t depend on your
Paramchaitanya,

379
00:34:26,082 --> 00:34:30,047
it doesn’t help you. Doesn’t give you
any solutions.

380
00:34:30,072 --> 00:34:38,103
Then you go on round and round and round
with your brain and work it out.

381
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:44,119
This is what you have to know definitely
that you are connected

382
00:34:44,144 --> 00:34:48,734
to the all-pervading Power
of Divine love.

383
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:54,680
This is not love which is stupid -
love that thinks.

384
00:34:54,705 --> 00:35:00,394
Love that is truth. Love that is
joy.

385
00:35:00,419 --> 00:35:08,211
All this is built in within you, and now
you have got realization,

386
00:35:08,236 --> 00:35:17,554
so instead of evolving yourself, you just
jump into things which are of no value.

387
00:35:18,087 --> 00:35:25,236
And so many Sahaja Yogis get lost.
I was recently told by someone

388
00:35:25,261 --> 00:35:27,745
that we have lost about hundred
sahaja yogis,

389
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:34,564
because they started following another
sahaja yogi, who started seeing things.

390
00:35:35,088 --> 00:35:38,680
So they also wanted to see.

391
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:47,289
If you can see something that means
you are not there, simple thing.

392
00:35:49,163 --> 00:35:55,216
If I am, say, on the top of a mountain,
then I’m there.

393
00:35:55,241 --> 00:35:58,837
But if I am away from the mountain
I can see it.

394
00:35:58,862 --> 00:36:04,546
The more you see something that means
you are away from it.

395
00:36:04,571 --> 00:36:07,069
Did you follow this point?

396
00:36:07,094 --> 00:36:14,949
So, the subtle, the sukshma,
state is that

397
00:36:14,974 --> 00:36:20,389
where you are yourself that.

398
00:36:20,837 --> 00:36:25,385
So, how can you see yourself?

399
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:29,639
This is the point Sahaja Yogis must
understand. Anybody who can –

400
00:36:29,664 --> 00:36:33,564
“Mother, oh no he can see, he saw
auras around You,

401
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:39,776
he can see this thing.” So,
how can you see?

402
00:36:39,801 --> 00:36:44,992
Because you are that, you can’t see.
So, all such people

403
00:36:45,017 --> 00:36:49,186
who are very popular sometimes,
in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga

404
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:57,221
try to control you and befool you.
And then you are thrown out.

405
00:36:57,501 --> 00:37:02,857
Now, this is what we call is
the judgement.

406
00:37:02,882 --> 00:37:09,940
There are sieves and sieves and sieves
through which you have to pass.

407
00:37:10,306 --> 00:37:16,736
Where you get enamoured by this or that, or you fall for this or that,

408
00:37:16,761 --> 00:37:24,932
all these things are there in a step-
by-step how you are arriving.

409
00:37:26,282 --> 00:37:34,090
You are arriving at that point where
your destruction is sure.

410
00:37:34,115 --> 00:37:41,419
Because you have to become the Spirit.
You have to rise in spiritual life.

411
00:37:41,444 --> 00:37:47,274
And if your movement is downward,
who can help you?

412
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:54,329
This is a very interesting time as I told
you, is the time of judgement.

413
00:37:54,354 --> 00:38:00,709
And at this time we have to be careful
that we are our own judges.

414
00:38:00,734 --> 00:38:05,532
Nobody has to tell you that you are
catching this one and catching that one.

415
00:38:05,557 --> 00:38:11,594
You yourself can feel it what chakras
you are catching.

416
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:15,709
Whatever I may try on My own

417
00:38:15,734 --> 00:38:20,348
to suck in all your problems,
do whatever is possible,

418
00:38:20,373 --> 00:38:27,874
to keep you rising and rising and rising,
but what I feel

419
00:38:27,899 --> 00:38:40,279
that this method of helping you
will not make you so strong,

420
00:38:40,304 --> 00:38:44,377
because you’ll always think that,
“After all, Mother will suck my problem.”

421
00:38:44,402 --> 00:38:49,291
If I get hundred letters, out of them
ninety-nine are of sahaja yogis

422
00:38:49,316 --> 00:38:55,749
who are suffering from this trouble
or that trouble. I’m amazed,

423
00:38:55,774 --> 00:39:03,815
you have all these qualities already
awakened in you, they are in you.

424
00:39:05,258 --> 00:39:08,130
You use them.

425
00:39:09,545 --> 00:39:12,133
Somebody will say, “That fellow
is troubling me,

426
00:39:12,158 --> 00:39:18,184
that wife is troubling me, the husband
troubling me.” Just forgive!

427
00:39:18,209 --> 00:39:25,122
Just forgive! Your power of forgiveness
is poor.

428
00:39:25,147 --> 00:39:29,307
Moreover, more than what the saints
have written

429
00:39:29,332 --> 00:39:38,826
you have got the power of truth.
You know the reality.

430
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:45,696
Much more than those saints who
have praised the Goddess.

431
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,398
If you could just think as to what
level you are sitting

432
00:39:50,423 --> 00:39:57,783
you wouldn’t fall, you wouldn’t go
down that much.

433
00:39:57,808 --> 00:40:03,749
Only problem is you have to know that
your ascent has to be spiritual,

434
00:40:03,774 --> 00:40:11,252
and already these qualities are very
well balanced and put within you.

435
00:40:11,277 --> 00:40:17,218
More than dharma. Dharma maybe,
you have a power

436
00:40:17,243 --> 00:40:26,091
to give up or to fall down, but these
powers are never destroyed within you.

437
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:34,396
I remember once I went to America
first time and I met one gentleman.

438
00:40:34,421 --> 00:40:37,063
The next day he came and he told Me,
“Mother, I am changed,

439
00:40:37,088 --> 00:40:40,669
I am changed, I am changed.”
“What happened?”

440
00:40:40,694 --> 00:40:46,038
“You know, I used to hate my uncle,
I never wanted to talk to him,

441
00:40:46,063 --> 00:40:51,783
very angry with him, but this time,
just imagine,

442
00:40:51,808 --> 00:40:57,057
yesterday I met him, I went and hugged
him, and kissed him, and I said,

443
00:40:57,082 --> 00:40:59,812
‘Now, I have forgiven you,
completely forgiven you,

444
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:04,201
now don’t think about feeling guilty
about it.

445
00:41:04,226 --> 00:41:08,793
He started looking at me
like this.’”

446
00:41:09,441 --> 00:41:11,586
So, with the Kundalini awakening

447
00:41:11,611 --> 00:41:17,300
all these beautiful qualities you have
will come up.

448
00:41:17,325 --> 00:41:22,792
And then your generosity,

449
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:30,961
your beautiful being, which is
enlightened by the Spirit

450
00:41:30,986 --> 00:41:37,835
will prove to the world that Sahaja
Yoga is the truth.

451
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:47,602
Yesterday’s beautiful dramas
have shown us,

452
00:41:47,627 --> 00:41:52,734
but it should not be a mental
satisfaction within you,

453
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:55,181
that “I have got the realization,
now I am this”.

454
00:41:55,206 --> 00:42:02,925
No. No. No mental. It’s a state,
it’s a state,

455
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:07,529
and that state to achieve, you have
to really meditate

456
00:42:07,554 --> 00:42:17,365
and find time for meditation
every night, every morning.

457
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:21,606
The more you’ll meditate the better
it will be.

458
00:42:21,631 --> 00:42:31,528
No excuses are to be given or to be
convincing to yourself.

459
00:42:31,553 --> 00:42:37,774
Everything is unimportant. Your ascent
is very important,

460
00:42:37,799 --> 00:42:43,485
if you really want to save this world
from - in this Kali Yuga.

461
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:48,358
I think today I have made it
very clear to you

462
00:42:48,383 --> 00:42:54,325
what qualities already are instilled
within you.

463
00:42:54,350 --> 00:43:00,906
They are there. They are not dharmas,
but qualities.

464
00:43:00,931 --> 00:43:03,473
They are just within you,

465
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:10,043
only thing you have turned your attention
to something opposite,

466
00:43:10,068 --> 00:43:15,158
otherwise all these qualities are
already instilled within you.

467
00:43:15,183 --> 00:43:22,322
They are already there. And nothing can
destroy them, except for you yourself.

468
00:43:22,347 --> 00:43:26,933
If you have destroyed them,
nobody can help.

469
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:30,800
May God bless you all.
