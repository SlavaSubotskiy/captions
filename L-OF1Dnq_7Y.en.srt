1
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:47,179
Today, we are doing a special type of puja

2
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:55,099
which is performed in the glory of Ekadesha Rudra.

3
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:13,259
Rudra is the destructive power of Shiva, of the Spirit.

4
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:28,899
Now one power, which is His nature, is forgiveness.

5
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:41,099
He forgives, because we are human beings, we commit mistakes,

6
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:44,499
we do wrong things, we get tempted,

7
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:53,339
our attention is disturbed – so he forgives us.

8
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:09,899
He also forgives us when we spoil our chastity,

9
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:13,059
we do immoral things,

10
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:19,101
we do thieving, and we do things

11
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:23,380
that are against God, talk against Him.

12
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:35,279
He also forgives our superficialities,

13
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:41,060
jealousies, our lust, our anger.

14
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:59,019
Also He forgives our attachments, petty jealousies,

15
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:08,419
vanities and also possessiveness.

16
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:23,019
He forgives our egoistical behaviour

17
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:28,379
and also our subordination to wrong things.

18
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:45,810
But every action has a reaction, and when He forgives,

19
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:52,499
He thinks that He has given you a big grace-mark,

20
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:56,619
and that reaction builds up within Him

21
00:19:56,739 --> 00:20:08,579
as a wrath, against those who are forgiven,

22
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:12,099
try to do greater mistakes.

23
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:33,899
Specially, after realisation,

24
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:37,899
because such a big blessing there is of the realisation,

25
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:41,226
you’ve got the light and, in the light

26
00:20:41,346 --> 00:20:44,219
if you are holding onto a snake

27
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:53,019
then His wrath goes up because he sees how stupid you have been.

28
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:07,699
What I am saying is that after realisation, specially,

29
00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:10,219
He is much more sensitive

30
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:12,739
that, people who are forgiven

31
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:17,419
and have been given such a big thing like Self-realisation,

32
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:22,459
still they do wrong things then he is much more wrathful.

33
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:38,564
So, in the balance, the forgiveness starts reducing

34
00:21:38,684 --> 00:21:42,001
and the wrathfulness starts increasing.

35
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:58,779
But when He forgives and, as a result of that forgiveness

36
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:01,139
you feel the gratitude,

37
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:15,419
then His blessings start flowing towards you.

38
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:25,699
He gives you tremendous capacity to forgive others.

39
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:34,915
He pacifies your anger, He pacifies your lust,

40
00:22:35,035 --> 00:22:37,787
He pacifies your greed.

41
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:55,779
Like beautiful dew drop His blessings come on our being

42
00:22:55,899 --> 00:23:00,219
and we become really beautiful flowers,

43
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:22,339
and we start shining in the sunshine of His blessings.

44
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:37,859
Now He uses His wrath or His destructive power

45
00:23:37,979 --> 00:23:43,099
to destroy all that tries to trouble us.

46
00:23:54,659 --> 00:24:01,619
He protects realised souls at every point, in every way.

47
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:11,939
Negative forces try to attack a sahaja yogi

48
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:17,539
but they are all neutralised by His tremendous power of protection.

49
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:33,299
Through his vibratory awareness we are guided into right path.

50
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:46,619
All the beautiful blessings of His are described in the Psalm 23

51
00:24:46,739 --> 00:24:49,739
isn’t it, that’s the 23 Psalm ……

52
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:53,459
The Lord is my Shepherd”

53
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:58,419
Is all described how he looks after you like a shepherd.

54
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:16,539
But He does not look after the evil people

55
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,339
He destroys them.

56
00:25:23,979 --> 00:25:26,579
Those who enter into Sahaja Yoga [and] are

57
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:31,099
still carrying on with their evil nature are destroyed.

58
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:41,459
Those who come to Sahaja Yoga and do not meditate

59
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:44,499
and do not rise He destroys,

60
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:52,459
or they are thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

61
00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:59,659
Those who murmur against God and live in a way

62
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:06,379
that is not behoving a sahaja yogi, He removes them from [it].

63
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:18,499
So by one force, He protects, by another force, He throws away.

64
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:30,139
But His destructive forces when they are built up too much,

65
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:36,739
then we call it : "Now the Ekadesha Rudra is active."

66
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:49,899
Now, this Ekadesha Rudra will be expressed

67
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:52,659
when the Kalki itself will start acting,

68
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:57,099
means the destructive power which will destroy all

69
00:26:57,219 --> 00:27:02,819
that is negative on this earth and save all that is positive.

70
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:21,579
So it is very necessary for sahaja yogis

71
00:27:21,699 --> 00:27:24,659
to expedite their ascent,

72
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:31,179
not to be satisfied with the social life or married life

73
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:36,059
or with all the blessings that God has bestowed upon you.

74
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:57,499
We always see, what God has done for us,

75
00:27:57,619 --> 00:27:59,859
how He has been miraculous to us,

76
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:03,539
but we have to see what we have done to ourselves,

77
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:07,739
what are we doing about our own ascent and growth.

78
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:29,539
Now the…out of the eleven centres…… Ekadesha, means eleven,

79
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:38,579
the five come from the right side of your void,

80
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:42,019
and five from the left side of your void.

81
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:59,979
The first five on the left hand side come from:

82
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:04,699
if you have bowed yourself to wrong gurus,

83
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:17,739
or if you have read wrong books,

84
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:25,619
or if you have been in the company of wrong people,

85
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:31,899
or if you have been sympathetic towards people

86
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:35,059
who have been following wrong paths,

87
00:29:41,699 --> 00:29:46,499
or you have been yourself one of the agents

88
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:50,899
or guru of these wrong people.

89
00:29:58,459 --> 00:30:10,059
Now these five problems can be solved, if we completely give up

90
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:13,899
whatever wrong we have been doing.

91
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:29,299
As Mohammed Sahib has said that you have to beat the Shaitan,

92
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:32,859
-means the Satan- with shoes;

93
00:30:32,979 --> 00:30:38,899
but that has to be done not mechanically but from your heart.

94
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:53,579
Like many people who come to Sahaja Yoga will tell me,

95
00:30:53,699 --> 00:30:58,019
“My father is following this guru; that father is following that guru,”

96
00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:02,779
and get involved with their father, sister, this, that

97
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:09,899
and try to take them out from those gurus, also get entangled.

98
00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:31,699
Or some of them yield to others’ forces.

99
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:36,499
Like I know of Maureen, who was with me,

100
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:39,579
and her parents and parents-in-law said

101
00:31:39,699 --> 00:31:42,507
said must be baptised, and I told her

102
00:31:42,627 --> 00:31:46,579
you cannot get this child baptised because it’s a realised soul.

103
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:59,979
But she could not, that way, stand up to that,

104
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:02,339
and she took the child for baptism

105
00:32:02,459 --> 00:32:08,579
and the child became very funny – it was really like a mad child.

106
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:34,339
Now then she gave up all that and so she has saved.

107
00:32:34,459 --> 00:32:37,059
But supposing she had another child

108
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:40,099
and she would have done the same thing, the second child

109
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:43,459
would have been something very, very bad.

110
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:04,059
Now, the trouble with sahaja yogis is that

111
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:06,459
anybody who comes to Sahaja Yoga programme

112
00:33:06,579 --> 00:33:10,059
thinks he is a sahaja yogi – is not so.

113
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:22,859
Either you should have very strong sensitivity,

114
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:25,459
or you should feel it in your body,

115
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:30,139
or with your intelligence you should understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

116
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:46,169
A person who is still negative always gets attracted

117
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:50,409
towards other one who is a very, very powerfully negative

118
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:00,379
and does not understand

119
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:03,819
that the other person is so powerfully negative,

120
00:34:03,939 --> 00:34:06,299
but gets impressed.

121
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:18,579
Under such circumstances, such a person is hit

122
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:20,579
by that negative person

123
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:23,939
and Shiva cannot protect.

124
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:40,379
One should not have sympathy with anyone who is negative,

125
00:34:40,499 --> 00:34:41,899
whether he is mad,

126
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:45,699
whether there is something wrong with him, whether he is your relation,

127
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:50,779
or anything. No sympathy of any kind, on the contrary a kind

128
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:54,059
of a anger should be there for that person,

129
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:58,739
a kind of a detachment, angry detachment.

130
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:23,019
And this angry detachment is the only time

131
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:26,219
when you have to be angry.

132
00:35:35,499 --> 00:35:41,739
But I have seen people who have anger for very good sahaja yogis

133
00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:47,419
but not for their own husbands or wives who are extremely negative.

134
00:36:02,019 --> 00:36:10,019
So when the Ekadesha Rudra starts acting on these five sides

135
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:12,859
on the, we should say, on the right side it moves, because

136
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:15,739
it comes from the left and moves to the right side,

137
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:27,339
then a person starts becoming negative but acting with his ego.

138
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:46,299
Such a person may take up a situation into hands and say that

139
00:36:46,419 --> 00:36:50,859
“I am such and such sahaja yogi and I am so, we should do like this

140
00:36:50,979 --> 00:36:54,699
and we should behave like this”, and start dictating people.

141
00:36:54,819 --> 00:36:56,419
[They] can do anything.

142
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:17,899
And some mediocres or some half baked sahaja yogis

143
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:19,699
may try to understand [him],

144
00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:22,779
but most will know that “This fellow is going out,

145
00:37:22,899 --> 00:37:25,379
now he’s on his way out!”

146
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:47,499
So, all these things lead to this left side development,

147
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:53,459
or we can call it on the head, on the right hand side of your medha,

148
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:55,419
this plate, brain-plate

149
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:59,139
is called as medha in Sanskrit language.

150
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:17,979
Now, the right sided one, comes from the idea people have that,

151
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:21,459
“I am myself a big guru.”

152
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:34,499
They start preaching about Sahaja Yoga also, as if

153
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:37,379
they have become great gurus.

154
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:49,099
We have known some people who give big lectures

155
00:38:49,219 --> 00:38:54,339
in any programme and never allow my tape to be played or anything.

156
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:57,939
They think they have now become experts.

157
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,899
Then some of them say that now we have become so great

158
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:15,979
that we need not do any footsoaking or anything,

159
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:19,859
there’s no need to do meditation – there are some like that also.

160
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,539
And then there are some who say that

161
00:39:32,659 --> 00:39:34,979
"sin can never touch us, now we are sahaja yogis,

162
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:38,419
we are very great evolved souls".

163
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:51,259
But the worst of all are those who just take my name

164
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:52,979
saying that “Mother has said so

165
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,459
and I am telling you because Mother has said”

166
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:59,339
– when I have never said such a thing, is all falsehood.

167
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:13,259
Now there are some people who use Sahaja Yoga money

168
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:16,379
and exploit Sahaja Yoga in such a way,

169
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:20,339
exploit them, sahaja yogis also sometimes.

170
00:40:37,379 --> 00:40:41,459
And such people become very inauspicious.

171
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:48,699
Anyone who tries such things

172
00:40:48,819 --> 00:40:50,899
will go out of Sahaja Yoga with disgrace.

173
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:03,419
But one should never go near such a person,

174
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:07,299
have nothing to do with such a person, have no sympathies.

175
00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:20,579
Because this inauspiciousness will hurt anyone to any extent,

176
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:23,379
so better keep out of such people.

177
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:38,499
When these ten Ekadeshas are developed within a person,

178
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:43,779
then definitely such a person gets diseases like cancer

179
00:41:43,899 --> 00:41:45,819
and incurable horrible diseases.

180
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:09,099
Specially, when the eleventh one which is actually here,

181
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:11,899
which is the Viratas chakra,

182
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:15,619
which is the collectivity, when it is affected as well,

183
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:19,619
then such a person cannot get out of this disease.

184
00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:41,699
But these…out of these even five are combined,

185
00:42:41,819 --> 00:42:48,099
supposing, with Mooladhara or with Agnya,

186
00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:54,019
then they get into very serious type of dirty diseases.

187
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:12,539
That’s why, I always say that be careful about your Agnya chakra,

188
00:43:18,299 --> 00:43:21,699
because that is one of the worst things,

189
00:43:21,819 --> 00:43:27,539
that, once it starts getting combined with these Ekadeshas,

190
00:43:27,659 --> 00:43:31,539
part of the Ekadeshas, then anything can happen to a person,

191
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:33,899
he can meet with a horrible accident,

192
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:39,419
he can suddenly be hit by someone, could be murdered by someone,

193
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:43,779
anything can happen to such a person who has got the right Agnya

194
00:43:43,899 --> 00:43:48,979
and also any one of the Ekadeshas, right or left.

195
00:44:09,739 --> 00:44:16,459
That means, the five of these, if they, any one of the five,

196
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:18,499
if they combine with Agnya Chakra,

197
00:44:18,619 --> 00:44:22,339
the protective powers of God are minimum.

198
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:36,179
So, to keep your Agnya chakra alright,

199
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:40,259
say now I am speaking, now you should watch Me constantly,

200
00:44:40,379 --> 00:44:42,539
so that there is thoughtless awareness

201
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:45,899
and the Agnya chakra is soothed out.

202
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:59,899
But, don’t pay attention here and there all the time.

203
00:45:04,779 --> 00:45:09,419
Then you will find that, gradually, your attention will neutralise

204
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:11,539
into thoughtless awareness,

205
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:29,459
and your attention would be fixed in such a manner

206
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:34,179
that you don’t have to worry about anything.

207
00:45:43,539 --> 00:45:48,379
In thoughtless awareness nobody can touch you, that is your fortress.

208
00:45:54,179 --> 00:45:57,779
By meditation, one must establish thoughtless awareness,

209
00:45:57,899 --> 00:46:02,099
that is the sign that you are rising higher.

210
00:46:10,339 --> 00:46:14,499
Many people do meditation and say, “Alright, Mother we are doing.”

211
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:16,819
Mechanically, they do and say,

212
00:46:16,939 --> 00:46:19,699
“Yes, I did this, I did this, and I did this!”

213
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:24,899
But did you achieve your thoughtless awareness, minimum of minimum?

214
00:46:36,899 --> 00:46:40,539
Have you felt your cool breeze coming out of your head?

215
00:46:44,419 --> 00:46:46,899
Otherwise, if you are doing something mechanically,

216
00:46:47,019 --> 00:46:51,539
it is not going to help; help you or help anyone.

217
00:47:00,499 --> 00:47:04,459
So, after realisation, as you are very well protected,

218
00:47:04,579 --> 00:47:07,539
you have all the blessings and a great future,

219
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:13,781
you also have a great

220
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:21,341
possibility of a complete annihilation.

221
00:47:38,899 --> 00:47:43,419
I would say, to give an analogy, you are climbing,

222
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:47,539
and everybody is supporting you to climb, holding your hand,

223
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:51,219
and there are so many things by which you are protected,

224
00:47:51,339 --> 00:47:53,419
to be taken upward,

225
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:57,779
there’s no possibility of falling off by mistake also,

226
00:47:57,899 --> 00:48:04,499
but if you try to remove your bondages with Truth and Love

227
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:09,059
and all the time try to hit the people who are trying to support you,

228
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:16,019
then you fall from a great height, greater height.

229
00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:48,579
I mean, the greater height you rise, the greater you fall,

230
00:48:56,179 --> 00:48:59,979
and with a greater force also, much more deeper.

231
00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:07,979
But every effort is made by the Divine,

232
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:13,539
every support is given to you, every care is taken.

233
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,539
Despite that, if you want to fall,

234
00:49:16,659 --> 00:49:20,739
then from that height, is very dangerous.

235
00:49:35,499 --> 00:49:39,739
But Ekadesha Rudra, at that time, at such a time when somebody tries

236
00:49:39,859 --> 00:49:43,779
to harm the cause of Sahaja Yoga, after being in Sahaja Yoga,

237
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:52,219
then hits you so badly that the whole attack is very widespread.

238
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:13,939
But the whole family can be protected if there are few people

239
00:50:14,059 --> 00:50:18,139
of that family doing Sahaja Yoga work; could be protected.

240
00:50:18,259 --> 00:50:22,339
But in case the family that is

241
00:50:22,459 --> 00:50:27,459
against all the time of sahaja yogis and try to trouble them,

242
00:50:27,579 --> 00:50:31,139
can be completely destroyed, in a very bad way.

243
00:50:54,459 --> 00:50:59,939
Now these Ekadesha Rudras come out of, as I told you, from the Void.

244
00:51:06,899 --> 00:51:11,339
So, we can say that the destruction part of it

245
00:51:11,459 --> 00:51:13,699
comes from the Void mainly.

246
00:51:20,059 --> 00:51:24,619
But these are the powers, all are given in one person

247
00:51:24,739 --> 00:51:30,019
that is the Mahavishnu, that is Lord Jesus Christ.

248
00:51:40,259 --> 00:51:43,819
Because He’s the support of the whole Universe,

249
00:51:47,219 --> 00:51:49,539
He’s the personification of Omkara,

250
00:51:49,659 --> 00:51:51,939
he’s the Personification of vibrations.

251
00:51:52,059 --> 00:52:01,899
So when He gets angry then the whole Universe starts breaking.

252
00:52:18,299 --> 00:52:22,019
As He personifies the power of the Mother

253
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:26,219
which is penetrating into every atom, into every molecule,

254
00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:28,259
and to every human being,

255
00:52:28,379 --> 00:52:31,819
into every [thing] that is living and non-living:

256
00:52:31,939 --> 00:52:37,459
once it gets disturbed the whole thing gets into a jeopardy.

257
00:53:04,659 --> 00:53:10,899
So the pleasing of Christ is very important.

258
00:53:15,299 --> 00:53:19,779
Now Christ has said, “You have to be like small children”

259
00:53:19,899 --> 00:53:22,899
That is, the innocence, the purity of the heart

260
00:53:23,019 --> 00:53:26,299
is the best way you can please Him.

261
00:53:37,379 --> 00:53:39,899
As in the West, specially, people

262
00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:42,739
have developed their brains too much,

263
00:53:42,859 --> 00:53:49,019
they try to play about with words

264
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:53,819
and think that nobody knows what they are doing.

265
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:18,819
All such people must know that everything you do is known to God.

266
00:54:23,139 --> 00:54:25,499
If you are not clean in heart,

267
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:35,059
it is very dangerous for anybody to pose

268
00:54:35,179 --> 00:54:39,499
as if he’s a very good sahaja yogi.

269
00:54:52,699 --> 00:54:57,299
Such people are not possessed, nor they are conditioned,

270
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:03,219
nor they are egoistical, but they are very cunning clever people

271
00:55:03,339 --> 00:55:06,819
and they are quite aware, as to what they are doing.

272
00:55:21,859 --> 00:55:24,859
But, there are people who get possessed also

273
00:55:24,979 --> 00:55:29,219
and then they, in that , they try to destroy themselves

274
00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:32,659
or cry and weep and do all kinds of things.

275
00:55:41,299 --> 00:55:45,059
There are some who think that if they hurt themselves

276
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:47,379
or do some sort of an extreme thing

277
00:55:47,499 --> 00:55:51,299
then God will be happy -are sadly mistaken.

278
00:56:08,459 --> 00:56:10,579
If you cannot enjoy in Sahaja Yoga,

279
00:56:10,699 --> 00:56:13,219
then you should know that something is wrong with you.

280
00:56:21,099 --> 00:56:24,459
If you cannot feel happy in Sahaja Yoga, then you must know

281
00:56:24,579 --> 00:56:27,139
that there’s something definitely wrong with you.

282
00:56:33,419 --> 00:56:36,339
If you cannot enjoy the company of sahaja yogis,

283
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:39,499
then be sure something is wrong with you.

284
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:51,979
If you cannot laugh and appreciate the greatness of God,

285
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:54,819
then something wrong with you.

286
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:05,779
If you are still worried about negative people and their problems

287
00:57:05,899 --> 00:57:09,179
then know that there’s something wrong with you.

288
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:22,139
If you have sympathies with negative people,

289
00:57:22,259 --> 00:57:25,139
then also there’s something wrong with you.

290
00:57:30,259 --> 00:57:34,859
But if you have anger for negative and all that is negative

291
00:57:34,979 --> 00:57:41,819
that is against Sahaja Yoga, then you are there.

292
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:58,139
When this thing gets matured then you become the power

293
00:57:58,259 --> 00:58:00,939
of Ekadesha Rudra yourself.

294
00:58:08,779 --> 00:58:11,939
Anybody who will try to insult you

295
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:14,859
or to do any harm, will collapse.

296
00:58:25,099 --> 00:58:29,139
It has happened with many people who tried to be insulting to Me

297
00:58:29,259 --> 00:58:31,099
or tried to harm Me or anyway….

298
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:33,939
Sometimes I am quite worried about them.

299
00:58:51,939 --> 00:59:00,299
So one has to be in such a way that they become the Ekadesha.

300
00:59:08,299 --> 00:59:11,099
Nobody can touch such people.

301
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:19,059
But such a person is full of compassion and forgiveness.

302
00:59:23,787 --> 00:59:28,987
As a result, Ekadesha acts much faster.

303
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:39,219
The more compassionate you are the more powerful Ekadesha becomes.

304
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:52,779
The more collective you become, the more Ekadesha acts.

305
00:59:56,899 --> 01:00:02,379
Many people have a habit of receding back into their exclusion

306
01:00:02,499 --> 01:00:06,987
and saying “Oh we better be at home and it’s alright,”

307
01:00:07,107 --> 01:00:10,027
but they don’t know what they are missing.

308
01:00:20,739 --> 01:00:23,419
Whatever may be your experience with others,

309
01:00:23,539 --> 01:00:25,459
you should stick-on together,

310
01:00:25,579 --> 01:00:30,941
always attend programmes, take leadership, go ahead with it,

311
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:35,501
work it out and you will be blessed thousand-fold.

312
01:00:47,499 --> 01:00:50,539
Ekadesha Rudra are all the powers,

313
01:00:50,659 --> 01:00:54,339
I would say, of destruction, together.

314
01:01:05,539 --> 01:01:08,899
Is the power, destructive power of Shri Ganesha.

315
01:01:11,819 --> 01:01:18,019
It is destructive power of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

316
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:25,299
It is the destructive power of the Mother.

317
01:01:28,139 --> 01:01:34,659
Is the destructive power of the Ganesha…

318
01:01:40,226 --> 01:01:51,546
and four of these are Bhairava and Hanumana, Kartikeya and Ganesha.

319
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:11,859
Also the powers of Sadashiva and of the Adishakti.

320
01:02:11,979 --> 01:02:18,699
All the destructive powers of all the incarnations are Ekadeshas.

321
01:02:31,099 --> 01:02:34,739
Now the last but not the least,

322
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:37,739
is the destructive power of Hiranyagarbha

323
01:02:37,859 --> 01:02:40,619
which is the Collective Brahmadeva.

324
01:02:56,499 --> 01:03:01,339
And this power when it acts, every atom explodes,

325
01:03:01,459 --> 01:03:07,819
the whole atomic energy goes into a destructive power.

326
01:03:18,138 --> 01:03:22,321
So, thus, the complete total destructive power is Ekadesha Rudra.

327
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:35,459
It’s extremely powerful, explosive, but it’s not blind.

328
01:03:40,459 --> 01:03:46,139
It’s very discriminative and extremely delicately woven.

329
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:57,099
It avoids all the good points and attacks the wrong things

330
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:15,147
and it hits at the right time, at the right point,

331
01:04:15,267 --> 01:04:22,267
direct, without hitting anything that is good in between.

332
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:35,419
Now the glance of Ekadesha Rudra falls upon someone,

333
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:40,339
say, for example, and there is something in between which is divine

334
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:44,619
or which is a positive thing

335
01:04:44,739 --> 01:04:48,946
[then] it penetrates through positive, without harming the positive

336
01:04:49,066 --> 01:04:51,266
and hits the negative.

337
01:05:06,499 --> 01:05:11,104
It cools down somebody and burns another.

338
01:05:22,179 --> 01:05:29,306
Not freezing, it doesn’t freeze, it cools down.

339
01:05:35,501 --> 01:05:40,718
So that is how it works with such care and such delicacy.

340
01:05:46,897 --> 01:05:50,285
And it is tremendously sharp also.

341
01:05:52,874 --> 01:05:55,057
And it’s very painful.

342
01:05:57,007 --> 01:06:00,222
It’s not like cutting the neck in one shot,

343
01:06:00,342 --> 01:06:04,509
it goes on slowly, slowly. All the horrible tortures

344
01:06:04,629 --> 01:06:07,421
that you have learnt or heard about

345
01:06:07,541 --> 01:06:12,102
are expressions of Ekadesha only.

346
01:06:30,865 --> 01:06:34,689
For example, take the case of cancer.

347
01:06:37,341 --> 01:06:42,091
In the cancer thing, the nose is removed,

348
01:06:42,211 --> 01:06:45,583
the tongues are removed, then the gullet is removed,

349
01:06:45,703 --> 01:06:49,027
then everything goes on, one after, one after,

350
01:06:49,147 --> 01:06:52,779
being removed with terrible pain, you see.

351
01:07:05,205 --> 01:07:09,759
Take leprosy for example, the lepers cannot feel their fingers,

352
01:07:09,879 --> 01:07:13,735
they cannot feel it, so the…any rat or anything eats their fingers

353
01:07:13,855 --> 01:07:17,415
they can’t feel it, so they start losing their fingers,

354
01:07:26,872 --> 01:07:33,167
that is how Ekadesha eats up people, devours.

355
01:07:39,486 --> 01:07:43,003
But this wrathfulness of the Father

356
01:07:43,123 --> 01:07:48,779
can be very gentle and could be very sweet,

357
01:07:53,088 --> 01:07:56,714
when it comes to His own children.

358
01:08:02,804 --> 01:08:07,561
The story is about the Mother

359
01:08:07,681 --> 01:08:10,905
– once She got very angry, the Primordial Mother.

360
01:08:11,025 --> 01:08:14,296
And She was so angry, She wanted to destroy the whole world

361
01:08:14,416 --> 01:08:17,144
with Her Ekadesha power and She tried to destroy the whole world.

362
01:08:18,567 --> 01:08:23,401
When She went into that mood, the Father Himself felt

363
01:08:23,521 --> 01:08:28,814
that She is being [a] bit too much angry.

364
01:08:51,584 --> 01:08:57,049
So when She started destroying, and She was going right and left,

365
01:08:57,169 --> 01:09:01,606
He did not know what to do, so He took Her child,

366
01:09:01,726 --> 01:09:07,116
that means representing sahaja yogi, you can say, representing Christ

367
01:09:07,236 --> 01:09:11,656
or representing anyone of these great children of Her’s,

368
01:09:11,776 --> 01:09:15,488
that he put the child under Her feet.

369
01:09:50,748 --> 01:09:54,624
So, when She was stamping, suddenly She saw Her own child

370
01:09:54,744 --> 01:09:57,343
under Her feet  and Her such a big tongue came out.

371
01:09:57,463 --> 01:10:02,303
She just stopped. Balancing.

372
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:20,411
But this has happened only once.

373
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:27,705
So, after the Ekadesha Rudra, ultimately

374
01:10:27,825 --> 01:10:35,165
the complete destruction comes through the anger of Sadashiva.

375
01:10:47,534 --> 01:10:52,261
When the final total destruction takes place.

376
01:10:57,467 --> 01:11:01,832
So thus we have seen how Ekadesha Rudra acts

377
01:11:01,952 --> 01:11:08,010
and how sahaja yogis have to become themselves Ekadesha Rudra.

378
01:11:17,308 --> 01:11:19,578
Now to develop this power

379
01:11:19,698 --> 01:11:29,958
one has to develop a tremendous power of

380
01:11:33,239 --> 01:11:37,508
detachment, power of detachment,

381
01:11:45,312 --> 01:11:47,747
detachment from negative.

382
01:11:50,516 --> 01:11:54,047
For example, negativity can come from very near people,

383
01:11:54,167 --> 01:11:57,939
like brother, mother, sister, could come from friends,

384
01:11:58,059 --> 01:12:00,289
could come from relatives.

385
01:12:10,062 --> 01:12:14,339
It could come from a country, it could come from

386
01:12:14,459 --> 01:12:18,149
your political ideas, economic ideas, anything like that.

387
01:12:18,269 --> 01:12:25,279
Any misidentification can destroy your power of Ekadesha Rudra.

388
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:44,789
So it is not only sufficient to say that “I am surrendered

389
01:12:44,909 --> 01:12:47,458
to Sahaja Yoga and I am a sahaja yogi,”

390
01:12:47,578 --> 01:12:51,646
but you must know mentally also what is Sahaja Yoga.

391
01:13:04,364 --> 01:13:09,062
So that, intelligently, you understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

392
01:13:13,986 --> 01:13:18,089
Because in the West specially people are over-intelligent and if

393
01:13:18,209 --> 01:13:23,237
the light of Sahaja Yoga does not enter into their intelligence

394
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:29,292
you can never overcome your attachments.

395
01:13:45,184 --> 01:13:48,671
That doesn’t mean you talk too much about Sahaja Yoga or

396
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:51,418
you give lectures on that, but mentally

397
01:13:51,538 --> 01:13:54,300
you should also understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

398
01:14:05,158 --> 01:14:08,992
Today is a special day when it has been asked that

399
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:11,911
we should have Ekadesha Rudra puja,

400
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:21,352
and is for all kinds of false religious sects and false gurus

401
01:14:21,472 --> 01:14:28,155
and false religions, which are followed in the name of God,

402
01:14:47,853 --> 01:14:55,112
or any religion that does not say about Self-realisation

403
01:14:55,232 --> 01:14:58,170
and does not achieve Self-realisation

404
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:03,345
and does not get connected with God, is false.

405
01:15:18,925 --> 01:15:24,694
So any such thing that is just faith and talks of God

406
01:15:24,814 --> 01:15:26,873
but has no connection with God

407
01:15:26,993 --> 01:15:30,070
cannot be a true religion.

408
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:46,551
Of course, it gives a balance to people,

409
01:15:46,671 --> 01:15:51,826
but in giving that balance, if people live on that money

410
01:15:51,946 --> 01:15:55,694
and try to enjoy

411
01:16:00,258 --> 01:16:02,926
a wealth out of that money,

412
01:16:03,046 --> 01:16:09,851
then it is not even at the very lower level is religion.

413
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:14,216
Like a balance, you, see, religion has to give a balance to begin with,

414
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:17,521
but in that balancing when they tell, “You have to be balanced,

415
01:16:17,641 --> 01:16:21,023
but give me money for that, you must give me money,

416
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:24,045
give me all your purse, give me everything,”

417
01:16:24,165 --> 01:16:26,231
then that cannot be balanced,

418
01:16:26,351 --> 01:16:33,439
it does not even have a slightest thing of the blessings of God.

419
01:16:53,871 --> 01:16:56,697
Or any religion that makes you bow

420
01:16:56,817 --> 01:17:00,231
to anybody else but the incarnation, is no religion.

421
01:17:00,351 --> 01:17:04,076
That’s another one which is absolutely false.

422
01:17:15,852 --> 01:17:19,908
The real religion will give you a balance

423
01:17:20,028 --> 01:17:23,800
and will always talk about the ascent.

424
01:17:32,994 --> 01:17:36,511
But they will not ask for money or make one man

425
01:17:36,631 --> 01:17:40,617
something great as venerated.

426
01:17:50,892 --> 01:17:55,818
Thus, we should learn to discriminate between

427
01:17:55,938 --> 01:18:01,323
falsehood, negative things and real things.

428
01:18:10,591 --> 01:18:14,452
Once you develop that discrimination through vibratory awareness,

429
01:18:14,572 --> 01:18:21,925
or through your intelligence, you are in the control of yourself.

430
01:18:37,799 --> 01:18:43,101
And then you become that power of Ekadesha,

431
01:18:46,335 --> 01:18:50,366
when you establish your maturity.

432
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:59,103
Today, I bless you all, that you all become

433
01:18:59,413 --> 01:19:03,361
the power of Ekadesha Rudra

434
01:19:03,481 --> 01:19:10,642
and you develop that sincerity which takes you to that state.

435
01:19:14,665 --> 01:19:16,945
May God Bless you.
