00:00:17,904 --> 00:00:28,180
Shri Hanuman puja. Pune (India), 31 March 1999.

2
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:06,311
Today we are celebrating Jayanti (Birth Anniversary) of Hanumanji.

3
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:17,941
What should we say about Hanumanji!

4
00:01:18,326 --> 00:01:26,143
He was so powerful and wise.

5
00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:33,972
He was equally devoted and dedicated.

6
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:44,730
Generally such a powerful person becomes right sided.

7
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,309
He considers Himself so dignified that

8
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:56,589
 He doesn't give any importance to anyone in His comparison.

9
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:08,437
But Hanumanji is a special Deity.

10
00:02:09,388 --> 00:02:16,726
A special deity full of qualities that as much strong He was

11
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:24,081
as much powerful He was as much was His devotion.

12
00:02:24,726 --> 00:02:27,666
An embodiment of balanced strength

13
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:32,510
He had as much power, as He had devotion.

14
00:02:38,217 --> 00:02:48,608
How did He maintain this balance?

15
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:54,317
And was steady in it  is worth understanding.

16
00:02:58,426 --> 00:03:02,766
In Sahaja yoga, when we are enlightened

17
00:03:03,153 --> 00:03:09,707
and in Sahaja yoga we get many powers

18
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:15,064
simultaneously, we get balance.

19
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:21,151
We love others.

20
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:27,735
With love and with the help of the power of Love

21
00:03:27,838 --> 00:03:32,956
we get busy in our work and go on doing our work.

22
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:37,080
In this way, Shree Hanumanji

23
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,759
was very powerful.

24
00:03:39,963 --> 00:03:42,389
He had Divine powers

25
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:46,121
He had NAVADHA (Special) powers.

26
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:49,673
which are called GARIMA, LAGHUMA.

27
00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:52,298
He could become as big as He wanted to be

28
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:54,637
or as minute as He wanted to be

29
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:58,799
and as small as an atom.

30
00:04:00,026 --> 00:04:03,430
All these powers

31
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:06,868
He got through His devotion.

32
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:10,897
It means that devotion and power

33
00:04:10,954 --> 00:04:13,404
are both the same.

34
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,138
He who has power

35
00:04:17,163 --> 00:04:21,312
and doesn't have devotion, becomes a Rakshasa (Demon).

36
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:24,734
And He who has devotion

37
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:28,481
but doesn't have power, becomes mad.

38
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,196
Between both these, he who is in the central path

39
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:46,948
attains this state which you may call power, or devotion.

40
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:51,436
Each part of his body is made of that.

41
00:04:53,888 --> 00:05:00,888
Because of His this special feature today we worship Bajrang Bali

42
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:07,754
in our motherland as well as in foreign countries.

43
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,175
I am so surprised

44
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,250
that the young boys, children of foreign countries,

45
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:17,119
when they draw any picture

46
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:21,974
first of all they draw Hanumanji’s picture.

47
00:05:23,316 --> 00:05:25,995
Next, His special quality

48
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:32,216
was that He was half man and half monkey.

49
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:41,988
Means, it was a perfect combination of animal and human being.

50
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:55,923
So within us, whatever we have lost  in our evolution

51
00:05:56,593 --> 00:06:05,719
in that, the element of love and attachment that was what he

52
00:06:06,223 --> 00:06:08,214
took with him.

53
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:21,442
For example, you see that guru's enamored path is believed

54
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:30,409
in which of guru's  which creatures are considered as attendants.

55
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:33,319
That is why they consider dogs.

56
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:36,296
A dog has that quality

57
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:44,882
that like a guru's disciple is fully dedicated

58
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:51,222
and has no other master except his guru

59
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:56,062
and has no other thought.

60
00:06:56,301 --> 00:07:01,576
Every time,  he sacrifices his life for his master.

61
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:06,458
In the same way, it should be understood that

62
00:07:06,648 --> 00:07:11,166
a creature who has been brought up in evolution

63
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:14,262
 when he comes in contact with a human being,

64
00:07:14,543 --> 00:07:19,091
what he learns, is full devotion.

65
00:07:19,882 --> 00:07:26,959
 It means, devotion is innately born within us.

66
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:37,891
The seed of devotion is beforehand completely sown within us.

67
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:44,225
 When we were not in this state, not in the human state

68
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:48,950
 the emergence of devotion was more at that time.

69
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:53,536
Devotion set its roots deeply in us.

70
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:56,750
 Take an example of any animal.

71
00:07:57,571 --> 00:07:59,585
You get a little love from him,

72
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,966
 give him a little love, a little fondness for him

73
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:08,643
 he gets so close to you, gives his regard to you

74
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:13,037
 and in this way loves you.

75
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:16,310
You must have heard about a horse too

76
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:21,279
 that when a horse's rider falls down

77
00:08:21,304 --> 00:08:26,220
 or is about to die, he remains loyal to him.

78
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:40,705
In the same way it is said about elephants.

79
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:46,435
 The elephants' determination too is terrific.

80
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:53,511
They never put their master to any trouble

81
00:08:54,090 --> 00:09:06,680
 and if a lion or any other animal attacks their master

82
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:09,719
 the elephant will better die while going on fighting

83
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:13,096
 but he will not allow his master to be touched.

84
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:22,646
This relation of a master and superior and high-quality animals

85
00:09:24,312 --> 00:09:29,127
 this relation is established within us beforehand.

86
00:09:30,596 --> 00:09:36,493
And along with this relationship we get that power as well.

87
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:38,316
 For example, I told you that

88
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:41,035
 the elephant will die while going on fighting in the battlefield.

89
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,415
The elephant gets this power of fighting too

90
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,842
 because of his love and devotion.

91
00:09:53,368 --> 00:10:03,276
We say that Sahaj yoga is the work of love and Divine love is true.

92
00:10:03,522 --> 00:10:09,320
 But while doing this work, that power is also inherent in it.

93
00:10:12,347 --> 00:10:16,933
We may or may not know it,

94
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:23,722
 we may or may not have any knowledge of that

95
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:29,898
 but that also is inherent in it, and that is Divine power.

96
00:10:32,728 --> 00:10:37,319
Man's bowing down before anyone

97
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:42,785
 to respect anyone, to consider anyone great

98
00:10:42,844 --> 00:10:46,081
 all these are the indications of that.

99
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:53,321
But when he respects his master, then within him

100
00:10:53,543 --> 00:10:56,443
there is importance to his master

101
00:10:56,468 --> 00:11:01,285
 but along with that is his power as well.

102
00:11:01,712 --> 00:11:05,342
So, devotion and power are not two different things.

103
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:08,058
 They are just one and the same.

104
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:12,426
We will say that if there is power in the right hand

105
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:14,295
 there is devotion in the left hand.

106
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:18,065
This fusion of power and devotion

107
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,236
 has been described beautifully in Shree Hanumanji.

108
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:28,981
On the one hand He went burn Ravan's Lanka

109
00:11:30,412 --> 00:11:35,742
and there only He prostrated before Sitaji.

110
00:11:37,048 --> 00:11:42,223
 And when Sitaji said ''No, you are My son

111
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:44,438
 I will not come at the behest of My son.

112
00:11:44,463 --> 00:11:48,318
My husband will have to come and will have to destroy this man.

113
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:56,291
 When He will destroy him (Ravana), then I will go with Him."

114
00:11:56,532 --> 00:12:00,499
Hanumanji said, “That is okay!"

115
00:12:00,524 --> 00:12:03,263
 He could have picked Her up like that only.

116
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:06,911
He had such powers.

117
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:15,201
 But He said,"If Mother is saying so, it is okay."

118
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:19,465
And after that, such a great war broke out.

119
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,941
 There was a need for that.

120
00:12:24,849 --> 00:12:27,977
Now there were special qualities of Shri Ram.

121
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:31,330
 Extremely powerful!

122
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:35,754
And His aim would never go astray.

123
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:41,997
 You must have heard what He did in Sita Swayamvar.

124
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:44,767
But the same Shri Ram

125
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:50,403
 when it was the case of Ravana

126
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:54,017
 He didn't give up.

127
00:12:55,762 --> 00:12:57,884
He killed Him.

128
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:06,128
 Tulsidas ji has given a beautiful description of this scene.

129
00:13:06,694 --> 00:13:12,677
Then Shri Ram was repeatedly hitting the arrows

130
00:13:14,914 --> 00:13:18,297
 at Ravana's ten heads.

131
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:21,036
The heads would fall down one by one but get back again,

132
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:22,871
 fall down and get back again.

133
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:28,819
Then Laxman said ,"what are You doing?

134
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:32,012
 Shoot one arrow in His heart,

135
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:35,930
the moment You will hit an arrow in His heart

136
00:13:35,955 --> 00:13:37,605
 instantly He will die

137
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,530
 Otherwise, how can He die ?

138
00:13:39,555 --> 00:13:41,406
He cannot die."

139
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:47,025
 The arrow should hit His heart.

140
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:52,231
There is a beautiful description of Shri Ram there.

141
00:13:52,653 --> 00:13:55,241
 He was a shy person, very shy.

142
00:13:55,415 --> 00:14:02,579
Shri Ram, even though He was so powerful, so intense

143
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:06,625
 even though He was such a noble person

144
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,846
 He said, " You see the problem is that

145
00:14:09,871 --> 00:14:14,818
 in Ravan's heart resides My Sita.

146
00:14:14,942 --> 00:14:17,336
So, I won't hit Him in his heart.

147
00:14:18,436 --> 00:14:22,281
 But when his head will cut off repeatedly

148
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:26,620
 his attention will surely shift towards his head.

149
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:30,532
At that time I will kill him with an arrow."

150
00:14:30,557 --> 00:14:32,519
 Otherwise for Him, it would be said

151
00:14:32,544 --> 00:14:35,030
that he would kill a person just with one arrow.

152
00:14:35,055 --> 00:14:37,882
 But now you see how delicate the matter is.

153
00:14:37,907 --> 00:14:44,411
Simply, it is a husband's love towards his wife.

154
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:53,083
 Even though being an ocean of power, what an amount of love He had!

155
00:14:55,153 --> 00:14:58,688
There are many instances of Hanumanji

156
00:14:59,437 --> 00:15:10,934
 in which Hanumanji proved that He is ocean of love

157
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:16,430
 and at the same time, he who is evil minded

158
00:15:16,526 --> 00:15:22,309
 he who bothers others, he who destroys others

159
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:31,169
 he doesn't hesitate in any way to kill him.

160
00:15:31,969 --> 00:15:40,069
As all this fact is about Hanuman's devotion

161
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:45,775
 the same is worth noticing about his power of strength.

162
00:15:48,545 --> 00:15:54,078
He knew that Ravana was afraid only of fire.

163
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,506
 So, He went to Lanka and set it on fire.

164
00:16:00,014 --> 00:16:06,415
This was His power that He put Lanka on fire.

165
00:16:07,295 --> 00:16:13,341
 And in that fire, He didn't kill anyone, He did not burn anyone.

166
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:16,484
Ravana also did not get burnt,  nobody got burnt

167
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,525
 but he got scared.

168
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:24,331
People got scared, as to what crime Ravana is doing.

169
00:16:24,553 --> 00:16:30,076
 People had given full consent about
 the type of deeds Ravana was doing.

170
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:35,947
They would say, "He is Ravana. it is his will.

171
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:41,319
 Whatever he wants to do, let him do. Who are we to question him?

172
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:43,980
Ravana is after all Ravana."

173
00:16:45,445 --> 00:16:52,396
 But it is worth noticing that when Lanka was on fire

174
00:16:52,421 --> 00:16:56,570
 when Lanka was completely combusted

175
00:16:56,843 --> 00:17:03,723
 people understood that it was a dangerous situation

176
00:17:04,698 --> 00:17:11,671
 because Lanka was put on fire and we too could be burnt.

177
00:17:12,404 --> 00:17:16,336
The quality of fire is that it goes upwards, doesn't come downwards.

178
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:20,024
 Everybody was watching upwards that it was burning.

179
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:25,511
Whole of Lanka was combusted but nobody got burnt.

180
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:30,646
 He did so to frighten them

181
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:37,421
 to make them understand that Ravana is committing a great sin.

182
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:44,052
How much understanding and how much balanced was Bajrang Bali

183
00:17:44,077 --> 00:17:46,048
should be noted.

184
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,148
 The same we come across in History.

185
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:57,211
All those who were very powerful had immense love.

186
00:17:57,932 --> 00:18:02,852
 If you observe an example, there is an example of Shivaji Maharaj.

187
00:18:02,953 --> 00:18:10,098
He was as powerful as He was well behaved,

188
00:18:10,203 --> 00:18:17,038
 very disciplined and very well balanced.

189
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:24,527
When you get this balance, then you are a Sahaja Yogi.

190
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:29,335
 If you get the power, it doesn't mean

191
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:37,404
 that you in your love and your dealings you somehow give up.

192
00:18:38,399 --> 00:18:43,785
But you are powerful and its beauty is that

193
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,919
 those who are Schedule caste, poor and unhappy

194
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:53,817
 those who are victims, those who are facing disaster

195
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,376
are secured.........

196
00:18:56,598 --> 00:19:01,010
And those who are troubling them

197
00:19:01,095 --> 00:19:06,482
those who are destroying, those who are bothering

198
00:19:06,631 --> 00:19:09,715
have created  problems for people

199
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,937
to such people

200
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,760
there is no need to do anything.

201
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:17,066
You can set them right only with the help of bandhans.

202
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:23,366
The powers that you have received inside your being

203
00:19:23,502 --> 00:19:26,676
it should be used for this very purpose

204
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:33,415
so that the evil will be destroyed.

205
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:37,935
But in your power there is no sword

206
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,072
or mace in your hand like Hanumanji.

207
00:19:42,252 --> 00:19:48,043
Mace is not outwardly but it is inside.

208
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:52,756
You watch your experiences

209
00:19:52,986 --> 00:20:00,082
that he who bothers or disturbs, he is attacked by a mace

210
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:05,069
you may or may not pick a mace in your hand.

211
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:09,812
In this way you yourself are safe by default

212
00:20:10,036 --> 00:20:12,601
your safety is  guaranteed

213
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:29,058
 but along with that your other sahaja yogis too are safe.

214
00:20:30,198 --> 00:20:34,997
Now in this Shri Bajrangbali has a great role to play.

215
00:20:35,022 --> 00:20:36,553
You don't know

216
00:20:36,578 --> 00:20:40,382
that he is standing in front of you as well as at your back.

217
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:49,044
His nature is just like children

218
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:56,385
Too pure and too simple

219
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:01,544
but such wisdom

220
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:07,425
and all types of virtues He knows.

221
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:13,262
It means that along with His power

222
00:21:13,287 --> 00:21:23,103
 He has a lot of absolute discretion- very wise.

223
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:27,195
The wisdom of the present time is useless

224
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,914
but the wisdom

225
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:32,887
that will scrutinize and understand everything with love

226
00:21:35,431 --> 00:21:40,980
a special form of that wisdom

227
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:48,539
 was Shri Ganesha and is Shri Hanumana.

228
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:57,130
The speciality of both of them is that

229
00:21:57,155 --> 00:22:06,547
 Hanumanji is very strong, very quick deity

230
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:11,246
 and Shri Ganesha is very cool.

231
00:22:11,271 --> 00:22:20,752
But both are great destructors in times of need.

232
00:22:20,888 --> 00:22:24,519
 For Sahaja Yogis there is no need of destruction.

233
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:27,672
There is no need to destroy anyone.

234
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:30,373
You just think

235
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:38,979
that both of them are with you at every moment.

236
00:22:39,586 --> 00:22:43,745
Whenever anyone bothers you

237
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:50,921
in reality, your protectors are standing with you.

238
00:22:51,718 --> 00:22:54,845
Many times, you must be noticing

239
00:22:54,899 --> 00:23:02,191
 that ministers or anyone visits a place, security escorts them.

240
00:23:02,525 --> 00:23:08,167
Sahaja Yogis' security always escorts them.

241
00:23:10,535 --> 00:23:17,112
 The other security with them is that of Ganas.

242
00:23:21,043 --> 00:23:24,303
Now their work is too diversified

243
00:23:24,328 --> 00:23:28,171
miscellaneous and little job work also.

244
00:23:29,182 --> 00:23:31,707
 And these only

245
00:23:31,732 --> 00:23:38,616
 give a message about you to Shri Ganesha who is Ganapati

246
00:23:38,642 --> 00:23:39,641
 about what is going on?

247
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,404
What wrong is going on and where?

248
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:44,559
 From where you are being attacked ?

249
00:23:44,584 --> 00:23:48,697
And from where you are troubled?

250
00:23:51,016 --> 00:23:52,672
you may not even be knowing.

251
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:56,069
Somebody may like to attack you in an unknown form

252
00:23:57,093 --> 00:24:02,479
even then both these deities are standing with you

253
00:24:02,504 --> 00:24:07,961
 and when Ganapati tells this

254
00:24:08,153 --> 00:24:11,629
 Shri Hanuman gets ready.

255
00:24:11,765 --> 00:24:15,541
Sahaja Yogis need not be afraid of anything.

256
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:18,383
 No need to be afraid of anything

257
00:24:18,408 --> 00:24:20,353
 Right now I am going to tell you a Story.

258
00:24:20,378 --> 00:24:22,468
It is so amazing.

259
00:24:22,493 --> 00:24:34,559
You must have heard that America exploded a lot of bombs everywhere

260
00:24:35,526 --> 00:24:43,694
 thinking that terrorists have made some arrangements.

261
00:24:44,861 --> 00:24:51,477
The story I am going to tell you is about a place in Africa.

262
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,831
 Here were some Sahaja Yogis and a bomb exploded there.

263
00:24:58,401 --> 00:25:03,132
Because of that bomb explosion, all the people died

264
00:25:03,157 --> 00:25:05,090
 and Sahaja Yogis remained unhurt.

265
00:25:06,611 --> 00:25:07,643
They were so surprised.

266
00:25:07,668 --> 00:25:10,364
 Even the dust did not touch them.

267
00:25:11,173 --> 00:25:15,395
They had never come to Cabella.

268
00:25:17,191 --> 00:25:19,920
They had never thought that they would ever come to Cabella.

269
00:25:19,945 --> 00:25:22,811
But when it took place, they came to Cabella.

270
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:28,604
 And after coming said,''Mother, don't know who saved us

271
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:31,133
 who protected us.''

272
00:25:31,502 --> 00:25:37,722
But all Sahaja Yogis were saved and the rest of the people died...

273
00:25:43,818 --> 00:25:47,844
Now it is an incident, it is true.

274
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:55,420
And its reason is this that you have now recognized God.

275
00:25:55,445 --> 00:26:06,569
You have enlightened your soul in Sahaja Marga.

276
00:26:11,788 --> 00:26:21,866
 With this new transformation

277
00:26:21,891 --> 00:26:33,619
 you have become a great devotee and a powerful human being.

278
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:38,337
Now it is not at all possible for anyone to touch you.

279
00:26:38,362 --> 00:26:42,232
I can give you hundreds of such examples

280
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,627
 that when you get your realization in Sahaja

281
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:51,985
 nobody can touch you.

282
00:26:53,734 --> 00:26:55,907
Previously also there were saints.

283
00:26:55,971 --> 00:26:59,495
 All of them were tortured, victimized, everything happened.

284
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:06,845
But in spite of being victimized or tortured, they didn't give up

285
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:11,252
 and not only this, they were always protected.

286
00:27:13,034 --> 00:27:18,464
And they would talk about such things
 which would make people very angry.

287
00:27:18,495 --> 00:27:20,853
 They would think, what are they talking

288
00:27:20,878 --> 00:27:25,677
 against kings, against emperors and against everybody.

289
00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:29,900
They would talk about such things which would scare people

290
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:34,959
 but because of Hanumanji's powers, nobody could touch them.

291
00:27:35,711 --> 00:27:38,073
Nobody hit them.

292
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:42,107
 There is a nice story about Khwaja Nizzamudin Saheb.

293
00:27:42,553 --> 00:27:50,839
That his king told him to bow down before him ..[unclear]..

294
00:27:50,864 --> 00:27:52,200
He didn't bow down.

295
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:56,231
He said, "No, I am not going to bow down before you. Who are you?''

296
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,630
He was very angry.

297
00:27:58,655 --> 00:28:00,977
He said that if within three days

298
00:28:01,002 --> 00:28:04,206
you do not come and bow down before me

299
00:28:04,231 --> 00:28:06,896
 I will get your neck cut off''.

300
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:08,668
He said,'' Ok, get it cut off!

301
00:28:08,693 --> 00:28:10,128
I won't

302
00:28:10,153 --> 00:28:14,458
because you are not a great saint that i will bow down before you.''

303
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:23,334
Then he came and raised a great commotion

304
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:28,099
that after three days this man's neck is to be cut off.

305
00:28:28,148 --> 00:28:31,430
The day his neck was going to be cut off

306
00:28:31,455 --> 00:28:35,629
 that night only, this King's neck got cut off, nobody knows how?

307
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:45,397
If this would not have been in history, those who were great saints

308
00:28:45,422 --> 00:28:51,494
 those who were great followers of dharma, would have been no more.

309
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:58,590
Because Rakshas's ways are so powerful and violent

310
00:28:58,981 --> 00:29:06,620
 and are so comprehensive that
 they would have surely put an end to them.

311
00:29:07,271 --> 00:29:14,055
But behind them is God.

312
00:29:14,516 --> 00:29:20,717
 And God is on one side Hanuman and on another side Ganesha.

313
00:29:20,865 --> 00:29:23,978
He is made of these two powers together.

314
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:29,311
 He is a protector, He takes care.

315
00:29:30,598 --> 00:29:35,655
There is a story of Rana Pratap of Mewar

316
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:39,363
 that when he went to fight a war,

317
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:46,558
his soldiers thought that he was going to be defeated.

318
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:47,416
So, they told him

319
00:29:47,441 --> 00:29:48,908
 ''You return back

320
00:29:50,453 --> 00:29:52,252
 because we want that your life should be saved

321
00:29:52,277 --> 00:29:53,576
 for the sake of Mewar."

322
00:29:53,998 --> 00:29:55,297
He didn't listen.

323
00:29:55,445 --> 00:29:57,756
 He said,"All of you better go back.

324
00:29:57,781 --> 00:30:00,459
I will stay put like this

325
00:30:00,484 --> 00:30:03,475
 because the Ganas are standing with me."

326
00:30:04,034 --> 00:30:05,525
He too was a Sahaja Yogi.

327
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:08,677
 "If you want to go, you go.

328
00:30:08,702 --> 00:30:10,665
I will stay here like this, only

329
00:30:10,881 --> 00:30:13,509
 because the Ganas are with me."

330
00:30:13,932 --> 00:30:16,748
Just understand that

331
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,427
 you have every type of protection in your front and back.

332
00:30:29,211 --> 00:30:32,454
But just on getting this protection

333
00:30:33,316 --> 00:30:37,285
what should a man have? What should a Sahaja Yogi have?

334
00:30:37,577 --> 00:30:43,861
A very serious and determined person, and not afraid of anyone.

335
00:30:49,045 --> 00:30:52,657
 He doesn't run away from anyone.

336
00:30:53,805 --> 00:30:57,758
He sticks at that place

337
00:30:58,825 --> 00:31:08,942
 and those who are evil persons,in front of him.

338
00:31:13,575 --> 00:31:16,602
He doesn't need to do anything.

339
00:31:18,735 --> 00:31:20,659
 That period is over.

340
00:31:20,684 --> 00:31:24,444
Now you just stand at a place and the other person will run away.

341
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:26,554
 He won't come to know what happened.

342
00:31:27,547 --> 00:31:31,972
Sahaja Yogis write and send about many such experiences

343
00:31:31,997 --> 00:31:36,421
that happened like this and that.

344
00:31:36,446 --> 00:31:40,965
Otherwise in the presence of these foreigners

345
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,732
 it is not so easy to spread Sahaja Yoga.

346
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:49,108
And since Sahaja Yoga has started spreading among Muslims too

347
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:51,460
you can understand that

348
00:31:51,485 --> 00:31:55,089
that this Divine power which is the power of love,

349
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:57,392
how much strength it has within it

350
00:31:59,194 --> 00:32:02,997
and how many tasks can be done with the help of it.

351
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,605
 But it doesn't mean that

352
00:32:05,952 --> 00:32:16,724
you make any harassment in the name of Hanumanji.

353
00:32:16,988 --> 00:32:19,483
It doesn't at all mean that.

354
00:32:19,797 --> 00:32:21,640
For example nowadays, there are such (organizations)

355
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:24,710
which  take the name of Hanumanji, take the name of Ganesh ji

356
00:32:24,782 --> 00:32:30,835
or of Mahadevji and make such organizations.

357
00:32:31,698 --> 00:32:34,451
There is no need of making any organization.

358
00:32:35,044 --> 00:32:38,240
You yourself are an organization.

359
00:32:38,265 --> 00:32:41,366
Neither anybody can touch you

360
00:32:43,844 --> 00:32:46,807
nor, anyone can destroy you.

361
00:32:48,898 --> 00:32:53,190
First, it is a matter of understanding one's own self

362
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:55,954
which has been said in all scriptures

363
00:32:56,571 --> 00:33:01,534
that Atmasakhshatkar means to know oneself.

364
00:33:01,743 --> 00:33:04,093
What does it mean to know oneself?

365
00:33:05,753 --> 00:33:12,877
To know means to know who is in front of you and who is behind you.

366
00:33:13,587 --> 00:33:16,308
Who is your protector?

367
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:22,028
And the love and affection you have for people

368
00:33:22,053 --> 00:33:28,435
and those who always think how to please others

369
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,835
For example (NOT CLEAR)

370
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,371
that i will make the whole world happy.

371
00:33:34,396 --> 00:33:36,805
I will fill everyone's heart with joy.

372
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,983
This thought that comes in your mind

373
00:33:39,008 --> 00:33:45,060
you should understand that there is nobody who can harm you.

374
00:33:45,096 --> 00:33:47,542
Have courage!

375
00:33:47,982 --> 00:33:49,913
Nobody will destroy you.

376
00:33:49,938 --> 00:33:52,600
And for that you don't have to do anything.

377
00:33:56,327 --> 00:34:01,310
For that you don't need to keep any sword

378
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,894
no need to have a mace

379
00:34:03,935 --> 00:34:05,210
They are already there.

380
00:34:05,235 --> 00:34:07,319
They have already come, well prepared.

381
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,389
And they are settled in you.

382
00:34:11,335 --> 00:34:18,940
 You don't need to make yourself strong. You are already so.

383
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:26,990
There is a Chinese story, very interesting!

384
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:31,324
In their country, cock fights are organized.

385
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:36,872
When the cock fight was on, it so happened that

386
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:43,847
somehow a king felt that he should go to a saint.

387
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:52,081
Let the cocks learn from the saint, how to fight with the world.

388
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:54,698
Because, this saint does not fight with anyone

389
00:34:54,723 --> 00:34:56,288
 nor anyone touches him.

390
00:34:56,769 --> 00:34:58,709
People run away from him

391
00:34:58,734 --> 00:35:01,522
 and salute him.

392
00:35:01,547 --> 00:35:05,479
So what is so special about him

393
00:35:05,614 --> 00:35:11,631
that he is living in this wicked world like this.

394
00:35:12,475 --> 00:35:16,476
The saint told him,''Ok! leave the cock here.''

395
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:20,857
So, he went back, leaving one cock with him.

396
00:35:20,882 --> 00:35:23,861
 He took back that cock after one month

397
00:35:24,246 --> 00:35:28,897
 and put him where the cock fight was going on.

398
00:35:28,922 --> 00:35:31,025
There were a lot of cocks.

399
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:34,603
 He put him in such a courtyard.

400
00:35:35,113 --> 00:35:41,533
But this great cock kept standing.

401
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:46,097
Now all the cocks were fighting among themselves.

402
00:35:46,122 --> 00:35:48,496
One after the other they left.

403
00:35:51,052 --> 00:35:53,335
Only this one cock kept standing.

404
00:35:55,143 --> 00:35:57,722
Everybody started getting scared of him
 and he is not reacting at all.

405
00:35:57,747 --> 00:36:00,009
 Is he somewhat special?

406
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:06,612
And at the end that one cock was saved who kept standing gracefully.

407
00:36:08,828 --> 00:36:11,749
So when we are doing the puja of Hanuman Ji here today

408
00:36:11,774 --> 00:36:16,717
 we must think that Hanumanji has settled in reality within us.

409
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:21,158
He is on our right side.

410
00:36:28,184 --> 00:36:30,593
 That means He is working on our Pingala Nadi.

411
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:38,110
He works on our Pingala Nadi and creates enthusiasm in us

412
00:36:39,584 --> 00:36:43,793
and that creates warmath in our body.

413
00:36:44,687 --> 00:36:46,657
 But his path is such that

414
00:36:46,765 --> 00:36:50,680
 along with warmath you feel devotion within you.

415
00:36:53,807 --> 00:36:56,863
So, the warmath that comes, the enthusiasm it creates

416
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:04,581
 that works inside us on our right side

417
00:37:05,085 --> 00:37:10,522
 and when we do not absorb the balanced power of Hanumanji

418
00:37:10,547 --> 00:37:14,592
 we get a lot of diseases.

419
00:37:14,764 --> 00:37:31,029
For example the liver problem, asthma

420
00:37:32,638 --> 00:37:35,299
 and when its heat goes downwards

421
00:37:35,324 --> 00:37:38,206
 Hanumanji controls this heat.

422
00:37:38,231 --> 00:37:43,615
But when the heat doesn't get controlled, such diseases attack

423
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,873
which are incurable.

424
00:37:45,898 --> 00:37:48,271
It can cause blood cancer

425
00:37:48,296 --> 00:37:50,336
and there can be intestinal trouble

426
00:37:50,361 --> 00:37:52,608
 which means all the troubles all over the world are

427
00:37:52,633 --> 00:37:55,317
caused just by the breakdown of the liver

428
00:37:55,342 --> 00:38:02,505
 and the liver gets spoiled because we do not follow Hanumanji.

429
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,595
There is no need to get angry.

430
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:11,319
 But getting angry and start hitting,

431
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:17,261
 beating this and that person to create panic,

432
00:38:17,554 --> 00:38:20,365
this is not Hanumanji's power.

433
00:38:22,296 --> 00:38:25,524
There is no question of getting angry.

434
00:38:27,993 --> 00:38:32,215
 There is no question of getting angry about anyone.

435
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:38,097
There is no need at all, if you respect Hanumanji.

436
00:38:38,258 --> 00:38:40,659
 He is not angry with anyone

437
00:38:43,449 --> 00:38:47,327
But a human being gets angry over everything.

438
00:38:48,012 --> 00:38:50,382
 He gets ego.

439
00:38:51,302 --> 00:38:53,343
Hanumanji didn't have ego at all.

440
00:38:53,368 --> 00:38:56,615
 A right sided person is very egoistic.

441
00:38:57,795 --> 00:39:01,482
A human being has so much ego!

442
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:05,435
 I become restless when I see what they were egotistical.

443
00:39:06,673 --> 00:39:10,384
That ego doesn't have any meaning

444
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:11,700
 What does "I" mean?

445
00:39:13,863 --> 00:39:19,521
Even an ordinary human being becomes egoistic.

446
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:23,074
 And many Kings and emperors also are not egoistic.

447
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:29,135
Its reason is that inside their being there is such a conditioning

448
00:39:29,256 --> 00:39:31,831
 that they do not recognize Hanumanji.

449
00:39:33,097 --> 00:39:38,371
As soon as you recognize Hanuman Ji, you recognise Shri Ram.

450
00:39:40,691 --> 00:39:46,353
 Now tell Me if you are right sided, you should not get Asthma

451
00:39:46,378 --> 00:39:48,214
 because Shree Ram is settled

452
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:50,973
 according to Sahaja Yoga in our right heart.

453
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:55,955
Because you do not recognize Hanumanji

454
00:39:56,091 --> 00:40:00,955
 your behaviour and your balance is not like His

455
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:04,344
 that is why you get Asthma as well.

456
00:40:06,676 --> 00:40:14,483
Shivji's place is in your heart,  there also is the same fuss

457
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:19,979
 and you can get a heart attack or you can have some other diseases.

458
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:27,002
After coming to Sahaja Yoga you should understand that

459
00:40:27,027 --> 00:40:30,432
 Hanumanji is an ideal in front of you.

460
00:40:30,747 --> 00:40:36,522
Ganeshji is already there, He is the incarnation of innocence

461
00:40:37,136 --> 00:40:41,542
 just like small children, very innocent

462
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:44,571
but very wise.

463
00:40:45,295 --> 00:40:49,255
And a perfect balance of Hanumanji’s

464
00:40:49,482 --> 00:40:52,516
happiness full of love

465
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:56,380
and along with that experience Divine power.

466
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:01,359
Keeping this in mind

467
00:41:01,384 --> 00:41:04,366
 a Sahaja Yogi's character or life should be such

468
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:07,699
that he should be balanced.

469
00:41:07,724 --> 00:41:14,393
Even when you are angry, just observe silence.

470
00:41:17,317 --> 00:41:20,046
I feel, I never get angry.

471
00:41:20,071 --> 00:41:24,303
Or maybe I get angry, but I am not aware of it.

472
00:41:26,093 --> 00:41:29,485
And the problem gets solved without getting angry.

473
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,522
Yes, I may say,"what are you doing?"

474
00:41:32,547 --> 00:41:35,780
Not much beyond this.

475
00:41:36,271 --> 00:41:40,944
People abuse and use all bad words

476
00:41:41,056 --> 00:41:43,391
 But when it crosses its limits

477
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:49,265
and when this habit of getting angry crosses its limits and man.....

478
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:51,521
He is sitting angrily

479
00:41:51,546 --> 00:41:53,167
sitting there in a very angry mood.

480
00:41:53,206 --> 00:41:55,068
He is showing his anger.

481
00:41:55,093 --> 00:42:00,565
 When people are like that, a serious problem arises

482
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:06,016
 they get a serious disease called Alzheimer.

483
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,916
Alzheimer is caused by anger.

484
00:42:12,787 --> 00:42:16,893
 That anger which we get unnecessarily.

485
00:42:17,554 --> 00:42:21,063
Now try to understand, Your son has been slapped by somebody.

486
00:42:21,088 --> 00:42:23,200
 And you get angry.

487
00:42:24,373 --> 00:42:26,889
Nothing is gained by getting angry.

488
00:42:26,914 --> 00:42:30,680
On the contrary you should think, if it is the mistake of our son?

489
00:42:30,705 --> 00:42:35,178
 Or we are spoiling that boy unnecessarily 
under the cover of our love.

490
00:42:39,264 --> 00:42:42,712
He will never have a balance in this way.

491
00:42:42,737 --> 00:42:46,200
 Alzheimer is a very serious disease.

492
00:42:46,225 --> 00:42:48,345
A person gets mad,

493
00:42:48,409 --> 00:42:51,701
 doesn't even die, nor allows anyone to die,

494
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:57,327
abuses, goes on shouting.

495
00:42:57,352 --> 00:43:01,680
 He gets so much caught up in his left side, in his brain

496
00:43:01,729 --> 00:43:04,799
 that his personality becomes very strange.

497
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:10,101
It's treatment is in Sahaja Yoga

498
00:43:10,126 --> 00:43:11,726
 but it is very difficult,

499
00:43:11,751 --> 00:43:14,159
because they go on abusing.

500
00:43:14,184 --> 00:43:17,173
 If they will abuse the person who will go to set them right,

501
00:43:17,198 --> 00:43:20,142
who will accept it. If anyone is a doctor.

502
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:22,625
if he is abused, he will say let him go to hell.

503
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,526
 What have I to do with him?

504
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:27,582
This is what happens with them, they don't want to.

505
00:43:27,892 --> 00:43:30,828
 Mother we won't set them right, let them go.

506
00:43:31,795 --> 00:43:34,322
Whichever way they want to live, let them live.

507
00:43:34,347 --> 00:43:41,449
 Now the next greatest enemies of Hanumanji are drunkards.

508
00:43:43,326 --> 00:43:48,851
Those who drink, are put to flames like Lanka.

509
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:55,260
Say, you see those who drink

510
00:43:55,448 --> 00:43:58,161
nobody will talk to them nor do anything else.

511
00:43:58,186 --> 00:44:01,325
He will collect ten more drunkards and drink.

512
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,518
And now when all of them are drinking

513
00:44:04,543 --> 00:44:08,720
 they don't have anything to eat nor to drink at their homes.

514
00:44:08,745 --> 00:44:13,274
They are drinking just like mad people.

515
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:18,473
 Those who respect Hanumanji, can't drink,

516
00:44:19,097 --> 00:44:20,097
can't drink because,

517
00:44:21,873 --> 00:44:23,811
 on the one hand, you respect Him

518
00:44:23,836 --> 00:44:25,733
 and on the other hand do the opposite, that is not possible.

519
00:44:27,194 --> 00:44:30,761
Nowadays I find that drinking is on the rise.

520
00:44:38,586 --> 00:44:41,335
 And I am so surprised , there was a senior officer

521
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:44,769
 once we went to his house,

522
00:44:45,244 --> 00:44:48,478
because both of them were friends of My Husband.

523
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:51,128
 And both husband and wife would drink.

524
00:44:51,806 --> 00:44:53,707
It was very cold.

525
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,894
 They told Me,"Stay here for the night."

526
00:44:55,919 --> 00:44:57,820
I said,"Ok, we will stay."

527
00:44:57,845 --> 00:44:59,976
 In the whole house, there was just one blanket.

528
00:45:00,001 --> 00:45:01,613
I said,"Oh! My God!"

529
00:45:01,724 --> 00:45:04,646
Just one blanket in the home of such a senior officer.

530
00:45:04,671 --> 00:45:06,806
I said," It doesn't matter to Me, I will sleep."

531
00:45:06,831 --> 00:45:10,275
Now they were worried, how to manage for My husband in one blanket.

532
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:14,235
I said," Don't worry. I will set it right."

533
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,944
They had such a great problem about themselves and their daughter

534
00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:19,487
but they were not willing to agree

535
00:45:19,512 --> 00:45:22,184
that their daughter had any problem.

536
00:45:22,216 --> 00:45:23,944
As soon as they drink

537
00:45:23,969 --> 00:45:25,480
they will start saying

538
00:45:25,505 --> 00:45:28,512
 our daughter is best of all, don't say anything.

539
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,166
That girl was in complete devastation,

540
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:32,873
 because they were under the influence of intoxication.

541
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:34,962
When intoxicated they were not are not in senses.

542
00:45:36,613 --> 00:45:40,331
That girl was completely devastated.

543
00:45:40,356 --> 00:45:42,999
 At last she came to Me just now, crying.

544
00:45:43,248 --> 00:45:45,794
She has been totally devastated.

545
00:45:47,149 --> 00:45:50,671
So it is like this that intoxication on account of drinking

546
00:45:51,005 --> 00:45:54,803
 increases intoxication all the more

547
00:45:55,964 --> 00:45:59,174
 and in that the most intoxicating thing is that

548
00:45:59,317 --> 00:46:02,489
 a man is devoid of love.

549
00:46:02,648 --> 00:46:04,483
He doesn't love anyone.

550
00:46:04,675 --> 00:46:10,646
 That is why everyone, in every religion, prohibited drinking.

551
00:46:12,385 --> 00:46:14,500
But for example, as is the case with the Christian religion

552
00:46:14,636 --> 00:46:17,453
everybody manages somehow.

553
00:46:17,478 --> 00:46:18,416
They say it is so in Hindu dharam,

554
00:46:18,441 --> 00:46:21,142
 in Christians and in Mohammedans too.

555
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:24,089
So they said that when

556
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:29,232
 Christ had gone to attend a marriage,

557
00:46:29,257 --> 00:46:31,908
in that marriage liquor was made.

558
00:46:31,933 --> 00:46:34,122
 Absolutely false!

559
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:37,284
That is why we drink.

560
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:41,307
 I was surprised in England that if anyone dies, they drink

561
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:43,627
 if anyone dies, even then they drink.

562
00:46:43,652 --> 00:46:45,994
If anyone is born, even then they drink.

563
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:48,391
 What does it mean, I can't understand.

564
00:46:49,483 --> 00:46:51,751
The habit that they have got used to

565
00:46:51,776 --> 00:46:55,637
 and drink has become like culture.

566
00:46:55,662 --> 00:46:57,460
They have to write books about drinks

567
00:46:57,485 --> 00:46:59,902
 which should be drunk when

568
00:46:59,927 --> 00:47:00,968
 not this,that

569
00:47:00,993 --> 00:47:04,201
 and  which type of glass should be used.

570
00:47:05,496 --> 00:47:09,920
Now the condition of these drunkards that I have seen

571
00:47:09,945 --> 00:47:14,387
 I think they are half human beings and half absolutely mad.

572
00:47:15,409 --> 00:47:16,724
They are mad!

573
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:19,747
 But it is getting sanctified there.

574
00:47:19,772 --> 00:47:21,821
It is topmost in France.

575
00:47:21,846 --> 00:47:23,687
It became the culture of France.

576
00:47:23,712 --> 00:47:26,534
We don't have to learn anything from them.

577
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,313
 Now what they talk about drinks;

578
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:35,200
Christ, when He went there that time,  that place

579
00:47:35,225 --> 00:47:37,702
 I have read this in HEBRU

580
00:47:37,933 --> 00:47:40,792
 that the people

581
00:47:41,475 --> 00:47:44,746
 used to drink the juice of DRAKSHA

582
00:47:44,873 --> 00:47:47,734
 means, they used to take grape juice.

583
00:47:47,891 --> 00:47:54,481
So He put His hand in water and made juice of grapes out of water.

584
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:59,025
 Does that juice ever become a drink without rotting and softening?

585
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:04,278
Can a drink ever be made in two minutes in Sahaj?

586
00:48:04,397 --> 00:48:06,631
 Till you do not rot the drink a lot

587
00:48:06,656 --> 00:48:10,385
 and the more it is rotten, the more it is costlier.

588
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:14,402
If it has been rotten for the past fifty years 
 it is all the more better.

589
00:48:14,427 --> 00:48:18,445
And if it is a hundred year old, it is rare.

590
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:22,107
 These notions about drinks were created by drunkards,

591
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:25,009
the drunkard writers and the drunkard tellers.

592
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,051
 With the lectures of the drunkards

593
00:48:29,076 --> 00:48:32,058
 don't know how many people become fools.

594
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:37,234
But I have not seen any effigy erected of 
any drunkard in any country.

595
00:48:39,505 --> 00:48:47,042
 So all these people

596
00:48:48,267 --> 00:48:52,828
 are not only against Shri Hanuman,

597
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,047
but they attack Him.

598
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,225
 Then He also shows His power,

599
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:01,220
causing such heat in his stomach.

600
00:49:01,245 --> 00:49:05,443
 It then causes Cancer and all the diseases.

601
00:49:05,468 --> 00:49:07,065
Drink more and more!

602
00:49:14,028 --> 00:49:16,654
 This drinking and serving drinks to others

603
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:20,164
 is the custom of drinking that has started.

604
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:22,952
I am scared of this.

605
00:49:22,977 --> 00:49:24,845
Manage Hanumanji

606
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:26,853
Don't know what He will do.

607
00:49:27,777 --> 00:49:30,124
What disaster He may cause

608
00:49:30,149 --> 00:49:32,384
is unpredictable.

609
00:49:33,211 --> 00:49:38,057
I am afraid that one day He may put all the drunkards in the sea,

610
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:44,542
 because  He has mercy, devotion and everything

611
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:47,282
 but those who are against Him

612
00:49:47,307 --> 00:49:49,079
 he is not for them.

613
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:51,484
For example Shri Ganesha

614
00:49:51,509 --> 00:49:55,433
 if anyone has a bad character

615
00:49:55,647 --> 00:49:58,848
 if any one acts badly

616
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:04,486
is attacked on his Mooladhara Chakra.

617
00:50:04,734 --> 00:50:07,850
 But His case is different.

618
00:50:08,096 --> 00:50:14,631
When He sees that he is playing with his own consciousness

619
00:50:14,731 --> 00:50:23,242
 by drinking- consciousness is lost- then He chases him.

620
00:50:23,747 --> 00:50:28,169
There will be conflict, quarrels and fights in homes

621
00:50:28,194 --> 00:50:31,023
 and you see there will be fights on roads if you..

622
00:50:31,078 --> 00:50:32,796
NOT CLEAR..

623
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:36,784
 two drunkards will be hitting each other

624
00:50:38,418 --> 00:50:41,350
 and then it spreads all the more.

625
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:45,827
So Sahaja Yogis should not visit any drunkard's house

626
00:50:46,206 --> 00:50:48,679
 that is an unholy place

627
00:50:48,704 --> 00:50:55,742
 nor should keep any association with any drunkard.

628
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,338
This is also fatal for Sahaja Yogis

629
00:51:00,363 --> 00:51:02,933
 because on one hand you respect Hanumanji

630
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:05,160
 and on the other hand join drunkards.

631
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:24,399
Especially in Poona, I don't know
how many types of Hanumanjis have come  here,

632
00:51:24,424 --> 00:51:29,578
people living in Poona should be very alert.

633
00:51:33,982 --> 00:51:37,148
Once a Hanumanji group had come
and requested Me to deliver a lecture.

634
00:51:37,173 --> 00:51:38,450
 I said ,"I won't come".

635
00:51:38,475 --> 00:51:39,862
They asked, “Why Mother?"

636
00:51:40,632 --> 00:51:45,134
 I told them that after having a drink you sing silly movie songs.

637
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:48,941
Do you know who is this Maruti?

638
00:51:48,966 --> 00:51:51,167
 When He will strangle throats of all of you

639
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:53,059
 then only you will come to know.

640
00:51:53,084 --> 00:51:59,966
I have heard about Ganpati programs
 that  they don't allow anyone to drink.

641
00:52:00,273 --> 00:52:02,752
 They drive away those who drink.

642
00:52:02,777 --> 00:52:04,303
Just think,

643
00:52:04,328 --> 00:52:06,682
 see their courage!

644
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:10,685
In front of Hanumanji, they do all this business

645
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:14,102
 In front of Hanumanji!

646
00:52:15,153 --> 00:52:17,589
What a courage!

647
00:52:19,216 --> 00:52:21,086
and this

648
00:52:21,504 --> 00:52:23,324
by doing everything

649
00:52:24,426 --> 00:52:27,281
people think that they get money.

650
00:52:28,508 --> 00:52:31,262
Those who deal in it

651
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:35,901
and those who drink, are its customers

652
00:52:36,401 --> 00:52:41,403
everybody somehow absolutely

653
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:48,730
useless, bankrupt , don't have a single penny

654
00:52:53,197 --> 00:52:56,020
We will say, what is there so much in drinking

655
00:52:56,045 --> 00:52:59,755
 because it is Shri Hanumanji's case.

656
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:04,405
What is the reason you are going against Hanumanji?

657
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:08,713
His power flows through your right side.

658
00:53:08,738 --> 00:53:11,985
Use that in balance.

659
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:16,395
 instead of upsetting your liver, spoil this and spoil that.

660
00:53:16,411 --> 00:53:17,949
He will definitely get upset.

661
00:53:18,551 --> 00:53:21,795
 That means it is Hanumanji's job in subtle.

662
00:53:23,414 --> 00:53:27,014
People don't understand this in reality.

663
00:53:27,212 --> 00:53:29,191
 In reality it is such

664
00:53:29,216 --> 00:53:31,310
that if you say something against drinking

665
00:53:31,335 --> 00:53:34,285
 people will run to kill you.

666
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:36,006
If you don't drink

667
00:53:36,031 --> 00:53:38,627
they will say you are a fool that you don't drink.

668
00:53:41,331 --> 00:53:50,608
Oh!  behind him is standing such great Hanumanji.

669
00:53:51,771 --> 00:53:53,589
If you attack him even once

670
00:53:53,614 --> 00:53:55,896
 you will be no more,  you will lose your life.

671
00:53:55,921 --> 00:53:58,096
 I think that if people start striking beforehand.....

672
00:53:58,135 --> 00:54:00,808
How do people talk such nonsense?

673
00:54:04,171 --> 00:54:06,854
They will repeat the same thing again and again.

674
00:54:09,021 --> 00:54:10,883
They are almost absolutely mad

675
00:54:10,908 --> 00:54:16,106
they are all together, have a party and they are all mad.

676
00:54:19,773 --> 00:54:24,670
It may be marriage or marriage procession,
 everywhere it is prevalent.

677
00:54:26,351 --> 00:54:33,512
Now the person who works

678
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:38,231
one who thinks of the future, one who is thoughtful

679
00:54:38,256 --> 00:54:41,948
 but is devoid of love towards everyone

680
00:54:42,036 --> 00:54:45,686
 has no feeling of love, he is also in trouble.

681
00:54:46,298 --> 00:54:52,208
Because  the devotee of Rama

682
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:57,411
 there is no whereabouts of Hanumanji.

683
00:55:01,134 --> 00:55:06,152
If you are a great worker

684
00:55:06,379 --> 00:55:08,385
you are a well to do person, a nice person

685
00:55:08,422 --> 00:55:11,260
but you don't have love for anyone

686
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:15,687
it won't work.

687
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:20,446
You have to love everyone

688
00:55:21,299 --> 00:55:23,062
and that is why

689
00:55:23,217 --> 00:55:28,092
 Christ has said ,"Forgive everyone."

690
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:32,446
Who are you not to forgive?

691
00:55:33,031 --> 00:55:35,301
 You yourself are not Hanumanji.

692
00:55:35,562 --> 00:55:40,133
Yes, Hanumanji is with you and He is an ideal for you

693
00:55:40,636 --> 00:55:49,124
 that He on the basis of His devotion
 has attained this high position.

694
00:55:51,227 --> 00:55:56,156
Wherever there is heat, people's brains get upset

695
00:55:57,116 --> 00:56:00,384
 and the bond of love gets disrupted.

696
00:56:02,736 --> 00:56:09,622
Every body should salute such Hanuman devotee, Shri Bajrangbali

697
00:56:12,396 --> 00:56:18,363
 and should understand that whatever powers
 we have got from Sahaja Yoga

698
00:56:18,388 --> 00:56:21,090
 we should keep in balance.

699
00:56:24,489 --> 00:56:26,712
Love is such a thing

700
00:56:26,737 --> 00:56:34,380
 that you can win over great personalities with the bond of love.

701
00:56:37,451 --> 00:56:40,188
I go on doing the same

702
00:56:40,213 --> 00:56:43,375
 because I have to face strange people.

703
00:56:44,072 --> 00:56:49,418
Now handle them with such a trick of love that they will be ok.

704
00:56:50,221 --> 00:56:52,379
Once I went somewhere.

705
00:56:52,418 --> 00:56:56,634
There was a famous but very short tempered saint;

706
00:56:56,659 --> 00:56:59,660
All of them are very short tempered.

707
00:56:59,962 --> 00:57:01,734
Then I climbed up and went there.

708
00:57:02,662 --> 00:57:06,968
He was shaking his neck in anger.

709
00:57:07,167 --> 00:57:15,186
Because he was egoistic that he could control rain.

710
00:57:15,685 --> 00:57:19,590
And as I climbed up and reached

711
00:57:19,741 --> 00:57:22,552
I was drenched completely wet in rain.

712
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:26,983
Now, he was sitting in great anger.

713
00:57:27,423 --> 00:57:29,831
I sat in his cave.

714
00:57:29,856 --> 00:57:31,820
He came and sat

715
00:57:31,845 --> 00:57:33,817
He was very angry.

716
00:57:33,842 --> 00:57:37,266
I asked,"What happened, even if I got wet?"

717
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:46,068
 He said, "You did not stop the rain to take away my ego.

718
00:57:46,093 --> 00:57:47,939
Because I can stop it.

719
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,025
I had this ego."

720
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,971
"There is nothing like that."

721
00:57:52,142 --> 00:57:57,273
I said,"You are a Saint and you have purchased a saree for Me.

722
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:03,951
I cannot take anything from a saint.

723
00:58:04,182 --> 00:58:07,019
And you cannot give Me anything.

724
00:58:07,336 --> 00:58:11,592
Then I thought it is better to get wet 
nd I will have to accept it."

725
00:58:13,447 --> 00:58:15,045
Because of that

726
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:19,524
tears came out of his eyes and he fell down at My feet.

727
00:58:20,262 --> 00:58:23,681
I said, ‘what should I have done?
 I had to just get wet.

728
00:58:23,706 --> 00:58:26,989
Otherwise I too would not have accepted it.

729
00:58:27,014 --> 00:58:28,903
 I said that it is better to get a little wet

730
00:58:28,928 --> 00:58:30,539
 then I will have to accept it’.

731
00:58:31,859 --> 00:58:34,099
Then he said, "Is it so?"

732
00:58:34,124 --> 00:58:38,708
I said you have purchased a peach coloured saree for Me

733
00:58:38,733 --> 00:58:41,520
and nauvar (nine yards) this you have done a good thing

734
00:58:41,545 --> 00:58:46,625
because My petticoat too has got wet, so I can wear this nauvar.

735
00:58:47,765 --> 00:58:50,001
He was very happy.

736
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:53,404
So, love is such a thing

737
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:58,427
 that it brings down to earth even great people fuming with anger.

738
00:59:00,033 --> 00:59:05,459
There are so many earlier examples of it.

739
00:59:05,484 --> 00:59:10,507
When they say," Basu"(Sit down),
the whole night will pass like that.

740
00:59:11,093 --> 00:59:14,025
And even now everyday it happens so.

741
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,357
Talk with love.

742
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:19,098
How does it matter?

743
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:24,410
If you love others, their good qualities will transmit to you

744
00:59:24,699 --> 00:59:34,258
 and if you hate someone, their bad qualities will transmit to you.

745
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:37,261
It is all give and take.

746
00:59:37,494 --> 00:59:41,220
 This person is like this, that person is like that

747
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:43,334
whosoever you see is not right.

748
00:59:44,935 --> 00:59:47,532
It is a custom with so many people

749
00:59:47,557 --> 00:59:49,028
It is their culture

750
00:59:49,176 --> 00:59:50,360
that if someone comes to his home

751
00:59:50,385 --> 00:59:53,355
stays, has his meals and fun and everything is over.

752
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:57,300
As soon as he leaves, comments follow that he is such a bad man.

753
00:59:57,325 --> 00:59:58,827
Next came and sat down

754
00:59:58,866 --> 01:00:00,430
especially among women it is too much prevalent.

755
01:00:01,236 --> 01:00:02,956
He comes and sits.

756
01:00:02,981 --> 01:00:05,105
You are very nice, very nice and now you can go.

757
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:06,944
Yes he is like that!

758
01:00:07,928 --> 01:00:12,259
Oh! this outward love won't work.

759
01:00:12,432 --> 01:00:18,316
If you shower artificial love, does he not understand?

760
01:00:18,922 --> 01:00:24,740
 You have got the power to love by heart as you are a Sahaja Yogi.

761
01:00:27,562 --> 01:00:33,177
And when you will imbibe this

762
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:39,634
when the tree of love will bloom by itself

763
01:00:39,861 --> 01:00:45,231
you will give joy to others and you too will enjoy its fragrance.

764
01:00:46,254 --> 01:00:50,780
Except the ocean of love, you will not like anything.

765
01:00:53,795 --> 01:00:57,427
So, what you have to learn from Bajrangbali is

766
01:00:57,452 --> 01:01:03,874
His devotion and that power which He has given to you

767
01:01:03,899 --> 01:01:08,961
that nobody can touch you if your devotion is pure.

768
01:01:09,407 --> 01:01:11,402
Nobody can touch you.

769
01:01:11,427 --> 01:01:14,499
 There are thousands of such examples in Sahaja Yoga.

770
01:01:14,524 --> 01:01:16,564
People call these miracles

771
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:21,076
 but I say that it is Shri Hanumanji's blessing.

772
01:01:24,435 --> 01:01:31,222
So, now I give My blessings and love to all of you.

773
01:01:33,045 --> 01:01:37,321
 First love yourself and then others.

774
01:01:37,346 --> 01:01:39,545
It doesn't mean my son, my this

775
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:40,302
No! No! No!

776
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:46,179
It means selfless love.

777
01:01:46,204 --> 01:01:48,721
 Love that expects no return,

778
01:01:49,781 --> 01:01:53,518
Which has no relation, is limitless.

779
01:01:53,543 --> 01:02:00,160
 Such a power of love has come to you, use it.

780
01:02:01,391 --> 01:02:03,692
Lots of blessings!

781
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:29,090
Anant Aashirvad (Limitless blessings).
