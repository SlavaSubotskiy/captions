00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,700
-

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,830
just to

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:42,870
[Music]

7
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,870
today we have gathered here

8
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:59,100
and very auspicious day to worship Shri

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:04,530
Ganesha Shri Ganesha is the first deity

10
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:10,220
that was created so that the whole

11
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:20,900
universe is filled with auspiciousness

12
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:20,900
with peace bliss and spirituality

13
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:40,710
he is the source he's the source of

14
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:45,810
spirituality as a result of that all

15
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:51,429
other things follow like when he trains

16
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:54,060
and his windy you feel the coolness in

17
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:54,060
that misfile

18
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:06,729
in the same way when Shri Ganesha emits

19
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:12,519
his power we feel all these three things

20
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:20,769
within and without I think I've told you

21
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:23,950
a lot about Havel and his nature but

22
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:28,900
still in so many of us have not yet

23
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:31,230
realized what are his powers and what he

24
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,230
wants

25
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:47,250
first and foremost thing is that to

26
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:51,660
respect Shri Ganesha is to understand

27
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:56,190
the importance of chastity chastity is

28
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:59,700
not only for the women it is more for

29
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:04,170
the men to observe if you have

30
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:07,320
self-respect in the real sense of the

31
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:10,020
word you will take to translate ly

32
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:15,930
without any difficulties because

33
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:17,820
chastity is a very joy giving any joy it

34
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,760
is not a thing that you have to tell

35
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:27,450
somebody or to force somebody or to

36
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:30,030
restrict somebody but it is to enjoy to

37
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:33,630
enjoy yourself and enjoy the chastity of

38
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:38,990
another person is such a great blessing

39
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:42,480
of Shri Ganesha such a great blessing

40
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:45,150
that you enjoy your chastity you are not

41
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,570
bothered about the another person he is

42
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:51,290
chased or not if he's doing bad things

43
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:54,120
if he's a ruined person doesn't matter

44
00:03:51,290 --> 00:04:00,660
you don't get spoiled with that you have

45
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:06,720
your own chastity your own life of very

46
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:10,440
chaste moments it is nowadays such a

47
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:14,610
modern style of thinking as a flowing

48
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:18,359
towards unchaste life and all kinds of

49
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:21,810
wrong ideas about chastity if somebody

50
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:24,650
now talks of chastity people think this

51
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:29,040
must be mad how can that be

52
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:32,030
now to understand the significance of

53
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,470
chastity within us we have to know that

54
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,440
chastity is the foundation of all

55
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:41,040
Dharma's unless and until you have sense

56
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,690
of chastity you cannot have that Dharma

57
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,930
is not possible because that's the

58
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:49,470
foundation it will be a house of cards

59
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,480
if you do not have the foundation of

60
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,500
chastity

61
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:57,260
it will just collapse in no time so is a

62
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,700
very important thing is chastity which

63
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,130
has been challenged in the West

64
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,780
throughout and that's why I'm saying

65
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,060
it's difficult to sow the seed of

66
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:08,480
chastity in this country but that is a

67
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:12,770
very important thing our whole morality

68
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:15,140
depends on our idea of chastity we

69
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,940
should be very chaste so many religions

70
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,840
have come and they have talked about

71
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:24,220
chastity but religions have become so

72
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:32,660
useless now have become without any

73
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:37,460
basis without any any proper execution

74
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:39,650
of what is written for them they do all

75
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:43,250
kinds of things and they call themselves

76
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:45,590
Hindu Muslims Christians all kinds of

77
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:48,130
religions actually the religions have

78
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:53,330
failed completely

79
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:57,680
people are sick now all over the Western

80
00:05:53,330 --> 00:06:02,620
life one feels they're sick sick because

81
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:06,080
they have never recognized Shri Ganesha

82
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:13,130
if one Freud came that doesn't mean that

83
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:16,370
you should accept him but you did as if

84
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:23,500
it was such an important thing to be

85
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:28,030
done so today we are faced with our

86
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:30,470
power of ascent and the power of

87
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,690
conditionings we have had when Freud

88
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,520
talked of conditioning he didn't know he

89
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:38,470
was putting another type of horrid

90
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,470
conditionings on terrible

91
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:49,449
six is not important for human beings at

92
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,449
all

93
00:06:49,539 --> 00:07:03,319
is not at all important and this

94
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:09,679
civility one has to that it's so much

95
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:16,039
surprising it comes from a very low

96
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:24,740
Grady within us it comes from the low

97
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:29,240
graded human beings that one becomes sir

98
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:35,769
why to it you should be the master of

99
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:39,019
that and today when I see around myself

100
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:43,759
in the West which is also part and

101
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:50,539
parcel of the same creation so much of

102
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:56,809
sickness that has come I am really

103
00:07:50,539 --> 00:08:02,479
aghast how to turn your attention now to

104
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:07,069
the maturity of sex when the sex matures

105
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:14,119
you become a father a mother and the

106
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:18,499
pure personality that doesn't mean I'm

107
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:22,729
saying austerity at young age that

108
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:26,899
doesn't mean that another absurdity is

109
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:30,459
that but of course you must mature you

110
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:30,459
need it the pasilla for that

111
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,870
six

112
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:44,240
the perversion has to be diverted

113
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:46,699
towards your family your wife and you

114
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,399
have to respect your chastity now the

115
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:53,029
whole thing becomes nothing but just

116
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:57,250
lead a chaste life not to be like a dog

117
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:57,250
but like to be like a human

118
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,370
all that attention has to become

119
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:07,830
chastity which is your power which is

120
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:16,560
your protection which is your connection

121
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:22,760
with the divine not force Chestatee but

122
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:26,760
a chastity of balance and understand

123
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:31,620
with your family with your wife

124
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:33,780
you're very chaste way we can live and

125
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,250
the women are chase men also Avengers

126
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:40,980
and this chastity is your main power

127
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:44,640
this is just T is the one is the power

128
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,560
of Shri Ganesha and when you get HT the

129
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,250
nature's power

130
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:53,320
you know how powerful you become the

131
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:56,690
innocence that is submitted

132
00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:03,950
without the chastity that women cannot

133
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:08,150
achieve anything one has to give up all

134
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:10,640
the pasta all the pasta and also the way

135
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:13,570
there is compartment from the newspapers

136
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,580
from the media from everything

137
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:20,480
recently I read a beautiful so because

138
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:25,150
that has come up that media forces

139
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:28,940
haven't in that they have said and how

140
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:31,750
this media has put ideas into the heads

141
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,750
of women

142
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:52,259
married divorced married and divorce now

143
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:56,369
what I gather that Western society is

144
00:10:52,259 --> 00:11:01,199
built up against marriages against

145
00:10:56,369 --> 00:11:08,759
families to be married according to them

146
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:10,049
it's a sin and once you are married to

147
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:13,709
get out of the scene you must do

148
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:16,439
something like that because they live

149
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:19,970
together for days together and once they

150
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:19,970
marry immediately they think of divorce

151
00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:26,040
because marriage is now so much

152
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:30,239
connected with property money is that

153
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:32,309
nonsense but the whole thing has become

154
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:35,489
so gross and after marriage there is no

155
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:37,949
question of love because how much money

156
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:39,749
goes how much part of the house goes how

157
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:42,619
many things are mine in harmony the

158
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:47,119
whole thing have become so materialistic

159
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:47,119
such marriages can never be successful

160
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:55,379
but in sahaja yoga we marry for our

161
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:58,110
ascent and we have to respect our

162
00:11:55,379 --> 00:12:02,309
marriages and to respect our chests it

163
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:08,040
is with our brothers and sisters those

164
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:12,509
people who try to somehow other way in

165
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:18,410
the purity of connectivity I assure you

166
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:22,559
will be in very very trouble hence both

167
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:25,110
so please do your soul-searching find

168
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:29,999
out if there are any impure feelings try

169
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:34,459
to throw the moment and know that you

170
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:34,459
are not possessed by such funny ideas

171
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:43,110
if you start developing a deeper

172
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:49,890
understanding then we will not be

173
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:56,160
attracted by superficial things and you

174
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:58,950
won't be distracted from your path after

175
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:02,010
getting realization you should be

176
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:04,440
absolutely chaste people you shouldn't

177
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:09,570
have your eyes roving around everywhere

178
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:13,230
and sort of what you can call a very bad

179
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:17,450
method of communicating with young women

180
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:21,660
and young men and spoiling your chastity

181
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:24,570
even your eyes should be clean even your

182
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:27,210
thoughts should be green for that you

183
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,279
should introspect and see for yourself

184
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:35,760
what mistakes were made

185
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:42,180
committing and what kind of an unchaste

186
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:47,820
behavior you have and the negative

187
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:55,320
within us disappears the light of Shri

188
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:59,550
Ganesha you can see it so clearly in

189
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,740
another person if you don't have

190
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,520
chastity you can never see who is

191
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,600
unchaste or just you cannot

192
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,339
everybody is just the same very good

193
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:14,520
very good very nice person when I

194
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:18,870
suppose I were a real possessed people

195
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:21,810
are certified as very good people in

196
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:25,520
sahaja yoga also sometimes and I start

197
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:28,290
wondering what's happening what is it

198
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:35,610
how is it these people are certified as

199
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:40,839
that can't you feel it there's no light

200
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:43,199
even if you get your realization even if

201
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,999
your spirit is working out your

202
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,779
collective consciousness even if you are

203
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:53,399
giving self-realization to others you

204
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:53,399
are nowhere if you have no chastity

205
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:01,179
that's like a broken glass which is

206
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:06,179
trying to reflect something it can never

207
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:09,429
give the right picture it's so important

208
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:12,129
and I have to tell you this now the time

209
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:18,939
has come for me to tell you this is the

210
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:21,009
snag in our life first thing people will

211
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:27,939
ask whom am I going to marry what is a

212
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:29,679
Johari of course marriage I call it an

213
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:31,300
auspicious thing marriage should be

214
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:35,679
there there should be a collective

215
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:39,100
sanction everything but for what to

216
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,649
adorn the chastity within us now

217
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:47,679
supposing you are worshiping today Shri

218
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:50,040
Ganesha so why are you worshipping Shri

219
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:50,040
Ganesha

220
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:58,140
you're worshipping because your Ganesha

221
00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:02,550
must be awakened that you should have

222
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:07,670
the qualities of Shri Ganesha that you

223
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:07,670
should feel that innocence in your eyes

224
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:13,590
otherwise you are a hypocrite if you are

225
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,860
sitting here in worshipping Shri Ganesha

226
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:24,560
and you are not trying to put your

227
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:24,560
attention to your ascent as the Ganesh

228
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:41,520
then it is useless the magnet within you

229
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:44,490
is Shri Ganesha many people know that I

230
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,050
have a great sense of direction that

231
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,680
comes through this magnet which is

232
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:56,250
perfect this magnet is the one which

233
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:57,440
keeps you sticking or existed or all the

234
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:03,570
time

235
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:06,690
pointed toward spirit if you don't have

236
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:09,480
the sense of chastity you will dangle

237
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:10,829
this way that way suddenly you become a

238
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,730
very good sahaja yogi tomorrow you

239
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:26,250
become a devil because there's nothing

240
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:31,500
that keeps you binding to the great idea

241
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:33,780
of the spirit let us face it up now the

242
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:38,040
time has come for all of us all the

243
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:42,740
sahaja Yogi's that the greatest thing

244
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,740
within us is not sex but his chest

245
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,600
once you understand the importance that

246
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:54,030
sahaja yoga you can only achieve your

247
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:58,290
ascent through purity there's no other

248
00:17:54,030 --> 00:18:00,230
way anything which is hanging on to you

249
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:03,900
will keep you down

250
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:07,670
and whatever you go start dropping it

251
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:11,340
out whether it is ego super-ego anything

252
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:15,120
but the highest of all is the purity of

253
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:22,560
your mind as far as the sex is concerned

254
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:26,970
I will give it the highest birth that's

255
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:29,700
what we call as innocence that's the

256
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:34,830
only thing that will think you are head

257
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:39,560
and so we all should try to search our

258
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:42,990
suppose you have got of course

259
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:45,600
realization you have got great qualities

260
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:48,630
you are not even aware as to what you

261
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,700
want through easy but the knowledge also

262
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:53,400
so easily didn't have to go to any

263
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:58,710
college or anything and you are capable

264
00:18:53,400 --> 00:19:01,770
of so many things but remember that the

265
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:06,450
power that is within you is cleverer

266
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:08,940
than you and anything you try to do

267
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:12,510
which is not correct which is not

268
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:14,990
righteous which is not holy it will try

269
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,990
to bear it

270
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:32,920
so try to be a different person try to

271
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:35,810
understand what is behind this person

272
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:44,170
what is the spiritual quality of this

273
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:49,010
person and then only you will know that

274
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:55,700
pure relationships are so fragrant and

275
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:57,710
so beautiful I really enjoy you people

276
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:02,110
because you have such pure relationships

277
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,110
of know yourself I have such understand

278
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,810
somewhat

279
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,810
