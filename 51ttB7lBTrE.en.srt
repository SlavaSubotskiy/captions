00:00:33,643 --> 00:00:37,813
I'll speak, I'll speak later on.
They will sing 'Jogwa'

3
00:00:38,358 --> 00:00:44,298
Just I'll explain. Jogwa you're going to
sing, na - I'll explain to them.

4
00:00:44,298 --> 00:00:47,598
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

5
00:00:50,104 --> 00:00:52,683
Shri Mataji: [MARATHI - STOP?]

6
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:10,539
I'm happy you're enjoying this music and
they want to give you, render some more

7
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:23,182
because I think, Philip has already explained,
Interpreter: [GERMAN]

8
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:29,608
Shri Mataji: so I don't have to talk too much then.
Interpreter: [GERMAN]

9
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,179
Shri Mataji: This Jogwa they are singing,
is a song written about 16th century

10
00:01:37,635 --> 00:01:47,245
by a poet called Namadeva
Interpreter: [GERMAN]

11
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:57,527
Shri Mataji: and he was a tailor and he
went to see another saint, who was a potter

12
00:01:58,102 --> 00:02:03,982
Interpreter: [GERMAN]

13
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:10,492
Shri Mataji: So when he saw the potter,
he just stood silent and he said,

14
00:02:11,024 --> 00:02:19,874
in Marathi language it is, 'That I came to
see the Formless,' that is the vibrations,

15
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:25,590
'I came to see the vibrations but here,
I find vibrations in Form."

16
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:37,460
[INTERPRETER - GERMAN]

17
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:44,526
Shri Mataji: So, what an appreciation of another
saint; Only a saint can do that, real saint.

18
00:02:45,238 --> 00:02:51,318
[INTERPRETER - GERMAN]

19
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:55,657
Shri Mataji: So the saintliness is a state
- you cannot certify it. It's a state.

20
00:02:56,426 --> 00:03:00,616
[INTERPRETER - GERMAN]

21
00:03:02,143 --> 00:03:10,993
Shri Mataji: So you have to be, you'll be listening
to this song, which was written by Namadeva

22
00:03:10,993 --> 00:03:19,687
and later on he went to Punjab and also, at that
time, Gurunanaka saw another saint coming in.

23
00:03:21,398 --> 00:03:31,752
[INTERPRETER - GERMAN]

24
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:37,422
Shri Mataji: So he said that, "Now you're
such a great saint and such a great poet,

25
00:03:37,422 --> 00:03:42,466
so why don't you write in Punjabi
language?" So he studied Punjabi language

26
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:49,113
and wrote a big book, in Punjabi
language, of lots of poetry in it.

27
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:58,698
[INTERPRETER]

28
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:06,408
[INTERPRETER]

29
00:04:06,408 --> 00:04:13,211
Shri Mataji: So the scriptures of Gurunanaka,
which He has all the, He's compiled all the

30
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:20,194
poems of the poets, of who were saints at
that time, is called as 'Guru Granth Sahab'

31
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:28,340
[INTERPRETER]
What is the name?

32
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,999
Shri Mataji: Guru Granth Sahab. Granth Sahab
is the one, which is, which is the
Holy Scripture for Sikhs.

33
00:04:34,262 --> 00:04:36,332
[INTERPRETER]

34
00:04:36,332 --> 00:04:45,299
Shri Mataji: Hmm, and in that He has put
Namadeva's poems also and that of His maid
servant, who was another saint, Janabai.

35
00:04:45,505 --> 00:04:54,875
[INTERPRETER]

36
00:04:54,875 --> 00:05:02,641
Shri Mataji: In this song he's saying that,
"O Mother, I'm asking for yoga, for the

37
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:10,168
union with the Divine." Jogwa means,
"O Mother give me the yoga of the Divine."

38
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,130
with the Divine means, the union
with the Divine.

39
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:21,938
[INTERPRETER]

40
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:25,697
Shri Mataji: I mean, Jogwa means yoga
[INTERPRETER]

41
00:05:25,697 --> 00:05:32,796
Shri Mataji: Yoga and then he says that,
"I've given up all that is a temper, which

42
00:05:32,796 --> 00:05:38,341
was my father-in-law," - like a lady he sings so.
"He was my father-in-law who was a temper,

43
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:47,651
I had uh.. attachments, who were my husband,"
like that, "I've given up all my relations to all
these things."

44
00:05:48,328 --> 00:05:55,358
[INTERPRETER]

45
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:59,412
[INTERPRETER]

46
00:05:59,412 --> 00:06:04,208
Shri Mataji: Then in the thing he says, 
"Now," - Amba is the Kundalini, so he says,

47
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:11,436
"Now rise the Kundalini - Uday, uday Ambe - Rise,
the Kundalini, rise - Uday, uday Ambe ho," like that.

48
00:06:11,436 --> 00:06:17,946
So it's sung in the villages.
[INTERPRETER]

49
00:06:17,946 --> 00:06:22,727
[INTERPRETER] should take off, take off 
Kundalini [INTERPRETER]

50
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:27,942
Shri Mataji: And for so many centuries, they have
been singing in Indian villages, this song.

51
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:32,814
[INTERPRETER]

52
00:06:32,814 --> 00:06:40,517
Shri Mataji: So because of the climate in
India, we were not so much bothered about

53
00:06:40,517 --> 00:06:46,462
the outside projection but inside
projection. Climate is very good.

54
00:06:46,462 --> 00:06:49,468
You can live in a village, 
you can live in a forest.

55
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:56,247
[INTERPRETER]

56
00:06:56,247 --> 00:07:01,046
[INTERPRETER]

57
00:07:01,077 --> 00:07:06,167
Shri Mataji: So they were meditative and
were trying to find out what is within us

58
00:07:06,396 --> 00:07:12,306
[INTERPRETER]

59
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:17,033
Shri Mataji: So the knowledge of Sahaja yoga was
available long time back, since the time of,

60
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:24,080
we can say, since the time of Shri Rama, even
earlier than that people knew about Kundalini

61
00:07:24,832 --> 00:07:33,542
[INTERPRETER]

62
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:38,246
Shri Mataji: Even recently we had a big
film Ramayana. In that also they told how

63
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:41,544
Rama was told about Kundalini by his guru

64
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:50,284
[INTERPRETER]

65
00:07:50,284 --> 00:07:56,527
Shri Mataji: But these gurus were realized souls.
They never took money, they didn't enslave people

66
00:07:56,763 --> 00:08:04,243
[INTERPRETER]

67
00:08:04,243 --> 00:08:09,147
Shri Mataji: So like that, our country was
blessed by many real saints, very great saints.

68
00:08:09,147 --> 00:08:15,023
[INTERPRETER]

69
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:20,245
Shri Mataji: And they are not good at
Science, you can say, for the outward

70
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:23,852
side of it but the inward search
was very deep.

71
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:28,784
[INTERPRETER]

72
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:33,402
Shri Mataji: So you can imagine that
background is there already.

73
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:38,573
[INTERPRETER]

74
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:45,105
Shri Mataji: So for ages, they know about
Kundalini, they know that Mother has to do that job.

75
00:08:45,322 --> 00:08:52,282
[INTERPRETER]

76
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:57,146
Shri Mataji: But as we have learnt so much
about machinery and Science from you,

77
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:03,718
which is the knowledge of the tree, you have
to also know the knowledge of the roots

78
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:10,185
[INTERPRETER]

79
00:09:10,185 --> 00:09:16,416
[INTERPRETER]

80
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:23,354
Shri Mataji: otherwise this tree will be lost
[INTERPRETER]

81
00:09:24,358 --> 00:09:28,818
Shri Mataji: and it is so simple and so
spontaneous, as you saw it yesterday.

82
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,966
[INTERPRETER]

83
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:37,219
Shri Mataji: You have worked with your
brains, now you have to work with your heart.

84
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:43,083
[INTERPRETER]

85
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:48,813
Shri Mataji: Now your brain has to love
[INTERPRETER]

86
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:53,287
Shri Mataji: That's what Sahaja yoga is.
[INTERPRETER]

87
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:57,738
Shri Mataji: So, you can hear this song and with
this song, I'm sure, you all will get realization.

88
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:04,127
[INTERPRETER]

89
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:06,804
Shri Mataji: Just take out your shoes,
so that's all.

[INTERPRETER]

You have to clap.

[INTERPRETER]

93
00:10:17,606 --> 00:10:21,731
Shri Mataji: And when they say 'Ho', you
too do the same way. That's all.

94
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:27,454
Shri Mataji: When they say 'Ho', you have
to also do the same. It will all work out.
I won't have to give a lecture.

Baba Mama: The audience can't see us.

We will stand up and sing. 
The audience can't see us.

98
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:45,821
Shri Mataji: No [MARATHI]
Some of you can stand. Some of you at the back.

99
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:51,957
No, not the musicians who are not singing

00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:56,239
