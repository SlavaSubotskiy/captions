1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:11,376
Today, we have gathered here to do
Ganesha Puja.

2
00:00:13,207 --> 00:00:17,934
I know very well that Ganesha is the symbol

3
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:23,128
of purity, of sanctity,

4
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:34,003
and worshipping the innocence.

5
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:40,495
When you are worshipping Shri Ganesh,
you have to know

6
00:00:40,696 --> 00:00:46,188
that He is the embodiment of innocence.

7
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:53,356
I wonder if we understand the meaning
of innocence or not.

8
00:00:53,946 --> 00:01:00,105
Innocence is a quality, which is innate,

9
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:05,772
which cannot be forced, which cannot
be trained into.

10
00:01:05,973 --> 00:01:13,541
It’s just a quality, innate quality,
within a human being.

11
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:21,654
When he becomes Shri Ganesha’s disciple,
he becomes an innocent person.

12
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:25,999
Maybe you say that innocent persons

13
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,536
are attacked by the cunning,
by the aggressive.

14
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:38,097
But innocence is such a great thing
that it cannot be destroyed.

15
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:44,162
Is the quality of the Spirit. Innocence is
the quality of the Spirit.

16
00:01:44,414 --> 00:01:52,834
And when this Spirit within you is
awakened, you get the power of innocence,

17
00:01:53,035 --> 00:02:00,100
by which you overcome all that is negative,
all that is wrong,

18
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:08,899
all that is detrimental to your growth,
spiritual understanding.

19
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:14,181
So to be innocent is not possible.

20
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:22,009
You have to be innocent, in the sense
that you are innately innocent.

21
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:28,125
This happens after Sahaja Yoga,
after Realization.

22
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:35,362
And your power to fight all these

23
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:40,917
wrong, negative feelings within you,
and without,

24
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:51,002
are absolutely supported, protected
by the Mother of Shri Ganesh.

25
00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:02,256
It’s difficult these days to tell somebody
about innocence.

26
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:10,015
But you know the life of Christ.
He was a innocent - innocence.

27
00:03:10,216 --> 00:03:14,743
He didn’t know what sort of people
He was around.

28
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:21,625
He thought they were all innocent. And so
He was talking to them in a manner

29
00:03:22,273 --> 00:03:32,143
that nobody who was cunning would
have done that.

30
00:03:32,344 --> 00:03:35,975
Because cunning always understand
the cunning of others.

31
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:43,552
And He said things which may not have
been understood by people;

32
00:03:43,753 --> 00:03:50,258
but whatever He said had the vibrations
of innocence.

33
00:03:50,757 --> 00:03:56,808
That should have put all these people
in a proper sense,

34
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:00,067
in a proper relationship with Him.

35
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:04,306
But somehow, that was not the time
perhaps for them

36
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:06,754
to be realized souls.

37
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:14,955
So the innocence of Ganesha was not,
that we should we say, defeated,

38
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:24,397
but was very much - created an atmosphere
of such sanctity

39
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:28,947
and beauty that you can see in the life
of Christ.

40
00:04:31,602 --> 00:04:35,858
I’m happy you all have heard about
your marriages.

41
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:42,041
Why the marriage? What is the need
to have a marriage?

42
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:46,455
After all, these days people are living
without marriage.

43
00:04:46,656 --> 00:04:50,929
But marriage means the sanctity
of marriage.

44
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:59,916
Sanctity of your physical, mental
and emotional integration.

45
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:05,643
If you do not have the sanctity and you
live with a person,

46
00:05:05,844 --> 00:05:12,932
then it is not perfect. The children you
will produce will not be all right.

47
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,694
That’s why the marriage is necessary.

48
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:21,604
And as you know, Christ went to attend
a wedding.

49
00:05:21,805 --> 00:05:25,373
Why did He pay so much attention
to a wedding?

50
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:30,924
Because that sanctifies your relationships
with each other.

51
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:36,129
Anything is all right, but relationship

52
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,897
between husband and wife have
to be sanctified.

53
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:45,858
Otherwise, the children you produce
could turn out to be anything.

54
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:54,377
They may be robbers, they may be cheats,
they may be liars,

55
00:05:54,578 --> 00:06:00,815
they may be very, very cruel people,
if there’s no sanctity about the marriage.

56
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:05,186
That’s why He went to sanctify the marriage
institution.

57
00:06:05,387 --> 00:06:11,006
But is absolutely wrong and nonsense
that He created alcohol.

58
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:21,010
What He did was to change the water
into the taste of grape juice.

59
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:25,323
“Alcohol” is called as “grape juice”
in Hebrew language.

60
00:06:25,524 --> 00:06:33,604
You can say it is not called, but “wine”
means alcohol

61
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:38,330
as well as grape juice. But it cannot be,

62
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:43,393
because instantly you cannot create
alcohol.

63
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:47,686
Alcohol takes time, it has to rot
and rot and rot.

64
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:55,080
Then it becomes an alcohol. But if Christ
has made it

65
00:06:55,281 --> 00:07:02,877
 in such a sahaj manner, spontaneously,
how can it be an alcohol that intoxicates?

66
00:07:03,078 --> 00:07:06,311
So, many people, specially in Christian
religion,

67
00:07:06,512 --> 00:07:12,780
believe that Christ sanctified wine,
which is absolutely wrong.

68
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:17,123
He never sanctified alcohol. He changed

69
00:07:17,324 --> 00:07:26,018
the grape juice into wine tasting.

70
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:29,780
The other day, I happened to meet person,

71
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:32,828
as you know him, Romano Battaglia.

72
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,295
And he said: “Mother, You give me
Realization”.

73
00:07:37,496 --> 00:07:40,737
I said: “Alright, get me some water.”

74
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:45,471
Brought some water, I put my fingers
into it.

75
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:50,237
And then he tasted and said: “Mother,
it tastes like wine!” I said: “That’s it!

76
00:07:50,438 --> 00:07:56,331
That’s what Christ has done.” So,
there is no sanctity of alcohol.

77
00:07:56,532 --> 00:08:01,386
How can you expect Christ to do
something like that,

78
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:05,895
by which your awareness absolutely
goes wrong.

79
00:08:06,462 --> 00:08:10,436
Those people who drink, you know,
are not normal people.

80
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:14,628
Something goes wrong with their brains.
When they drive, they create problems.

81
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:23,046
When they are talking to somebody,
you can make out that they are not normal.

82
00:08:23,247 --> 00:08:25,487
They try to be very aggressive,

83
00:08:25,688 --> 00:08:30,569
sometimes they can be very passive also.
Mostly they are very aggressive,

84
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:37,011
and very much behaving in a manner
that doesn’t behove a human being.

85
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:41,995
So, we must understand that

86
00:08:42,196 --> 00:08:46,315
this wine, so-called, which is being
fermented for days together,

87
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:51,571
is very wrong and against the spiritual
life.

88
00:08:52,723 --> 00:09:01,921
All those countries where alcohol
is accepted as a very sanctified thing,

89
00:09:02,122 --> 00:09:05,948
are just going to dogs.

90
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,386
It is against Shri Ganesh. It’s against
innocence.

91
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:15,893
And so, such a person can become
very cunning, very shrewd,

92
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:20,721
very dominating – all kinds of bad things
can come through him.

93
00:09:20,922 --> 00:09:26,362
And one cannot trust a person who drinks
and becomes a drunkard.

94
00:09:26,563 --> 00:09:31,686
He can get after his wife, his children,
anybody.

95
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:37,986
And try to destroy their lives, because
he knows he is himself destroyed.

96
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:44,073
So the one thing one has to understand,
innocence doesn’t allow you

97
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:48,964
to have anything like that, that goes
against your awareness.

98
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:54,436
Your human awareness is very important.
That must be respected.

99
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:59,405
Anything that you take that spoils
your awareness or spoils your health

100
00:09:59,606 --> 00:10:04,179
is all wrong for - specially for sahaj
yogis.

101
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,311
You have to keep your health all right.
How do you keep your health all right?

102
00:10:09,512 --> 00:10:16,044
By avoiding all such things – those which
destroy your health.

103
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:19,901
So the married life is a sanctified life.

104
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:24,534
Is a life which is been blessed.

105
00:10:24,735 --> 00:10:29,964
Now we have peace, but I would say
in Sahaja Yoga, they are all blessed by Me.

106
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:36,401
So one should understand that this is
a very big thing that you have got.

107
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:41,237
But there are many I have known, who come
round saying: “Mother, we want a divorce.

108
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:45,249
We are trying to make up a good marriage…”

109
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,458
All kinds of stories they tell Me.

110
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,132
If you know it’s a sanctified marriage –

111
00:10:52,359 --> 00:11:02,706
is a marriage which is been done under
all the ceremonies of Sahaja Yoga –

112
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:09,882
it cannot be a bad marriage. But if you
are bad, nobody can help you.

113
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:15,538
If you have funny ideas about marriages,
you should try to correct it.

114
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:19,182
If you want to marry in Sahaja Yoga,
then please see

115
00:11:19,383 --> 00:11:24,339
that you respect the sanctity of married
life.

116
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,811
I know, sometimes women can be bad,

117
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:31,081
men can be bad, there can be problems.

118
00:11:31,282 --> 00:11:35,893
But a person who is wise will try
to endure all that.

119
00:11:36,094 --> 00:11:43,897
Because she wants or he wants to respect
the sanctity of marriage.

120
00:11:46,368 --> 00:11:51,624
This one is a very contradictory thing
then, which comes to,

121
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:55,532
that Christ was born without the marriage.

122
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:59,865
And Ganesha was also born without
the marriage.

123
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:04,022
They Themselves are sanctity.

124
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,386
They don’t need any sanctity from outside.

125
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:11,085
They are innocence, and for innocent
people,

126
00:12:11,286 --> 00:12:18,995
They don’t need any kind of a ritual
or a kind of a ceremony.

127
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:25,128
That’s how They have been born,
absolutely pure, of innocence.

128
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:30,284
But that doesn’t mean that we should
take Their example into ourselves.

129
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:34,694
They were divine personalities, and They
were to be born like that.

130
00:12:34,895 --> 00:12:40,797
While we have to be sanctified and leading
a sanctified life.

131
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:46,376
This is a difference between an incarnation
and a human being.

132
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:54,174
Is easy to criticise incarnations.
Very simple to criticise Them.

133
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:58,174
All incarnations have been criticised
by human beings,

134
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,346
because human beings cannot understand
Them.

135
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:07,436
But try to be really very pure and
innocent,

136
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:12,608
 and then you will understand that why
Their lives were on a different line,

137
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:15,291
different style.

138
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:24,513
Now, if you say: “We can develop
innocence, Mother”, you cannot.

139
00:13:25,144 --> 00:13:29,717
Which is the way to become innocent?
In Sahaja Yoga,

140
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:36,647
we have a proper method how we can
become innocent.

141
00:13:36,848 --> 00:13:43,678
It happens through our thoughtless
awareness.

142
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:47,823
If you are in the state of thoughtless
awareness,

143
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:51,256
then what happens, you do not react.

144
00:13:51,457 --> 00:13:56,657
You do not get involved into wrong things.

145
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:03,002
You do not get involved into any
discussions, arguments. But you just watch.

146
00:14:03,203 --> 00:14:06,209
And the innocence within you rises
beautifully,

147
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:11,228
like a lotus rises out of a dirty pond.

148
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,002
So, whatever may be the circumstances,

149
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:18,850
when you are in thoughtless awareness,
you do not react.

150
00:14:19,051 --> 00:14:25,620
That is the sign of innocence. And people
who do not react keep young.

151
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:28,952
They will never show their age,
they keep young.

152
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:38,737
Because to react is not a very good thing,

153
00:14:38,938 --> 00:14:43,565
which makes you get involved into
another person.

154
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:49,291
But if you don’t react, if you are just
watching, and you are a witness,

155
00:14:49,492 --> 00:14:53,565
then you don’t get involved into anything.
You are away from everything.

156
00:14:53,766 --> 00:15:00,485
And that’s how your innocence grows
and you get very confident.

157
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:07,602
I’ve read a story about a Chinese king,
who went

158
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:17,397
to a saint, and asked Him that he wants
some boon from Him. He said, “What?”

159
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:23,737
He said: “I want my son to be developed
into a person

160
00:15:23,938 --> 00:15:26,788
who can face all kinds of people.

161
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:30,737
Whatever people may do, he should
be able to face them”.

162
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:34,457
He said: “Alright, you leave your son
with me”.

163
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:39,475
So, when the arguments started,
when the fighting started,

164
00:15:39,676 --> 00:15:41,487
his son was just standing straight,

165
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:44,545
watching everything in thoughtless
awareness.

166
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:52,170
So, everybody from the arena went back,
they all went away.

167
00:15:52,371 --> 00:16:00,021
And they couldn’t stand the innocence
of this boy, who was very young.

168
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:04,064
And the king was surprised how his son
could face

169
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:08,209
all of them, all their arguments,
all their aggression

170
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,623
and all kinds of horrible things
they said to him.

171
00:16:12,824 --> 00:16:18,701
If anybody says anything to you, you should
just be innocent.

172
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:22,713
At that time, your power of innocence
will show

173
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:27,517
that this person, who is trying
to dominate you,

174
00:16:27,718 --> 00:16:32,052
to trouble you, is very much in the wrong.

175
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:37,646
And the person himself might realise that:
“I’m doing all these things

176
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:42,952
and this fellow, the one on whom I’m trying
to dominate,

177
00:16:43,153 --> 00:16:45,470
is not taking any note of it.”

178
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:50,050
So he feels very weak.

179
00:16:50,251 --> 00:16:53,511
He thinks he has no power to dominate
a person.

180
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,882
So this is we have now as sahaj yogis:

181
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,745
we can get into thoughtless awareness.

182
00:16:59,946 --> 00:17:03,952
Try to reduce your reactions, reaction
to anything.

183
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:09,265
People have such funny ideas about
themselves that they react.

184
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:13,859
Now for example, somebody showed me
those carpets,

185
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,933
I’ve started watching, I was very happy.
And they told me

186
00:17:18,134 --> 00:17:23,206
all the sahaja yoginis have made these
with their hands, so beautifully.

187
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:28,273
I mean, it was really so joyful to know
that they have done it.

188
00:17:28,474 --> 00:17:35,167
But if I was a very normal person, I would
have said: “Oh, My God,

189
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:39,097
what a colour! What a thing!” and all
that ... like that.

190
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:43,030
So whatever they have done, I can’t even
enjoy that.

191
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:49,015
One thing is the enjoyment is lost.
For a child, enjoyment is complete.

192
00:17:49,216 --> 00:17:54,741
Whatever he sees, he makes a joy,
joyful thing out of it.

193
00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:58,620
You look at children - I’ve seen children,

194
00:17:58,821 --> 00:18:01,605
they find anything, they make a toy
out of it.

195
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:08,136
The other day, we had gone to Genoa and
I saw there were big blockets kept there.

196
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,234
Some children came from somewhere.
They just climbed on that

197
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:14,441
and made horses out of them. And were
enjoying them.

198
00:18:14,642 --> 00:18:17,085
You see, they find anything, any space,

199
00:18:17,286 --> 00:18:22,460
they make a joyful thing for them to,
a play for them.

200
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:30,894
For them, life is also a play.
Just a thing of enjoyment.

201
00:18:31,095 --> 00:18:33,749
And they make you also enjoy everything.

202
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:39,023
If you are not in a good mood, they’ll
come and behave in such a manner

203
00:18:39,224 --> 00:18:48,882
that you’ll have to come round and become
a very simple, natural person.

204
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:52,089
So to see, a simple natural person,
we always say:

205
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,976
“See, they are like children”. Means they
do not understand the cunning.

206
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:01,632
They do not understand the stupidity
of the people,

207
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:04,894
and they live in their own world
of innocence.

208
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:11,773
In the same way, all the Sahaja Yogis
have to develop that aura around them.

209
00:19:11,974 --> 00:19:17,062
Let people see you, how innocent you are,
how sweet you are!

210
00:19:17,263 --> 00:19:22,390
No arguments, no quarrelling, no fighting
is needed.

211
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:28,898
It is just the inner satisfaction
of thoughtless awareness.

212
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:31,710
Many people say: “Mother, we cannot
become thoughtless!”

213
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:34,284
Why? Why can’t you become thoughtless?

214
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:39,198
Because all the time, whatever you see,
you want to react.

215
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:42,726
If you gradually start stopping reaction -

216
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:46,027
introspect yourself, see for yourself.

217
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:55,618
If you are all the time trying to react,
tell your mind to behave itself.

218
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,784
If there’s any reaction, you just don’t say
anything. Keep quiet.

219
00:20:00,985 --> 00:20:04,933
Gradually, you’ll be amazed and surprised

220
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:12,581
how you become thoughtlessly aware,
how beautiful you become.

221
00:20:12,782 --> 00:20:16,964
And everybody who sees you will know that

222
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:21,312
you are something different – you are not
like the normal person.

223
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:25,617
But the normal reaction of human beings is
this, that, if there’s a quarrel going on,

224
00:20:25,818 --> 00:20:32,156
say, on the street, everybody will join in
the quarrel. They like to fight.

225
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:39,344
They want to be part and parcel of that
quarrel or fight or whatever it is.

226
00:20:39,545 --> 00:20:41,777
They don’t want to get out of it.

227
00:20:41,978 --> 00:20:47,097
At that time, if you just have your
innocence, that will act.

228
00:20:47,298 --> 00:20:50,905
I told you, innocence is the Spirit,
and Spirit is the innocence,

229
00:20:51,106 --> 00:20:56,374
which cannot be destroyed by anything.
The fact is that it cannot be destroyed

230
00:20:56,575 --> 00:21:03,197
by anything, and it can be re-established
through Sahaja Yoga.

231
00:21:03,398 --> 00:21:06,236
You might have been a very aggressive
person,

232
00:21:06,437 --> 00:21:08,980
you might have been a very unhappy person,

233
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:14,027
you might have been a person who is
all the time disturbing others – maybe.

234
00:21:14,228 --> 00:21:19,202
But after Sahaja Yoga, you can make
your personality so sweet and beautiful,

235
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:24,242
that not only you can enjoy, but others
can also enjoy.

236
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:34,477
This innocence is something which is
absolute, honest intelligence.

237
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:45,222
It is not that it works for the purpose,
some purpose.

238
00:21:45,423 --> 00:21:50,433
But it is purposeless. It’s absolutely
purposeless.

239
00:21:50,634 --> 00:21:58,944
And thus it achieves that height of joy
because there is no purpose in anything

240
00:21:59,145 --> 00:22:03,881
It sees the futility of all kinds
of endeavours that we have,

241
00:22:04,082 --> 00:22:08,956
and it just enjoys: “Why people are running
up and down, why are they fighting?”

242
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:13,878
Just stands up and sees, that: “Why
should they do it?” – like that.

243
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,995
Some may think they are all right,

244
00:22:16,196 --> 00:22:19,476
there’s nothing wrong with them,
but it’s not so.

245
00:22:19,677 --> 00:22:24,108
Innocence is something, I told you,
is an innate quality,

246
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:30,020
and you should not deceive yourself
by thinking you are innocent.

247
00:22:30,255 --> 00:22:34,893
On the contrary, you just put some
introspection upon yourself,

248
00:22:35,094 --> 00:22:38,563
and see for yourself what have you been
doing so far,

249
00:22:38,764 --> 00:22:44,058
as far as others are concerned?
What is your attitude?

250
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:47,905
I have already talked to you about
emotional intelligence.

251
00:22:48,106 --> 00:22:52,714
Emotional intelligence is the expression
of innocence.

252
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:57,433
It is the expression of Shri Ganesha
within you.

253
00:22:57,634 --> 00:23:03,159
Children who are gifted with this will
always try to please you.

254
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,397
They know what you want, what you need.

255
00:23:06,598 --> 00:23:09,823
They’ll give you all the joy that you want,

256
00:23:10,024 --> 00:23:13,569
they’ll do all the things that you like,
just to please you.

257
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:18,601
They don’t have their own wants. They don’t
want to have their own demands.

258
00:23:18,802 --> 00:23:22,972
They never say: “I want this”,
“You do for me” – never!

259
00:23:23,173 --> 00:23:27,542
They just want to see what you want,
what do you want to have.

260
00:23:27,743 --> 00:23:33,854
And they put all the effort to supply you
with that, whatever you want.

261
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:37,101
It’s very interesting how the children
behave

262
00:23:37,302 --> 00:23:45,448
towards others, elders. Just like, I would
say, a great understanding, we should say,

263
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:49,780
like a very elderly personality.

264
00:23:49,981 --> 00:23:54,062
So, in innocence, you become extremely
grown up, matured.

265
00:23:54,263 --> 00:23:57,331
Very matured. With that maturity you know

266
00:23:57,532 --> 00:24:02,222
what this person needs, and what
the other person should not have.

267
00:24:02,423 --> 00:24:05,312
And the way they establish is very
interesting.

268
00:24:05,513 --> 00:24:09,534
Children are the most interesting things,
I think, in the world.

269
00:24:09,735 --> 00:24:15,636
For me, roses are very beautiful, but
children are the most interesting things.

270
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:22,116
And they teach you so many things that
you are surprised at their innocence.

271
00:24:22,317 --> 00:24:27,054
So many jokes are there about the children
– how they behave, how they talk.

272
00:24:27,255 --> 00:24:32,015
And they are so innocent that they will
tell everything to everyone.

273
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:38,491
They have no way of hiding anything,
it’s very difficult.

274
00:24:38,692 --> 00:24:46,085
I know one joke: when a gentleman
came to the house for dinner.

275
00:24:46,286 --> 00:24:49,809
So the child was looking at him
very intensely.

276
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:53,738
And then he says: “Mother, he doesn’t eat

277
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:57,844
like a horse, as you told me!”.
So everybody was shocked!

278
00:24:58,045 --> 00:24:59,629
“You see, he doesn’t eat like a horse!”.

279
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,110
Mother must have told him: “He eats
like a horse”.

280
00:25:02,311 --> 00:25:05,004
So he looked at him: “He doesn’t
eat like a horse!”. You see,

281
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:08,695
they are so innocent sometimes,
they say things,

282
00:25:08,896 --> 00:25:11,684
by which you can get exposed completely.

283
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:17,387
There are so many jokes about it. And if
you write some books,

284
00:25:17,588 --> 00:25:22,297
writing the jokes of children, I tell you,
people will just enjoy it.

285
00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:27,945
Because so innocently they say things,
which are nothing but the truth.

286
00:25:28,146 --> 00:25:32,250
And they cannot tell lies. They are
so truthful,

287
00:25:32,451 --> 00:25:37,070
that’s the quality of innocence.
They never tell lies.

288
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:39,488
“You did this?” “Yes, I did.”

289
00:25:39,689 --> 00:25:44,047
“You didn’t do this?” “No, I didn’t do.”
They never tell lies.

290
00:25:44,248 --> 00:25:53,333
It is we, the grown-ups teach them to how
to tell lies, how to be cheating.

291
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:58,047
Then we teach also our children another
bad thing,

292
00:25:58,248 --> 00:26:01,379
that is, “You must possess everything.”

293
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,871
Especially in the West, is a thing they do.

294
00:26:06,072 --> 00:26:11,595
They tell the child that: “This is yours,
you should not give it to anyone,

295
00:26:11,796 --> 00:26:13,965
this is your own.”

296
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:19,106
On the contrary, you should tell them:
“You can do what you like.”

297
00:26:19,307 --> 00:26:20,790
Leave it to their innocence.

298
00:26:20,991 --> 00:26:24,723
You’ll be amazed, they’ll give up
everything that they have.

299
00:26:24,924 --> 00:26:28,500
In such a beautiful manner they’ll behave,
that you’ll be amazed

300
00:26:28,701 --> 00:26:36,035
how they try to please everyone, and try
to do something to entertain you.

301
00:26:36,236 --> 00:26:40,742
All their capacity of this is so great
that sometimes

302
00:26:40,943 --> 00:26:45,367
one wonders how these little things
have developed these capacities.

303
00:26:45,568 --> 00:26:49,879
It is the blessings of Shri Ganesha.
Is His blessings

304
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:57,227
that children are so very sweet and
so much entertaining, and so beautiful.

305
00:26:57,428 --> 00:27:00,848
Try to become like them. We have to be
like them.

306
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:04,813
You might have read many books, you might
have got lots of degrees,

307
00:27:05,014 --> 00:27:09,680
you might be something great, but you are
not a childlike.

308
00:27:09,881 --> 00:27:18,027
You have to be a childlike person.
Otherwise, no one likes your company.

309
00:27:18,228 --> 00:27:22,047
We call them bores. But actually boring
comes with the people

310
00:27:22,248 --> 00:27:27,421
who have no innocence in their heart.
They are trying to tell you:

311
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,891
“You must do this. If you want to be
successful, you do that.”

312
00:27:33,092 --> 00:27:35,957
All these lectures are useless
for children.

313
00:27:36,158 --> 00:27:40,469
In the same way, it should be within
your own understanding

314
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,590
that it’s all nonsense they are talking.

315
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:47,719
As the children don’t care for what
you suggest to them –

316
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,297
to be nasty, to be horrid – in the same
way, if you are innocent

317
00:27:52,498 --> 00:27:56,723
you will not accept it. You may listen
to anything,

318
00:27:56,924 --> 00:28:00,735
let them tell you anything they want to,
doesn’t matter.

319
00:28:00,936 --> 00:28:05,451
You’ll never do that, because you cannot,
because you are innocent.

320
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:09,551
And the innocence will guard you, it will
give you proper guidance

321
00:28:09,752 --> 00:28:12,735
what is to be done, what is not to be
done.

322
00:28:12,936 --> 00:28:18,961
Now try to introspect and see for yourself:
“Are you innocent or not?”

323
00:28:19,162 --> 00:28:24,561
People think that somebody is trying
to overpower you,

324
00:28:25,045 --> 00:28:32,125
is trying to harm you, is trying to put
you down.

325
00:28:32,326 --> 00:28:34,953
Nobody can put down innocence.

326
00:28:35,154 --> 00:28:40,770
Innocence is a quality that survives
all kinds of nonsense.

327
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:48,892
And not only that, but age, your health,
your mind,

328
00:28:49,725 --> 00:28:55,414
your thinking, and your emotions,

329
00:28:55,615 --> 00:29:02,166
are extremely innocent and you enjoy
yourself.

330
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:08,534
Nowadays, there’s a big wave

331
00:29:11,141 --> 00:29:14,567
of shamelessness. Sometimes they have.

332
00:29:16,127 --> 00:29:19,031
The people I’ve seen, they have no Lajja.

333
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,801
I don’t know, some men want to attract
women

334
00:29:22,002 --> 00:29:26,184
and some women want to attract men.
Children never do like that.

335
00:29:26,385 --> 00:29:30,453
They don’t know what is this ‘to attract
men’ or ‘to attract women’,

336
00:29:30,654 --> 00:29:36,895
 or ‘attract’ anyone. They’ll try to please
the dog, they’ll try to please a horse,

337
00:29:37,096 --> 00:29:43,590
but they never I’ve seen going all out
to attract someone.

338
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:49,682
The reason is this, that their self-esteem
is complete.

339
00:29:50,521 --> 00:29:53,340
They know about themselves fully.

340
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,481
So why should they do all this nonsense

341
00:29:55,682 --> 00:30:01,371
of running after women, running after men
and creating problems for themselves?

342
00:30:01,572 --> 00:30:05,860
Their self-esteem is complete. Innocence
is like that.

343
00:30:06,061 --> 00:30:09,813
It gives you a complete self-esteem.

344
00:30:10,014 --> 00:30:14,438
You don’t bow to anyone, nor you make
anybody else to bow.

345
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:19,313
 This is the beauty of innocence, which
works out so well within you.

346
00:30:19,514 --> 00:30:24,488
That’s why I always say that: “Worship
Shri Ganesha!”

347
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:32,485
I know of somebody who was very highly
placed.

348
00:30:32,686 --> 00:30:39,305
And suddenly I was surprised how
he was paralysed.

349
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:45,436
What happened? He was a very good man,
he should not have been paralysed.

350
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:55,579
Then I found out that he had very bad
intentions about women,

351
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:59,797
and that’s how he got this problem.

352
00:30:59,998 --> 00:31:04,621
So I told him: “You’d better worship
Ganesha. You worship Shri Ganesha”.

353
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:08,727
Worshipping the Shri Ganesha improves
your Mooladhara,

354
00:31:08,963 --> 00:31:16,934
improves your sense of shame, improves
of your own dignity, self-esteem.

355
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:22,922
You dress up in a way that shows that
you respect your body.

356
00:31:23,123 --> 00:31:28,113
You talk in such a way that shows that
you respect your tongue,

357
00:31:28,314 --> 00:31:33,485
your language. You cannot have a foul
mouth if you are an innocent person.

358
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:41,016
Cannot have a mind that can abuse
or can say horrible words.

359
00:31:41,217 --> 00:31:46,781
I have seen, in America, they talk in such
a funny manner that you are shocked.

360
00:31:46,982 --> 00:31:52,250
There’s no need to use these dirty words
to express yourself.

361
00:31:52,451 --> 00:31:57,727
With that, your tongue gets spoiled.
So innocence is gone from your tongue.

362
00:31:57,928 --> 00:32:00,059
If you have lost innocence from
your tongue,

363
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:04,391
whatever you say will never come true –
will never come true.

364
00:32:04,592 --> 00:32:07,606
But if you are innocent, and your tongue
is innocent

365
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:11,188
and respects… So the basic, as you
can see,

366
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:14,082
is respect your innocence in every manner.

367
00:32:14,283 --> 00:32:20,317
Like, when you have to get angry with
somebody or say something,

368
00:32:20,518 --> 00:32:22,438
just keep quiet is the best way.

369
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:28,719
Or else you must respect your tongue,
respect your eyes.

370
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:33,953
Some people have a very bad habit of roving
their eyes all over, looking at women;

371
00:32:34,154 --> 00:32:38,977
or some women are like that. You don’t
respect your eyes,

372
00:32:39,178 --> 00:32:44,703
then they develop problems of the eyes.
Not only that, but mind also.

373
00:32:44,904 --> 00:32:51,930
Mind gets so much ruined by this kind
of behaviour that it has no sense.

374
00:32:52,131 --> 00:32:56,641
It cannot enjoy anything. Such a person
cannot enjoy anything.

375
00:32:56,842 --> 00:33:04,232
If you are a person who respects your eyes,
your nose, your ears –

376
00:33:05,197 --> 00:33:10,824
I tell you, you’ll be amazed. Everything is
so enjoyable.

377
00:33:11,025 --> 00:33:14,266
In this world there are so many things
to be enjoyed.

378
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:17,238
But people can’t hear anything that is
good.

379
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:20,477
There are birds who are chirping –
they can’t hear.

380
00:33:20,678 --> 00:33:23,356
There are trees, which are growing,
they can’t see.

381
00:33:23,557 --> 00:33:27,129
There are flowers, which have fragrance –
they cannot smell.

382
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:31,649
Because they are so much low
in their self-esteem,

383
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,309
because they are very low-level people,
I should say,

384
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,547
who cannot enjoy everything around.

385
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:41,414
And they should be a source of enjoyment.

386
00:33:41,615 --> 00:33:45,457
You see children, how they are source
of enjoyment!

387
00:33:45,658 --> 00:33:49,547
Anybody who comes on the stage and
runs about, I mean, how we enjoy.

388
00:33:49,748 --> 00:33:52,684
Why? Why do we enjoy a child running
about?

389
00:33:52,885 --> 00:33:57,512
We don’t say he’s gone amuck, or he’s
drunk, but we enjoy the child. Why?

390
00:33:57,713 --> 00:34:02,578
What is the sweetness of that child that
makes us so happy?

391
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:07,496
Because that’s innocence. His power
is innocence.

392
00:34:07,697 --> 00:34:12,652
With that power, he is just looking
so sweet, so beautiful

393
00:34:12,853 --> 00:34:16,188
that it gives us the real joy within us.

394
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:21,367
So the second thing is that innocence
is joy-giving.

395
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:26,898
Innocence gives joy to people. Anything
said innocently,

396
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:32,430
anything done innocently is very,
very joy-giving.

397
00:34:32,631 --> 00:34:40,309
And, in that, you see the person
so transparent, so beautiful,

398
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:49,984
that you enjoy that transparency and
that sanctified innocence.

399
00:34:50,185 --> 00:34:53,309
That’s why Ganesha is worshipped first.

400
00:34:53,510 --> 00:35:00,500
Because Ganesha was the first Deity
that was created by Adi Shakti.

401
00:35:00,701 --> 00:35:06,688
Because, if She has to create something,

402
00:35:06,889 --> 00:35:09,410
She must know that there has to be
power of innocence.

403
00:35:09,611 --> 00:35:13,797
Otherwise people will go wrong, they’ll
do all kinds of wrong things.

404
00:35:13,998 --> 00:35:18,328
So first She created Ganesha, whose
innocence –

405
00:35:18,529 --> 00:35:24,063
you can call the vibrations – are so strong
that it controls.

406
00:35:24,264 --> 00:35:28,355
Of course, there are people who have
abandoned completely

407
00:35:28,556 --> 00:35:32,957
their innocence and they think no end
of themselves. Just forget about them!

408
00:35:33,158 --> 00:35:39,754
But normally, normally, you are always
guided by your innocence,

409
00:35:39,955 --> 00:35:45,207
whether you are aware of it or not,
and that is such a sweet thing.

410
00:35:45,408 --> 00:35:48,760
Such a sweet thing that it makes

411
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:52,586
people rise in their nobleness,
in their greatness.

412
00:35:52,787 --> 00:35:57,539
And that is what we have to develop in us,
the sahaj yogis.

413
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:01,465
When sahaj yogis go anywhere, try to do
anything,

414
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:03,973
meet anybody, any social work

415
00:36:04,174 --> 00:36:09,836
anything, people should feel that joy that
you have within yourself.

416
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:13,447
It’s for that joy only

417
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:18,582
the Adi Shakti created Shri Ganesha.

418
00:36:18,783 --> 00:36:23,957
Because that joy within, of innocent joy,
which doesn’t harm anybody,

419
00:36:24,158 --> 00:36:27,156
which doesn’t expect anything, which
doesn’t demand anything,

420
00:36:27,357 --> 00:36:32,988
which doesn’t want anything, but just
emitting joy all over -

421
00:36:33,189 --> 00:36:36,285
that sort of a personality you should have.

422
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:39,578
There’s nothing wrong in wearing good
dresses,

423
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:42,367
nothing wrong in eating good food,

424
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:47,070
nothing wrong in having conversations
with people.

425
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:51,813
But in all that, it is the respect
of the innocence,

426
00:36:52,037 --> 00:36:54,848
the expression of innocence should be
there.

427
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:59,469
With this innocence we can solve
the problems –

428
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,199
all the problems of the world can be
solved.

429
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,703
That’s why Shri Ganesha is so important.

430
00:37:05,904 --> 00:37:11,977
If you do not have proper understanding
of Shri Ganesha,

431
00:37:12,178 --> 00:37:18,664
and if your Shri Ganesha is in a jeopardy,
I don’t know what can happen to you.

432
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:24,164
These days, see, so many horrible diseases
are coming,

433
00:37:24,365 --> 00:37:29,258
because they are not sanctified. Their
relationships are not sanctified.

434
00:37:29,459 --> 00:37:33,770
Every relationship has to be sanctified
with your innocence.

435
00:37:33,971 --> 00:37:38,512
Like, you have a sister, you have a mother,
you have a brother,

436
00:37:38,713 --> 00:37:42,684
you have a father, you have all these
relationships.

437
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:47,539
And these all relationships they are
so good, so beautiful and sanctified,

438
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:52,297
because there is the relationship
of innocence.

439
00:37:52,498 --> 00:37:57,773
You love your father out of innocence, and
you love your daughter out of innocence,

440
00:37:57,974 --> 00:38:02,367
you love your mother out of innocence.
Why should you love,

441
00:38:02,568 --> 00:38:06,191
for some sort of a gain? Then it’s
cunning.

442
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:12,504
For some sort of an overpowering?
Then it’s cunning.

443
00:38:12,705 --> 00:38:17,105
It’s just for love’s, love’s sake. That’s
possible if you are innocent.

444
00:38:17,306 --> 00:38:21,078
So now I’m happy: tomorrow you are
all going to get married.

445
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:23,871
And those people who are getting married
should understand

446
00:38:24,072 --> 00:38:27,625
that it’s a sanctified marriage.
It’s very important.

447
00:38:27,826 --> 00:38:34,457
It’s not like any other marriage. It’s the
marriage taking place in my presence.

448
00:38:34,658 --> 00:38:39,824
So be careful! Now, if you do not want
to marry, all right, finish it.

449
00:38:40,025 --> 00:38:42,930
You have been given a chance to know
the person, to understand it.

450
00:38:43,131 --> 00:38:47,105
But afterwards, if you try to be funny,
it’s going to be very difficult

451
00:38:47,306 --> 00:38:52,590
for you and for me. I may give up having
marriages.

452
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:58,666
So I don’t like people to talk of divorce
from the very first day.

453
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:02,848
But if there is really a problem,

454
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:08,320
it’s all right, in Sahaja Yoga, we have
allowed divorce.

455
00:39:08,521 --> 00:39:11,457
Not, say, the Catholic Church, they don’t
allow divorce.

456
00:39:11,658 --> 00:39:15,306
So men have all kinds of relationships
and women have all kinds of relationships.

457
00:39:15,507 --> 00:39:20,512
That’s not there. Instead of doing this
kind of a nonsense, you can have a divorce.

458
00:39:20,713 --> 00:39:26,130
But it should be very innocent happening.

459
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:30,649
That if you are divorcing a person because
your innocence is challenged,

460
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:35,258
it’s all right. There, I agree with you
that you should have.

461
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:37,652
So preserve your innocence.

462
00:39:37,853 --> 00:39:43,426
In these modern times, it’s very important
to preserve your innocence,

463
00:39:43,627 --> 00:39:51,273
that Shri Ganesh should be awakened
within you, and also in other people.

464
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:55,216
That is going to save this world.
Nothing else,

465
00:39:55,417 --> 00:40:00,113
but the innocence that you have,
is going to save the world.

466
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:06,020
 Whatever you may know, whatever you
may say, whatever you may write,

467
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:11,551
please see that you are not hurting
the innocence within you.

468
00:40:11,752 --> 00:40:17,926
It’s not necessary to lead a life
of morality, this, that.

469
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:20,370
What is needed is your innocence.

470
00:40:20,571 --> 00:40:26,065
Innocence itself gives you moral strength,
moral understanding.

471
00:40:26,266 --> 00:40:31,213
You don’t have to read books for that,
you don’t have to go to any guru for that.

472
00:40:31,414 --> 00:40:37,323
Innocence will guide you and tell you
that: “This is what is sahaj,

473
00:40:37,524 --> 00:40:41,901
this is what you have to have.” You all
have got Realization,

474
00:40:42,102 --> 00:40:45,225
is a very big thing, that has happened
to so many people.

475
00:40:45,426 --> 00:40:51,194
And I always want you to worship
Shri Ganesh within you.

476
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:55,584
Shri Ganesh is your innocence, it is
the Spirit within you.

477
00:40:55,785 --> 00:41:00,620
When you want to know your Spirit,
it is Shri Ganesha you become one,

478
00:41:00,821 --> 00:41:04,116
one with Shri Ganesh. It is within you,

479
00:41:04,317 --> 00:41:07,549
and is absolutely possible for all of you

480
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:15,028
to be completely enlightened by the power
of Shri Ganesha.

481
00:41:15,903 --> 00:41:19,975
I’m very happy that you have accepted
all the marriages,

482
00:41:20,176 --> 00:41:22,210
and you have decided to marry.

483
00:41:22,372 --> 00:41:26,155
But, even now, if you say no, it’s better
to finish it off.

484
00:41:26,356 --> 00:41:29,706
But don’t try any tricks, and don’t try
to be funny,

485
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:34,315
because that is not going to help you
in any way to enjoy your marriage.

486
00:41:34,516 --> 00:41:39,729
From the very first day, try to understand
that you have to be very kind.

487
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:43,702
 Kind to your partner, very respectful,

488
00:41:43,903 --> 00:41:48,373
very caring, very loving. That’s a very
important thing,

489
00:41:48,574 --> 00:41:52,073
which people don’t understand. And do not
take for granted:

490
00:41:52,274 --> 00:41:55,373
“It’s alright because it’s a sahaj
marriage”, people take it for granted.

491
00:41:55,574 --> 00:41:59,057
No, never take it for granted. If you want
to have real joy,

492
00:41:59,258 --> 00:42:03,713
then have innocent love between yourself
and enjoy yourself.

493
00:42:03,914 --> 00:42:06,536
May God bless you. Thank you.
