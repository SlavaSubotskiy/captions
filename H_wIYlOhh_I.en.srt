1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,080
For a saint, it’s said in Sanskrit,

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,400
“Udara charitanam vasudhaiva kutumbakam,”

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,400
for a person who is of a generous nature,

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,080
means a person who is a saint,

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,120
the whole world is his own family.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,240
Are you still only worried about your own family?

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,999
Then you are not yet aware of your saintliness.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,000
And a saint doesn’t only worry about his own wife,

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,800
about his own child, about his own house,

10
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:44,680
he worries about the whole world.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,200
Now, as sahaja yogi, you are a powerful entity.

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,680
You are very powerful people.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,280
We have got problems in the whole world. You know that very well.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,999
It’s not necessary you have to be great intellectuals,

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,560
or you have to be people who are

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,280
some sort of politicians, or something.

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,680
But you must be on the lookout for the problems

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,480
which are troubling this world. You have to be.

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,080
You cannot live in your own world, that you are a saint,

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,320
“Now I am in Niranand!” that’s not possible.

21
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,040
You can’t just be in Niranand.

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,999
You have to know that you have to live in this world,

23
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,999
and you have to know all the problems of this world.

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,720
And you have to think about them,

25
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:40,480
not only your problems that, “Mother

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,999
how will I be able to do this and how will I be able to do that?”

27
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,720
But you have to worry about the whole world.

28
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,040
You have to think, what’s happening in the world, what are the problems of the world.

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,999
You are responsible for that.

30
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,280
Not only that, but you have to pray.

31
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,999
In your prayers you have to say, “Mother solve this problem.”

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,040
Collectively, individually, you have to take your attention

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,040
from yourself, from your smaller life,

34
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,840
to a much wider thing – then you are a saint.

35
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:20,800
And you have to think that it is your duty to ask for Divine help,

36
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:24,800
that all these problems should be solved.

37
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:29,400
This is your job for which you are selected.

38
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,800
Your asking is going to work out

39
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:34,000
because as you know, I am desire-less.

40
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,400
You have to desire for it. Whatever you desire will work out.

41
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,080
The protection, the affection, the compassion

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
of Mother is with you.

43
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,000
But you have to look after this world

44
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,920
and show the concern that you have,

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
not to live with a very limited areas,

46
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,680
and with a very limited ways.

47
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,720
Like now the British think, British are here, all right.

48
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:05,800
“UK problems are our problems.” No

49
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:07,999
Your problems extend to

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
all the places wherever there is Sahaja Yoga.

51
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,240
And you have to worry about all of them.

52
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,999
Now we are having, say, problems in Australia.

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,920
And there’s somebody who is very troublesome.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,999
So, you have to see to it that

55
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,560
you beat that person with shoes and put that right.

56
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,400
Your leader has to tell whom to beat with the shoes.

57
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,280
And work it out, whether it is in Australia,

58
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,560
whether it is in America, whether it is in India,

59
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,800
anywhere you see that there’s a problem on Sahaja Yoga,

60
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:46,400
there’s an assault on Sahaja Yoga,

61
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,480
all of you should put your attention to it and work it out.

62
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,999
Then there are general problems as you see.

63
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,560
You see, we see that America is now becoming idiotic,

64
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,480
or whatever you may say,

65
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,200
so you have to put your attention to America.

66
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,000
You have to stretch your attention outside,

67
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,680
not inside

68
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,560
just worried about yourself, about your family,

69
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,080
about your house, about your children.

70
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,200
As soon as you spread your attention outside,

71
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,000
your problems are solved in the house,

72
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,480
in the smaller circle they are solved.

73
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,680
You have to pay attention outside!

74
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,720
Now these days there are televisions,

75
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:35,560
where, first, we had said, “Don’t see any televisions!“,

76
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,080
because there was no use seeing television by sahaja yogis.

77
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,040
When they saw the television they only got caught up.

78
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,280
But now there are important things that are happening

79
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,280
which you can see for yourself. You can scan it out,

80
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,280
what are the world problems, and you can see for yourself

81
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,680
where you have to put your attention.

82
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,200
You should become aware of your personality,

83
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,920
it’s not a personality that can be

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,999
completely involved into a very small area.

85
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,920
Your personality, is such [that it] should get involved

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,720
into all the problems of the universe,

87
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:16,999
all the problems there are.

88
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,680
And you’ll be amazed that everything can work out

89
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,480
in a very collective way.

90
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,360
And at this stage, when you are, you can see for yourself now,

91
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,080
all the sahaja yogis have got vibrations on top of their heads.
