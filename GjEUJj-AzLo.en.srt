1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:20,760
In Sahaja Yoga the Guru puja has a very different
significance from any other guru puja.

2
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:36,720
When you worship your Guru you are also worshiping
the Guru within you.

3
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:57,779
This is not in any other guru-disciple system
because, in you, the Guru, the Master has

4
00:00:57,779 --> 00:01:00,450
been awakened.

5
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:11,600
And so, when you are worshipping your Guru,
then this Master within you is also worshipped,

6
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:19,630
you respect it, you glorify it, you awaken
it, and you manifest it.

7
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:31,110
This we have to realise that – in Sahaja
Yoga – if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

8
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:45,260
Now, the quality of Guru, first and foremost,
is that he makes you meet God: means he raises

9
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:55,079
the Kundalini and establish the relation between
the All-pervading Power.

10
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:04,810
And as your Guru is Adi Shakti, you make that
person meet, also, the Adi Shakti.

11
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:13,700
So you have a double advantage that, at the
same time, when you give them Realisation,

12
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:23,300
not only that you make them feel the union
with the Divine Power, but you can make them

13
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,910
meet the Divinity Itself, the source of Divine
Power.

14
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:36,471
So your responsibility, as Sahaja Yogis, is
very great because in you is there is the

15
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:37,471
Guru.

16
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:46,169
Now in our mantras we say that, “Mother,
I am my own Guru."

17
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:53,610
But, saying that, do we realise that: if I
am my own Guru, this “I” and “my Guru,”

18
00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:00,770
between the two, what have I achieved?

19
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,749
Where am I?

20
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,750
Can I guide myself?

21
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:13,880
Have I got the light of the Spirit on my attention
so well established and manifested that I

22
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,660
can guide myself and guide others later on?

23
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:28,030
First of all, in the Guru principle it is
important that you see to yourself – the

24
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,040
introspection: Can I be my own Guru?

25
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,720
Have I become my own Guru?

26
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:52,910
Now, in your case, your Guru is a Mother,
a woman, so, it has to be among women that

27
00:03:52,910 --> 00:04:00,240
the development of their Guru qualities have
to be very well manifested.

28
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,399
But it’s just the way it is not.

29
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:14,070
For them, they are still the mothers or they
are the wives or they are Sahaja Yoginis.

30
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:19,179
But they don’t realise that you are also
the Gurus.

31
00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:32,660
And, because your Mother is a Guru, because
She is a woman; and you have to be also of

32
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,660
that quality, that people should say, “Look
at this woman, she’s such a Guru."

33
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,340
But still, as I hear from the different leaders
that the ladies are absolutely still very

34
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:46,320
much far away and are very few who can be
called as real Sahaja Yoginis.

35
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,400
It’s a sad thing to hear.

36
00:04:50,400 --> 00:05:01,130
Because if you still keep to all these mundane
things of womanhood and the drawbacks of womanhood,

37
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,940
which has come out of domination maybe, because
of always they were shown to be something

38
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,940
lower.

39
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:14,000
Specially in the Christian religion they were
never regarded as something holy.

40
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:23,050
They have this kind of a diffidence in them
that they don’t understand that dharma can

41
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,600
be established more by women than by men.

42
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:42,240
And the Guru’s work is to establish the
dharma – in the society, in the family,

43
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
in relationships.

44
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
All these Gurus, which are representing all
these great symbols here, have done nothing

45
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,420
but have established dharma.

46
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:52,560
But, first of all, before establishing the
dharma, we should watch ourselves – have

47
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,850
we got dharma within ourselves or not?

48
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:13,040
First of all, the quality of a person who
has dharma is that he listens to others, he

49
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,680
obeys.

50
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,370
And this is something [that] has gone wrong
with the Western women, I think, that they

51
00:06:18,371 --> 00:06:23,400
have forgotten how to listen to others, how
to obey others.

52
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:31,280
That’s why their children also don’t obey
them.

53
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,310
Obedience, if you do not have, nobody’s
going to obey you.

54
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,300
First, you must learn to obey.

55
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:48,739
A person like Kabira, because he was born
of a unknown cast, people didn’t know what

56
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:57,970
he was born from, and he could not go directly
to any Guru.

57
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:08,400
So, he heard about Ramanand, a great Guru
of those days, who used to go to the river

58
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,010
Ganges every morning to have his bath.

59
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:21,150
So one day on his steps Kabira kept lying,
and in the darkness the Guru could not see,

60
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,710
and he touched him with his feet.

61
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,160
He said, “Who are you?”

62
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,300
So he said, “I’m Kabir, and I’m your
disciple."

63
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,870
And he caught hold of his feet.

64
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,840
And when he caught hold of his feet, he [Ramanand]
said, “Alright, come along!”

65
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:45,400
And then he became such a great saint in India.

66
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,630
People know him more than they know his Guru;
he became so great.

67
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,120
The basic thing is humility.

68
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,569
Yesterday you saw how the musician (Nishat
Khan) was humble.

69
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,829
All the time he was humble.

70
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:02,280
He didn’t know how to express his humility
every time.

71
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,710
All the time he was humble.

72
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:14,340
Because in humility only you can receive the
blessings, you can receive the quality that

73
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,389
is of your Guru.

74
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:28,000
Now, for a Guru as you have seen that, in
My own way, in My own image, you have to come

75
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,310
up.

76
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,198
First of all your life should be absolutely
transparent.

77
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:36,650
Transparency is the essence of Sahaja Yoga.

78
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:40,740
Everybody should know what you are doing,
where you are going, what is the way you live,

79
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:46,680
what is the way you are behaving.

80
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:53,080
I have seen people, who are gurus, also in
the sense that we call them leaders, or we

81
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:59,050
can call them sub-gurus, or they can not be
called as priest, but I can say ‘communication

82
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,610
centres’ as they are.

83
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:07,850
In them you find that they are very fussy
type of people.

84
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:14,600
Always think about their body, always think
about their comfort, always grudge about – nobody

85
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,200
looked after them – as if they suffer from
persecution-mania!

86
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,490
Or they will grudge about food, “I didn’t
eat my food for one day!”

87
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,950
Doesn’t matter!

88
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:32,460
For a Guru it’s better to starve for about
three, four days nicely, so that you get over

89
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,670
this idea of hunger.

90
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:40,550
You’ll be surprised since I’m here I have
not eaten anything much, and just drinking

91
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,230
something, because just the Guru has no hunger.

92
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:51,450
Because it is in your stomach the Guru, vibrations,
are so much that you don’t feel like eating

93
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,580
anything.

94
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,990
So then, what do you eat and how do you eat
and all these things that we have given up

95
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,830
to come to Sahaja Yoga.

96
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,760
So even if leaders have this nonsense in their
head [like] what do you get to eat!

97
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,140
I mean, this is the basics, absolutely!

98
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:14,780
And when I hear some people telling Me, oh,
what did they eat and how did they eat and

99
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,780
all!

100
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,799
It’s like I feel they are like tourists
in Sahaja Yoga.

101
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,640
Just come in Sahaja Yoga like tourists, you
see, to see places and go round and to know

102
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,309
where you get, in what restaurant, you get
good food and cheaply.

103
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:41,709
All this is so basically, absolutely not a
manifestation of Guru Principle.

104
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:46,900
Now you have seen your Guru as She is.

105
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:53,140
I do not know what I eat, what they give Me,
what I want.

106
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,240
They go on giving Me whatever they think I
like, and I just don’t know if I like that

107
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,180
thing or not, or what is it.

108
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,850
If they ask Me, “Mother, what will You have?”

109
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:05,940
I said, “What will I have, I don’t know
really, what will I have?

110
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,970
Anything!”

111
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,340
So there has to be no choices.

112
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,440
First of all not to waste your attention on
choices.

113
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,590
Of course, only on vibrations.

114
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:20,910
I mean, supposing, you go to a restaurant,
find all kinds of funny vibrations there,

115
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,150
people are getting drunk or anything, then
of course you should say.

116
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:31,289
But all the choices must be based on vibrations
and not on material things.

117
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,260
That you get something nice there, “Let’s
go there,” and they’ll travel for fifty

118
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,910
miles to go eat something nonsensical.

119
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,510
It should be all nonsense for all Sahaja Yogis.

120
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,559
And when I said “Sahaja Yogi” it means
also Sahaja Yoginis.

121
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,030
So the food part of it is aswadha.

122
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:54,699
You should not have any taste for any special
food.

123
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:02,220
Specially in France to say that people may
not like, but French are very, very conscientious

124
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,650
or aware about the food part.

125
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:13,530
I don’t know how far they make really good
food, but at least they think they eat very

126
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,530
good food.

127
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:20,010
So, the eating of good food is a kind of a
addiction.

128
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:26,879
It’s a kind of an addiction; it’s something
like drug – that you must have good food.

129
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:32,460
So Zen started this system of what they call
the tea ceremony.

130
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:39,619
In the tea ceremony what they did, I mean,
I have been through that and it’s really

131
00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:41,070
quite a test of people.

132
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:46,420
With Me it was alright, but the rest of them
got really frightened.

133
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:54,460
That in the tea ceremony whatever rituals
they do they give you a tea, which is so bitter,

134
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,100
and we can say [like] quinine raised to power
108!

135
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,070
It’s like that.

136
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:05,439
And they give you very nicely, handle you
with such ritual that you have to take it.

137
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:11,129
So first they say, “You see the cup without
thinking."

138
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:14,810
So he tried to make thoughtless awareness
through the cup.

139
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,740
I don’t know how much one can achieve with
that.

140
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:25,039
But that tea if you take once, your tongue
is good for anything.

141
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:35,309
And to compensate it they give you something
sweet, which is again sweetness raised to

142
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:40,350
power 108, so sweet that it becomes bitter!

143
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,650
So sweet.

144
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:47,819
So this is just to conquer the tongue [that]
Zen must have thought that better give them

145
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:58,710
this tea ceremony where there is no tea, there’s
nothing but just you really give such shocks

146
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:04,040
to your tongue, so that after that you can
eat whatever you get.

147
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,689
And that’s why you must know that Japanese
can eat anything.

148
00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:14,330
They have solved their food problem because
they can eat anything!

149
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:25,450
They can just fish out some crabs or could
be some prawns, just peel them out like peanuts

150
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,939
and eat them like that.

151
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:32,780
I think Zen has solved this problem for them,
because they have food shortage and this is

152
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,069
how they can eat everything: they can eat
the bark of the tree, they can eat the snake,

153
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:42,360
they can eat the lizards, they can eat the
frogs, everything they can eat, so all their

154
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:50,789
eating problems are solved in that country
by Zen, I think, because you have no taste.

155
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:57,780
But in this I think the worst are, in the
whole world are Indians.

156
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,289
They are the fussiest people for food.

157
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,809
Because their women have spoiled them.

158
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:07,770
They know very good cooking and they know
how to handle their husbands by cooking very

159
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,770
well.

160
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:13,289
And the way they cook food for them, you see,
the men have to go back to Indian food.

161
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:17,970
Even if they travel the whole world, they’ll
need Indian food, they can’t get over their

162
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:18,970
tongues.

163
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:24,809
It is such a big conditioning in India of
food that I just don’t know how will they

164
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:29,730
get out, the, absolutely, the basics which
are important.

165
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,710
Gandhiji tried that very much in the ashram
(laughing).

166
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:41,230
He used to give horrid food, boiled food with
the oil of mustard on top and then nobody

167
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,160
could eat that.

168
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
Raw!

169
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,169
And he used to make everybody eat that.

170
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:52,939
Not only that, he would make them clean the
bathrooms, WC’s, everything so that you

171
00:15:52,939 --> 00:15:56,360
get rid of your nose also, that you need everything.

172
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,629
Because so many people you will, while eating
also in India will put something to their

173
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:02,179
noses, and they smell everything.

174
00:16:02,179 --> 00:16:05,610
So they are oversensitive to their tongue
and to their nose.

175
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,860
But not to their eyes, to eyes they are not.

176
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:15,869
For eyes I would say the most sensitive people
are Japanese and Chinese and also the Western

177
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:20,260
people are very much sensitive because they
don’t like to see anything dirty, filthy

178
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,260
or ugly.

179
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:30,809
Indians won’t mind any dirt, filth, anything,
just like dogs and what you call, horses or

180
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:31,809
buffalos!

181
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:35,249
They can walk through any dirt, filth – anything!

182
00:16:35,249 --> 00:16:41,020
Nothing matters to them, anything ugly, any
ugly building or an ugly dress or anything

183
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,020
is alright for them.

184
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,760
It doesn’t matter, to their eyes it doesn’t
matter at all.

185
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,720
Only thing [is that] kitchen should be clean
and they are all the time in the kitchen.

186
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,610
So we don’t have to learn all these bad
things from Indians.

187
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,499
There are some good things they have, but
there are certain things [which] are very

188
00:16:56,499 --> 00:16:57,499
bad conditionings.

189
00:16:57,499 --> 00:17:00,400
And the next to that are, I think, the French.

190
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:11,439
But if you eat English food you can become
quite good because there’s no taste in English

191
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,558
food (laughter and applause).

192
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:25,450
So, I have no problem anywhere because I think
I have no taste at all and I can eat anything

193
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:32,028
any way it is cooked, it’s alright, I don’t
bother about what is cooked, what is not cooked.

194
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:37,390
But if you have some French people for a dinner
in a restaurant they will spend forty-five

195
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,089
minutes deciding what they are going to eat,
and what a waste of energy!

196
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:44,540
Forty-five minutes just to decide what they
are going to eat!

197
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,810
After all what is so great, what you are going
to eat?

198
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,810
It’s all there.

199
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,220
Just one thing that everybody should have.

200
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,719
So for Sahaja Yogis it’s important to give
up this idea, “I will have this."

201
00:17:54,719 --> 00:18:00,430
First of all nobody should ask, “What will
you have?”

202
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,789
To Me also.

203
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,869
I do not like people asking Me questions [like],
“What will You have?”

204
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:18,320
Because I’ve to think about it and I want
to be in Nirvichara (laughter and applause).

205
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:36,100
So, this is a, one, big ordeal, which we do
not understand: how much we are attached to

206
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,659
food.

207
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,459
And food goes in the stomach.

208
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:46,149
And not only that it spoils our guru system,
but also spoils our physical system.

209
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:49,320
So we should try not to look at food.

210
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:56,029
That’s why fasting was told to the all the
people who wanted to develop their Gurupada,

211
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:59,659
so that they should not fast.

212
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:06,720
But they do not fast normally because they
think of food, so there’s no fasting.

213
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,758
I mean, fasting means that you go into nirvichara
and don’t think of food.

214
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,579
But they are all the time thinking of food,
so it has no meaning and you are just the

215
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:19,959
same whether you eat it or not, your mind
is eating it all the time.

216
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:28,999
Then you start thinking, “When will I end
my fast and know where will I go to have what?”

217
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:34,528
So this is a very basic thing that we should
get rid of our habits, of our conditionings

218
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:38,459
– what we are going to have and what food
we are going to have.

219
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:45,249
Our children also should be given a proper
training about it that – it’s alright,

220
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:49,268
sometimes there is no salt, sometimes there’s
no sugar, doesn’t matter.

221
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:51,829
And sometimes there’s nothing, doesn’t
matter.

222
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:55,879
Nothing [is] important for a Sahaja Yogi,
you can live without food for days together,

223
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:57,570
no problem.

224
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:07,409
So for a Sahaja Yogi there’s nothing like
taste of food and hunger.

225
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:13,389
There’s only one hunger is to be purified,
to be clean.

226
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:21,909
This is one of the things that dirties our
mind, we should say, that we think about food

227
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:26,369
all the time.

228
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:30,710
Even in Russia I found people carried all
Indian things there, they were cooking all

229
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,940
Indian things, and I am, poor thing, I can’t
eat anything.

230
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,268
So they cooked, brought everything for Me,
thinking I’m an Indian, but they don’t

231
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:42,790
know I am Zen – I cannot, I do not, have
sense of taste.

232
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:46,659
So once, to get over taste one has to work
out.

233
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:50,220
It’s an experiment you have to do with ourselves.

234
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:55,278
Unless and until we introspect ourselves and
do experiments we cannot rise.

235
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:00,470
Because though the Kundalini is trying her
level best, but your conditionings are so

236
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:07,229
great that it cannot pierce through and cannot
make you onto that Guru level.

237
00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:13,190
If you see the lives of all these Gurus: they
were married, they had children, they lived

238
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:20,739
a normal life but in their own personal life
they were absolutely detached people.

239
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:26,699
So, first detachment should come from food.

240
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:29,839
And there whatever you like you just don’t
eat.

241
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:32,209
That’s the best way.

242
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:35,840
Because already because of liking something…supposing
if somebody’s fond of ice-cream.

243
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,969
He must have already spoiled his liver; so
then, give [it] up now.

244
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:44,440
If you like pasta, give up pasta.

245
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,799
If you like something else, just give up,
don’t ask for it and don’t eat it at all;

246
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,459
so that, you see, your mind will get little
bit detached from it.

247
00:21:54,459 --> 00:22:03,599
It’s very easy to achieve this detachment,
I think, if you work it out in a sensible

248
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,599
way.

249
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:06,159
Just try to punish your body.

250
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,099
You see, if you are your Guru, you better
take hold of first of all your body and your

251
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:12,099
conditionings.

252
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:14,849
You have to treat your body with this thing.

253
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:19,879
I am told many girls who have married abroad
are still making their Indian food and eating

254
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:20,879
that.

255
00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:21,879
It’s horrible it is!

256
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:22,930
They should starve.

257
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:28,369
If they starve for say about five, six days
or maybe eight days, then they’ll eat any

258
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:29,970
food in any case.

259
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,379
That’s why the fasting is given.

260
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:37,589
So one should adjust oneself to any kind of
food you can have.

261
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:43,590
And if you want to survive then you eat anything,
so just make it a point that you get rid of

262
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:51,759
this very simple conditioning you have – of
liking the food that you want to eat and you

263
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:52,869
don’t want to have anything else.

264
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:58,139
I think as Sahaja Yogini or Sahaja Yogi who
cannot get rid of this little thing, then

265
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:00,159
how can you call him a Sahaja Yogi?

266
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,159
I don’t know.

267
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:02,159
He’s very asahaj.

268
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,268
Because the other day I met one lady.

269
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:06,729
I said, “What is the matter, where have
you been?”

270
00:23:06,729 --> 00:23:09,899
She said, “I have been looking out for some
sort of an Indian ingredient."

271
00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:12,869
I said, “How can you get it here in this
Spain?

272
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:13,869
You cannot."

273
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:14,869
“Why?”

274
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:16,769
“Because they asked me to make Indian food."

275
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:17,769
“Alright.

276
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:19,379
Then without that can’t you make Indian
food?

277
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:22,909
What is the need to run all the way, whole
day for a one small little thing called hing

278
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:23,909
(asafoetida)?”

279
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:26,899
There’s a big name for that, it’s a small
little thing.

280
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:31,440
Just to get that she had to run all over the
places to get it!

281
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:39,199
So for people who are Sahaja Yogis if they
are sahaj, whatever is available you can make

282
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:43,100
something nice out of it and eat it.

283
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,009
So that shows what?

284
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:51,509
It shows sagacity, shows trupti (तृप्ति
– contentment), shows your satisfaction.

285
00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:55,319
And that is one of the manifestations of a
Guru that he’s a satisfied soul.

286
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:58,170
He’s just self-contained, he doesn’t bother.

287
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:06,820
Now, for example, some people, specially in
the West, thank God, they are not spoiled

288
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,259
by their wives so much.

289
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:11,060
They don’t have so much of conditioning,
they can eat anything.

290
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:16,450
I’ve seen that when they come on the India
tour, all the Indians say, “Horrid food

291
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,809
was given and the poor things were eating
that horrid food and this and that."

292
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,129
And I asked them, “Which place you like
the best?”

293
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:26,129
They said, “Brahmapuri."

294
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:27,129
I said, “Eh?

295
00:24:27,129 --> 00:24:29,979
They were saying Brahmapuri had the worst
food and everybody is complaining."

296
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:30,979
“No, no.

297
00:24:30,979 --> 00:24:35,999
Brahmapuri was the best, because we could
bathe in the river and we could sing and we

298
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:36,999
could enjoy it!”

299
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:44,049
You see, that’s the sign of one thing, to
get rid of your bad habits of food business.

300
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:50,339
Now the second part is for the body you need
comforts.

301
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:59,180
I must congratulate the Western Sahaja Yogis
that they may be coming from any walk of life

302
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:05,109
– I must say, the Indians have to learn
from them – they may be coming from any

303
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:06,499
position or status.

304
00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:14,129
All of them enjoy the comfort of the Spirit
when they travel in the Tour.

305
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:19,829
They do not ask for, “I haven’t got a
chair, I haven’t got a bed, I haven’t

306
00:25:19,829 --> 00:25:21,979
got a proper things here."

307
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:30,309
In this way, you see, you will realise that
the body comfort is of no importance.

308
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:33,829
It’s, we have just spoilt our body, there’s
no need, no need.

309
00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:36,670
Body you put it anywhere, will sleep in any
case.

310
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:41,499
If you cannot sleep for two nights, alright,
put on some music for one night or two nights

311
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:42,499
as we had here, you will sleep anyway! (laughter
and applause as everybody fell asleep during

312
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:56,778
the Nishat Khan performance the night before)

313
00:25:56,779 --> 00:26:05,190
So this is the second point is that we have
to give up body comfort.

314
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:14,680
But the third point where I think the Western
people falter is their materialistic attitude.

315
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:20,989
Materialistic attitude and their fondness
of their eyes.

316
00:26:20,989 --> 00:26:23,229
So one of them is the worst of all.

317
00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:29,420
I mean, the worst in worst of all is that
you can never have, that’s such a big blot

318
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:35,159
if you have that is to have a roving eye and
things like that.

319
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:36,159
It’s out of question.

320
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,229
That’s out of question for women or for
men.

321
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:41,518
They are not Sahaja Yogis by any chance.

322
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:46,839
They have to have very clean eyes.

323
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,999
That part is alright.

324
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:52,768
And the second part is the greed, lust and
greed.

325
00:26:52,769 --> 00:27:01,690
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga maybe the lust
part is over, but greed is still there with

326
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,830
so many who get lost.

327
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:10,599
So I would say Indians do not have this lust
problem, but they still have greed, greed

328
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:18,670
problem – means they want to buy something
like a radio or some electrical stuff they

329
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,670
must buy.

330
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,289
If they come abroad they must buy something.

331
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:25,339
It’s alright, if you get it, well and good,
if they don’t get it, well and good.

332
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:26,369
It should be [that attitude].

333
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:32,300
But for a Westerner, you see, he would not
like to give up his furniture, which his great

334
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,489
grandmother had it.

335
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:36,670
Though he can’t sit on it because it’s
so old.

336
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,219
If he sits on it, it will be break.

337
00:27:38,219 --> 00:27:43,459
But he must keep it to show off that, “I
had a great grandmother who gave this unique

338
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:44,459
chair."

339
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:47,318
According to Indian standards it’s junk!

340
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:49,040
Absolute junk.

341
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,050
Because it is good for nothing you put it
in the drawing room, nobody can sit on it

342
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,009
and it looks junky.

343
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:59,300
But according to the Western mind the older
it is, the better – whether it is a junk

344
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:03,649
or anything – he’ll have so many junks
in the house and they will sell like hot cakes.

345
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:08,859
Because there’s a very subtle materialistic
attitude towards matter that, “This will

346
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:13,599
sell like hot cakes if I sell it,” because
there must be another mad Westerner who would

347
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,070
like to buy that junk.

348
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,170
You see?

349
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:22,379
So this junk that you have in the house it’s
better to get rid of, because God knows how

350
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:23,820
many people must have used [it].

351
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,409
It’s like a grave in the house.

352
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:26,879
It’s a grave.

353
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:29,519
So to have then also the antique jewellery.

354
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:40,139
Antique jewellery is another mad, antique
is a – what you can say – is the fad or

355
00:28:40,139 --> 00:28:42,008
addiction of the Western people – antique.

356
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:46,810
For us nothing is antique because we still
produce antique things, beautiful things so

357
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,019
Indians don’t understand the value of antiques.

358
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:54,659
They don’t understand how these people are
so mad after torn things and broken things

359
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,389
and dirty things and filthy things!

360
00:28:57,389 --> 00:29:00,739
But the Western mind has been brought up that
way.

361
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:05,399
Now, in these antique things I have seen that,
once I went to somebody’s house, you see,

362
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:08,489
and he asked Me with very great honour to
sit on his chair.

363
00:29:08,489 --> 00:29:13,590
And as soon as I sat on the chair I thought
there were snakes and there were scorpions

364
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,209
all biting Me.

365
00:29:15,209 --> 00:29:16,999
I got a fright, I got up.

366
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:18,299
I said, “What is it?”

367
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:23,430
He said, “This is from great, great, great
grandmother, you see, she gave us this thing."

368
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,310
I said, “It will break, I better sit outside."

369
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,310
(laughter)

370
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:34,979
So this also madness of this antique is so
much that it is unbelievable how people go

371
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:35,979
into it.

372
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:42,129
So there’s a joke in India there’s a very
great writer called as Premchand, he wrote

373
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:50,800
about two Englishmen going on the road of
Benares when they were hit by a lota (metal

374
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:56,439
pot), that they use for their bathrooms, fell
on their feet.

375
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:58,680
And it fell on their feet.

376
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:04,299
And jokingly he says, “on the feet where
all the bureaucrats fall."

377
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,820
Means, all Indian bureaucrats used to fall
at the feet of the English at that time!

378
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,249
So he made a joke.

379
00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:10,249
But doesn’t matter.

380
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:14,008
Then the English, you see, looked at that
thing and they were very angry and immediately

381
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:18,050
they took to law, “You have to come to the
courts, you have to come to the police and

382
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:22,479
we’re going to report this has fallen there,
it has hit us,” and all that.

383
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:29,588
So there was a clever man, he knew the English
or the Western mind, he said, “Sir, do you

384
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:32,259
know this, this lota has very valuable!”

385
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:33,389
He said, “Why?”

386
00:30:33,389 --> 00:30:37,939
“Because this one was used by Akbar the
Great.

387
00:30:37,939 --> 00:30:39,109
So ancient it is.

388
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:40,139
” He said, “Really?”

389
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:44,040
“Yes it is and, you know, you just don’t
quarrel with them.

390
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,939
And ask them for this lota."

391
00:30:45,939 --> 00:30:49,849
And he told in Indian language to them that,
“I have befooled these people, I have told

392
00:30:49,849 --> 00:31:00,339
them that this lota belonged to Akbar and
you have to take this lota and use this lota

393
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:03,619
to just to befool them."

394
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:07,670
So then they asked, “But alright, we’ll
forgive you, we’ll not take you to any courts

395
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:10,909
or anything, but you just give us this lota."

396
00:31:10,909 --> 00:31:12,389
They said, “No, we can’t."

397
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:13,389
He said, “Why?”

398
00:31:13,389 --> 00:31:15,479
“Because it’s such an antique piece, you
see."

399
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:20,008
In India you won’t find anybody respecting
antique pieces, especially in Benares nobody

400
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:21,009
bothers.

401
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:26,809
(Laughter) So they said, “Really?”, “Yes,
it belonged to Akbar and, you know, my father

402
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:29,149
was, my forefathers worked with him, so he
gave us this lota, we can’t give you, we

403
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:30,149
are sorry, you see."

404
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:35,849
“No, no, no, no, please give us, you see,
and we’ll no take you to the police."

405
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:38,629
“Alright, you charge us, whatever money
you charge us,” and all that.

406
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:42,519
In those days they paid one thousand rupees,
you see, this is equal to, now, one crore

407
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:43,869
(10 million), I think.

408
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:49,969
They gave, these English paid them and bought
that lota, which had nothing to do with Akbar

409
00:31:49,969 --> 00:31:51,659
or anyone.

410
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:55,619
So this madness of antique has to go away
from our minds.

411
00:31:55,619 --> 00:32:01,769
It’s such a built-in thing within us, that
we always talk of antiquities.

412
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:06,779
Perhaps maybe because of wars everything was
destroyed and whatever was in the olden times

413
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:11,019
was something very beautiful and good and
now we are not making very good things, perhaps,

414
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:12,050
maybe that is the reason.

415
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:15,670
But now we are making nice things, we can
make.

416
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:20,700
Now in England I was surprised the old crafts
are coming up, everywhere I go the old crafts

417
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,828
are coming up.

418
00:32:21,829 --> 00:32:28,899
So to respect antiques means you just stop
making the old craft revive.

419
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:35,170
Because you pay so much to the antiques, the
same thing made today won’t fetch the same

420
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,079
price as it was.

421
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:43,739
Now this has ruined our creativity, ruined
our handwork and it has ruined our whole – I

422
00:32:43,739 --> 00:32:49,528
think the quality of our life, because the
way we are mad after antiques.

423
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:55,589
So this also should go from your head that
anything antique is something good.

424
00:32:55,589 --> 00:32:59,959
It’s a very superficial value – if you
see to it.

425
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:03,768
Because people think that antique is something
expensive.

426
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:08,570
It’s just a marketing style that people
have felt that this is expensive, that is

427
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:13,019
expensive, so it’s something great to wear
something stupid and to say that, “this

428
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:16,359
is antique jewellery,” and go about.

429
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:22,149
I mean, God knows how many people must have
used it and must have worn it and what must

430
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:24,508
be the feelings of that person.

431
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:31,489
So we have to understand that this conditioning
that we have in our heads, that we must have

432
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:39,189
something antiques with us, keep something
of such value.

433
00:33:39,189 --> 00:33:43,369
I mean, these questions never arose before,
so it’s not written in any books.

434
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:48,209
Anyone of the books of the Gurus is not written
that, “Don’t care for antiques."

435
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:52,539
They have written, “Don’t drink, don’t
smoke,” all other things which spoils your

436
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,540
Nabhi.

437
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,999
They’ve written all these things.

438
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:59,920
But they have not written that, “Don’t
worry about antiques so much."

439
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:06,870
You see, and I find that’s a craze nowadays
and so we have to tell people that we have

440
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:07,870
to be careful.

441
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:12,669
Moreover I feel the way people have gone to
drugs and that, maybe that because they used

442
00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:16,779
so much antiques that the bhoots from the
antiques must have caught them.

443
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:20,709
Can’t understand that why people are so
melancholy, all the time crying, weeping,

444
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:21,939
and all that.

445
00:34:21,939 --> 00:34:29,430
So the conditionings of these matter as we
think it to be is to be absolutely taken out.

446
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:34,089
Of course, I mean in certain countries we
should say that the antique things [that]

447
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:35,518
were made were good and nice.

448
00:34:35,518 --> 00:34:39,738
But, only because something is antique it
should not be respected, [but] because of

449
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:46,219
its intrinsic value of aesthetics, it’s
alright.

450
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:50,410
But one has to see first of all the vibrations
of everything.

451
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:56,129
If the vibrations are good then you should
accept, otherwise not, because we have the

452
00:34:56,129 --> 00:35:04,119
language of vibrations and we have to use
the language of vibrations.

453
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:10,320
Once you start using the language of vibrations
you’ll be surprised how you will get the

454
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:18,718
complete picture as to what is to be done.

455
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:26,120
So to get rid of these three conditionings
too, for our body is very important.

456
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:34,300
And the worst thing for a Sahaja Yogi [is]
to think that he’s sick: is a, sort of a,

457
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,178
tarnishing the name of Sahaja Yoga.

458
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:42,270
If you still feel you are sick you better
get out of Sahaja Yoga!

459
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:49,830
Because either you get well or you are not
a Sahaja Yogi, one of the two things.

460
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:55,000
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you have to see that
you get well and if there are certain problems

461
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,090
also – doesn’t matter.

462
00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:00,890
Now, for example, supposing, I have certain
problems, which I know, because of Sahaja

463
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:10,260
Yoga, because of My position as the Mother,
position as Adi Shakti: certain physical things

464
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,990
I have to face, parasympathetic working I
have to face, but I go through it!

465
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,990
Is accepted.

466
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:20,629
You have to accept your body as it is and
you are not to sort of say that, “I’m

467
00:36:20,629 --> 00:36:25,460
not well,” and “There’s something wrong
with me,” and go on complaining like some

468
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,670
old hag!

469
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:30,379
Never think you are old, first of all.

470
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:34,840
Never think that you have gone old or you
are no good.

471
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,050
Look at your Mother.

472
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,330
I never think that way.

473
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:43,480
Yesterday half of you were sleeping, still
I was alert and listening to the music and

474
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,100
today I’m again alert here.

475
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:50,670
So if you have a Guru then that image should
be with you that: “Look at our Mother.

476
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,250
She’s so old, how much She travels, how
much She does!”

477
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,350
Alright, you might say, She’s the Adi Shakti!

478
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:59,010
But little bit of shakti you too have.

479
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:05,520
And that shakti is to be shown by your full
dynamism.

480
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,159
If you have no dynamism and if you still feel
very weak that means you are not a Sahaja

481
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,159
Yogi.

482
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:17,469
So just ask for, ask for any amount of energy
– it can come to you.

483
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:18,980
That dynamism, it should be there.

484
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:24,629
Now this I would say, for the physical self
that one has to know that you are all younger

485
00:37:24,629 --> 00:37:30,619
and getting younger and younger, but not the
stupidity of youth, but gravity, the gravity

486
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:32,620
of the age.

487
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:39,300
Actually I have seen children who are born
realised, they are very grave, they won’t

488
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,280
do anything that is not dignified.

489
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:49,240
And they will never, I’ve never heard them
talking to some of – the Sahaja Yoginis

490
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,330
have a bad habit of talking, “tuk, tuk,
tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk,” among themselves.

491
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,480
It’s a very bad habit.

492
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,939
Which shows that they [are] still very much
lacking.

493
00:37:57,939 --> 00:38:01,750
Just wearing saris or wearing bindis you do
not become a Sahaja Yogini.

494
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,290
First of all, what is the gravity?

495
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:06,370
You should only speak whenever it is necessary.

496
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:12,080
So I have seen these Sahaja Yogis who are
born realised children they stand like this

497
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
before Me.

498
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:18,140
And they say very few words, but beautiful
words they speak.

499
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,709
And say things, which you can remember all
the time.

500
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:25,320
They just do not go on wasting anything.

501
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,439
And they are extremely obedient.

502
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:33,240
So from them one can learn that these are
born realised and the way their Guru principle

503
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,840
is acting, are we also acting the same way?

504
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,499
Or we are doing something that is not good
for our ascent?

505
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:45,800
So even after coming to Sahaja Yoga if you
do not try hard to introspect yourself, you

506
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,249
have missed the point that you compare yourself
with your Guru – all the time.

507
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,250
Now.

508
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:58,120
Then everything has to be understood in the
right perspective that we are Sahaja Yogis.

509
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,000
Now for a Sahaja Yogi first and foremost thing
[is] that he has to have love.

510
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
First.

511
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,070
For others, not for himself.

512
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:10,939
If you are all the time worried about yourself,
“My body is such, my this thing such, and

513
00:39:10,939 --> 00:39:14,350
I have to do this and that,” then you don’t
love others.

514
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:17,020
But do you see to the comfort of others?

515
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,530
Do you feel the compassion of other Sahaja
Yogis?

516
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,948
Do you feel, “What have I to bring for them?

517
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:23,949
What is missing in them?”

518
00:39:23,949 --> 00:39:25,280
Do you work it out?

519
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,030
Do you go out of the way to help them?

520
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:32,590
First of all Sahaja Yogi s.

521
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:36,189
Now Sahaja Yogis are different things.

522
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:41,080
I have seen many Sahaja Yogis will go and
take the side of the non-Sahaja Yogis and

523
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,880
try to debase the Sahaja Yogis.

524
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,060
Is a very wrong thing.

525
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:51,030
You belong to this new race and the people
who do not belong to this new race and if

526
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:56,109
they are attacking anybody: these are your
hands, your feet, your head, and if they attack

527
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:01,919
it, it is duty bound that you help them instead
of helping the others.

528
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:04,158
Maybe something wrong with this person, doesn’t
matter.

529
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:06,760
You need not show all the fair play there.

530
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,830
In that place you should support a Sahaja
Yogi out and out.

531
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:15,510
Later on you may correct and you may tell
that person, “You should not have done like

532
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,468
this, it was wrong."

533
00:40:17,469 --> 00:40:22,380
So this dignity and this understanding comes
only through silence.

534
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,929
But if you are chirping all the time, talking
“tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk,”

535
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:30,859
it can never, never can make you a deeper
person.

536
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:34,429
You’ll be just flying in the air with all
that.

537
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:40,139
So for women now is best is to take to mauna,
is to keep quiet, just keep quiet.

538
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:42,010
They all the time want to talk.

539
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:46,790
This I’ve heard from all the leaders that
is a big problem with women.

540
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:50,600
They just go on talking stories, telling stories.

541
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:57,350
But if you ask them to come and speak, they
will start shaking.

542
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:01,350
How many can give speeches?

543
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:03,040
Women?

544
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:10,959
If you understand that if you cannot give
a speech, you better not talk also.

545
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:14,840
You should be able to give a speech because
your Mother is a woman, She gives speeches.

546
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,658
Why can’t you give some speech?

547
00:41:16,659 --> 00:41:17,659
You cannot.

548
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:20,419
If I make you stand here, you’ll be shaking,
I know that.

549
00:41:20,419 --> 00:41:23,939
But if it comes to murmuring souls, you are
there.

550
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:27,030
So that is one thing women have to be very
careful [about].

551
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:33,050
And as today is the Guru puja I have to tell
you things, not as a Mother but as your Guru.

552
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:37,999
That, if you have to ascend the best thing
is for you to stop talking.

553
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,020
“Maunam sarvatha sadhanam."

554
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,250
‘Maun’ means to keep quiet.

555
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:48,469
It gives you all kinds of facilities, just
keep quiet.

556
00:41:48,469 --> 00:41:50,709
If somebody’s talking too much, just keep
quiet.

557
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:53,730
If somebody’s trying to criticise, keep
quiet.

558
00:41:53,730 --> 00:42:00,369
That’s your silence, that’s your right,
that’s your domain that you can keep silent.

559
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:02,300
Just watch that person.

560
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:07,050
If it comes then to answer, then you can answer
better.

561
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:10,560
But if somebody’s trying to attack ,you
just keep silent.

562
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:17,560
But this silence has to be established and
one should only establish by not talking too

563
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,560
much.

564
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,199
I have seen also when I am sitting here, I
have seen women talking among themselves,

565
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:24,819
and this is very wrong.

566
00:42:24,819 --> 00:42:26,410
You must learn the silence.

567
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,820
Like yesterday I saw so many ladies also were
walking out, walking in.

568
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,249
In the church will you do that?

569
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,100
You won’t do it.

570
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,680
In the church there is no Christ, there’s
a horrible priest sitting there, but you cannot

571
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,680
do it.

572
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,399
You all keep quiet, you sit there nicely.

573
00:42:42,399 --> 00:42:47,459
I’ve never seen anybody walking out here
and there and doing all kinds of things, putting

574
00:42:47,459 --> 00:42:49,408
the children in front like that, making them
sleep.

575
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:50,409
Never!

576
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:55,850
Can you do that in the church?

577
00:42:55,850 --> 00:43:00,090
What a discipline people observe in that church,
which is an artificial place.

578
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:06,718
And where you are now, that kind of a silence
has to be there and that kind of understanding,

579
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:09,169
that depth, that awe has to be there.

580
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,719
But because we have not yet developed that
Guru thing.

581
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:14,959
If we had developed it then immediately it
will work out.

582
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:19,580
You will see your gravity will show in your
behaviour.

583
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:33,480
So this is for our attention not to be wasted.

584
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,219
To discuss somebody, to discuss about others’
characters, we have no business.

585
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:39,050
Do we discuss the character of one hand to
another hand?

586
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:43,948
To discuss about what has happened about marriages,
things like that.

587
00:43:43,949 --> 00:43:49,310
Also marriage is just…in Sahaja Yoga it’s
not such an important thing.

588
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:52,679
Some people pay too much attention to marriage,
you see, and marriage becomes a headache.

589
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:54,530
Also then, “What about my marriage?”

590
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:58,379
Then again ten minutes you see that person,
“What about my marriage?”

591
00:43:58,379 --> 00:44:00,390
Again after ten minutes, “What about my
marriage?”

592
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:01,879
You want to run away.

593
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,790
I mean, you see, it’s something becomes
like a mania for people, “What should we

594
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:07,790
do?”

595
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:11,899
And the whole thing is, all depends, and the
whole programming depends on how you are going

596
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,350
to get married.

597
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:20,580
So you have come to Sahaja Yoga, you are sanyasis.

598
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,439
You are not married people in a way.

599
00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:28,408
You are married only to Sahaja Yoga, that’s
your husband, that’s your wife.

600
00:44:28,409 --> 00:44:32,209
And the so-called husband and wife are there.

601
00:44:32,209 --> 00:44:36,948
But if they are not Sahaja Yogis then you
are unmarried, definitely.

602
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:40,149
So too much attention is paid in Sahaja Yoga
to marriages.

603
00:44:40,149 --> 00:44:47,270
I have seen that before, marriage, before
Sahaja Yoga, marriage was a joke; every third

604
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:55,109
day there was a divorce and people would run
away and do all kinds of things.

605
00:44:55,109 --> 00:45:01,340
Then when they got married after Sahaja Yoga
they are the greatest romantic people ever

606
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,718
known in the whole world!

607
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:04,760
I mean, all ‘Romeo, Juliets’ going about.

608
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,129
I just don’t understand.

609
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:09,750
Even in the Indian villages people complain
that, “What sort of these people are?

610
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:14,770
I mean, they have no sense at all and the
way they go round, are they the saints?”

611
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:24,530
So that saintliness, that sanyasta, that asceticism
has to be expressed in our married life.

612
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:30,290
I don’t mean that you don’t have relationship
with your husband but in a very private way.

613
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:36,459
It’s has to be extremely private and it
should not be such a great thing to go into

614
00:45:36,459 --> 00:45:37,459
romanticism.

615
00:45:37,459 --> 00:45:42,250
You’ll ruin the whole of Sahaja Yoga in
the West if you start doing that nonsense!

616
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:48,030
Because also there’s an idea about it that,
you see, you fall in love.

617
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,030
But then you’ll fall!

618
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:50,310
That’s the first point is.

619
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:53,010
You will fall [but] you want to rise.

620
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:58,540
So this attachment and this worry about the
husband and this and that, I mean, you can

621
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:02,290
carry on with any kind of a husband and wife
if you are a Sahaja Yogi, should be able to.

622
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:04,670
I mean, I know that’s very simple.

623
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:08,760
It’s a…your husband is a study, wife is
a study, that’s all.

624
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,350
You study a person, what sort of a person
he is.

625
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:15,699
But for that you have to have the witness
state and you have to see, you have to be

626
00:46:15,699 --> 00:46:16,699
detached.

627
00:46:16,699 --> 00:46:18,030
So in marriages one has to be detached.

628
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:25,169
But, on the contrary, I find that just after
the marriage they want to organise some special

629
00:46:25,169 --> 00:46:31,699
thing for them to go to some sort of a honeymoon
or some sort of a thing!

630
00:46:31,699 --> 00:46:34,483
I don’t know how these ideas crawl up.

631
00:46:34,483 --> 00:46:39,010
These are coming from the old conditionings
of things and after honeymoon they come and

632
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:41,109
say, “Mother, this marriage is not going
to work out."

633
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:45,369
So it’s better to do slow and steady and
then decide.

634
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:49,948
Because you just jump into honeymoon mood
and come back and say, “Mother, this, I

635
00:46:49,949 --> 00:46:53,380
have started thinking and I don’t think."

636
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:59,910
I know of a lady who was jumping with a Indian
gentleman and she was on her way to Australia.

637
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:04,408
In Singapore, she telephones that, “Mother,
I don’t think this marriage will work out."

638
00:47:04,409 --> 00:47:08,969
And here everybody complained to Me, “Mother,
these two are behaving in such a manner that

639
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:10,209
Indians are rather embarrassed."

640
00:47:10,209 --> 00:47:15,580
So the sense of shame you must learn from
Indians.

641
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:21,480
They never… husband and wife never sit together
in India, is regarded as bad manners and it

642
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,820
should be with you also.

643
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:29,198
That, even in the puja, even in anything they
are sitting in the public, what is the need

644
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:32,129
to show your relationship in the public?

645
00:47:32,129 --> 00:47:33,890
It’s only in the private.

646
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:39,969
This is one of the things one, if you start
understanding, there will be a proper adjustment.

647
00:47:39,969 --> 00:47:46,429
Men should be with men in the public, women
should be with the women together.

648
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:55,709
But the women or men, whatever they are, whatever
are their bad, bad points should not be brought

649
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:56,709
back.

650
00:47:56,709 --> 00:48:05,080
Like, I would say the men have jealousies
and they have power orientation and they discuss

651
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:10,919
about leadership and they, every, they get
a shock if you tell them that you are not

652
00:48:10,919 --> 00:48:15,129
going to be a leader, as if they think leadership
is something very concrete.

653
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:18,820
It’s the greatest myth ever going, is this
leadership!

654
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:23,430
There’s nothing like leaders in this Sahaja
Yoga, it’s just a joke.

655
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:28,080
And your Mother is very good at playing serious
jokes.

656
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,050
So be careful!

657
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:32,869
Don’t be childish about it.

658
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:38,749
You have to understand that this is a big
joke going on and it’s just a testing point

659
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:44,330
and if I test you wrong, you can tell Me,
but I think this has worked well, because

660
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:48,840
I can test people very well on that level
and immediately I know when the person gets

661
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,459
onto the horse of ego.

662
00:48:50,459 --> 00:48:59,250
So, for your mental attitude, has to be different
and our priorities have to change.

663
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,469
Our priorities have to change.

664
00:49:01,469 --> 00:49:03,060
What are our priorities?

665
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:06,439
First and foremost thing is our ascent, is
the first priority.

666
00:49:06,439 --> 00:49:10,859
For our ascent whatever is needed has to be
done.

667
00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:13,219
If you have to punish your body, alright.

668
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:15,699
If you have to punish yourself, alright.

669
00:49:15,699 --> 00:49:19,810
If you have a conditioning, get rid of it.

670
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:26,270
Just introspect yourself, that is Self-realisation,
is to know yourself.

671
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:32,090
When you know yourself and know what is clinging
onto it, just to remove it completely.

672
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:33,689
Work it out the way you like.

673
00:49:33,689 --> 00:49:35,790
Work it out the way you like.

674
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:51,240
You see, it is very important that the body,
mind, everything should be your slaves.

675
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,919
Nothing should dominate you.

676
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:56,099
You should be on top of everything.

677
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:59,059
How dare your body ask for anything?

678
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,790
How dare your mind tells you anything?

679
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,130
How this conditioning works on you?

680
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:06,949
“I am a Sahaja Yogi, I’m above everything."

681
00:50:06,949 --> 00:50:12,609
Like the lotuses have come out of the ponds,
you have come out of it.

682
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:17,760
We have so many proofs to show that you are
realised souls.

683
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,908
I’ll show you some photographs that I have
to show that there is light.

684
00:50:22,909 --> 00:50:26,260
I can put light into you, they are all enlightened
people.

685
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,550
But in My presence if you become the light,
you must carry the light outside.

686
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:33,310
Not only in My presence, but when you go out.

687
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:38,619
But one of the reasons, I think, when I tell
something people just start thinking about

688
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:41,138
whom Mother is talking, they never think,
“She is talking about me."

689
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:47,510
That’s the only way you can penetrate within
yourself when you see that, “Mother is talking

690
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:51,609
about me, She’s correcting me all alone
and She’s telling me."

691
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:55,560
Then only it will penetrate and it will work
out.

692
00:50:55,560 --> 00:51:01,840
The priorities have to be changed and the
first and foremost is your ascent and the

693
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,329
Spirit and Sahaja Yoga.

694
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:10,550
The rest is negligible, nothing important.

695
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:20,638
Then the faith that there is this All-pervading
Power, which is looking after us, is very

696
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:21,639
important.

697
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:24,480
This time the musicians came all the way.

698
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,280
I must tell you the story of their travel.

699
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:31,810
They came and they said that there’s a train
from Kiev and they also bought the tickets

700
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:37,449
so got into the train and they were off-loaded
before the Hungarian border.

701
00:51:37,449 --> 00:51:43,429
They didn’t know what to do, they had no
visas, nothing and not so much money also.

702
00:51:43,429 --> 00:51:44,429
They thought, “We are on the train."

703
00:51:44,429 --> 00:51:49,510
They said, “No, you have to go cross over
and go to Budapest,” and they didn’t know

704
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:51,999
where, they were standing on the road.

705
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,149
And, but they were all laughing and enjoying,
“must be something in store for us."

706
00:51:57,149 --> 00:52:00,330
Nobody felt that they were in trouble or in
anything.

707
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:01,330
So surrendered.

708
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:04,320
“So, suddenly,” they said, “the custom
people came and surrounded them,” and they

709
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:09,350
said, “What’s the matter, how are you
here with all these bags and baggages?”

710
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:10,929
So they said, “Why are you here?”

711
00:52:10,929 --> 00:52:15,899
They said, “We have come for a concert and
this, and musicians we are and all."

712
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:17,649
And some or other they started melting away.

713
00:52:17,649 --> 00:52:18,980
And then they gave them Realisation!

714
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,939
Six of them got Realisation.

715
00:52:20,939 --> 00:52:24,138
Now can you believe: the power of love.

716
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:29,810
And the custom officers they offered their
own cars, took them down to the other side.

717
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:32,119
It’s never happened with custom officers!

718
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:33,119
Imagine!

719
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:38,289
It would be like shaving their teeth off,
I tell you, the way (laughing) if you can

720
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:39,740
do that to the custom officer!

721
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,119
But it happened.

722
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,968
And they came to the other side and left them
there.

723
00:52:45,969 --> 00:52:47,140
Now they didn’t know what to do.

724
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:51,990
They wanted to go to Budapest, they had to
walk about two miles or something to the station.

725
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:58,830
So they were waiting there well, they said
that, “Mother, You sent maybe, two Yugoslavs

726
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:03,250
came in a big bus of 49 people – all vacant."

727
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:06,419
They stopped the bus and said, “What is
it, why are you here?”

728
00:53:06,419 --> 00:53:09,158
So they said, “This is our problem and we
have to go."

729
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:10,280
So they got into the bus.

730
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:15,229
When he was driving them down, they thought
of talking to him that, “Why not you take

731
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,660
us to Milan?”

732
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:23,850
And they managed! (laughter) And they were
in Milan.

733
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,110
It’s so remarkable.

734
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:31,480
So to have faith completely in yourself and
in that Power, which is surrounding you.

735
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:40,440
And once you have that faith you will realise
that, though it is so helpful to you, it is

736
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:48,399
so kind to you, on the same level if you think
it, it can be very harmful.

737
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:57,240
So then never listen to the Guru ninda, means
anybody talks anything ill about your Guru,

738
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:01,399
just put your hands to your ears, absolutely
immediately.

739
00:54:01,399 --> 00:54:07,540
I have known of a person who did that [and]
got cancer, another now in jail, another one

740
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:08,540
there.

741
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,209
So anybody is saying like that, just put your
hands.

742
00:54:11,209 --> 00:54:15,330
Because now you know that – what is your
Guru.

743
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:19,370
So you should never hear anything against
your Guru from anyone.

744
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:23,919
The other day one gentleman asked Me a question,
a newsman.

745
00:54:23,919 --> 00:54:27,300
He said that, “I am told you have made a
castle for Yourself."

746
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,050
I said, “I have paid for it, I have made
it also.

747
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:31,599
It was a horrid place, no doubt.

748
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,908
But there are only Sahaja Yogis staying there,
I am not staying there.

749
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:35,909
That’s the best part."

750
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:36,939
But that’s all I said.

751
00:54:36,939 --> 00:54:41,939
But on the contrary, they never go and ask
these questions to any gurus on anything.

752
00:54:41,939 --> 00:54:44,090
Because the disciples say, “Yes, so what?

753
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:47,140
We want to give to our guru money and this
and that."

754
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,140
They never ask.

755
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:53,359
But, through Sahaja Yoga, or [by] Myself,
I have cured so many people of incurable diseases

756
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,050
– I could have minted money.

757
00:54:56,050 --> 00:55:01,189
For curing one cancer patient I could have
made a castle, Myself.

758
00:55:01,189 --> 00:55:05,199
So when people say like that you should say,
“Do you know how many people She has cured?

759
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:12,399
How much money She could have taken from them
if She was a doctor or She was a false Guru?

760
00:55:12,399 --> 00:55:15,230
How much money She would have made out of
all of them?”

761
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:16,500
Then they will understand.

762
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,459
You see, because they are being materialistic
they talk like that.

763
00:55:20,459 --> 00:55:25,810
And their attitude is very different and so,
to tell them off is the best way.

764
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:32,520
Because I have seen that these press people
are absolutely harassed by the disciples of

765
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,589
the false Gurus.

766
00:55:33,589 --> 00:55:39,070
Just they cannot criticise, they cannot say
a word against such false Gurus.

767
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:47,729
While I find that Sahaja Yogis still lack
that complete faith in themselves and complete

768
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:48,730
assertion.

769
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:51,630
Where you have to assert you must assert.

770
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:57,990
For example, anybody says something wrong
against Me, you have to assert; must say,

771
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:59,590
“No, not possible.

772
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:00,590
It’s not!”

773
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:05,129
But I have seen some people asking Me funny
questions who are ‘Sahaja Yogis’ also!

774
00:56:05,129 --> 00:56:09,353
So the first part is that to see how much
we are sensitive to spirituality.

775
00:56:09,353 --> 00:56:17,469
I have seen Sahaja Yogis supporting somebody
who is so negative, you can’t even bear

776
00:56:17,469 --> 00:56:23,260
that person and, [to them], such a person
is something great, while somebody who is

777
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,260
so good they cannot make it out.

778
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,499
So what’s the use?

779
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:30,919
Your computer is so faulty, you’ll do…I
mean, the planes will have to run up and down

780
00:56:30,919 --> 00:56:34,000
if you have such a computer as Sahaja Yogis
are!

781
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,770
Because they just judge the other way round.

782
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:41,760
A person who is good in Sahaja Yoga, who has
got vibrations, he may be simple, he may be

783
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,830
unassuming, he may not be so rich, he may
not be so educated, may not be from some good

784
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:51,980
universities or anything, but you must see
the vibrations of that person!

785
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:55,260
What sort of vibrations that person has, and
then you should judge.

786
00:56:55,260 --> 00:57:02,149
Instead of that if you judge that person only
because he’s very good to talk and he talks

787
00:57:02,149 --> 00:57:05,369
well and very scholarly or something like
that, that’s not the point.

788
00:57:05,369 --> 00:57:06,369
The point is what are his vibrations!

789
00:57:06,369 --> 00:57:13,108
And once you see those vibrations and judge
them on vibrations, then you are a Sahaja

790
00:57:13,109 --> 00:57:15,439
Yogi, otherwise I would not call you at all
a Sahaja Yogi.

791
00:57:15,439 --> 00:57:17,138
But for a Guru it is very important.

792
00:57:17,139 --> 00:57:22,070
I have seen sometimes even the leaders supporting
somebody who is absolutely horrid!

793
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:26,119
I can’t bear that person even for five minutes!

794
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:32,320
But here the Guru sends him over to Me, “Oh,
Mother, he’s so good, you know, he donated

795
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,320
so much money."

796
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,320
It doesn’t matter.

797
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,800
You donated money, so what?

798
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,370
Who asked him to donate money?

799
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:41,679
But he should not donate his bhoots to us
now anymore!

800
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:43,800
We don’t want his bhoot!

801
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,800
So that’s what it is.

802
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:49,209
So the judgment should be correct about a
person when you say that this man is not good

803
00:57:49,209 --> 00:57:50,879
or that is not good.

804
00:57:50,879 --> 00:57:56,540
But mostly ‘gurus’ themselves are caught
up and then they are ambitious and if somebody

805
00:57:56,540 --> 00:58:01,089
doesn’t listen to them or somebody wants
to give a lecture at a wrong time and somebody

806
00:58:01,089 --> 00:58:04,840
says, “You shouldn’t talk like this,”
or something, then they get angry.

807
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:09,490
They are very hot tempered and they provoke
people, they say things sometimes.

808
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:12,570
And then when people react they say, “You
are a bad Sahaja Yogi."

809
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:13,570
That’s not the way.

810
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:22,109
First of all a guru or a leader has to be
himself a very mild, gentle, and a good person.

811
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:27,159
He has to be in such a way [that] he should
not demand anything, should not ask for anything.

812
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:28,620
Never demand anything!

813
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:34,000
Anybody who demands can not be a guru.

814
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,439
Respect is to be commanded and not to be demanded.

815
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:45,899
And so, everything works out well if you understand
that – once you rise in your ascent, in

816
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:50,550
your wisdom, in your awareness and in your
Spirit – automatically all these things

817
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:51,550
happen!

818
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:56,229
You don’t have to ask for anything, you
don’t have to plead for anything, you don’t

819
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:58,709
have to complain for anything, everything
works out.

820
00:58:58,709 --> 00:59:03,010
You are looked after by all the ganas, by
all the angels.

821
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:04,249
They are there.

822
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,790
You are on the stage.

823
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:07,649
But if you are halfway then they play tricks
with you.

824
00:59:07,649 --> 00:59:14,099
You see, they play tricks, they make you falter,
you have problems, you go here, you go there,

825
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:18,658
all these things happen and then you say,
“Mother, how is it this happened?”

826
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:24,150
Because they are also jokers, so they play
jokes with you and they make problems for

827
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:26,949
you just to make you understand that you are
doing wrong.

828
00:59:26,949 --> 00:59:33,560
So we are on a stage where there’s a beautiful
security, everything is there and we have

829
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:39,740
to give to the world such a great thing like
Sahaja Yoga, which is for the emancipation

830
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:45,050
of the whole world, as you realise, and so
also I hope you realise your responsibilities.

831
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:51,129
There are so many things one has to understand,
how one has to be as a guru, how he has to

832
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,490
act and how he has to work out.

833
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:58,859
Now I have given so many lectures on Guru
things, but, for today’s lecture, only I

834
00:59:58,859 --> 01:00:07,189
have to say that, first thing, to have a guru
system, you must have complete humility.

835
01:00:07,189 --> 01:00:16,980
Now, with Me, I would say, I am too simple
and I am Mahamaya, so you be very careful.

836
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,369
You cannot take liberties with Me.

837
01:00:20,369 --> 01:00:21,640
You cannot take.

838
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:26,908
If you try to take too much liberties that
means you are not a disciple.

839
01:00:26,909 --> 01:00:30,599
A disciple has to keep a distance from the
Guru.

840
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:35,289
You cannot just take liberties, walk into
My room every time, sit there for hours together,

841
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:36,879
chit-chat with Me – nothing!

842
01:00:36,879 --> 01:00:38,990
You have no right.

843
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:45,261
Only when I call you, when I ask for you,
you should come.

844
01:00:45,261 --> 01:00:49,169
Then you should not force things on the Guru
that, “Please, come and listen to this,”

845
01:00:49,169 --> 01:00:51,849
or, “Do this!” that should not be said.

846
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:57,698
For example, yesterday nobody told Me there
are going to be these music programs or everything

847
01:00:57,699 --> 01:00:58,699
arranged.

848
01:00:58,699 --> 01:01:04,459
So we have to report everything to your leader,
or to Me, all those things that you want to

849
01:01:04,459 --> 01:01:05,459
do.

850
01:01:05,459 --> 01:01:06,459
And it should be really transparent.

851
01:01:06,459 --> 01:01:10,530
Like this hand knows everything that this
hand is doing, and this hand knows everything

852
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:11,718
that this hand is doing.

853
01:01:11,719 --> 01:01:14,740
In the same way everybody should know each
other.

854
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:19,369
Then the gurus should not have jealousies
for each other.

855
01:01:19,369 --> 01:01:25,218
This I’m just telling you because also I
found out that there are certain jealousies.

856
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:32,990
And when they talk there is a little bit of,
“Ha, he’s good, but this, this, this."

857
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:38,550
When they enjoy each other’s company because
they have reached a certain state and they

858
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:41,100
understand, “This is the state we are in."

859
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:45,740
When they enjoy each other’s company fully
and appreciate each other much more than anybody

860
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:49,849
else – the guru’s company.

861
01:01:49,849 --> 01:01:59,050
All the company of the leaders, if they enjoy
each other and there’s no jealousy, there’s

862
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:03,658
no fight, there’s no problem but just the
enjoyment of the company, then they should

863
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:05,060
know that they have become a guru.

864
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:07,320
Now all of them never fought with each other.

865
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,320
They supported.

866
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:12,309
Actually it is one Principle was born again
and again.

867
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:18,439
But only the satanic people – they’ll
fight among themselves, not the godly.

868
01:02:18,439 --> 01:02:26,270
And also they will talk against the person
who is a realised soul or who is an Incarnation,

869
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:27,329
but never against themselves.

870
01:02:27,329 --> 01:02:33,178
It’s very surprising that the satanic people
though they fight among themselves, there

871
01:02:33,179 --> 01:02:36,669
are jealousies, they’ll never talk of each
other.

872
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:40,160
But here I find that in Sahaja Yoga we have
freedom.

873
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:44,899
But freedom is not abandonment, is the freedom
with complete rules and regulations of the

874
01:02:44,899 --> 01:02:50,500
Divine, with us, and we have to know them
that this is the Divine Law.

875
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:56,763
So all of us are now sitting like in a big
vimana, like an aeroplane, and we all have

876
01:02:56,763 --> 01:02:58,449
to land into the beautiful area.

877
01:02:58,449 --> 01:03:10,250
But first of all we have to develop that humility
in your heart; complete humility and surrender,

878
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:11,250
that’s very important.

879
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:15,250
Unless and until you have that humility and
surrender in your heart, Guru principle can

880
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:16,560
not be awakened.

881
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:21,169
First you have to be the disciple and then
the guru.

882
01:03:21,169 --> 01:03:24,220
So you have to develop that humility.

883
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:30,260
And that humility comes very easily if you
love Me, respect Me.

884
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:31,280
It’s not only love, but respect.

885
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:41,330
That respect has to be there and then people
will respect you.

886
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:43,330
May God bless you
