1
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,560
Shri Mataji: It’s quite.

2
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,560
Sahaja Yogi: Still quite, some more people
are coming.

3
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,560
Few people are still coming.

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,610
So, with Mataji’s permission, I will just
say a few more words while people are still

5
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:42,830
coming into the hall so that when She speaks
that can be full attention.

6
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:48,800
Because this is a subject where we have to
really give our attention fully and not be

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:56,620
distracted by what’s going on in the next
seat or behind us.

8
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:03,550
What has to happen is that our attention should
go inside.

9
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:11,650
It’s not an easy thing for people who are
used to thinking, to stop thinking, and just

10
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,200
watch what’s going on.

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,909
Because we are so identified with our thoughts,
we don’t realize that they’re not reality

12
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:28,700
and they’re actually preventing us from
experiencing reality which is absolutely the

13
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,100
present time.

14
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:45,759
So, please realize that if you have come here
to get something, it’s something personal

15
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:58,399
to you by which your relationship to others
is very much purified and improved but which

16
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:07,319
is for you and it’s for them also, but you
don’t worry about them.

17
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:20,360
Now one thing which will help this experience
to take place, this happening to work out,

18
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:28,790
is if you don’t mind to take out take off
your shoes and just rest your stocking feet

19
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,020
on the floor.

20
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:35,660
It’s a very simple reason for doing this
it’s like an earthing system.

21
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:41,720
It’s just giving a contact with the Mother
Earth.

22
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:52,550
It’s not a meaningless thing that the Muslims
insist that we do this when we go to their

23
00:02:52,550 --> 00:03:05,180
mosques because Mohammed was a genuine teacher
who was connected to this All-pervading source

24
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:15,319
and who tried to teach people the actions
that would help them to be balanced and to

25
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,040
reach this higher state.

26
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,590
But people follow it without understanding
why they’re doing it.

27
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:29,980
So it’s simply to provide an earthing an
outlet if you like for negativity to pass

28
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,670
out because we have to become the Spirit.

29
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:42,780
We are the Spirit but we have to have that
knowledge.

30
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:53,610
And by letting all our thoughts all up but
Karma’s all our emotional hang-ups farce

31
00:03:53,610 --> 00:04:02,599
out through the different elements like the
earth, the flame of the candle, into the sky,

32
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:05,469
then we find the Spirit is what remains.

33
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:16,940
It’s absolutely silent, it’s absolutely
untarnished it cannot be killed as Christ

34
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,200
proved.

35
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:28,550
It cannot be harmed by anything; it’s born
again and again.

36
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:38,240
And we have to know the joy of the Spirit
which is just to be the Silent Witness of

37
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:46,110
all the activity that goes on in our lives.

38
00:04:46,110 --> 00:05:19,009
So now I’d like to introduce the Divine
Mother Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

39
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:38,120
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: No, I’ll stand.

40
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:46,800
Shri Mataji: I bow to all the seekers of truth.

41
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:59,520
At the very outset I must thank our very respected
mayor of North Hank Hampton to grant us permission

42
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:10,539
to use this beautiful Hall for this work of
God.

43
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:25,770
Yesterday, at Bedford, I explained to you
about this energy which is placed in the sacrum

44
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:35,620
bone which in Sanskrit language is called
as Kundalini.

45
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:43,080
This energy is placed in the “sacrum”
bone which is the Greek word; that means Greek

46
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:50,229
people also knew that there is something sacred
in this bone.

47
00:06:50,229 --> 00:07:02,889
Now this energy is the energy of desire within
us, the primordial desire, the ultimate desire

48
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:08,870
that is not yet manifested.

49
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,289
That is the reason it is called as residual.

50
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:18,460
This desire is to become one with the Divine.

51
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:31,621
We are born today in these modern times in
a very great time I should say because this

52
00:07:31,621 --> 00:07:34,330
is the Blossom time of human beings.

53
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:45,280
Never before in the history of spirituality,
so many seekers were born, so many honest

54
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,889
sincere seekers of Spirit were born.

55
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:57,550
There are a special category of people they
don’t know why they are not satisfied with

56
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:05,030
what they have, perhaps they don’t know
even what they have to seek but definitely

57
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:13,040
they know that they have to seek something
new.

58
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:24,220
We have our scriptures all over the world
and to understand as I said the personality

59
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:33,400
of any incarnation like Christ, we have to
consult every scripture to see where it is

60
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:41,120
indicated about the life of these incarnations.

61
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:58,140
This knowledge of the beyond, knowledge about
the roots of the Tree of Life was a secret

62
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:04,680
knowledge before, was very limited, was given
to very few people.

63
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:12,250
It’s described that at the time of Rama,
his father-in-law Nanaka, who was the incarnation

64
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:19,290
of the Primordial master, had
only one disciple who came to ask for Self-realization.

65
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:27,110
And he said: “You can ask for my kingdom”
because he was a king, “but don’t ask

66
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,709
for this”.

67
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:33,680
Because that was the beginning of life.

68
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:44,800
But as in the story of a tree, there are only
one or two flowers in the beginning a time

69
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:56,589
comes when there’s a Blossom time and many
flowers blossom and the wind comes which sends

70
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:59,750
the
message and they become the fruits.

71
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:07,230
That’s what is the time today is the time
of Resurrection as described in Quran, as

72
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,190
time of judgment as described in the Bible.

73
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:19,640
This is described by a great astrologer in
India, who was born thousands of years back

74
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,820
whose books were revised about 300 years back.

75
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,700
He has described this time again.

76
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:38,850
When we think of the Resurrection time or
the time of judgment, we must understand that

77
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:44,740
this judgment has to come to us spontaneously
from a living force.

78
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,770
Because God is a living being and his force
is living.

79
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:55,139
All the living things you see that exist – for
example, a flower becomes a fruit.

80
00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:00,190
All such tremendous things, we see we take
it for granted, are the blessings of this

81
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:06,160
living force which is all-pervading but it
is subtle which we cannot feel.

82
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:12,980
That’s what Christ has said that, “you
are to be born again” that’s a very important

83
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,980
thing.

84
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,890
Actually, he came on this earth with this
message.

85
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:22,709
He didn’t come to establish any balance
within us because that was done by Moses and

86
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:24,640
Abraham and all these people.

87
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,970
But he actually came on this earth for us
to ascend.

88
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:38,170
This is the greatest message and Resurrection
is his message and not crucifixion.

89
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:44,670
Crucifixion has a very great
meaning no doubt and about which I’ll tell

90
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,079
you later as I’ll go from chakras to chakras.

91
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:56,170
When he said about the Holy Ghost he could
not explain either.

92
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,130
The reason being there was no time.

93
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:07,130
There were only four years for him to speak
about all these things and that’s how he

94
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,050
could not explain what was the Holy Ghost.

95
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,010
So, for every practical purpose, it’s a
mystery.

96
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,019
But after Realization, you will be amazed,
it’s not a mystery.

97
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:23,470
You know everything about the domain of God,
his laws and methods.

98
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,630
Once you get your Realization, it’s a surprising
thing.

99
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:34,111
But it is surprising because we do not know
what we are.

100
00:12:34,111 --> 00:12:40,610
We do not know the Tree of Life is within
us and that this divine power appears as the

101
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:49,370
centres as described in the Bible: tongues
of flames, I will appear before you like tongues

102
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,370
of flames.

103
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,930
And you really see them as tongues of flames.

104
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:57,959
These centres are silent tongues of flames
burning with different colours.

105
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:05,040
Of course, especially at the top, they have
many colours and all these colours are beautifully

106
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,320
displayed and really peace giving.

107
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:16,290
But all this, what I am saying to you, is
not to be taken for granted either and not

108
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,460
to have faith in Me blindly.

109
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,630
That’s not the way to approach Sahaja Yoga.

110
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,810
Because I’m talking of reality and not of
some brainwashing.

111
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:32,589
It’s the reality that you must get and you
have to be honest about it that you have to

112
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:34,920
get the reality.

113
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:45,170
Now, when I say that all these things are
within us, I am saying it like a hypothesis

114
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,290
in a scientific research.

115
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:53,730
And once it is proved to be true then you
have to believe in it.

116
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:59,199
So, as a research
student or as a person who is trying to know

117
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:05,040
the new knowledge about the roots, you have
to keep yourself open and a little tolerant

118
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,759
about it.

119
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:07,759
As Mr.

120
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:14,019
Brown has told you that we have many angsts
and that’s why the problem is that’s why

121
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,019
we are confused.

122
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:21,200
But this Kundalini is such a force that it
shoots off taking you away from all those

123
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:29,250
angsts and makes the Spirit shine in your
attention in your central nervous system.

124
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:38,510
Now the Spirit is a reflection of God Almighty
within you.

125
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:45,520
That’s the collective being because God
is a collective being it is a collective being.

126
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,610
It is not that I say you are all brothers
or sisters that’s not the way so brainwashing,

127
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,649
but it exists within us as an actuality.

128
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:59,360
And when you actualize the Spirit you become
collectively conscious.

129
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:06,250
You become, that means on your fingers as
you see, you start feeling other people.

130
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:14,970
Then there is nobody the other you can feel
yourself your centres and you can find out

131
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:20,100
what’s wrong with you what’s wrong with
others.

132
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:26,470
Today, when I met the radio gentlemen, they
suggested that people would be very anxious

133
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,370
to
know how people get cured by Sahaja Yoga.

134
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:36,890
So, first I would like to explain to you what
happens.

135
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:46,690
This force the residual force within you is
the Kundalini as I told you and is the power

136
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:53,810
that, when rises, she pierces through all
these centres.

137
00:15:53,810 --> 00:16:02,769
And all these centres represent our physical
being our emotional being our mental being

138
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:04,310
and our spiritual being.

139
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:13,570
For example, the very first one that you see
here, the red one, is our innocence.

140
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,790
Innocence as human beings.

141
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,699
As animals we had innocence.

142
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:24,660
Then God created human beings and he gave
them freedom.

143
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,330
He said: “All right, you’ll be on your
own keep your innocence.

144
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:34,269
Don’t run towards the so-called knowledge,
the knowledge: “What is this matter?

145
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:35,269
What is that?

146
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:36,269
Who is God?

147
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:38,300
All those things.

148
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,399
Keep innocent”.

149
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,350
If he had maintained that innocence with our
freedom intact there would have no problem

150
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,000
at all.

151
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,579
But in the curiosity of human beings when
they had the freedom, they consulted a satanic

152
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,040
force.

153
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,149
And the so-called book of knowledge started
opening out.

154
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:05,690
So, whatever we have got the knowledge is
a “avidya ” is not knowledge, it is non-knowledge.

155
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,140
Because by knowing this you do not know the
way about it.

156
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,868
For example, if you know that is gravity in
the matter or you can say there is gravity

157
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,300
in the mother earth, you just know there is
gravity.

158
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:24,920
It’s just a statement of fact which you
see with your eyes but you can’t say why,

159
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,930
why there is gravity.

160
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:33,710
Whatever you learnt through science is just
the knowledge that you see but you cannot

161
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,760
explain why it is there.

162
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:43,700
So, it is not a complete knowledge it is just
a gross knowledge of the thing that you have

163
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,940
which you can use for your purpose.

164
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,130
Also, science can help.

165
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:53,270
Now, I find science is very helpful because
if there was not a microphone, I could not

166
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,690
have talked to you people.

167
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,850
If there was no television people could not
have received

168
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:02,170
vibrations those who received on the television
today.

169
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,690
It should not have impossible.

170
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,710
So, even the science has helped you.

171
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,880
But that knowledge was not required and it
was all right.

172
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:17,860
But when we chose the other way, God also
helped us by sending on this earth many incarnations

173
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,840
to first tell us that: “You’d better establish
your balance”.

174
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:29,300
And this balancing was done at this point
[the Void] where you see the green circle

175
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,110
which is here in the stomach.

176
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,170
So, this balance has to be established.

177
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:38,970
When we got the Ten Commandments, you see,
we thought it’s a challenge to our ego:

178
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:43,020
who are they to say: “Thou shalt not do
this “.

179
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,980
What’s wrong?

180
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,892
Everybody says “what’s wrong?” when
they preach people don’t like it because

181
00:18:48,892 --> 00:18:50,080
those please do not follow it, you see?

182
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,480
Naturally people say: “What’s this?”

183
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,570
But when the Kundalini awakens, she enlightens
these Ten Commandments so we can say the religion

184
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,150
within you.

185
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:05,270
That’s called as the principle of the Master
within you.

186
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:10,970
The master – say, in the car the one who
is the master is watching the driver who’s

187
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:11,970
driving.

188
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:19,370
First, learning how to drive, then suddenly
he finds a driver has become an expert.

189
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,710
And then he becomes a master.

190
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:27,640
In the same way, when you start moving towards
the right-side of action and the left-side

191
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,430
of desire you act.

192
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:38,630
Balance it: you make errors, mistakes you
correct them, again you balance it.

193
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:43,720
You discover the mistakes you have made, again
you balance it.

194
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:50,100
But these Ten Commandments, when they are
enlightened within you, you just don’t do

195
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:55,570
those things, you don’t like it, you just
don’t like, you just give up because there’s

196
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,570
enlightenment.

197
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,740
For example, in this hall there is no light
then you may fumble down when they fall down

198
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,340
you may learn by following ten times that
there are so many steps.

199
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,891
But if there is light you can see everything.

200
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:10,060
You can see the absolute relationship between
everything.

201
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,280
So, when you discover your absolute, the relative
position of everything is understood and automatically

202
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
you become righteous.

203
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
Nobody has to tell you: “Become righteous
“.

204
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,240
You just become you can’t help it.

205
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:31,420
So, this is what it is we the diseases are
caused mostly by imbalances.

206
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:39,130
As Mr Brown has told you that the Mother Earth
sucks the problems because all these centres

207
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:44,020
are made out of the elements, different elements
at different levels.

208
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:49,840
And we have imbalances of these elements in
our body and that’s how we get sick.

209
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:58,140
So, now the Mother Earth gives us, if she’s
here, if she knows Me, she’ll suck your

210
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,390
problems which are come by the imbalance of
the mother earth.

211
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:08,790
For example, arthritis and things like that,
all these come as problems of Mother Earth.

212
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:14,680
Especially in the cold countries people have
this trouble they can be cured by taking help

213
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
of the Mother Earth.

214
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,520
It’s very surprising.

215
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,480
The other day I had an Indian lady at my house.

216
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:25,700
She has terrible arthritis, and her hands
were like this and she couldn’t walk.

217
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:33,850
But when she understood how to ask the Mother
Earth to take away her problems and the methods

218
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:38,960
of divine laws, within half an hour she got
rid of her arthritis.

219
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:46,160
Even yesterday there was one gentleman who
got better, much better which his arthritis.

220
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,630
In the same way, we have problems with the
imbalances within us.

221
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,730
Now, let us see what problems do we have with
imbalances.

222
00:21:53,730 --> 00:22:00,780
I am sorry, today I am going to speak on more
about our physical side because specially

223
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,741
he said people will be interested and I think
if you are physically not all right, how can

224
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,770
you be all right spiritually?

225
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:14,730
Now the imbalances we have within us, because
we are extremists.

226
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:22,080
If you are a person who is emotional you go
to the end of your emotions till you become

227
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,240
mad and lunatic.

228
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:30,850
You weep out yourself so much that you have
to land up in some lunatic asylum.

229
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,660
But nature has its own way of controlling
that.

230
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:40,890
For example, a person who is a lunatic never,
never has the failure of the brain.

231
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:50,590
It should be but the failure- on the contrary
the failure of the brain it has, but not the

232
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:57,590
failure of the heart, though an emotional
person works with the heart.

233
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:02,050
On the contrary the one who works too much
with the brain, thinks of the future, plans

234
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:07,000
too much, his brain should fail but his heart
fails.

235
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,580
All heart failures come to people who think
of the future, plan too much, think all the

236
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:18,450
time, all the time worried about the future,
work very hard physically because the right

237
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,650
side is the physical and the mental side.

238
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,690
They have all heart problems.

239
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:30,850
And those who are very emotional, I mean,
you say heart too much, always crying, weeping,

240
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,620
they get failure of the brain.

241
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,990
Just imagine, what a balance is build!

242
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:42,540
And a doctor told Me, from a mental hospital,
that they have a cardiograph machine, but

243
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:49,130
it was never used because a lunatic’s heart
never fails.

244
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:57,500
So, once you have such an imbalance nature
takes the respite but it can be very fatal

245
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,900
and dangerous.

246
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,510
There are many diseases which are caused,
really, most of the diseases are caused by

247
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,640
imbalances.

248
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,750
Now let us take out a person who is a very
speedy person, it’s very common these days.

249
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,000
I mean people are so speedy that you don’t
know how to talk to them.

250
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,580
They are telescopically speedy their words
go telescopically and you don’t know how

251
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,640
to scan it out, how to talk to them.

252
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,420
Now such people who are speedy, who are running
all the time, who are not there in the present

253
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:33,180
at all, all the time of the future are the
people who move too much on the right hand-side.

254
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:43,740
And there is the second centre which is looking
after the right-side, the creativity, the

255
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,590
thinking.

256
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:51,490
Because when you think the cells of the brain
are replaced every minute by the fat that

257
00:24:51,490 --> 00:25:00,010
is in your stomach, by this centre which we
call as Swadisthana which in the gross expresses

258
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:03,600
itself as aortic plexus.

259
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,140
Of course, the medical science won’t accept
it but when we have proved it by curing people

260
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,410
I hope they will accept it.

261
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:14,590
Now this imbalance comes in because you are
all the time thinking.

262
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:24,980
Now this poor centre has to look after other
organs within us like the liver, spleen, pancreas,

263
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:30,710
kidneys, intestines and uterus.

264
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:35,860
Now such a person who is thinking all the
time neglects all these organs and any one

265
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,150
of these diseases he can have.

266
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:47,740
For example, he can have liver [problems]
he can have diabetes, he can have leukaemia.

267
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:53,610
Leukaemia cost more to these speedy people
not so much to the people who are futuristic,

268
00:25:53,610 --> 00:26:02,680
but more to the people who are speedy.

269
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,340
Because the spleen acts for our emergencies.

270
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:15,910
Supposing a person is extremely speedy; he
just rushes to the bathroom, takes his bath

271
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:21,210
goes and gets his breakfast and drives on
the way eating his breakfast all the time.

272
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:25,810
Poor spleen does know how to cope with this
crazy personality.

273
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:29,080
Because here it is, he’s going in a mad
rush.

274
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,500
In the modern times, you see the traffic is
so bad, they just, they are shouting at the

275
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
traffic.

276
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,330
Then there’s a breakfast going on.

277
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:41,460
All these things are going simultaneously
and poor, this spleen, doesn’t know how

278
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:48,110
to react and how to cope all the time to these
emergencies, one after another, simultaneously

279
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,730
so many coming up.

280
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:57,780
So, it gets crazy it loses its control completely
and it starts producing additional blood cells

281
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,580
and blood cells and blood cells.

282
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:06,960
And when they become too much then they start
flowing on their own, because there is no

283
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,700
relationship left now because of the speediness.

284
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,360
And that’s how Leukaemia has established.

285
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,820
Now leukaemia can be easily cured, very easily
cured.

286
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,760
Because when you put your hand when you are
a Realized soul the energy is flowing.

287
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,560
You just you put your hand on the spleen of
the person, you’ll be surprised that the

288
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,060
spleen settles down because it gets new vitality.

289
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:37,850
It gets the wisdom from these vibrations,
we can say, from this energy because this

290
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:42,180
energy is the one that thinks, that cooperates
and organizes.

291
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,170
That’s the one which sorts out also all
kinds of plants and everything.

292
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:55,020
It is this living energy which when given
to the spleen it becomes wiser: it rests,

293
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,020
it becomes silent.

294
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:02,730
And also, if you give the person the balance
with your hand, you can make the person much

295
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:08,620
more relaxed, much more silent within himself.

296
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,140
And that is how you can cure.

297
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:16,410
And we have, not only that, I have cured of
course nowadays, I don’t cure people much.

298
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:21,200
There’s a disciple in America and one gentleman
met Me in a village.

299
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,960
He came in his car and he told me that: “My
grandson has gone to America for his treatment

300
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,190
of leukaemia and now they said he’s a gone
case and in 15 days he is going to die.

301
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,920
That’s the certificate”.

302
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:40,750
So, I told him that: “I’m so busy in the
villages now, you can go back and bring up

303
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:48,420
this lady she’s there in New York and she’s
an American Sahaja Yogini “.

304
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,090
And he rang her.

305
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,650
She said: “All right, I’ll try to work
it out “.

306
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,800
And she cured him.

307
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:00,310
The boy came to see Me in London he’s now
back in the school, he’s perfectly all right.

308
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,860
Now people think it’s magical.

309
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,860
It is not!

310
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,040
It’s nothing so great.

311
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:10,030
Because we take so many things for granted,
every day, if you see the living work of God,

312
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,030
it’s tremendous!

313
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:15,750
Look at this honey, look at the way the flowers
become fruits.

314
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:20,790
I mean millions and billions of things we
take it for granted even our evolution from

315
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,430
amoeba to the stage we have come.

316
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,560
We don’t know how we have come, how God
has done it.

317
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,110
It’s done so delicately with such care with
such understanding.

318
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:35,180
At least we should know that there must be
some meaning when he has brought us to this

319
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,410
level as a human being.

320
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,580
What is the meaning?

321
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,580
Why?

322
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,860
What was the reason?

323
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,470
Why he made us like this?

324
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:49,590
And just when you discover this meaning spontaneously
automatically this thing gets cured, because

325
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:52,850
that vitality starts coming to you from the
top.

326
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,520
Now we grow over tensions why?

327
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:02,630
Because you see, there, with the activity
of these two sides left and right side, we

328
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:06,530
develop two big balloons in our head.

329
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:12,660
With the left-side one which is for conditioning
us, which frightens us, gives us fear and

330
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:18,890
all that, which is our past, we develop an
institution call “superego”.

331
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:26,180
Such people are all the time under fear, under
danger, or crying, weeping sort of people.

332
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,650
The other side are the people who act.

333
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:34,550
When they act, they have another by-product
in the head called “ego” which you must

334
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,410
have heard quite a lot.

335
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:41,530
And this Mr ego is on one side and superego
on another side and once they close down will

336
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,860
become like an eggshell.

337
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,110
You are closed.

338
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,810
You have an “I-ness”.

339
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:51,050
You are Mr So, you are Mrs So.

340
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:58,340
Now when this is accumulated there [Agnya]
we feel the tension because either we are

341
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:04,820
in action or we are in whipping conditions
where we are in inaction.

342
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,700
This tension mounts up in the head and you
feel the tension.

343
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,900
And with this tension you get all sort of
complications.

344
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,120
With the left-side you might get low blood
pressure and all that.

345
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,720
With the right-side you might get high blood
pressure.

346
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,370
Now how do you reduce the tension?

347
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,110
People ask Me how do you reduce the tension?

348
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,650
It’s a very simple thing.

349
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,670
You see, life’s work is extremely simple.

350
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,860
Like your own breathing is so simple!

351
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,510
Have you ever thought about the breathing
that you do?

352
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:34,950
You don’t read any books you don’t go
anywhere you don’t consult anyone it just

353
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,150
happens to you.

354
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:41,450
In the same way, it’s such a simple thing
that your tension on the head is because either

355
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,840
you are worried or you are planning something.

356
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,810
You are aggressive or you are taking the aggression;
one of the two.

357
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,280
So, what happens?

358
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:58,000
Here I say that Christ plays a very big role
in our life because he is placed in that crossing

359
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,560
point if you see.

360
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,570
This is the cross.

361
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:05,860
When he said on the cross: “It has been
accomplished”.

362
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:17,060
When he says that the placing of Christ in
that little space of ego and superego is accomplished.

363
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:26,890
When Christ is awakened through the kindling
of the Kundalini then these two things are

364
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:27,890
sucked in.

365
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:31,470
That’s why we say he died for our sins because
the left-side are the sins and the right-side

366
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,850
are the Karmas the action, the ego.

367
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,760
So, he sucks it.

368
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,539
By that suction you are amazed that suddenly
you find there’s a depression here like

369
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:42,540
a child has.

370
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,920
And you feel the throbbing here.

371
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,180
And after the throbbing you feel the cool
breeze coming out of your head.

372
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,650
From your own head the cool breeze is coming
out.

373
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,280
This Holy Ghost is manifesting herself.

374
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,280
And she’s all around.

375
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:00,740
Also, you can start feeling in your hands
if your- this centre is all right.

376
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,920
This is what he meant “to be born again”.

377
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,190
Not just to call some people: “All right
now we have a baptism”.

378
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:10,510
So, the poor child is screaming and you put
your hand on his head and say: “All right,

379
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,510
you’re baptized now”.

380
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,670
That’s artificial, it’s just a drama.

381
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,010
And this kind of drama they do in every religion.

382
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,890
It’s not only in Christianity.

383
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:21,960
You’ll find even Hindus do the same joke
and everybody has the same joke.

384
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,880
But it’s not true because if there is baptism
there has to be transformation.

385
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,420
And there is no transformation whether you
baptize a child or not.

386
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:33,700
On the contrary, I have seen some children
they become funny.

387
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,260
Because this is a very precious place, it
is a very holy place [Sahasrara] and anybody

388
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:44,030
who is not a holy person who is not a sanctified
person places the hand on top of the head

389
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:47,100
of such any child, he can become even mad.

390
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:55,040
We had three examples of that kind that people
who got baptism, children who are perfectly

391
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:01,950
normal but after baptism their eyes started
squinting around and they lost their awareness.

392
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:07,640
Because the people who put their hands on
this very precious holy place where not themselves

393
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,640
holy.

394
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,720
They didn’t have a clean heart.

395
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:16,030
And that’s why- this is the centre of the
heart which is there in the Spirit.

396
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:23,091
And this one [Sahasrara] when it is touched
by someone who has a heart of a stone can

397
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:25,560
pass bad vibrations satanic vibrations.

398
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,339
People can spoil them.

399
00:34:27,339 --> 00:34:32,129
You have a very great poet in this country-
you had him- was William Blake.

400
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:34,540
And he said: “A priest cursed on my head”.

401
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,409
And people asked Me: “What it is?”

402
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:41,710
I said: “The priest must be somebody who
is not such a good man perhaps and he touched

403
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,710
his forehead”.

404
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,030
Because he was a Realized soul.

405
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:49,190
And he’s written so much about Sahaja Yoga
that nowhere in the world I have seen so much

406
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:53,280
written about Sahaja Yoga as your great poet
William Blake.

407
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,820
Now when this happens so many other things
can also happen to us.

408
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:03,840
For example, a person who is very emotional,
for example, the one who is always whipping

409
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,560
crying going to the left-side.

410
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:12,800
Oh, they are – most of the people feel guilty
that’s the worst disease of the West.

411
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,710
By feeling guilty you get spondylitis, thyroid
all kinds of troubles.

412
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,980
So, no use.

413
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,440
What’s the use to feeling guilty after all?

414
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,970
Or people who believe that “we must suffer”.

415
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,870
Now this I can’t understand at all!

416
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:29,390
Because Christ has suffered for us.

417
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,650
What more are we going to suffer?

418
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,210
Now he suffered already for us.

419
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,800
Has he left something for us to suffer?

420
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,890
Those people who believe like Jews did believe
in such a thing, they suffered.

421
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,960
We don’t have to suffer at all!

422
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,990
That’s a promise.

423
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,210
He suffered for us.

424
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,970
Only thing, we have to awaken him, that’s
all.

425
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:55,010
Nor do we have to feel we are very guilty
because if you feel guilty then this left-side

426
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,900
gets caught up [Left Vishudhi].

427
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:03,050
And it creates a problem for your Realization
first of all and secondly, it might give you

428
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,060
a physical problem.

429
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:09,630
I’ve seen this is very common with the West
people I don’t know why they should feel

430
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,630
guilty.

431
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:19,170
One must know that God Almighty is the ocean
of compassion, ocean of love, ocean of forgiveness.

432
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:24,120
We cannot understand his forgiveness, we cannot
be like him.

433
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,670
And what guilt can we have?

434
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:32,060
Even the judges on this earth who are just
human beings cannot punish you.

435
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,990
How can that God is going to punish you for
what?

436
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:39,610
So, we live with myths: “Oh, I should not
have done it, I should not have done it”.

437
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:44,160
This has come also with our modern life.

438
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,350
For example, if you put your fork and spoon
in this way then you are all right, sophisticated.

439
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:53,870
If you just put it a little this way: then
you are: “Oh, I should not have done it”.

440
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:57,620
If you spill the coffee then you are as if
you’d murdered three persons the way you

441
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,620
feel about it.

442
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,660
It is not so.

443
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,490
It’s not so.

444
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:05,440
In the realm of God what does it matter?

445
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
It’s nothing important.

446
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,720
For him, the most important thing is that
you are a human being.

447
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:15,490
And you must know that you are at the epitome
of the whole creation and that should have

448
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:19,670
no self-pity about it, no self-pity at all.

449
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:26,670
But you must have self-confidence that God
has created you with a purpose, that you become

450
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:31,080
collectively conscious and you see the play
of God’s beauty and his glory.

451
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,590
That’s why he has created you.

452
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:38,940
Not to feel guilty not to have self-pity and
to cry and weep and always say: “I’m horrible.

453
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,060
I have problems”.

454
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:46,090
Such people get troubles to themselves while
those are aggressive trouble others.

455
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:49,950
Both are just the same in the eyes of God
whether you trouble yourself or others, it’s

456
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,900
just the same.

457
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:59,320
Now this kind of an imbalance that comes within
us can be corrected with the awakening of

458
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,860
Christ within us.

459
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:05,910
The chanting at this place when he is awakened,
when he is awakened because you are to be

460
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,950
connected with him.

461
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:10,641
Then is our Lord’s prayer that’s the mantra.

462
00:38:10,641 --> 00:38:18,380
We have to say that he is kept awakened and
that is the chanting we have.

463
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:25,310
You’ll be amazed after coming to Sahaja
Yoga the Christians who hated the Jews have

464
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:36,020
understood the importance of Moses because
he resides in this void part, this green circle

465
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:42,560
and all ten of them who incarnated again and
again reside there.

466
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,490
Now those who are fanatics say, those who
believe that only more Muhammad is the one

467
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:56,490
or those who believe that only the Moses is
the one or any such funny ideas, they also

468
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:59,950
suffer physically.

469
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:06,763
I had a doctor from Iran, about ten years
back I should say, he came to England to see

470
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:11,390
me and he had a cancer of the stomach.

471
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:17,400
And I asked him, I said: “Do you believe
that Muhammad is the only one you had?”

472
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,400
“Yes.

473
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,400
I believe in that."

474
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,700
I said: “How can it be?

475
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,580
He himself has said there have been many prophets.

476
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,990
And how can you say that he’s the only one?”

477
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,660
So, he said: “No, no, no.

478
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,701
He was the last.

479
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:34,120
He was the most modern so I believe in him
and I don’t believe in anybody else”.

480
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,600
I said: “You have to believe in Moses.

481
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
“Oh!

482
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
That I cannot believe.

483
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,050
These Jews, I can’t believe in them.

484
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,220
I hate the Jews I can’t believe Moses."

485
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,430
I said: “All right, go ahead, if you can’t
believe in him.

486
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,270
Same is Nanaka.

487
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:50,340
Same is Janaka.

488
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,500
They are the same people again born again.

489
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,230
And the same quality of the Primordial master
is born again.

490
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:59,210
I said: “All right, go ahead, I cannot cure
you if you are a fanatic you suffer."

491
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:02,460
So, he went home and he had a bad time.

492
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,110
Doctor said: “You are going to die now”.

493
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,970
So, after eight days his wife brought him
again.

494
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:11,820
I said: “Now do you believe in it?” he
said: “Yes Mother, I do.

495
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,930
Please, cure me”.

496
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,170
And he got cured.

497
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,790
He’s still alive all right.

498
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,730
Fanaticism has its own respite to.

499
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:22,890
Fanaticism is real madness I should say to
be fanatical about something.

500
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:26,960
It’s a mental projection to believe that
somebody belongs to you.

501
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,730
Actually, you have to belong to them and nobody
belongs to you.

502
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:38,890
This fight of religion imagine when you see
that in this world there are fights going

503
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:42,860
on in the name of God, in the name of religion,
you’re shocked!

504
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:50,000
The things that were created for peace, for
bliss and for heavenly abode of human beings

505
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,060
are being used for something that is absolutely
opposite of that.

506
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:04,030
It’s most surprising how people are believing
into a team to such an extent that they are

507
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:10,100
just getting monopolized and filthen [unsure]
and they are torturing others.

508
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:15,320
It could become even very sophisticated like
people who have formed lots of mental projections

509
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:19,600
you see, they have dogmas, this, that and
they cultivate you every time they have a

510
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,650
lecture and then you believe in it: “Oh,
oui, [yes?] this is this”.

511
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,710
And from your childhood you are told, “you
are like this you are like that”.

512
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,600
Ultimately, what do you find at the end of
life?

513
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,200
Nothing but the same and same and same going
on.

514
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:39,210
But the principle of religion is to give you
a balance and that doesn’t happen unless

515
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,550
and until this religion is awakened within
you.

516
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:47,590
Once it is awakened, I don’t have to tell
you that: “You give up your drugs”.

517
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,310
You just give up.

518
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,140
I don’t have to tell you: “Take your alcoholism
out.

519
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,140
” You just do it.

520
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,230
I just don’t tell you.

521
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:57,360
I don’t say that if you have alcoholism
or anything as a disease it just drops up

522
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,360
automatically.

523
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,860
Even if you want you cannot drink.

524
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,520
You won’t enjoy it at all!

525
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:08,150
It’s just as a by-product as you get rid
of your troubles.

526
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:13,590
In the same way, these habits also drop out.

527
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:20,010
You become independent you become free not
slave of anything because you are the Spirit

528
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,300
which is the freedom within you.

529
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,030
Complete supreme freedom is your Spirit.

530
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:36,160
Last of all, I will tell you about a horrible
disease, which is the modern disease nowadays,

531
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:42,090
is the disease of cancer, which is a horrible
thing as people say.

532
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:49,740
Cancer is caused mostly, which I have seen,
in the people who are left-sided.

533
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:53,760
Not so much in the right-sided people, those
who are aggressive.

534
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,880
But those who are emotionally ones disturbed
get this trouble.

535
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:04,650
So far, I have not seen one patient of cancer
who has not been emotionally very much inclined.

536
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:12,730
It might look, appear that a person is very
aggressive, but if you really go into the

537
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:19,120
history of a person you will find that he
had a problem, that his mother died, or his

538
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:24,710
father died early, or some sort of an emotional
problem he developed later on, or a shock

539
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:29,610
from his wife or a fiancée, from his children
or something like that.

540
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:35,210
It’s more a case of emotional disturbance.

541
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:43,360
Now when you find, that a person has a cancer,
on the hands you’ll find that all these

542
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,080
fingers are burning [Shri Mataji shows all
the fingers of Her left hand], sometimes even

543
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,930
these fingers start burning [Shri Mataji shows
fingers of Her right hand].

544
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:54,190
When it is on a galloping state you put your
hands towards a person who is suffering from

545
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:59,020
cancer- even doctors might not diagnose it,
they might find it later on – all your fingers

546
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,140
start burning.

547
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:05,320
You start burning here and here [Shri Mataji
points on the top of the palm near the fingers].

548
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,650
Also, you may start feeling a throbbing here
[Shri Mataji points to the solar plexus].

549
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:14,340
Of course, throbbing doesn’t mean that a
person has a cancer, but is one of the symptoms.

550
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,330
Now how cancer is caused?

551
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:17,330
It’s very simple.

552
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:22,710
And to understand it- it’s better that if
you understand- you will not those things

553
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,740
which are not to be done.

554
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:30,730
Anything we do into extremes, I mean any emergency
is taking over by this two sides, because

555
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:33,720
they manifest the sympathetic nervous system.

556
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,370
They act for our sympathetic nervous system
whenever there is an emergency.

557
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:43,170
For example, a person has a habit, a simple
habit, of say, rubbing his ears, very simple

558
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:44,170
habit.

559
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:45,530
He may develop a cancer there.

560
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:47,310
Because he has overdone it.

561
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,480
An extreme thing he has done is rubbing, rubbing,
rubbing.

562
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:57,080
So, what happens is that the cells which are
supported by a centre here, for example, it’s

563
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,970
coming from left and right [Shri Mataji forms
a triangle to mime the spinal cord] – and

564
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,080
that’s how a centre is formed.

565
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,820
If you can see all of you.

566
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:06,520
This is the one through which the medulla
oblongata passes, the spinal cord, this is

567
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,780
the spinal cord.

568
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:13,630
Now, when there is a pull on right-side or
left-side too much, on the sympathetic nervous

569
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:17,760
system, then this connection breaks out like
that [Shri Mataji splits the hands].

570
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,900
When it breaks out the connection of the centre
with the whole, because this centre [right

571
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,100
thumb] is supplying the energy, is broken.

572
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:31,530
When the connection with the whole is broken,
there is no coordination left, there is no

573
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:32,530
control left.

574
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:37,170
So, the cells become on their own what we
call malignant.

575
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:38,440
They start growing on their own.

576
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,230
For example, if their nose develops the cancer,
than nose becomes big.

577
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:49,340
The rest of the- is smaller and the cells
of the nose start pressing all other organs

578
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,620
in here [on the throat].

579
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:54,680
And sometimes they may pass into blood and
go to other areas also.

580
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:59,920
So, these are aggressive cells, malignant
cells are on their own, you cannot control

581
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,920
them.

582
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:07,420
By some chance, if you could bring them back
in connection with the whole, if you can do

583
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,100
that, cancer can be cured.

584
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,780
It’s as simple as that.

585
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:15,130
When the Kundalini rises, what she does is,
she awakens the centre.

586
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:20,670
And when the centre is awakened, it just comes
back to normal and a person becomes normal.

587
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:22,650
That’s how cancer can be cured.

588
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:25,110
It is very simple, it’s not so difficult.

589
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:29,710
Human life we have made it so difficult, actually
it’s not so difficult.

590
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:37,181
It’s a very simple thing if you understand
the laws of nature and laws of God’s divine

591
00:46:37,181 --> 00:46:38,181
Power.

592
00:46:38,181 --> 00:46:45,910
You can overcome most of your maladies, most
of your problems and you’ll reside in the

593
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:47,440
kingdom of God.

594
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:54,000
Now, there are so many other diseases which
I don’t want to refer now because I have

595
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,680
tell to you the physical side.

596
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,870
And the mental side is the left side as I
told you.

597
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:04,420
Also, on the left side is another disease,
is multiple sclerosis.

598
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,810
I saw a very good television show the other
day.

599
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:10,770
It was put up by some doctors.

600
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:18,760
And they said that in ourselves there is an
area which is built in from our creation,

601
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,330
means the collective subconscious.

602
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:24,540
That’s what we call it.

603
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:30,220
And there are proteins which they call protein
58, protein 52 or something like that.

604
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:35,040
They enter into our being and trigger the
cancer.

605
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,460
So that shows what we have said, that there
are dead within us.

606
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:46,800
On the left-hand side is the subconscious
and then the collective subconscious.

607
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,420
And when you enter into the collective subconscious,
anyone of this spirits can catch hold of you.

608
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:57,410
Once they catch hold of you, you are liable
to any of these diseases.

609
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:02,930
Specially I have seen if there is a possessed
person – of course they become mad, they

610
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:05,470
get epilepsy, all this are possessed people.

611
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:10,130
Epilepsy can be cured; we have someone here
who had epilepsy of the worse type.

612
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:13,320
She is cured completely.

613
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:17,110
And all such mental troubles, depression,
can be cured.

614
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:19,010
Not difficult at all.

615
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:23,650
But one must know, that if you are possessed
you must really work it out and see to it,

616
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,730
that it goes away from you and you become
yourself.

617
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:29,270
Because when you are the other, you don’t
know what’s happening to you.

618
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:35,710
Now this affliction when it comes to you,
there is another horrible disease called multiple

619
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:38,060
sclerosis which comes up.

620
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:43,950
I have seen so far there three cases in England
of multiple sclerosis which have been cured

621
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:45,290
by Sahaja Yoga.

622
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:48,950
All of them had either the wife or the husband
possessed.

623
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:51,160
Can you imagine?

624
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,360
It’s something surprising.

625
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,130
We do not know these things are so important.

626
00:48:56,130 --> 00:49:02,050
These are very important things and that’s
why all these people come on this earth said,

627
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:04,820
that you lead a clean life.

628
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,840
And a sensible married life.’

629
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:14,900
It is not permitted to have an adulteress
life in any religion whatsoever, because adulteress

630
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:20,950
life brings forth all kinds of problems of
the sex spoiling the last chakra.

631
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:27,730
People can become impotent or overexcited,
could become suffering from all the troubles

632
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:32,760
of this centre, which you know are diseases
which are kept as secrets.

633
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:40,400
So, one has to lead a very clean wonderful
married life, because marriage is supported

634
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,630
and sanctioned by the collective.

635
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:46,030
It is sanctioned by God almighty.

636
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:50,280
So, that kind of a life, that kind of a sexual
life, is a sensible one.

637
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,270
One should not get a shock out of it.

638
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:55,310
When I say this in the west, people really
don’t like it.

639
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:56,630
But I’m your mother.

640
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:59,050
I have to tell you the truth.

641
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:01,660
Even whatever you have done is done – finished,
doesn’t matter.

642
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,430
But now come to your sanity.

643
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:10,970
Because there are all these horrible satanic
diseases waiting just to gulp you down.

644
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:14,450
Apart from diseases such a person creates
a problem for children.

645
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,141
He creates a problem for the whole society.

646
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:17,400
The whole society topples down.

647
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:24,070
If they do not respect the marriage, if the
woman becomes aggressive and try to sort of

648
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:27,770
replace men – they cannot do it, they are
woman.

649
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,180
Men are man, woman are woman.

650
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,990
But that doesn’t mean that somebody is going
to suppress.

651
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:34,310
They are equal, no doubt, but not similar.

652
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:37,450
This is a simple point we don’t understand.

653
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:41,369
They woman is to be respected, but she has
to be respectable.

654
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:47,310
And she has to be respected, because she is
one who is the power behind the man.

655
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:51,120
If we understand all these simple things of
life, the life becomes very beautiful.

656
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,610
How we have to respect our elders.

657
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:55,080
How we have to respect everyone.

658
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,100
The respect itself is gone from the modern
times.

659
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:02,119
People have accepted themselves as something
you see ‘what’s wrong’ business.

660
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:04,150
There is no respect for anything whatsoever.

661
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:08,320
I mean the way they bark at each other; one
doesn’t understand how human beings have

662
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:13,680
become now dogs or what have they become the
way they start barking at each other.

663
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:20,000
The whole system goes out of gear when we
become too much materialistic also, because

664
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,510
the matter makes us absolutely a dead matter
also.

665
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:31,460
But I’m not saying that you have to give
up anything.

666
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:32,480
What do you give up?

667
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:38,070
You don’t give up anything because if you
have not taken anything into you, if you do

668
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:41,670
not cling anything to anything, what do you
give up?

669
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:47,070
Like this people Hare Rama came to Me and
they saw Me in My house and of course I mean,

670
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,280
we live very well.

671
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:53,250
Perhaps they thought it was too much for a
saint like Me to life in all these luxuries.

672
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:57,670
And they started saying: ‘Mother, You are
living in this fashion and how people call

673
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:58,840
You a saint.

674
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,400
I said: All right.

675
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,000
Now, you talk of Lord Krishna, isn’t it?

676
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,410
Now in this house or one My body anywhere
you find anything equal to the dust of the

677
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:11,820
feed of Lord Krishna, you take it away.

678
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,530
Anything, but must equal!

679
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:14,820
‘ That’s one thing.

680
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,761
They looked around and they could find anything.

681
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:19,770
I said: ‘What have you given up?

682
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:20,780
Stones?

683
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:21,780
Ashes?

684
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,200
What is there to give up?‘

685
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:29,510
When you just see the whole thing as a drama,
when you are not clinging on anything, what

686
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:30,510
is there to give up?

687
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:32,650
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t believe in false
asceticism at all.

688
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:37,010
Be believe in the real asceticism which comes
from within.

689
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:38,760
Where a person gives.

690
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,390
Where a person enjoys matter in giving others.

691
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:48,110
We don’t believe in this kind of a falsehood
that you wear a certain type of cloth or you

692
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:53,390
have a nunnery or this judo-sannyasis going
around.

693
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:54,390
None of these things.

694
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:57,880
You have to lead a very normal life in the
centre.

695
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:01,060
All the great saints of India were married
and had children.

696
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:03,890
Except for some people like Buddha who died
very early.

697
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:07,080
He had to take a sannyasa because of His work.

698
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:14,250
Then we had people like also we can say Kabira,
Nanaka – all of them were married people.

699
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:18,490
And nobody talked of this extreme nature that
you have to give up everyone.

700
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:19,791
Such people can be very, very dangerous.

701
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:23,340
They can be very hot tempered.

702
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:27,040
They can be so hot tempered that you cannot
just face them.

703
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:32,100
Because marriage makes you very normal to
come in the centre.

704
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:36,860
In this life, in this married life you are
going to receive the blessings of God.

705
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:38,760
There is no abnormity needed.

706
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:44,470
Actually, we become extremely normal when
you get your realization.

707
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:47,970
Of course, some of these ideas may not appeal
to you.

708
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:52,690
But you can see for yourself, whatever I say
is true or not?

709
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:55,110
After Realization, you become a different
person.

710
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:59,460
Your priorities change, you become such a
beautiful person because you start giving.

711
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,290
The whole thing starts flowing from you.

712
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:05,940
Because you become the light and the light
starts flowing from you.

713
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:15,890
And then you understand and assume your powers,
powers of your Spirit and you enjoy this compassionate

714
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:16,890
flow.

715
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:21,560
And all the things look very different, the
whole life changes.

716
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:27,790
This has to happen to the whole world if you
bring peace and sanity, if you have to save

717
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:30,030
this creation, we have to do this.

718
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:34,330
Actually, the divine is more anxious than
anybody else to do it because the creation

719
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:37,040
will be lost if human beings are lost.

720
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:43,410
So, those who are people who are seeking should
understand their responsibility that they

721
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:45,810
have to become the spirit.

722
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:50,700
And after becoming the spirit they have to
manifest the powers of their spirit.

723
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,960
These are their own powers which they manifest.

724
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,690
Only they have to know how to work it out.

725
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:59,940
It’s very simple as I said.

726
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:06,080
And to have it is the best way to understand
it.

727
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,790
May God bless you all.

728
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:14,650
I would like to have some questions from new
people because today is the first lecture

729
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:15,740
here, but for a short time.

730
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,220
Please ask constructive questions.

731
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,980
Don’t ask offensive questions unnecessarily.

732
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:25,900
I’m here to do good to you, not to do any
harm to you whatsoever, take it from Me.

733
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:31,700
So, be kind to Me and ask Me questions which
are good for you and for everybody else, because

734
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:37,000
they are all just waiting for their Realization
which should not also spoil their chances

735
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,030
and delay the matter.

736
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:42,910
So, I would request you to ask Me questions
which are sensible related to the subject

737
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:46,970
and I’ll be very happy to answer them because
certainly when you get your Realization you

738
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:51,060
will find your mind will peep out: ‘Oh,
you didn’t ask this question to mother.’

739
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:58,530
I’m sorry I have been speaking now every
day and last month I was too [?].

740
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:05,520
Everyday there was a speech on, so little
bit there is a strain on My throat, doesn’t

741
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,520
matter.

742
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:10,110
Can I request you to ask Me questions please?

743
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:14,340
Thank you.

744
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:22,800
Shri Mataji: Yes, please?

745
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:30,690
Woman: Can you get rid of epilepsy?

746
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:33,280
Shri Mataji: What is it?

747
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,410
Sahaja Yogi: Can you get rid of epilepsy?

748
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:42,630
Shri Mataji: You just come here to tell Me.

749
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:50,910
Sahaja Yogi: The lady is asking can you get
rid of epilepsy?

750
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:52,010
Shri Mataji: Yes.

751
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,010
All right.

752
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,010
Yes.

753
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,640
Woman: [Inaudible]
Sahaja Yogi: What is it?

754
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,720
I didn’t follow, can you raise your hand,
please, where are you?

755
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:03,960
Sahaja Yogi: The lady’s question was whether
one can you get rid of epilepsy.

756
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,530
Shri Mataji: Yes, we do, we can.

757
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:15,070
If you really cooperate with us it will work
out.

758
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:17,530
It will work out definitely.

759
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:18,530
But you have to cooperate.

760
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:24,450
You see, I’m not a doctor which is one who
takes money from you, so you are not bound

761
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:25,450
to Me.

762
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:26,450
It’s your freedom.

763
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:27,540
It’s your freedom!

764
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:31,920
Whether you want to cooperate or not, but
sometimes people don’t cooperate, then I

765
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,970
can’t help it.

766
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:38,770
It’s noting great is to be done but few
things that have to be followed if you cooperate

767
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:44,880
with Me, of course it can be done without
of course any charges, anything, it just works

768
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,880
out.

769
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:46,880
Yes.

770
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:53,810
Woman: [wording incomprehensible]
Shri Mataji: What’s she saying?

771
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:57,520
Woman: Will You help me please?

772
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,380
Shri Mataji: Definitely, why not?

773
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:03,810
I’m here for that, all right.

774
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:06,090
Make yourself comfortable, yes.

775
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:10,670
Actually, I’m not helping anyone, I’m
helping myself.

776
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:17,180
Supposing this finger is paining and if I
rub it, do I help anyone?

777
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,369
Because you are within Me.

778
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:26,280
When you start everyone – you’re feeling
another person within yourself we really don’t

779
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,280
help anyone.

780
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,200
There is no question of charity.

781
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,390
It’s question of my saving myself.

782
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:33,060
All right?

783
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:38,910
Woman: I’d like your help too, please.

784
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:42,810
Shri Mataji: What is it?

785
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:46,180
Woman: I’d like your help too.

786
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:47,460
Shri Mataji: What did she say, Gavin?

787
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:51,870
Gavin: She say’s also that she would like
to have your help.

788
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:54,840
Shri Mataji: All of you.

789
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:59,840
All of you are going to be helped in a way
if you say call it ‘help’, but I don’t

790
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,470
like the word ‘help’ much.

791
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:02,890
It’s your own.

792
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:04,310
It’s your own.

793
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:08,840
Just like if you go to a banker for example.

794
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,770
Then you say: ‘Can I have my check cashed?’

795
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:13,770
All right?

796
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:16,550
At the most you’ll say ‘can you help me?’,
because you are very generous, I should say

797
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:18,390
and sophisticated.

798
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:20,580
But actually, it’s your bank there and it’s
your money.

799
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:22,620
You better have it.

800
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:35,220
Woman: Mother, can you [inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Can you raise your hand I can’t

801
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:36,550
see which one is speaking?

802
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:37,650
Yes, my child.

803
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:40,963
Woman: Mother, … [wording incomprehensible]
Shri Mataji: What she is saying?

804
00:59:40,963 --> 00:59:44,090
Sahaja Yogi: What do You hope to achieve through
Your lectures?

805
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:47,530
Shri Mataji: What do you do Myself?

806
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:49,494
Sahaja Yogi: What do You hope to achieve?

807
00:59:49,494 --> 00:59:50,494
Shri Mataji: Achieve?

808
00:59:50,494 --> 00:59:51,494
I mean, don’t you understand.

809
00:59:51,494 --> 00:59:52,494
[laughing] What am I achieving is that you
all have to become collectively conscious.

810
00:59:52,494 --> 00:59:54,640
That’s what I’m achieving, nothing else.

811
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,640
As I am.

812
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:59,260
I will tell you in political terminology,
all right?

813
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:02,350
I have all the powers within Myself, so I’m
a capitalist.

814
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:07,790
But I can’t enjoy it because I have to give
you, so I’m a communist.

815
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:10,369
And I want you to enjoy your own powers, that’s
all.

816
01:00:10,369 --> 01:00:12,070
Nothing more than that.

817
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:13,760
Shri Mataji: Yes please?

818
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,850
Man: Is it possible to receive help after
a surgery or before.

819
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:20,130
Shri Mataji: After?

820
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:21,820
Sahaja Yogi: After surgery.

821
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:25,730
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, of course, of course.

822
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:27,690
There is no problem even after surgery.

823
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:35,450
But if you put something artificial there
– sort of a – say a rod or say, steel

824
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:37,480
or something, then we can’t move it.

825
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,000
It has to be something living.

826
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,980
We can repair it, regenerate it and we can
give vitality, but to the rod, say, it’s

827
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:47,520
of steel, then what can we do?

828
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,880
But other surgeries we can work out.

829
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,540
Shri Mataji: Yes, please?

830
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,710
Yes?

831
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:57,710
Please ask the question?

832
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,290
Man: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: What?

833
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:02,250
Sahaja Yogi: He also wants the help of Mother.

834
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:05,540
Shri Mataji: All right, for all of you, I’m
there.

835
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,190
You don’t worry, you all are there.

836
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:13,532
I’m going to come down and see all of you,
all right?

837
01:01:13,532 --> 01:01:17,580
All of you I’m going to see like yesterday,
as we did.

838
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,580
Man: Mother.

839
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,530
When You were speaking about Holy Ghost

840
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:21,530
Shri Mataji: Yes.

841
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:24,780
Man: You use the word ‘She’ which regard
to that.

842
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:25,780
Shri Mataji: Shri?

843
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:30,540
Man: She
Shri Mataji: Yes

844
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:32,560
Man: You said She.

845
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,560
Shri Mataji: ‘She’, yes.

846
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:37,359
‘She’ is the power and She is called as
Shakti.

847
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:39,200
‘Shakti’ – She is the power.

848
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:45,650
So ‘He’ is the God Almighty and His power
is the ‘She’ – the Holy Ghost.

849
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:47,180
Man: The creator’s power?

850
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:52,010
Shri Mataji: That’s the power of the divine
power of God, His love.

851
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:55,040
Which has got one: is a creative power.

852
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,750
Another is the power of His desire.

853
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:57,750
First you must have desire.

854
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:05,710
Then he creates, so He has a power of desire
and He has a power of creativity and also,

855
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:10,250
He has a third power, which is the power which
gives us sustenance.

856
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:17,250
We become say – we have our qualities, like
carbon has four valences and all that.

857
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:19,640
And then it also gives us evolution.

858
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:25,640
So, this third power is more important, because
that gives us this ascent also.

859
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:32,730
This is the manifestation of the Holy Ghost
which is the power of God Almighty, which

860
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:34,930
is the power of His divine love.

861
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:43,119
Woman: Mother, if some diseases are caused
by our parents, why innocent children get

862
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:44,430
leukaemia for example?

863
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:49,440
Shri Mataji: Oh, they get it because the mother
is like that.

864
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,180
Mother must be a speedy lady.

865
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:55,030
You see, if the mother – today only I had
a lady, I must tell you: I saw a lady, she’s

866
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:59,570
told Me that: ” My child is overactive,
she is so active that I don’t know how to

867
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:00,570
control.

868
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:03,920
It’s not a mental case, but it is a funny
situation, that she is overactive “.

869
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,640
So, I said: “What were you doing?

870
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,640
” when she was pregnant.

871
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,680
She was such, she told Me, in the night she
used to work in the factory, the whole day

872
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,771
she used to work in the house.

873
01:03:12,771 --> 01:03:13,771
Imagine?

874
01:03:13,771 --> 01:03:14,771
I mean, you pay no respect to your pregnancy.

875
01:03:14,771 --> 01:03:15,771
So, what will happen?

876
01:03:15,771 --> 01:03:20,790
If the mother is so, sort of a speedy person,
the child gets it.

877
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:23,070
You see, mother has such an influence on the
child, isn’t it?

878
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:27,090
The blood of the mother goes into the child.

879
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:28,950
And that blood carries the message.

880
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:31,369
That’s how the children get it.

881
01:03:31,369 --> 01:03:33,790
And that’s very difficult to cure also.

882
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:38,430
One has to know also, when you are pregnant,
how to treat your children, how to be looking

883
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:39,470
after your foetus.

884
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:40,570
That’s one has to know all these things.

885
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:41,570
These are very important basic things which
we do not know.

886
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:42,570
Shri Mataji: Yes?

887
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:43,570
Man: Your power of healing, is it something
that you sought yourself or were you born

888
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:44,570
with it?

889
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:45,570
Shri Mataji: What is it?

890
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:49,340
Come and tell Me as I just can’t hear.

891
01:03:49,340 --> 01:04:01,770
Sahaja Yogi: He is asking, is your power of
healing something You sought yourself or which

892
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:04,820
was born with You?

893
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:11,700
Shri Mataji [smiling]: It’s all with Me,
all right?

894
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,810
As you know you are a human being, I knew,
I was this.

895
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:17,020
But about Me I’d better not tell.

896
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,900
It’s better you discover it.

897
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,830
It’s better not to tell about oneself.

898
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:24,070
You better discover it.

899
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:27,630
Gradually, you will discover about Me.

900
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:34,450
Shri Mataji: Yes?

901
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:37,240
Now, say loudly.

902
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:41,770
Woman: Is it possible to go to classes in
Northampton and ….

903
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:43,420
how much is it?

904
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:47,550
[Unsure]
Sahaja Yogi: She wants to know if there are

905
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,020
classes in Sahaja Yoga in Northampton.

906
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:53,910
Shri Mataji: You cannot have a course in it,
you see.

907
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:58,660
It is not courses, but we have centres.

908
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:01,050
You have to just go and know about it.

909
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:06,430
There is no classes, nothing like that, but
you can come to the centre, where they will

910
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:11,910
tell you how to use this power, what does
this mean, all the decoding of it, how to

911
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:13,590
establish your Realization.

912
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:19,360
We have a centre here in Northampton and I
don’t know when you have it.

913
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,780
I’ll tell- I don’t know.

914
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:23,690
But we have a centre here, just right here.

915
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:30,410
Can somebody tell when is the program, at
what time?

916
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:53,460
Sahaja Yogi: The program in Northampton [Inaudible
conversation]

917
01:05:53,460 --> 01:06:01,950
Shri Mataji: You can become masters, real
gurus.

918
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:04,020
Yes, you can.

919
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:09,810
But I think people must take it more seriously
about the whole thing and should understand

920
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:13,900
it and learn it, because the main thing is
we do not take any money, you see.

921
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:17,260
So, people think, that you see, you are not
bound.

922
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:19,350
You are absolutely free to come and to go.

923
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:25,130
But this freedom sometimes makes a person
a little superficial or sometimes a little

924
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:26,470
frivolous about it.

925
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:34,970
But this is so precious, so invaluable, that
you cannot charge any money for this knowledge.

926
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:36,390
All right?

927
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:39,369
Now, should we have it?

928
01:06:39,369 --> 01:06:41,720
No questions?

929
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:44,070
Man: [Inaudible]

930
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:55,830
Shri Mataji: Gavin, what did he say, I just
can’t?

931
01:06:55,830 --> 01:06:57,900
Did you hear?

932
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,290
Gavin: No…

933
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:05,370
Shri Mataji: You didn’t hear him: Just stand
up, I think.

934
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:06,820
You better stand up here.

935
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:08,150
Gavin, you just stand up.

936
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:09,150
Just say it loudly, please, if you don’t
mind.

937
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,150
Yes!

938
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:11,150
Man: [Inaudible]

939
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:14,140
Gavin: When you have a pain within yourself
[…] through the mother earth?

940
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:22,030
[some words incomprehensible].

941
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:33,630
Shri Mataji: Yes, some things are sucked by
mother earth, as I told you – some.

942
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:39,160
Some are sucked by the flame of the… – can
be the flame, can be the fire.

943
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,640
The sun also sucks in.

944
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,070
Then the sky also sucks in, anything can.

945
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:46,550
It depends on, on what centre you have a problem.

946
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:49,910
All these centres are separately made by different
elements.

947
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:53,060
It depends on, what problem you have.

948
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:54,140
All right?

949
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:59,670
But on the whole mother earth is the most
precious thing.

950
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:02,040
She helps the maximum on thing.

951
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:06,530
Man: You spoke about living energies and vibrations
and the scientist with us […] not the scientist

952
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:20,620
he enjoys trying to get the rays within, he
mentions the gravity […].

953
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:37,469
Because there were people who thoroughly enjoy
… into the rays of gravity.

954
01:08:37,469 --> 01:08:39,219
I’ve been very … in things like dowsing.

955
01:08:39,219 --> 01:08:40,219
[some words incomprehensible].

956
01:08:40,219 --> 01:08:41,219
Shri Mataji: Ah, dowsing.

957
01:08:41,219 --> 01:08:42,219
Dowsing is…

958
01:08:42,219 --> 01:08:43,219
Man: A force now … bring … together [unclear]

959
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:44,219
Shri Mataji: I talked about this yesterday.

960
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:47,220
Yesterday I talked, but again if you want,
I’ll tell you in short.

961
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:51,150
You see, we have some other dimension which
we are not know, they are unknown to us.

962
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:56,040
But they are not divine, like we have the
left side dimensions as I told you, you go

963
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,580
into the collective subconscious.

964
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:02,460
Now if you go into collective subconscious
some of this busy bodies can enter into your

965
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:03,460
being.

966
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:06,339
And they are the once who give you this power
of dowsing.

967
01:09:06,339 --> 01:09:11,569
You see, that’s how you start knowing there
is water, because there are some spirits in

968
01:09:11,569 --> 01:09:12,569
you which can [?

969
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:13,569
] to it.

970
01:09:13,569 --> 01:09:17,089
You see, there are ESP’s and all this thing
come from the same sources.

971
01:09:17,089 --> 01:09:22,270
There could be some on the right-hand side,
supra-conscious once, which are very aggressive.

972
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:23,270
Hitler used them.

973
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:31,500
He is the one who used this supra-conscious
people, very aggressive people and enticed

974
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:35,049
all German people and made them so aggressive.

975
01:09:35,049 --> 01:09:37,569
So, these two areas are within us.

976
01:09:37,569 --> 01:09:41,920
In Sanskrit the one on the left is called
‘adi bhautic’ and the right as ‘adi

977
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:42,920
daivic’ [?].

978
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,359
Both of these are to be avoided.

979
01:09:44,359 --> 01:09:47,710
For example, somebody sees auras around Me,
for example now.

980
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:49,230
I would say he should not.

981
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:50,250
It’s not proper.

982
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:52,830
Because then you are on the right side.

983
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:57,570
But if you see some gods and goddesses around
Me, that also is not good, because you’re

984
01:09:57,570 --> 01:10:00,219
seeing the left side – the past, and the
future.

985
01:10:00,219 --> 01:10:03,670
What you have to be is in the centre, in the
present.

986
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:08,710
So, all these things come to you from some
busy bodies as I said, that they enter into

987
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:09,710
your being.

988
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:15,360
I have seen another television show where
they showed Gogin entering into somebody.

989
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,900
And he was painting just like him.

990
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:22,170
The lines were just like him, bold the same
wave very different styles that he has.

991
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:24,610
And he was doing it and he said: ‘I’m
Gogin.’

992
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:27,110
And this is very common even with curatives.

993
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:30,600
When people cured, they use spiritualists.

994
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,350
That’s very dangerous.

995
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:37,160
All these are taking you to the realm, which
is not your own.

996
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,190
It is somebody else who acts in you.

997
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:44,560
Even a thing like, say acupuncture can be
very dangerous, because acupuncture uses the

998
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,440
whatever energy in you of the sympathetic.

999
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:51,050
This is energy I’m talking which is all
the time flowing.

1000
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:53,960
When you get connected with the mains all
the time it is flowing within you.

1001
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:57,450
That’s the energy we should have.

1002
01:10:57,450 --> 01:11:00,090
And the scientists are correct when they say
vibrations.

1003
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:01,360
But they can’t say, why there are vibrations.

1004
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,210
This is the point.

1005
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:10,730
Not that I’m against science because today
the science is helping us so much.

1006
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:25,460
Man ask about his son, which have skin problems.

1007
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:27,100
[analogous]

1008
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:42,900
Shri Mataji: Ah, skin problem.

1009
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:51,230
All right, there’s nothing, that’s liver.

1010
01:11:51,230 --> 01:12:01,239
Woman: How can I help myself…

1011
01:12:01,239 --> 01:12:16,250
Sahaja Yogi: How can she learn to cure herself.

1012
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:28,580
Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s what I’m saying
that today if you get Realization well and

1013
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:29,580
good.

1014
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,469
Otherwise there is a centre, you can come,
by which whatever you have cured yourself,

1015
01:12:31,469 --> 01:12:32,469
but you can cure others also.

1016
01:12:32,469 --> 01:12:33,469
[1:06:59]

1017
01:12:33,469 --> 01:12:34,469
Man: The Self-realization, Sahaja Yoga.

1018
01:12:34,469 --> 01:12:43,880
Is that the answer about our problems?

1019
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,520
[… some words unclear]

1020
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:51,230
Shri Mataji: Hundred percent, to all problems.

1021
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:53,630
You see, because we live in a relative world.

1022
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:57,650
We are living relatively and we are confused,
isn’t it?

1023
01:12:57,650 --> 01:13:00,330
But when you find the absolute, all the questions
are solved.

1024
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:05,530
That’s true, because spirit is to be awakened,
that’s the main thing.

1025
01:13:05,530 --> 01:13:06,790
Spirit is the solution.

1026
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:09,750
Firstly, it is the collective being.

1027
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:13,840
Again, it is the source of all vitality.

1028
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,440
It is the source of all the creativity.

1029
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:21,510
It is the source of all the joy and bliss.

1030
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:26,661
Once you achieve that being within you, when
that being shines in your attention, you become

1031
01:13:26,661 --> 01:13:31,550
the master of that.

1032
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:37,840
[1:08:03] Woman: Question incomprehensible.

1033
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:48,850
Shri Mataji: Can you say it loudly?

1034
01:13:48,850 --> 01:14:03,900
Man: She says Mother, has the mother nature
provided the answer in terms of herbs to cure

1035
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:04,900
people?

1036
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:10,760
Shri Mataji: We don’t use any herbs or anything.

1037
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:16,650
We at the most can sanctify some water or
salt or sugar, these basic things, that’s

1038
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:17,650
all.

1039
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:21,020
We don’t use any herbs or anything, that’s
not needed now anymore.

1040
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:29,330
Woman: Excuse me, do we have to be religious
to… [some words incomprehensible]

1041
01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:33,070
Shri Mataji: You don’t have to be religious
at all.

1042
01:14:33,070 --> 01:14:35,310
But religious is different from religion!

1043
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:38,820
Religion is within you, you can’t get rid
of it.

1044
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:42,440
You see, religion is your quality as a human
being.

1045
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:45,239
That’s within you, you can’t get rid of
it.

1046
01:14:45,239 --> 01:14:51,170
If you go against it, whatever is within you,
then there is a problem.

1047
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:52,170
Yes, everyone has that, everyone has that!

1048
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:54,360
That’s true and that’s why you get problems.

1049
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,870
But religious is a very absurd thing.

1050
01:14:56,870 --> 01:15:02,100
Sometimes religious so called people can be
horridly hot tempered, you know.

1051
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:07,310
Could be very bad and could be – I mean,
it has no relationship whit reality sometimes.

1052
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:14,230
So religious is a different thing, but religion
is important.

1053
01:15:14,230 --> 01:15:22,530
Religion is universal, which is within you.

1054
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:27,280
Now, let’s start now.

1055
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:32,030
Woman: Question about diet.

1056
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:35,590
[exact wording unclear]

1057
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:49,820
Man: She says Mother, does the diet which
we … solve her problems?

1058
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:56,870
Shri Mataji: Yes, not the diet want solve
it completely, but when you take to Sahaja

1059
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:58,860
Yoga, supposing you are a liver-patient, all
right.

1060
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:04,900
So, we give you some sanctified or vibrated
sugar to eat, white sugar.

1061
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:08,900
Now doctors will say: “Don’t eat white
sugar”, but we have cured so many of liver

1062
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:09,900
troubles.

1063
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:14,730
All have migraines and this and that and so
many troubles of the allergies are to be cured.

1064
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:18,330
Now for that of course we say, for about a
month, you just don’t eat some fats.

1065
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:19,350
You see, that’s all right.

1066
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:24,340
But that by eating, you see, you paying so
much attention ‘eat this, eat that!

1067
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:26,020
That food, that food!’

1068
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:27,020
That’s not needed.

1069
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:29,570
It’s too much attention diverted to food.

1070
01:16:29,570 --> 01:16:30,730
But you should know basics.

1071
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:33,420
But if this is the problem with you then what
you should eat.

1072
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:39,130
That’s all, it’s not such a emphasis on
diet that you eat this.

1073
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:43,020
Only by dieting you maybe, all right, at the
most physically, but you are not only a physical

1074
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:44,050
being.

1075
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:46,150
You are also an emotional being.

1076
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:49,380
If you pay too much attention to your physical
side, you can become a dry personality.

1077
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:50,380
Absolutely.

1078
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:56,300
There could be divorces in the families and
such a person who just is nothing but a physical,

1079
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:57,300
imagine.

1080
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:04,300
It can be very dangerous and can be a very,
very angry person who has just physical thing.

1081
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:10,520
And such a person gets heart – heart trouble,
because the spirit resides in your heart and

1082
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:15,230
if you are too much physical, then the heart
goes out, because you must pay attention to

1083
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,230
your spirit.

1084
01:17:16,230 --> 01:18:17,300
So, you are not only a physical being, you
are a mental being, you

1085
01:18:17,300 --> 01:19:44,090
are an emotional being 
and you

1086
01:19:44,090 --> 01:20:03,290
are

1087
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:14,110
a spiritual being.

1088
01:20:14,110 --> 01:22:32,900
All

1089
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:44,590
this

1090
01:22:44,590 --> 01:23:32,100
must

1091
01:23:32,100 --> 01:31:17,860
be integrated and there should be

1092
01:31:17,860 --> 01:37:00,610
a complete balance.
