A Sinless Life 
January 1, 1988 Ganapatipule, India

2
00:00:05,352 --> 00:00:10,252
Happy New Year to you all!

3
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:21,918
May God bless you this year with all His divine powers.

4
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:30,972
May all the choicest flowers of joy

5
00:00:31,178 --> 00:00:35,429
and happiness be showered upon you.

6
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:47,250
May God give you wisdom to become great Sahaja Yogis,

7
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:56,242
so that a new world can be created beautifully out of you.

8
00:00:59,888 --> 00:01:04,955
Very happy to meet you all today here.

9
00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:11,961
First day, I am sure there must have been lots of inconveniences.

10
00:01:12,596 --> 00:01:16,675
 But Sahaja Yogis don’t feel any inconvenience.

11
00:01:30,687 --> 00:01:36,164
It’s important that you all are here,

12
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:40,640
 should meet each other, talk to each other about Sahaja Yoga.

13
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,220
 Try to understand what’s going on in the other parts of the world.

14
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:59,321
 There are certain problems which arise sometimes when you don’t listen to Me.

15
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:07,250
So whatever I have said about swimming, the timings, please keep to it.

16
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,711
 We have to give up our old conditionings,

17
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:15,893
 I mean, we have to start a new life of understanding and wisdom.

18
00:02:19,126 --> 00:02:22,310
Today is a day when we should decide,

19
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:29,170
take some vows in our hearts, what we want to do for our future,

20
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:34,877
for Sahaja Yoga, for building of our lives.

21
00:02:36,132 --> 00:02:38,643
You know all the programs we have.

22
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:44,826
Tomorrow we’ll be giving you the final list of the people who are getting married.

23
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:53,626
And, also you should meet people whom you are getting married to.

24
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:58,605
 Talk to them and find out about them.

25
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:06,939
Today I don’t want to say much. They say whatever you do on the first,

26
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:10,859
 it happens to you all the year round,

27
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:14,224
and I don’t want to speak like this all the time.

28
00:03:14,548 --> 00:03:17,421
Because I’ve been speaking too much.

29
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,596
So best way to enjoy New Year is to decide

30
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:27,746
as to what we are going to do now, further.

31
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:32,168
What are we going to achieve next year

32
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:37,419
so that we can look back and say that in one year we have done this job.

33
00:03:37,975 --> 00:03:46,076
So forget the past, and think of today

34
00:03:46,471 --> 00:03:49,970
which is an important date, we are here.

35
00:03:51,788 --> 00:03:55,465
That we have to decide about ourselves.

36
00:03:57,464 --> 00:04:01,777
 Let us decide that we’ll have sinless life.

37
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:06,960
We’ll have a sinless life and complete obedience to Sahaja Yoga.

38
00:04:09,638 --> 00:04:14,466
 Forget the past. Past conditionings.
