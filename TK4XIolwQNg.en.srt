1
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:20,860
So 

2
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:23,750
the New Year is coming and CP. It's expected
to be a very dynamic year for Sahaja Yoga

3
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:39,250
and Sahaja yogis. Everything new becomes stale
and never becomes new again. So whatever has

4
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:47,910
gone has gone. Let bygones be bygones. There
have been very sweet memories sometimes, sometimes

5
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:58,510
rather unhappy also, but on the whole we are
growing, realising, coming up. You've done

6
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:10,010
a good job of building up ourselves, into
a new way. New Sahaja yogis have come up now

7
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:21,150
have got rid of their lethargy and their jealousies,
their slyness, their slumber and narrow-mindedness

8
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:37,030
. All these things have to be buried in the
past. They are of no use to us. It's a load

9
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,909
we carry for nothing at all.

10
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:49,460
Today it happens that I read a very nice letter
which was lying with me which I didn't read.

11
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:56,419
It was sent by Gregoire to Warren. It really
touched my heart.

12
00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:03,419
He was concerned about the jealousies that
people suffer and the way he said that, that

13
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:11,970
this jealousy is the most petty stuff, a most
ugly thing, and it comes up as something as

14
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:20,430
a challenge to your love, challenge to your
understanding or something like that, and

15
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,560
then he started explaining it. This explanation
is all rational. In Sahaja Yoga there is nothing

16
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:40,300
like jealousy . It doesn't exist. It doesn't
exist in the Kingdom of God, something called

17
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:47,300
jealousy, because all are part and parcel
of one God. So, one person becomes important,

18
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:53,270
another less important. Is only for the time
being. For example, when you are smelling

19
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,270
a flower, naturally the nose is more active
than the eyes.

20
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:02,800
When you are seeing the flower the eyes are
more active. So, it is not necessary that

21
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,450
at this moment, when somebody is more active,
doesn't mean that he is closer to God and

22
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:14,430
another person who is inactive. Everybody
is, but some people are active at a point,

23
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,469
some people are active at another. Or some
people are closer, some people are taken away

24
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:24,320
but they are all part and parcel. So this
is one of the things one has to understand

25
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,169
that there should be no jealousy. On the contrary,
if you find somebody who is spiritually higher

26
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:36,169
you must try to understand and appreciate,
especially a person who is wiser than somebody

27
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:44,229
who says wise things. If you hear somebody
saying something wise, try to notice, appreciate,

28
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:52,669
enjoy, be nice. Sometimes even the children
say something nice. Young people can say something

29
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:24,849
nice.

30
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:16,560
So the first thing is of jealousy which I
don't understand. Some of you think that I

31
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:24,440
like someone more than the other. To be very
frank I have no idea of liking or disliking.

32
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:30,800
I don't understand. There is no question.
It's a very different mechanism you are dealing

33
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,649
with. That person who doesn't get involved
into any, doesn't get entangled into any.

34
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:42,430
Only thing what I am trying to do is to disentangle
you. If I was an entangling type, how can

35
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:49,430
I disentangle? You see, if I was the person
who has to purify you and if I am the person

36
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:57,339
who cannot purify you, then what's the use
of My being there? So if the person who tries

37
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,930
to purify has to be pure himself. Supposing
there's a soap and the soap is the one that

38
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:11,209
gets dirty. Then what's the use of such a
soap? In the same way I never get entangled

39
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:18,209
with anyone. That's my name, Nirmama. To Me,
Nirmala, nobody is mine. Everybody. So this

40
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:29,330
should get out of your mind as 

41
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:42,220
to Nirmala.

42
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:49,220
All right, so we have to bury this useless
thing called jealousy and it can be very serious.

43
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:13,339
It can happen very serious with people. I
have seen people, they got jealous. Then they've

44
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:20,339
got after another person. Then they've got
after Sahaja Yoga, then after. And this jealousy,

45
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:30,769
one should not allow to crawl in. You see,
some people are more congenial, sometimes

46
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:36,690
are more nearer Sahaja yoga, sometimes. They
are more helpful. Sometimes they are more

47
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:41,379
useful. Sometimes they have to be there. Sometimes
they need Me the most of all. Some of them

48
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:47,019
are lost people. Some of them are really possessed
and badly off. So sometimes that's why I look

49
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:53,420
after them. It's My own whim. I cannot say.
I cannot justify. Maybe that person is very

50
00:10:53,420 --> 00:11:00,420
good. I look after. Maybe that person is very
bad. I look after. So one should never have

51
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:09,029
any jealousy with people. Only you must have
understanding that your Mother has to work

52
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:16,459
for all of you and has to improve you, cure
you, do something about. One thing we have

53
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:24,180
to bury is the jealousy that lives within
us. We bury something and something comes

54
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:31,319
out very bad, and what is that comes out of
this jealousy, is that we have to better ourselves.

55
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:39,949
So the outgoing jealousy should leave within
us. "Oh, am I jealous of a person!" Then what's

56
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,560
good in that person?

57
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:49,560
Now, this is not outward. Sahaja is not outward.
If that person is outwardly like this, outwardly,

58
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:58,509
it goes inward. If I correct somebody, I correct
that person because the vibrations of that

59
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:06,370
person are not all right. You see that person
can be extremely sweet also, a very sweet

60
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:13,300
type, could be anything, could be harsh, could
be anything, but the vibrations of that person

61
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,540
have to be all right. I have to gain nothing
out of you except that your vibrations should

62
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,550
be correct.

63
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:25,870
So, you should not have any misidentification
that some people are very dynamic, so they

64
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:31,790
think they can do what they like. Some people
think they are very sort of deceiving type

65
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:38,790
so they think they can do what they like.
All of this. First of all you should speak

66
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:50,399
collective.

67
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,560
For a mother if some children are left behind,
her heart, all the time she thinks they are

68
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:01,490
left behind. They should. That's the main
thing. This is not for one person. Like just

69
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,839
thinking about your own son or thinking about
your own wife, thinking about your own husband.

70
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:12,839
It's not the point. All of you are dearer
to Me, dearest to Me, but I belong to no one.

71
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:23,019
I'm a hopeless case. Just hear me up. I belong
to no one. No one can possess me. I cannot

72
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:30,329
possess myself. How can you possess? I am
beyond possession. Then if it is so, there

73
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,999
should be no jealousy. There's no question
of jealousy or in any way feeling jealous

74
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:43,999
of each other. Only the beauty of enjoying
others. Somebody has some great points - very

75
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:49,579
good qualities in that person - you'll imbibe
it. In Sahaja Yoga, whatever you enjoy you

76
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:56,579
imbibe. You know that. Whatever you enjoy
you will imbibe, just like that. You should

77
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,569
be able to enjoy.

78
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:05,110
Now supposing you enjoy creating rifts in
people, creating problems with people, you'll

79
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:12,110
have them yourself. Supposing you enjoy saying
harsh things to others, you'll imbibe that

80
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:18,399
in the sense that you will have more of it.
Whatever you want, you will have. Christ has

81
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,100
said if you want gold, you'll have gold. Many
people who came to Sahaja Yoga went away in

82
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,759
the search of money, promotions and they got
it. You'll have gold.

83
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:35,759
But those who are dearer to Me, will have,
will sit with Me on My throne. This is what

84
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:44,100
you should ask for. This is what you ask for.
Not for having more gold, more money, more

85
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:51,399
this, more that, but that you are part and
parcel of his company. Now somehow, I know

86
00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:02,430
everyone of you. Somehow, I don't know how,
I know everyone of you. How far you are with

87
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:12,610
me, I know. There is no need to justify. No
need to say, "This is not so. That is not

88
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:19,610
so". I know everything. I should know. Otherwise,
how would I give you something substantial?

89
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:29,730
I have to give you something very special
and for that I have to know what you need,

90
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:36,949
when I know I love you. Unless until you love
someone, you cannot know so much about the

91
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:45,120
person. I know your beauties. I also know
your ugliness. I know your tenderness. I know

92
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:52,170
your harshness. I know all the things that
you have, that you have been, that you are,

93
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:59,170
and you will be. It is many-dimensional knowledge.

94
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:06,850
Some of you I expect it is too much because
I think you are capable and I know your past.

95
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:13,579
I work very hard on you. You know that and
I'll work and I'll continue to work, every

96
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:20,199
year, but '82 is a very remarkable year, where
you people should now work hard for Sahaja

97
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:24,870
Yoga. I have already given some idea as to
how to work it with Raveen. I have talked

98
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:30,550
to him. Raveen knows how we are going to work
it out in a systematic way, how to attack

99
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:35,910
a particular village, or a particular district,
or wherever you have to go, how to go there,

100
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,850
how to propagate, how to establish.

101
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:44,660
Wherever there is soft ground you should settle
down, not in the hard ground. The hard ground

102
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:51,160
will never yield any produce. So don't go
on working on a hard ground. Put your attention

103
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,240
to these factors. What can I do for Sahaja
Yoga? Take out your attention from yourself.

104
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,769
For example, supposing a person, now there
are presents all being tied up. Supposing

105
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:07,130
a person wanted a particular present, take
it like that. Sahaja Yogis are not that low

106
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,949
type but still, supposing take the lowest
of lowest, behave like children. So, you don't

107
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:14,160
get that particular one.

108
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,640
Now, to do all this with all the work I've
been doing here, select that and to arrange

109
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:27,250
all that, isn't it tremendous? So, whatever
Mother could do in that hurry and scurry,

110
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:32,340
with everybody's name and all that, it is
quite a lot to be done, and if She has done

111
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:38,230
that, one should appreciate the love that
Mother wants to bestow upon you. It is all

112
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:42,670
symbolic. But somebody can sit down and start
saying, "Oh, I should have had this. Why didn't

113
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,070
you give me this? Why didn't you give me that.
I should have."

114
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:50,960
You see, it is not anything that one has made
or anything, just to give somebody something,

115
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,960
in a small way, I am saying, but even in this
small way, you are worried about yourself.

116
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,770
You have to worry about Sahaja Yoga. What's
going to happen to Sahaja Yoga? How is it

117
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,850
going to come up? What have you to work it
out? What do you have to do? How many pujas

118
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,890
do we have to arrange? How do we have to do
anything? Not about yourself. How should I

119
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:19,620
improve myself? That point is also. Forget
it. What are we going to do to propagate Sahaja

120
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:25,570
Yoga, we have to say. Not go to personal life,
my husband and wife quarrelling, with them.

121
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:31,320
I mean, I've had enough of it. I mean, I'm
not here to settle your marriages. All these

122
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,870
nonsensical things, you forget now. Of course,
if you have a good marriage, it helps Sahaja

123
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:42,230
Yoga, no doubt. It helps because you get children.
It helps. If the husband and wife are not

124
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,880
all right, you might get very horrible children
which may be possessed from the very childhood

125
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:52,820
and be very difficult. They will be realised
souls but will be very difficult children.

126
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:59,820
So this is important that we should dedicate
ourselves to Sahaja Yoga today, to bring out

127
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:07,929
the old and bring out the new which is dedicated
to Sahaja Yoga - not to your personal life,

128
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:16,029
not your personal likes and dislikes, what
will happen to Sahaja Yoga - and to be sincere

129
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:22,409
about it. Many people who organise go off
their heads. I've seen it. Somehow, you give

130
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:29,409
them something to organise, they are about
to land up in a lunatic asylum. You give them

131
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:36,860
something to organise, make them the leader,
finished. It happens like that. It goes off

132
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:43,860
their head somehow or other. You see, there
is a crack in the head, and these, so the

133
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,890
cracked head then starts behaving in such
a funny manner, that you can't imagine how

134
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:04,370
far one can go. You have to organise, you
have to become right-sided, you have to work

135
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:09,730
hard, no doubt, but you need not be right-sided.
If you work with right hand you don't become

136
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:16,730
right-sided, do you? You don't double up your
ears, nose or (mantra?). Do we? Or you don't.

137
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:24,880
I mean, really, the nature, it keeps the body
all right, I must say, because there is some

138
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,899
right-handed people should have a right side,
emotions. Or the left hand should have a left-hand

139
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:34,899
development. Should be there, but it is not.
It keeps nature all right. Nature keeps the

140
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:39,510
faith all right, everything all right. It
keeps it.

141
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:46,510
So one has to know that when you are trying
to bring in something new, you must talk of

142
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:57,000
the new. Then whatever is old and outward
should be sent away, should be thrown out.

143
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Otherwise you will never grow. It will shift
from here to here, here to here, the bhoot

144
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,059
particles.

145
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:16,279
So today's message of not feeling guilty and
not thinking of what all old things, old rags

146
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:23,010
you have had on, throw it away, same day.
You see, obstinacy should not be there. People

147
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,630
are very obstinate. They don't want to see.
They don't want to forget. They don't want

148
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:31,919
to forgive. Give up that obstinacy. Obstinacy
is not the nature of your spirit. If you are

149
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,279
the spirit you will never be obstinate. Have
you ever seen Me being obstinate? Ever? You

150
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,130
said, "Mother, sit here." "All right". You
say, "Sit there." "All right". No, not that

151
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:49,130
I am going to sit here alone. Never, never.
You say, "Mother, will you eat this?" "All

152
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:56,529
right," even if I am very, very full myself.
Sometimes I should put down My foot but I

153
00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:03,529
don't. So you should also not be at all obstinate.
There should be not obstinacy. There should

154
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:16,250
be no fanatics. It's all a play going on,
this way, that way, that way. Just enjoy yourself.

155
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,970
So this is one thing, if you are obstinate,
you cannot become a new person. To become

156
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:29,070
a new person you have to give up your obstinacy
completely. Once you give up your obstinacy

157
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:36,070
you will be very happy and peaceful, and you
must come as a new person every minute, every

158
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:48,390
second you are. So I just.

159
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:02,820
Now, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned in
England, I think it has taken a good road.

160
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:15,299
Propagation has to be established. It has
to be publicised. It has to be talked about.

161
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:20,590
People are to be told you have found it. Go
and see people who are seekers. Whatever level

162
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:27,590
you are, supposing you are dealing with a
particular type, of say a lawyer, should meet

163
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:34,559
all the lawyers. If there's a psychologist
is there, should go and see the psychologist.

164
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,409
At your level, whatever level it is, you should
go and talk about it to others that this is

165
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:44,580
what you have found out. Why don't you get
hold of it, and you will all get good quality

166
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:51,580
people who are really seekers? You must talk
now and that is what is. Get out of your shyness.

167
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:58,419
That is very important to get out of your
shyness. Talk to people. But I've seen people

168
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:04,210
when they talk about Sahaja Yoga, instead
of giving a good name to Sahaja Yoga, they

169
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:10,409
bring bad name, because when they talk, they
talk in such a way as if they are being clever.

170
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:16,110
That's not good. We have to say we are just
the same. We are just the old egg and we are

171
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:20,580
just trying to talk because we have found
something, so others are not hurt.

172
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,399
So for that you have to remember the past
that we were like this, and if somebody had

173
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:29,720
talked to us, like this, they would have been
hurt. We have to remember our past, remembering

174
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:36,610
the past, just for your own manoeuvring, that's
all. Not that as a part and parcel but just

175
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:40,760
for your manoeuvring, how to deal with others.
Unless until you remember your past, you will

176
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:47,760
not know how to deal with others and you won't
have compassion. So that is what we have to

177
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,470
see, the importance of the past.

178
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:58,620
The future at this present moment is that
'82 is a great year, that's all, not more

179
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:03,409
than that. You don't have to think about '83
because even if you start doing it in '83,'82

180
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:10,409
will be silent. "You do it in '83, Mother.
What does it mean? I think I believe it would

181
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:19,539
be a better idea to do this in '83. What do
you think, Mother?" Suggestions. I have a

182
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:27,100
suggestion today. Supposing we do it in '83,
why not today? Why not now? Ask the question,

183
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:39,769
"Why not?" When such a thing is done, why
not now? And then whatever you do, you do

184
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,510
it fully, completely to the finishing point.
Like (Pais ?) has been very good with you

185
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:53,320
when we were working in that house. You were
chiselling the house and I was chiselling

186
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:59,120
you. You were building the house and I was
building you. It was very good, interesting,

187
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,929
very nice. Some of you have really gained
a lot, really gained a lot. You have really

188
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:09,929
become very dynamic, very beautiful, very
Sahaja. Quite a lot of you done that. I know

189
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,929
that and it is really very appreciative, work
that you have done. Anybody can see that very

190
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:17,320
clearly.

191
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,580
You are being described by Blake that you
will be the golden builders. Clearly, this

192
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:29,580
is done by the golden bridges, but in that
you have to learn first. Like now they are

193
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:37,639
painting, all right. The painter goes up to
paint. He takes a place to sit down on top.

194
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:44,210
When he comes out everything is there, all
the mismanagement that was done is still there.

195
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:49,179
The painter has finished the painting. Still
the scaffolding is there, the seat is there,

196
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:53,789
the things on which he was sitting, the cushion
is there, all these piers that were removed

197
00:26:53,789 --> 00:27:00,500
that are there, all the carpets are there,
are just the same. It takes hardly ten minutes

198
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,470
to put it right.

199
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:12,470
So this is the future. The future is that
when you do something, feel, be that futuristic

200
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:21,169
seed of that person. See that the state in
the seed again. You give realisation to somebody.

201
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,830
See that it is fixed. So remember the past
for your manoeuvring and remember the future

202
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:33,830
for feeling so it is not lost in the future.
This is importance of making the spirit. Experience

203
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:44,059
of the back or the past should give you manoeuvring,
in the sense that at that moment you must

204
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:50,960
do something in the present. You must compensate,
in the sense that at that moment you must

205
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,159
do something in the present. You must compensate,
in the sense that at that moment you must

206
00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:02,159
do something by which the future is not giving.
This is how New Year's celebration should

207
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:15,269
be. '82 is important. In '82 whatever we have
learned from the past, we remember. We'll

208
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:22,769
not do the same mistake. Not only but also,
remember whatever past has taught us. We'll

209
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:27,980
have compassion for the people who have been
like that. We'll have love for them. We'll

210
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:33,149
have understanding. We'll do whatever is possible
to bring them round. We'll have concern, need

211
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:37,190
not just Sahaja Yogis, you see, sweet-talking
Sahaja Yogis, but we'll do something about

212
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:40,360
it.

213
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:46,929
So many are lost in intellectual pursuits.
So many are lost in financial pursuits. So

214
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:52,899
many are lost in political pursuits and so
many are lost in so-called service pursuits.

215
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:58,019
All of them belong to some category and you
have to belong to one of these categories.

216
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:02,769
So you have to think of them, try to bring
them out, do something about it, have a wider

217
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:04,100
standing.

218
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:09,990
When you have a small personalty, think of
your wife, yourself, nothing more than that

219
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:15,389
or your children at the most. But when you
are a wider personality you just think what

220
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:21,519
will happen to the people who belong to this
clan, who belong to Catholicism, those who

221
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:28,519
belong to Judaism, those who belong to Methodist
and to Jainism. Saint Michael, like that,

222
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:36,169
have a wider personality. Don't worry about
yourself. I've known people who'll come and

223
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:44,139
ask, "Mother, where should I find my keys?
Mother, where should I put my basket? Mother,

224
00:29:44,139 --> 00:29:51,139
where should I put my nose? What should I
do about my luggage? What should I do about

225
00:29:55,139 --> 00:30:01,029
my travelling?" All nonsensical things, they'll
come and ask. I'm not here to give you all

226
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:05,759
that. Every small thing they will ask. Now
if you tell them, "Why are you doing it?"

227
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:10,279
you said it. I didn't say it that you ask
Me every time you have to raise a finger.

228
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:17,279
"Mother, may I rise my finger. May I close
my eyes? May I smile?" Not that. You are people,

229
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:26,870
in My eyes are saints. So decide for yourself,
of course. You are saints. You have to assume.

230
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:33,809
You don't know you are saints. Assume you
are saints. This assumption must come to you,

231
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:39,440
on this great auspicious day that you are
saints, and saints have to be wise people

232
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:46,440
and do it by themselves, because they are
saints. If they fight, quarrel among themselves,

233
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:51,559
then this is stupidity, absolute stupidity,
against the whole. Sahaja Yoga is here to

234
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:58,559
solve the problems of others. What am I to
tell you anything? You are saints, that's

235
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:04,380
all I say, care. If you ask Me any questions,
answer is you are saints. Do what you like.

236
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,370
Whatever you want you will have. Whatever
you say it will happen. Whatever you ask for

237
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:13,070
it will happen. Whatever you imagine it will
work out, but if you imagine something good

238
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:20,070
and say something good and do something that
is divine, you are so great. You are made

239
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:28,630
like that. You are that. Assume. Assume that
power that you are a saint. How can you say

240
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:37,710
something nonsensical? Nirmala Vidya is at
your disposal, at your complete, I would say,

241
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:49,990
in fact, Nirmala Vidya, nobody had it except
for you Sahaja Yogis have. Nobody had even

242
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,929
the, Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, never even had
it. Can you believe? They had their own powers

243
00:31:53,929 --> 00:32:00,929
but you have Nirmala Vidya and now what do
you want more and then you ask me, "Mother,

244
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,110
should I ring?" or whether, "Should I smile?"
This is (?).

245
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:15,110
First of all you believe in yourself and then
it will work out. Behave in a confident manner,

246
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:23,259
in a proper way, and if I say anything, do
not start going into confusion, something

247
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:29,120
like that. Just understand that what your
Mother is saying is not for Me, for others,

248
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,220
maybe, and if it is for Me I should correct
Myself. Simple thing. If it is for others,

249
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:38,789
why should I worry? If it is for Me, thank
them very much and I must correct Myself.

250
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:39,809
It's as simple as that.

251
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:46,809
A day should come when I don't have to talk.
You have to talk. I hope that I could listen

252
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,169
to all your wise talk as I listen to children
when they tell me something. As I listen to

253
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:55,269
children when they tell me something. They
are so wise. In the same way I would like

254
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:59,500
to listen to you, talking all wise things,
nice things, about each other, loving, not

255
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:05,610
frightened of anyone, very happy, with each
other behaving like great gentlemen and great

256
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:11,190
gentle ladies, and be very much in love with
each other, looking after each other, not

257
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:18,190
to be sullen and sulking and stupid faces,
but charming. Charm! I won't use the word

258
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:24,549
because charming can be horrible. I've heard
that because I would say, but faces that are

259
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:31,549
lit up with joy, happiness and of dignity.
Such people should be like (?). Loving, affectionate,

260
00:33:38,629 --> 00:33:45,129
smiling, that should be that is what is Sahaja
Yoga. Those who do not want to join are absolutely

261
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:51,970
(unclear: (to God?). Actually, they are thrown
out. So, to stick onto Sahaja Yoga is difficult.

262
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:58,970
It is better to understand that to be a Sahaja
Yoga is difficult thing. To be a non Sahaja

263
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:04,159
yogi is to exist.

264
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,480
So this is what you have been seeking, which
you've got, which you assume, and be happy

265
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:16,480
and joyous and do not upset others. Do not
disturb others. Don't say harsh things because

266
00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:24,419
Nirmala will get upset ( ?). Be kind to others
and understand. If you need any correction

267
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:32,139
I am there to tell you. Up to a point I will
tell you. After some time, I'll not. Once

268
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:35,879
the children are grown up Mother doesn't say
anything. She just sits down and watches the

269
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:42,879
beauty of her children who are so grown up,
so mature, so beautiful. I hope that time

270
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:48,560
will come in my lifetime and I will be able
to see such beautiful people around, that

271
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:54,649
they have grown up, they understand how to
behave, and how to be nice and good.

272
00:34:54,649 --> 00:35:01,649
So for today's New Year let us vow within
ourselves that the selfishness or the self-centeredness

273
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:08,480
of the smallest in you is finished. Now the
drop has to become the ocean. Live like an

274
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,480
ocean and like a lion. Don't roar at others
and be generous and don't be afraid of others.

275
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:22,630
Everything is taken care of, but believe that
everything is taken care of. Sometimes you

276
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:27,160
might feel that you are let down, or you might
feel that this should have happened. Do not

277
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:34,160
desire for it. Whatever you desire is not
correct, that's all. If the desire is correct

278
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:42,020
and it's deserving it will happen - one hundred
per cent. So all the best. Have the greatest

279
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:54,340
year, and happiness and joy. Do your responsibilities.
Understand each other.

280
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:01,520
And now I'm going. Tomorrow I will be gone,
so-called. Don't worry about anything else

281
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:12,270
but worry about Sahaja Yoga. That has to be
established all over the world. Very great

282
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:19,270
work one has done, of course. I mean, you
can't say, one has done as much one can do,

283
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:26,800
but you can do much more. You can become really
dynamic 

284
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:06,330
and 

285
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:59,100
you can 

286
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:47,900
do it. Try to 

287
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:50,640
think of ways and methods of doing it. May
God bless you. So now with all these dreams

288
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:15,550
and blues, should we start giving presents
now.
