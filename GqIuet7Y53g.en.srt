1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:10,120
I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the
very outset we have to know that truth is

2
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:24,860
what it is. We cannot change it, we cannot
transform it, we cannot describe it, we cannot

3
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:36,599
purchase it. It is, it has been and it will
be.

4
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,920
I’m so very happy to see so many seekers
of truth in Los Angeles. So whatever I’m

5
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:59,550
going to tell you today, you are not to take
Me for granted, nor you have to believe Me

6
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:10,550
blind-folded. We have had lots of problems
because of this kind of blind-folded faith.

7
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:19,690
But whatever I’m telling you, you have to
know that this is just a hypothesis I’m

8
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:31,090
putting forth. If it is proved, then you have
to believe in it as honest people because

9
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:44,670
it is for your benevolence, it is for the
benevolence of your family, it is for the

10
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:52,470
benevolence of this city, it is for the benevolence
of your country and it is for the benevolence

11
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,840
of the whole world.

12
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,840
It is important that now we have to think
about our benevolence. We have had lots of

13
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:19,819
fun, pleasures, all kinds of enterprises in
our life. But what do we seek in those enterprises

14
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:35,989
is joy, anand. Whatever you want to have,
you want to have it because you think by that

15
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:48,540
you will feel satisfied and you’ll have
joy. But it is not so. Today we want to have,

16
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:59,700
say, for example, a house, all right? Then
we want to have a car. All right, then we

17
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:10,379
want to have a helicopter, I think. Then it
goes on like that one to another. We are never

18
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:21,900
satisfied. If these desires were pure desires,
we should have been satisfied when we got

19
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:26,090
them.

20
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:33,090
Also economics says that in general wants
are not satiable. Now whatever you have been

21
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:44,719
told about this power which is residing in
our triangular bone called as sacrum, that

22
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:54,329
means the Greeks knew it was a sacred bone.
They called it sacrum. And this bone has this

23
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:02,340
power within us which is the pure desire and
what is the pure desire? That is the truth

24
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:17,629
about ourselves that you are not this body,
this mind, this ego, these conditionings,

25
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,560
this emotions, this intellect. You are not
that because you say my emotions, my ego,

26
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:38,240
but who is this “my”? So you are not that.

27
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:45,860
The truth is you are the pure Spirit. The
second truth is that there is a all-pervading

28
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:03,490
Divine power of love. This power of love does
all the living work. For example, now you

29
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:15,169
see beautiful flowers all over. We take them
for granted. We don’t even think that it’s

30
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:24,389
a miracle. Who runs our heart? If you ask
the doctors, they will say it is autonomous

31
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:31,990
nervous system. But who is this auto? So all
these living things are done by the Divine

32
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:47,810
power of love. I say to you this, you need
not believe it M. But tonight you are going

33
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:56,150
to feel it, you are going to feel it on your
finger tips this all-pervading power of Divine

34
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:03,870
love which is called as paramchaitanya in
Sanskrit language. In Koran it is called as

35
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:11,110
ruh, in the Bible it is called as the cool
breeze of the Holy Ghost and Patanjali has

36
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,470
called it as Ritambhara Pragya, which is rather
a tongue twister.

37
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:28,470
So this power exists. You see the result,
you see the result that living things are

38
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:39,849
happening. Now if you go to the science, it
has its own limitations. First of all, science

39
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:51,629
is amoral. You can destroy Hiroshima, is all
right with science after all. You can do whatever

40
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,560
you want to do because you think you have
mastered the matter, but that is not our job

41
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:16,129
is to destroy people all over the world. This
idea of destruction comes because we forget

42
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,509
that we do not know the absolute truth.

43
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:31,030
First we have to know the absolute truth,
then we’ll know where are we. What are we

44
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:38,030
doing? What we are supposed to do. You are
quite aware as to what is happening in the

45
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:47,039
world, especially in America about which I
am very much concerned. As you know, there

46
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:54,949
are sixty-five per cent people are expected
to be sick within ten years’ time. It’s

47
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:03,280
not only a sickness of the body but of the
mind and this destruction will one day create

48
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:15,270
such a vacuum that we’ll be all shocked
why we are born as human beings and why we

49
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:28,909
should be destroyed? After all, the Creator
has created us with such understanding, with

50
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:35,909
such love, He has evolved us to this position
and now why should we be destroyed?

51
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:43,490
The reason is: we must find out why are we
on this earth. We are on this earth to become

52
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:53,980
the Spirit, to be a channel of God’s love
and above all, to enter into the Kingdom of

53
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:04,300
God. When I say to you it sounds rather impractical
and people can’t believe it. It’s a fact.

54
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:16,350
It’s the truth, I’m telling you that the
time has come for all of you to become the

55
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:26,730
Spirit. It’s a special time. I call it a
Blossom Time. They call it the Last Judgment.

56
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:36,279
Some people call it as Qiyama. Even in Sanskrit
there are words, many words to describe it.

57
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:44,540
So now we have to be the Spirit, otherwise
we should see with our own eyes the destruction

58
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:55,860
of our fellow men and of ourselves. There’s
nothing in between. Either you become Spirit

59
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,980
or all kinds of destructions will start. You’ve
been already told about the centers that exist

60
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,920
within you. On the medical side, we can say
that they express themselves and manifest

61
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:28,490
themselves as plexuses, but also they act
on the left-hand side as shown there on our

62
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:40,870
mind. So we’ll take one center and I’ll
tell you what can happen to you. Of course,

63
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:51,470
Sahaja Yoga is a meta science. Whatever I’m
saying you can find out and you’ll discover

64
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:00,019
that whatever I’m saying is the truth.

65
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:07,019
This one chakra we’ll deal today because
I could feel what’s the problem of Los Angeles.

66
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:15,519
This center that we call as Swadishthana , the
yellow-colored one. It comes out of the third

67
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:27,980
center what we call the Nabhi chakra, the
solar plexus. But this one which manifests

68
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:35,899
aortic plexus moves all over your abdominal
viscera and gives energy to your liver, to

69
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:50,050
your pancreas, to your spleen, to your kidneys,
to your intestines one side. Another thing

70
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,360
important thing it does, about which I think
doctors don’t know, perhaps, is that it

71
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:10,670
transforms energy for the use of the gray
cells. The gray cells in the brain we use

72
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,320
when we are futuristic, we think too much,
read too much, when we are very mental.

73
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:35,029
This energy is used and for that this poor
center has to work very hard. Today’s life

74
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:45,660
as it is, you see, where it is so futuristic.
Not only that but we have become really very

75
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:56,389
mental people. We go on thinking, thinking,
thinking and this thinking is done by the

76
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:06,079
gray cells which require the energy. So this
poor center has to work for this only work

77
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:13,639
when you are a thinker. Now it has to do other
things also. So it neglects all other viscera.

78
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:31,149
(Mother talks aside.) So all others are neglected.
Now when the liver is neglected, it is a very,

79
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:54,589
very important, extremely important organ
in our body. It takes out all the poison from

80
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:04,290
our body as heat and pass it into blood. It
cleanses through this process. But when this

81
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:19,630
liver is neglected, it cannot do that work
which it has to do; then the heat starts accumulating

82
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,019
in the liver.

83
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:33,019
Such a person is quite a hot-tempered person,
very hot-tempered can be. When he tries to

84
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:41,660
control the temper, he gets even worse. That’s
not the only thing that happens. This heat

85
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:53,399
consumes all the fats and such a person starts
becoming extremely thin. He doesn’t like

86
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:02,990
food, he doesn’t like people. I mean his
attention becomes extremely disturbed and

87
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:13,329
he thinks no end of himself. He thinks that
all others are stupid fools; I’m the only

88
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:23,279
wisest person. If anybody thinks like that
then they should know they have a liver problem.

89
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:30,279
Now thus a thing called ego starts growing.
This is the white color into the brain crosses

90
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:37,850
over and you get a big balloon of ego.

91
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:44,850
That’s on one side, doesn’t matter. But
what happens to your body? This heat of the

92
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:55,240
liver then starts rising and when it goes
to the pancreas, you develop diabetes. Is

93
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:09,790
a very common disease of modern man is diabetes.
Now can you imagine in India we have villagers,

94
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:18,529
simple people. They don’t think so much,
you see. They earn, today, eat their food,

95
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:23,129
sleep off. Next morning they are again up.
They don’t have to insure anything, they

96
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:30,129
don’t have to worry about it. But they take
so much of sugar, sometimes four, five spoons,

97
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:40,370
big spoons. The spoon must stand straight
at right angle otherwise they think this is

98
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:47,329
not tea at all and they take it three, four
cups of tea. They never get diabetes.

99
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:54,329
It’s a wonderful thing, you know, that you
can have as much sweet as you like, you never

100
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:07,009
get diabetes. Now these villagers don’t
think but those who are sitting on their chair

101
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:16,159
planning, thinking of the future all the time,
they definitely get diabetes. Then what happens?

102
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:36,730
Then the another movement of the same heat
goes to spleen and now this is even worse.

103
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Spleen is a speedometer. It keeps our speed.
Supposing we have eaten our food and then

104
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:55,520
we want to run, get a pain here, because it
supplies red blood corpuscles for emergencies.

105
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:06,760
If the spleen goes out of order with the heat
as well as the kind of life we have, a very

106
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,000
hectic life. First of all, what I see in America
is really terrible because they get up late,

107
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:26,549
in the night sleep late first of all and get
up late. Then early in the morning they have

108
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:34,090
to go to work, so they are in a hurry. They’ll
pull back their jeans and then I don’t know.

109
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,840
They don’t eat at all, they don’t even
brush, get into the car, start brushing and

110
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:49,470
then they have their food in the car, or call
it the breakfast, so-called breakfast. Here

111
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:54,210
it is all the cars are honking and you’re
getting late and there’s a jam, this that.

112
00:18:54,210 --> 00:19:01,210
This poor spleen doesn’t know what to do,
because it’s such a hectic life. It doesn’t

113
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:07,419
know how to cope with such a hectic person
who sometimes needs this, sometimes needs

114
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:14,419
that, so it becomes hectic. But then it is
vulnerable to a very serious disease which

115
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:21,770
we call as blood cancer, leukemia. On the
contrary, if our life is a peaceful quiet

116
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,880
life, we nicely get up in the morning, have
our bath, don’t go for jogging, that’s

117
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:43,620
also another thing. Jogging is right-sided.
Jogging is all right for people who are lethargic,

118
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:51,809
you see. Indians would be better. But not
for Americans. Because this is the physical

119
00:19:53,140 --> 00:20:00,140
as well as the mental side, right side. And
suddenly you get a shock or something happens.

120
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:09,429
Specially the newspapers. They believe in
just giving you shocks.

121
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:15,669
So in the morning you read something. “Oh,
what has happened?” And you get a shock.

122
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:21,789
Now you won’t believe the way they are describing
now the calamities in India are not so bad.

123
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:27,190
I’ve telephoned, I found out, it’s not
so bad. But why the newspaper are doing because

124
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:33,440
they love to give you shocks and you also
love them because they give you shocks, I

125
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,440
think. So in this shocking conditions this
poor spleen of yours cannot cope and that’s

126
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,100
how you get this horrible disease called blood
cancer.

127
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,450
Now I must tell you with Sahaja Yoga we have
completely cured blood cancer, completely

128
00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:01,450
cured of many people. It’s a fact. Without
going to doctors, without going for diagnosis

129
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:09,289
because in the diagnosis only half people
die, but we know their trouble. They and we

130
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,620
know what they are suffering from and it can
be worked out. Just this Kundalini is to be

131
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:21,620
raised. She goes to this center and just pacifies,
enlightens it, nourishes it and the whole

132
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:30,500
thing changes. I’m not telling you a cock
and bull story. I really tell you. You should

133
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:39,440
know that it is all happening, it’s all
happening today, everywhere.

134
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:46,440
Then the third thing that happens is that
your kidneys get coagulated and you get kidney

135
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:55,179
trouble. Then you have to go for dialysis
and you end up as bankrupts. I mean they do

136
00:21:55,409 --> 00:22:00,610
not cure you with dialysis. No, there’s
no cure with dialysis. But the only thing

137
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:07,610
that happens that you can become a bankrupt
and then die. Then it goes to intestines,

138
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:19,900
creates problem. You never feel hungry and
whatever you may eat, you get into constipation

139
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:26,900
of terrible dimensions and that leads to then
hernia and all kinds of diseases. So with

140
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:32,600
one center how many things you are suffering.

141
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:39,440
But that’s not the end of it. Then this
heat rises upward. There’s a center we call

142
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:46,440
it as right heart. Here you can see. When
this center is affected, you develop asthma.

143
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:54,960
Asthma is one hundred per cent curable in
Sahaja Yoga. We have a doctor who got his

144
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:02,950
MD. Now he’s in America for curing cancer,
curing asthma through Sahaja Yoga. Absolutely

145
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:16,909
curable. So with the intestines, with the
kidney, there are problems which seem, looks

146
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,960
like, people say, is incurable, but not. These
are the fundamentals we have, and if you have

147
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:37,020
to deal with the fundamentals, then the rest
of it falls into proper picture.

148
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:45,600
Like supposing now there’s a tree which
is sick. Now if you start treating the leaves,

149
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,600
you can’t cure. If you try to correct it
through its branches, you can’t cure. You

150
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,760
have to go deep down into the roots and the
sap that rises will cure it. In the same way,

151
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:10,370
these are the roots. This is the knowledge
of the roots I’m telling you. I see Los

152
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:17,370
Angeles every year is growing and growing
and growing. America is growing very fast,

153
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:25,399
no doubt. But when a tree of this civilization
is growing so fast we must find out about

154
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:36,270
our roots. And if you do not find out about
your roots how are you going to look after

155
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:45,470
this huge big civilization you have created
which is dry, which has no nourishment? So

156
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,279
we have to go to our roots.

157
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:57,279
Another problem is that if this knowledge
is coming from India, people have an objection.

158
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:07,350
It should come from America or from England.
Many people believe that Christ was born in

159
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,320
England. Is impossible to say that all right,
you have science, which we have learned; now

160
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:36,130
we have something. Why shouldn’t you learn,
if it is for your good? It’s only not I

161
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:43,130
am saying that. We had poets in London like
William Blake. He has said for these days

162
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:51,340
that the men of God will be born in those
days and they will become Divine and they

163
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:58,409
will have powers to make others Divine, said
by an Englishman. I don’t know if you read

164
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:03,899
C.S. Lewis or not. Another one, so many. There
was also one poet. He was Englishman who came

165
00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:10,899
in here and lived here. I read them and I’m
surprised that this has already been predicted.

166
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:19,830
So some people start thinking about it and
they think, “Let’s go to religion.”

167
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:25,399
Nothing wrong with religion as such and nothing
wrong with the people who have created it,

168
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:32,399
but I must say people like Jesus Christ or
Mohammed Sahab were really very, very great

169
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:43,700
people, were very, very great people and they
were so much evolved. They were so much evolved

170
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,649
that they never understood human beings, what
sort of things they are dealing with. I’ll

171
00:26:52,649 --> 00:26:59,649
give you an example. Fifth chapter Mathews,
Christ has said that: “If your one eye does

172
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:09,190
anything wrong, take it out. Otherwise, take
out the other one. If your one hand does something

173
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:18,429
wrong, then you cut it or cut both the hands.
If somebody slaps you on this side, you turn

174
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:28,700
the other side.” I have yet to see one Christian
who has cut his hands or taken out his eyes.

175
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:37,059
Is impossible. He thought you were such, we
were all such great…

176
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:43,390
I was born myself in a Christian religion
so I was shocked, how could these people follow

177
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:49,450
these rules and regulations which are beyond
human beings because they’ll have to take

178
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:56,450
out their eyes or they’ll have to cut their
hands? Then Mohammed Sahab thought that such

179
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:03,519
strictness was there for men, why not we have
something for women. So for women also, he

180
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:10,519
said, “All right. If a woman is not moral,
she should be put in the Mother Earth and

181
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:19,980
should be beaten with shoes or with stones.”
Now imagine: What about American ladies here?

182
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:29,549
It’s a dangerous situation.

183
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:36,549
So then came the another one called Sharia,
you see, it was actually given to the Jews

184
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:44,769
by Moses when he saw they were very decadent.
So he gave them this, this is in the Jeremiah,

185
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:51,769
who has written clearly that he said that
if you steal something, your hand should be

186
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:58,360
cut. All this Sharia was given to Jews, but
Jews were wise. They said, “Baba, we can’t

187
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:04,740
do this. No, no.” So the Muslims have taken
over and they are putting on their […?] I

188
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:11,740
have yet to come across one Muslim who can
be called as a real Muslim, or one Christian

189
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:20,250
who can be called as a real Christian. It’s
none of their mistakes, after all, they are

190
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:26,909
human beings and these laws and regulations
are for saints. If the saints do anything

191
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:33,909
wrong, then they should be punished. Not for
ordinary human beings, it’s too much.

192
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:43,340
But to us religion now has become a matter
of fighting. And then you see people, they

193
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:51,179
go on distributing. Now like the other day
a fellow came with a Gita to Me. He walked

194
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:58,120
up to Me. “You must buy this Gita.” I
said, “I have many already in the house.

195
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,909
But,” I said, “Why are you wearing this
dhoti here? It’s Chicago, is a very cold

196
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:08,649
place. You know, you should not wear this
dhoti.” He said, “My Guru has initiated

197
00:30:08,649 --> 00:30:15,320
that I must wear a dhoti.” I said, “Do
you think by wearing a dhoti, you will go

198
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:22,140
to heaven? In India everybody wears a dhoti,
will theyl all go to heaven? Try to understand

199
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:29,140
now.” Now shaven his head completely . I
said, “Why do you shave your head?” He

200
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:35,610
said, “That’s what my Guru has told me
that if I have to be spiritual, I must shave

201
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:42,610
my head.” Kabira has said that if, by shaving
your head, if you can go to Heaven, then the

202
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:50,840
sheep is shaven every year, there won’t
be any place for you there!

203
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:04,779
All the saints who were real saints were full
of fun about all these things and they could

204
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:15,639
see that this is all stupidity. The way people
are trying to create this kind of fanaticism

205
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:24,850
is all stupidity. It is, then we feel disappointed.
Same about Hindus. Hindus, it is said that

206
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:39,139
in every human being there is a Spirit. Everybody
has the Spirit in the heart. Then how can

207
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:48,340
you have caste system? How can you have a
higher race and a lower race? There are so

208
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:57,779
many examples to show. For example, Shri Rama
ate the fruits from an old lady who had eaten

209
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:05,659
them before to see that they are not sour.
In India if somebody eats something you’ll

210
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:11,809
never eat that. But look at Shri Rama and
then He tells His wife, “Oh what fruits!

211
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:17,470
I’ve never eaten like that.” But the brother
was angry. The brother said, “Why should

212
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:23,590
she give you such fruits, it’s not proper.”
So the wife says, “Please give me some.

213
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:29,860
After all, I’m your wife.” Then she eats
something and says, “Wow! What fruits!”

214
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:35,700
Now the brother Lakshmana says, “Sister-in-law,
give me also little bit.” “No, you were

215
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,720
so angry, I will not give you.”

216
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:45,720
The whole story shows the love, the compassion,
the oneness, because of love. Krishna also

217
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:58,389
had food with a person called Vidura who was
a son of a maidservant. He wouldn’t go with

218
00:32:58,389 --> 00:33:05,389
the king and eat food but He would eat with
this. Now why? Because he was a realized soul,

219
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:17,840
Vidura was. Every story of Christ or anything
you see is nothing but love. But if you are

220
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:28,200
bent upon taking something like Christ went
to a wedding and He made wine out of water.

221
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:38,419
That’s the simple thing. Now I can also
do that, not difficult. But that’s not the

222
00:33:38,419 --> 00:33:45,419
wine. That is the taste of grape juice. For
wine it has to rot. Instantaneously who can

223
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:57,990
make wine? How can you make wine just by touching
water. You cannot. It has to rot. The more

224
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:10,340
rotten it is, the better it is, they say.
I’ve never tasted so I don’t know, but

225
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:21,740
smells horrible, I can tell you this much.

226
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:28,770
Now, so we don’t know what to do because
go to religion, there we find fanaticism.

227
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:36,830
We find people fighting in the name of God,
making big money out of, I don’t know but

228
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:45,030
I read a book about where it said the Vatican
printed one million, no, nine million dollars,

229
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:56,480
nine million dollars as counterfeits and distributed
through their own bank. How could any religious

230
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:07,730
man think of doing these things, I can’t
understand. First of all, they have to be

231
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:16,950
holy people. They have to be righteous people.
If they have interest in your purses, then

232
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:25,440
how can they be holy men? God doesn’t understand
money. It’s your headache. Banking is your

233
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:32,990
headache. How can you purchase God with money?
So I appeal to your intelligence, to your

234
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:43,440
wisdom, to know that this your American country
has fed so many false gurus so far without

235
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:51,600
even thinking what they are doing, without
even finding that they are just making money.

236
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,190
They are marketing some nonsense.

237
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:02,190
That’s another problem. When I came here
first nobody would listen to Me. I said, “Why?”

238
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:11,660
“Because you don’t take money, so what
is the credibility?" They can’t understand

239
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:18,960
anything without money. All right, doesn’t
matter. Now the situation seems to be better.

240
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:30,400
But the last thing that happens to you is,
very serious thing with this Swadishthan chakra,

241
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:37,090
is that you get a heart attack, a massive
heart attack, especially if you are young,

242
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:43,410
and you are playing, say, tennis and you are
drinking too much, you get a heart attack

243
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:50,410
which is very massive and which is always
fatal. Angina is different. But this massive

244
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:58,520
heart attack comes from this right-side problem.
Then this heat rises into the head and what

245
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:06,660
happens, you get paralysis of the right side,
minimum.

246
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:13,660
There are so many diseases out of one center
you can get. Then you go to some guru. He

247
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:24,220
puts something into your head, I don’t know
what they do. Then you get cancers, you get

248
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:31,750
incurable diseases, you get insomnia, all
kinds of things you get and ultimately you

249
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:37,620
realize, you have gone mad. I mean I don’t
know, a mad man doesn’t understand he’s

250
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:44,620
mad, but others know. But wisdom should be
there. When you choose a guru, you must know

251
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:51,940
anybody who wants money for spiritual work
cannot be a holy person, cannot.

252
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:06,200
So at this juncture you have to know that
when this Kundalini rises, first thing that

253
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:13,200
happens to us that our innocence starts manifesting.
Innocence is eternal, it is not temporary,

254
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:25,200
it is eternal. Whatever you may try to destroy
it, it is there and it starts manifesting

255
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:32,010
and then your eyes become innocent, absolutely
innocent, and very powerful and there’s

256
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:39,010
a glint of the spirituality in your eyes.
Such eyes are so powerful that even a glance

257
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:47,290
of such a person can settle down thousands.
With this innocent eyes you understand that

258
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:59,610
your attention has lost lust and greed completely
and you have become a very moral person, very

259
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:03,680
righteous.

260
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:10,680
Nobody has to tell you, don’t do this, don’t
do that, no. Just it happens. Now how? It’s

261
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,010
like this, if I have a snake in my hand, and
I’m a very obstinate person and you tell

262
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:21,040
me, “There’s a snake in your hand, please
leave it.” I’ll say, “No, there’s

263
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:28,040
no snake, it’s a rope.” Till it bites
me and I’ll go on saying, “It's a rope”.

264
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:35,320
But if there’s a little light, I’ll throw
it away. I’ll know this is wrong. As a result

265
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:43,820
of this happening, whatever is destroying
within you, you may think it should be given

266
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:51,370
up. You may not be knowing also that it is
destructive but you just drop it out. Overnight.

267
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:59,480
I must tell you I have known people who have
dropped drug addiction. Here such a problem

268
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:07,080
exists of drug addiction and can be completely
cured with Sahaja Yoga, I can assure you.

269
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:17,150
If this Kundalini rises, then not only drug
addiction but any kind of addiction drops

270
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:23,770
off.

271
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:30,770
Then you know all about your centers on your
fingertips. You know what’s wrong with you

272
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:39,740
on your fingertips. With this light you know
where lies your problem. This is self knowledge.

273
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:50,390
On your fingertips, means on your central
nervous system, in Sanskrit the word is bodh,

274
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:56,020
from where the word Buddha has come, or also
is Vida from where the word Veda has come.

275
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:03,020
You have to know the truth, not mentally,
but on your central nervous system, on your

276
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:11,500
fingertips. So you know the absolute truth.
Now there are many who came to me who never

277
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:20,970
believed in God. Atheists, they call themselves,
especially in Russia, say Russians. But they

278
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:27,820
took no time to get their realization. They
are such a clean slate, I tell you. They have

279
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:34,820
no conditionings, nothing. And you won’t
believe that we always have our program in

280
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:44,330
stadiums. We cannot have in halls. We’ve
got sixteen to eighteen thousand people in

281
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:51,830
one place. What is happened with them? Why
is it they are so sensitive? They have thrown

282
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:59,260
away all false gurus, one by one. They’re
not bothered. After all at least, I must say,

283
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:07,280
sixty per cent people in Russia are so sensitive
to spirituality, very sensitive. Most amazing

284
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:18,800
thing is that they jump into it without any
difficulty. I don’t know how they trust

285
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:29,760
Me so much but they do trust themselves first
and then do trust that they have got self-realization.

286
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:39,820
I don’t know if you have told them or not
that recently they had a conference of two

287
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:46,270
thousand scientists. Their scientists are
very highly qualified people where they invited

288
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:53,270
Me to speak to them. In the conference I was
the chief speaker and I was amazed. There

289
00:42:54,990 --> 00:43:01,990
were also ten thousand other people. The subject
matter they gave Me, “Medicine and Self-knowledge.”

290
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:10,460
They all talked about morality, how important
it is to preserve the society, to preserve

291
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:19,110
the families, to preserve the whole society.
And they were such great surgeons, there was

292
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:26,730
one surgeon ninety-year old who had operated
on our prime minister Indira Gandhi, who is

293
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:31,470
still operating. He’s ninety years, and
the way he speaks you wouldn’t make out

294
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:38,470
that he’s of that age, and he has written
a book against alcoholism and immorality.

295
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:47,430
I can’t think such a subject can ever be
talked about here where your Hollywood is

296
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:56,040
so important. What harm they have done to
you, you don’t know. First of all, Mr. Freud,

297
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:07,940
who just was worshipped like Christ and he
has ruined the people and brought them to

298
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:14,970
the sex point only. He is from Austria and
when I told this in Austria, they were very

299
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:25,940
happy. They clapped, they said he’s brought
such shame to us. But here he was worshipped

300
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:33,510
and now the whole country has been so much
degraded by him. Now I read the book, “Freudian,

301
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:44,400
Fraudulent Freud”. There’s another book:
“Downfall of the Freudian Empire”. But

302
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:51,880
with that, how many have suffered? What has
happened? Families broken. What nonsense he

303
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:59,940
talked about. The mother, that your relationship
with mother is of a sexual nature. God knows

304
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:06,440
he must be having something like that. I told
this to an Indian, he said, “Thank God he

305
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:13,220
didn’t come to India, otherwise we would
have cut him into pieces and thrown him into

306
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:20,220
Arabic Sea.” How could you accept such an
unwise, nonsensical thing? Well, you did and

307
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,960
so many people who thought it was big experimentation,
this that. It is absolutely a myth, I tell

308
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:36,760
you. If you come to Sahaja Yoga, you will
know what is a psyche, how it gets affected,

309
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:43,760
where it is, how it works out the real knowledge
about psychology, you will know. This is psychology

310
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:51,050
or is it child science? I don’t understand.
It has nothing to do with reality, everything

311
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:58,090
imaginary. Jung, Jung was the one who got
realization and he did say that Freud was

312
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:07,680
wrong. He was the one who said it and who
talked of morality.

313
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:14,680
But I must tell you one story about Myself.
They invited Me to a conference of the Jungians.

314
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:25,580
It was International Jungians Conference.
Me, poor thing, was supposed to talk about

315
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:33,330
Jung and I told them where did Jung went wrong
because he said the consciousness is vertical.

316
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:41,110
No, he said it is horizontal which is not
so and that was the biggest mistake. But whatever

317
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:46,500
it is he talked of morality.

318
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:51,380
But next day the president, now he’s no
more, so I can tell you the story, came to

319
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:57,240
see Me. Eighty-five year old, shaking, you
know? He came to Me, said, “I have some

320
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:04,240
private work.” I said, “What is it?”
“I have a keep and my wife is dead. Can

321
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:13,940
you please help me to cajole this keep of
mine, to tell her that she should now marry

322
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:22,260
me?” "What's the age of your fiancé or
whatever you call it?" "Only about thirty-eight

323
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:33,690
years." I said, “Do you think I am supposed
to do all such work?” Now this is a Jungian

324
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:40,690
who is talking like this. If it was a Freudian,
I could have understood. I was shocked and

325
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:50,160
to come to Me for this kind of a nonsense.
I said I don’t know what’s wrong with

326
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:59,170
these people. They can’t even understand
that spirituality is holiness, auspiciousness,

327
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:06,670
is purity. Can’t understand how he came
to ask Me this question. I was so disappointed

328
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:15,460
that nine years I didn’t visit your country.
I said, “How can I talk to them?”

329
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:18,590
[“I have a keep” means to have a mistress,
Ed. ]

330
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:25,590
Today I have to tell you one thing. The time
has come for all of you to get your self-realization,

331
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:32,630
by which your attention becomes enlightened,
your health gets completely all right, your

332
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:42,600
mental processes are sensible, but above all
you stand in your present. We live in the

333
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:55,970
past or the future and all the time we are
thinking of past and future. We are jumping

334
00:48:55,970 --> 00:49:02,970
on the cusp of past and future. With this
happening you become thoughtlessly aware because

335
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:11,460
these thoughts elongate. Thoughtlessly, but
aware. And this thoughtless awareness is the

336
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:18,700
time which is reality in which you grow spiritually.
Then you get your inspirations. All your potential

337
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,550
qualities starts manifesting.

338
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:31,550
You’ll be amazed in India we have had many
great writers, very great, we should say,

339
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:42,120
poets, very great musicians who are now world
famous. All of them came to Sahaja Yoga. They

340
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:52,710
were nothing. Even Miss India that was this
time Miss Universe. She is a Sahaja Yogini,

341
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:58,670
and she came to Me, she said, “Mother, is
it all right if I go for this beauty contest?”

342
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:03,920
I said, “What’s wrong? You go.” “I
don’t want to wear funny dresses.” I said,

343
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,580
“But you wear, after all, swimming dress,
it’s all right.” She, she was not such

344
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:16,200
a beautiful girl. She asked Me, “Mother,
I’m going just now for Miss India.” I

345
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:23,200
said, “You’ll be also Miss Universe. Take
it from Me.” She became.

346
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:29,690
Because what is the speciality? It’s not
only the face, it’s not only the features

347
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:36,470
or anything, but it is the inner beauty, it’s
the balance, it’s the poise, it’s the

348
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:43,470
wisdom, all these things put together make
a personality. Not only just your face, how

349
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:52,550
you look. That’s not important. See, look
at Mahatma Gandhi, how he looked like. I don’t

350
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:59,610
know I have seen him, I have lived with him
in my childhood. Such a bony structure, but

351
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:09,720
even Samson would have been afraid of him,
he was like that. Such a power of truth and

352
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:16,720
honesty in his heart. It’s not that his
face was very impressive, but the inner power

353
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:25,290
which was within him. I know of another prime
minister very well Lal Bahadur Shastri. I’m

354
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:32,290
talking about him because both were born on
the same date of 2nd of October. Another person,

355
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:39,540
tremendously powerful, very short man. So
powerful he was and his realization of such

356
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:49,550
a high degree. He could easily make out who
[BREAK IN RECORDING] Of course, he respected

357
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:56,550
Me very much. I used to be very shy,because
he would not even sit before Me 
on the chair. Is what we call self-realization.

358
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:22,080
In Sanskrit an egg is called as Dwijaha, the
bird is called Dwijaha and a human being,

359
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:30,860
when he is realized, also called as Dwijaha,
means born twice. So first it’s an egg,

360
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:36,470
then it becomes a bird. There are two different
things. In the same way, first we are a human

361
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:43,160
beings then we are realized souls. This is
the new age, this is the new race which has

362
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:50,160
come up. Is nothing, just put a brand here,
one, like any other twice-born, like any other

363
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:58,440
person you are behaving. Why? What is twice,
twice-born? Or I am a Christian, and a Hindu,

364
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:04,540
and a Muslim or anything. It’s just a brand
because anybody can commit any murder, any

365
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:07,480
sin, anything.

366
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:14,480
So this transformation is your responsibility.
You have to take to this transformation, and

367
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:23,780
you have to change people. If you have to
save your country, now learn this: that you

368
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:31,270
can do it. You can easily do it. Is very simple
because is all built in within you. Now what

369
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:39,470
do we do? Just put a seed in the Mother Earth
and it sprouts by itself. How? Because the

370
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:46,290
seed has a built-in quality to sprout and
the Mother has a built-in quality to make

371
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:53,290
it sprout. In the same way, you all have this
power, this glory is within you, just it has

372
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:58,160
to happen. It sprouts and then you have to
grow.

373
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:05,160
I don’t know how people trust Me so much.
I am an Indian after all. I could be an immigrant,

374
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:15,800
or whatever. I could be anything. But they
trust Me somehow. But later on, they do not

375
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:26,330
trust themselves and they do not grow. It’s
a very sad thing, not in Russia, I must tell

376
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:33,810
you, not in Russia. There’s a joke. We had
a seminar of thousands of people in Russia

377
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:41,440
and there was one American Sahaja Yogi and
a Russian Sahaja Yogi asked him: “How many

378
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:48,440
do you have Sahaja Yogis in America?” So
he said, “To be precise, it is fifty-six.”

379
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:58,290
So this Sahaja Yogi from Taliatti says, “Oh
my God, you are fifty-six thousand? We have

380
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:04,920
only twenty-one thousand here in Taliatti.”
They can’t understand. They think Americans

381
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:11,920
are very bright, very smart people. There
must be at least 56,000. Americans are known

382
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:19,170
to be very intelligent, very smart. So they’re
taking to Coca Cola culture now. Russians,

383
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:29,620
forty per cent, because they think Americans,
after all, you know, they take Coca Cola,

384
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:36,620
they go to McDonald. They’re very smart
people. They’re ruling all over the world

385
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:41,210
and all your junk which doesn’t sell here
goes there and they are really trying to look

386
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:43,690
like Americans, you know.

387
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:50,690
Whatever it is. Why I’m trying to say this,
is the whole world is looking at you. They

388
00:55:53,020 --> 00:56:00,020
follow you. This Hollywood doesn’t understand
its own responsibility. The whole world is

389
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:06,870
following you and the way they speak also
English is very surprising is just like American

390
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:12,410
English. I take about two days to understand
that. But now in Russia they are speaking

391
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:19,410
the same English as you speak and it’s a
difficult situation. So, you have to understand

392
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:26,440
the second responsibility that, as citizens
of this great country, you have to lead the

393
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,020
whole world into righteousness, into morality,
into constructive beautiful life. You have

394
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:38,020
to enter in the Kingdom of God and settle
there, whatever may be your race, whatever

395
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:45,090
may be your religion, or all these nonsensical
differences.

396
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:50,540
But it’s very important and you’ll be
surprised, the first country I visited was

397
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:56,680
America. I would say, first I went to Iran
because my brother was there but after that

398
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:03,680
I came to America and I was surprised. How
do they take to falsehood so easily? Even

399
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:12,480
Indians who come here become stupid. I don’t
know. Really. You won’t believe, this there’s

400
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:20,170
a gentleman who is organizing the marriage
of Rama and Sita. I mean they were married

401
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:24,610
long time back. But he’s organizing it in
every place. Los Angeles one marriage, one

402
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:31,610
in New York, one in Philadelphia. All like
that he is organizing. And here there were

403
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:39,920
ten thousand people who attended that wedding.
The boy, means Rama, was ten-year old and

404
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:46,200
the girl was eight-year old. So this kind
of nonsense, even Indians, they would not

405
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:51,470
do this in India. No, everybody will laugh
at them.

406
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:56,340
The another example if I give, you’ll be
shocked. There’s a lady, Maharani of Dhrangadhra

407
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:03,230
. She’s another mad woman and she has lost
her husband. So she has got one man, she dressed

408
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:10,230
him up as a lady, and she calls him as “the
goddess” she worships. I was shocked at

409
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:14,640
the whole thing that they are doing. So I
said, “But you don’t have anybody who

410
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:21,640
follows you.” “No, no, we have many in
Los Angeles.” Can you imagine? This there

411
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:34,050
is another one now who makes the pendulum
move. The people who are lynched by him, I

412
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:42,080
met them in Washington. They told me, “Mother,
we have sold out our houses. Now we don’t

413
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,900
know what to do. We have taken out our children
from good schools. We have no money.” I

414
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:52,710
said, “ So why?” "There was this gentleman
from the TM, you see. Pradeep Chopra is the

415
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:58,060
name." Pradeep, to have such a nice name,
I don’t know who gave him this name. What

416
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:03,240
his mother must have thought. So he said that,
“Now, I can control the minds of others,

417
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:08,240
I’ll teach you how.” So he calls somebody.
“Stand here” and he gives you a pendulum

418
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:15,240
in his hand. Now he says, “See, now he’ll
move the pendulum.” He moves the pendulum

419
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:22,910
and people have given up their houses, this,
that, to this man. So I said, “How can you

420
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:31,460
come and tell Me this now? Have you come on
this earth to move the pendulums?” I mean,

421
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:40,040
this kind of stupidity, can’t understand.

422
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:47,040
Then they said you can levitate three or four
feet like this. Already you have jams on the

423
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:57,990
road. Why do you want to have such people
moving their three feet? Such stupid things

424
00:59:57,990 --> 01:00:04,990
they accept, such stupid things. But the fellow
of TM, the one who was their very big master,

425
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:11,370
he got epilepsy, so he came to me. By that
time, he had become bankrupt. He told Me:

426
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:16,350
“I went to America and my guru told me,
your money is so much involved, so you have

427
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:23,110
to tell then, I came without any visa, without
any passport.” His name is Peter Pierce.

428
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:29,830
“And you have to tell them I can walk into
the wall, through the wall." "Then?" I said.

429
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:36,540
"I told them and they all believed me.”
“They all believed you?” “Yes.” “Professors,

430
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:41,770
mathematicians, everybody believed you?”
“Yes.” How can they believe such nonsensical

431
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:42,020
things?

432
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:48,880
There is a saying by Guru Nanaka, “Satguru
wahi, jo sahib mili hai.” “The one who

433
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:05,190
is the real master is the one who makes you
meet God, who makes you Divine.” And this

434
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:14,420
is what you should expect. It looks difficult,
is the easiest thing to be Divine. You don’t

435
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:20,340
have to jump, you don’t have to waste money.
Nothing of the kind. It’s all built in within

436
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:26,530
you. Just have your awakening and enjoy. You
don’t have to do anything like running away

437
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:31,490
from your homes, going to Himalayas, standing
on your heads. Nothing needed. No austerities.

438
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:37,690
You are already ready for it. You have done
all this in your last lives. Now please don’t

439
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:42,090
do all these things. You just get your Self-realization.

440
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:48,670
So you become collectively conscious. You
can feel on your fingertips vibrations of

441
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:55,230
another person, whether dead, living, or historical
whatever it is. You can know. You know the

442
01:01:55,230 --> 01:02:02,230
absolute truth on your fingertips. But above
all, because you become collectively conscious,

443
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:10,430
that is, a microcosm becomes the macrocosm,
because a drop becomes the ocean. Who is the

444
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:20,560
other? You become the part and parcel of one.
So when it happens to you, it is very amazing

445
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:30,300
how you realize what powers you have. You
can give realization to people, you can cure

446
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:39,030
them, you can enjoy yourself. You never get
bored. So many powers you have which starts

447
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:48,140
expressing and when they start expressing,
you’re amazed at yourself. This is what

448
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:52,500
you must expect and not moving of a pendulum.

449
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:59,500
I’m sure today I’m not talking to stupid
people. Sahaja Yoga is not meant for idiotic

450
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:07,150
people, I must tell you. The kind of idiocity
that has come I can’t understand, because

451
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:17,060
I used to worship Abraham Lincoln, used to
worship and he gave us such a great thing

452
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:24,470
like democracy and how can this democracy
be a demonocracy? There are seekers, but misled.

453
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:42,350
Above all that happens to you, the highest
is that you jump into the ocean of joy…you

454
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:53,010
just become joy. Joy is singular. Happiness
and unhappiness are the two sides of one coin.

455
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:06,710
But joy is singular that you become the witness
the whole thing like a drama. It’s fun and

456
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:15,800
you get out of your problems and that’s
how you know how to solve them.

457
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:22,800
And above all, the bliss is there to help
you. You’ll be amazed how things work out.

458
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:30,860
Meticulously in every way, even money-wise.
There was a girl, lady from Toronto. She wanted

459
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:38,450
to travel with me, come here. She’s very
good, but she thought she hasn’t got sufficient

460
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:45,450
money and next day she got a check of $4,000
because she had paid some money somewhere

461
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:52,740
a long time back. This is just a very, very
minimum. But the greatest thing is that you

462
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:04,440
become your own master. You know what chakras
are there, you know what you are doing. You

463
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:10,250
know everything. It is not just like standing
and moving a pendulum nonsense but it is you

464
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:17,250
know what’s wrong with anyone. Then you
don’t talk about his face, about his dress,

465
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:25,970
how he walks but you talk about his centers,
what centers are there and you can cure. All

466
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:29,340
this is your own.

467
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:36,340
Last of all I have to tell you this Kundalini
is the power of pure desire and she is your

468
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:45,210
individual mother. She knows everything about
you. It’s all tape-recorded. So you don’t

469
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:53,250
have to start judging yourself. She knows
you and She is anxious to give you self-realization.

470
01:05:54,330 --> 01:06:01,330
She takes up all the trouble on Herself and
gives you this beautiful thing which you call

471
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:09,100
as self-realization and then you realize that
you are endowed with the power of Divine love.

472
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:20,090
You become extremely dynamic; at the same
time you are extremely compassionate. You

473
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:28,770
enjoy your virtues, you enjoy your love, you
enjoy others, you enjoy everything. Such a

474
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:38,300
state is not difficult. Only thing you must
understand that you are here to become the

475
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:47,460
Spirit. In this time try to say whatever is
possible. I’m going tonight to New York.

476
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:57,630
They always put me like a shuttlecock from
one place to another. So I have to go. But

477
01:06:57,630 --> 01:07:04,630
I’m very happy I saw so many of you here.
I hope you’ll be all responsible and will

478
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,400
look after your realization.

479
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:14,400
Now I would request you that it cannot be
forced on you, it cannot be, because I respect

480
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:26,310
your freedom. You have freedom. This is the
Last Judgment: If you want to go to Heaven,

481
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:33,310
you are welcome, if you want to go to hell,
you are welcome. I cannot force on you. So

482
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:41,640
those who do not want to come for this or
do not want to have it, I cannot force, so

483
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:48,530
I would request you, those who do not want
to have, can leave the hall. Would be better

484
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:54,030
for others and those who want to have it are
welcome and I’m sure you all will have it.

485
01:07:54,030 --> 01:08:01,030
No doubt about it. No doubt. It will take
hardly ten minutes for you to get your realization,

486
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:13,850
ten minutes. But you have to be little patient
and you have to also know that it is your

487
01:08:16,449 --> 01:08:23,449
pure desire that is going to give you. Just
your pure desire. I’ve already told you

488
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:32,210
that Kundalini knows everything about you
and you don’t have to judge yourself.

489
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:39,279
So there are three conditions, very simple,
very, very simple. The first one is that you

490
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:49,650
are not to feel guilty at all. Your Kundalini
knows everything. Why should you feel guilty?

491
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:57,960
Leave it to Her. You don’t judge yourself
and please don’t feel guilty. You don’t

492
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:04,960
know if you feel guilty, this center here,
catches, and if this center goes out of order,

493
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:13,630
you develop angina which is a horrible disease
of the heart. You develop spondylitis and

494
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:23,850
also lethargic organs. Only by one this center
of yours, and it is always there when you

495
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:30,779
feel guilty. If you have done anything wrong
in the past, you should have dealt with it

496
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:36,450
that time. What’s the use of carrying it
here all the time? Also is conditioning. For

497
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:43,450
small, small things people start feeling guilty,
specially with this Catholic Church, Christian

498
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:52,240
churches. You have to know that we are sinners,
we are not. We are human beings and human

499
01:09:53,470 --> 01:10:00,470
beings can commit mistakes. You are not gods
and at this juncture, if you have guilt, how

500
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:08,080
will the Kundalini rise? If you are really
guilty, you would have been in jail, isn’t

501
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:15,370
it? I don’t know with this law here, if
people can go to jail even if they have done

502
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:21,080
something wrong, I have no idea. I, somehow
or other, I’m very apprehensive about the

503
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:28,080
LA laws you see. They say it’s very funny.

504
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:36,610
All right, whatever it is. Now God’s laws
are extremely pure and He loves you. He doesn’t

505
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:50,100
want you, to put you into any trouble. He
loves you and loves you very much and He wants

506
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:59,250
you to enter into His kingdom to enjoy. Now
you’re just ready to get it. So the first

507
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:09,390
condition is that you are not to feel guilty
at all. I assure you, you have done nothing

508
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:16,980
wrong. Is it possible to forgive yourself?
Thank you.

509
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:24,990
The second condition is even easier. If you
understand, logically. If, I mean, the second

510
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:36,670
condition is that you have to forgive everyone,
even without thinking about them. Just to

511
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:45,790
say, “I forgive every one of them,” finished.
Is very difficult but logically, I’ll tell

512
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:52,790
you, whether you forgive or don’t forgive,
what do you do? Do nothing. But if you don’t

513
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:59,670
forgive, then you play into wrong hands and
torture yourself while the person who has

514
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:06,670
tortured you, is very happy. You go on torturing
yourself because you can’t forgive. So just

515
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:12,210
you have to say, “I forgive everyone.”
Don’t think about them also because that

516
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:19,210
will give you a headache. Best is to forgive
everyone. Once you forgive, then the Divine

517
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:26,920
takes over and works it out. So now please
forgive everyone. Is there any problem? All

518
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:34,830
right.

519
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:41,830
The third condition is very simple is that
you have to take out your shoes. That’s

520
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:52,150
all. You won’t believe, in London first
time I said, “Take out your shoes,” half

521
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:59,150
of them walked out. It’s difficult.

522
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:20,700
All right. So first of all we’ll show you
what we have to do to nourish our centers.

523
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:39,700
Only for tonight, only for tonight. You don’t
have to do it. Later on, as I told you that

524
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:47,340
our centers are here and all this is happening
in a collective way. It’s not single person

525
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:52,730
doing something at home. So you have to go
there. They’ll give you every instruction,

526
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:59,730
everything, every book, whatever you want.
Free, absolutely free. But you must desire

527
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:04,750
to grow and it will work out.

528
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:10,860
Some people get it immediately in such a big
way and then they think they’re on top of

529
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:16,340
the world, but no. You have to grow and you
have to know everything about yourself. You

530
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:23,340
have to know about Sahaja Yoga completely
in a full way. You have to be a master and

531
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:30,110
I tell you hardly it takes one month to be.
You people are very intelligent and everything.

532
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:34,630
Just put your attention, it will work out.
All right.

533
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:41,630
So now we have to put our left hand on our
lap just. (Mother speaks aside to someone

534
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:55,410
in Hindi.) Just now. Left hand on your left
lap, comfortably. We are not to go to Himalayas,

535
01:14:57,290 --> 01:15:02,970
do anything of the kind. We have to be comfortable,
that’s one thing. Here sitting down, you’ll

536
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:09,970
get your realization. Left hand towards the
photograph, we put here, because they have

537
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:17,460
objection for that, but now you put towards
Me, left hand towards Me which is symbolically

538
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:27,300
saying that you want your self-realization
because the left side is the power of desire,

539
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:34,740
mundane desire. So you’re desirous, so you
are putting the hand towards Me, left hand,

540
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:40,140
that’s all. Now with the right hand, we
have to nourish our centers on the left-hand

541
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:43,120
side. Now they will show you how to do.

542
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:50,120
First we put our right hand on the heart.
In the heart resides the Spirit which is the

543
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:59,250
reflection of God Almighty. If you become
the Spirit then you become your own master.

544
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:13,960
So you take your hand on the upper portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side and

545
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:20,960
this is the center of your mastery which is
created by all the prophets. You will know

546
01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:32,050
about it, everything. Everything will be told
to you. You have to put both your feet apart

547
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:40,610
from each other because these are also two
powers on left and right.

548
01:16:40,610 --> 01:16:47,610
Now please take your hand in the lower portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side. This

549
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:55,540
is the center for pure, Divine knowledge.
Don’t get disturbed with this, it’s very

550
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:08,510
simple, is the center for the pure, Divine
knowledge to work out. Now you take your hand

551
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:21,460
back to the upper portion of your abdomen,
press it which is the center of mastery. Now

552
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:31,900
please take your right hand on top of your
heart which is the center of the pure Spirit.

553
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:40,920
Now please take your right hand in the corner
of your neck and shoulder and turn your head

554
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:45,920
to your right. Now this is the center I told
you about that when you feel guilty, this

555
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:52,920
goes out of order and at this juncture you
must keep this center open by not feeling

556
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,350
guilty at all.

557
01:17:57,350 --> 01:18:04,350
Now you raise your right hand on top of your
forehead across and put down your head. This

558
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:13,690
is the center where you have to forgive everyone.
This center is extremely constricted and if

559
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:21,300
you don’t forgive, it won’t open. All
your life you’ve tortured yourself and if

560
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:25,580
you don’t forgive now, you’ll have to
miss this great opportunity of getting your

561
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:30,430
self-realization.

562
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:37,290
Now take back your right hand on the back
side of your head and push back your head.

563
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:44,290
Here, without feeling guilty, without counting
your mistakes, just for your satisfaction,

564
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:53,810
you have to ask forgiveness from the all-pervading
Divine power of love. That we’ll do later

565
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:57,780
after closing eyes, but I’m just telling
you how to do it.

566
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:03,510
Now stretch your palm. This is the last center,
very important. Stretch your palm and put

567
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:10,150
the center of your palm on top of the fontanelle
bone area. Now please put down your head.

568
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:16,510
They forget this. Please put down your head
and push back your fingers as far as possible.

569
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:23,510
Just push back, so there’s a good pressure
on the scalp. Now please move your hand in

570
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:31,840
such a way that the scalp moves, clockwise,
seven times. Do it very slowly. Put down your

571
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:37,390
head, put down your heads. Please put down
your heads. You must put down your head otherwise

572
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:42,020
it doesn’t work out better. Put down your
head. Now push back your fingers. Pushing

573
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:47,480
back your fingers is important. Push back
your fingers outward, so that there’s a

574
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:54,480
pressure on the scalp. Now move it slowly
seven times, clockwise. Don’t hold your

575
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:09,730
head, push back your fingers. Please push
back your fingers. That’s it. That’s all

576
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:12,550
we have to do.

577
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:19,550
Now, again, we put our feet apart from each
other. Put the left hand on your left lap

578
01:20:24,830 --> 01:20:31,740
and put the right hand on the heart. Now please
close your eyes and please don’t open them

579
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:38,740
till I tell you. You can take out your spectacles,
if you like. Now when you put your hand on

580
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:50,520
your heart, you have to ask Me a question,
very fundamental question about yourself:

581
01:20:56,740 --> 01:21:03,740
You can call Me Mother, or Shri Mataji. Here,
you please ask Me a question, in your heart,

582
01:21:04,850 --> 01:21:11,850
three times. “Mother, am I the Spirit?”
Ask this question three times in your heart.

583
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:25,690
I’ve told you that if you become the Spirit,
you become your own master. So please take

584
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:36,170
your right hand in the upper portion of your
abdomen on the left-hand side and press it

585
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:43,170
hard and here you have to ask another fundamental
question about yourself. Three times, please

586
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:51,210
ask in your heart: “Mother, am I my own
master? Mother, am I my own master?”

587
01:21:58,730 --> 01:22:05,730
I have told you that I respect your freedom
so I cannot force pure, Divine knowledge on

588
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:14,550
you. You have to ask for it. So please take
your right hand in the lower portion of your

589
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:21,550
abdomen on the left-hand side and here you
have to say six times because this center

590
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:28,740
has got six petals. You have to ask, please
ask six times: “Mother, please give Me pure,

591
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:40,880
Divine knowledge.” As soon as you ask for
pure, Divine knowledge, Kundalini starts rising

592
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:57,400
upward. So we have to nourish our upper centers
with our full self-confidence.

593
01:23:00,830 --> 01:23:06,490
So now please raise your right hand in the
upper portion of your abdomen on the left

594
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:13,490
hand side and here you have to say ten times:
“Mother, I am my own master.” Please say

595
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:23,560
it ten times: “Mother, I am my own master.”
At the very outset I told you that you are

596
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:35,960
not this body, this mind, these emotions,
this intellect, these conditionings, this

597
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:42,960
ego, but you are the pure Spirit. So now raise
your right hand on top of your heart and here

598
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:54,540
please say twelve times with full self-confidence:
“Mother, I am the pure Spirit. Mother, I

599
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:15,460
am the pure Spirit.” This all-pervading
power of Divine love is the ocean of knowledge.

600
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:32,610
It is the ocean of blessings, it is the ocean
of compassion, but above all, it is the ocean

601
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:40,330
of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you might
commit will be completely dissolved by the

602
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:45,490
power of this ocean of forgiveness.

603
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:50,980
So please forgive yourself and put your right
hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

604
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:57,980
and turn your head to your right. Here you
have to say sixteen times: “Mother, I am

605
01:25:07,490 --> 01:25:08,490
not guilty at all.” Please say with full
self-confidence, sixteen times: “Mother,

606
01:25:08,490 --> 01:25:15,490
I am not guilty at all.” I have already
told you whether you forgive or don’t forgive,

607
01:25:23,070 --> 01:25:29,900
you don’t do anything. But if you don’t
forgive, then you play into wrong hands and

608
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:36,900
torture yourself. Specially at this time if
you do not forgive, this center of agnya won’t

609
01:25:38,210 --> 01:25:44,610
open and the Kundalini won’t be able to
break through. So I request you again and

610
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:47,040
again, just forgive everyone.

611
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:53,210
So now raise your right hand on top of your
forehead across and please put down your head.

612
01:25:53,210 --> 01:26:00,210
Here you have to say, from your heart, not
how many times: “Mother, I forgive everyone

613
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:11,170
in general.” Please say it from your heart.
Now without feeling guilty, without counting

614
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:27,450
mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you
have to ask forgiveness from the all-pervading

615
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:35,650
Divine power. So please take your right hand
back side of your head and push back your

616
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:43,340
head as far as possible. Here now you have
to say again from the heart, not how many

617
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:52,070
times: “Oh, Divine power, if I’ve done
anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly, please

618
01:26:57,420 --> 01:27:04,420
forgive me. Oh, Divine power, if I have done
anything wrong, knowingly or unknowingly,

619
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:18,120
please forgive me.”

620
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:25,720
Now the last center. Please stretch your palm
fully. Now carefully put the center of your

621
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:35,130
palm on top of the fontanelle bone area which
was a soft bone in your childhood. Now please

622
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:42,280
bend your head as much as you can. Now remember
to stretch back your fingers so there is a

623
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:49,280
good pressure on your scalp. Here again, I
respect your freedom. I cannot force self-realization

624
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:57,910
on you. So you have to say seven times, moving
the scalp seven times, you have to say: “Mother,

625
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:07,300
please give me my self-realization. Mother,
please give me my self-realization.” Now

626
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:14,300
move the scalp seven times clockwise slowly.
(Mother blows into the microphone.)

627
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:59,260
Now please take down your hand. Open your
eyes, slowly. Now please put both the hands

628
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:13,700
towards Me like this and try not to think.
Now bend your head and see with your left

629
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:29,310
hand, right hand towards Me, the left hand,
you feel if there is a hot or a cold breeze,

630
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:37,480
like vibrations, coming out of your fontanelle
bone area. Please put down your head. Now

631
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:42,800
please don’t put the hand on top but little
away. Some people get it further away. So

632
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:49,800
please move your hand and see for yourself
if there’s a cool or hot breeze, like vibrations,

633
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:55,980
coming out of your fontanelle bone area.

634
01:29:55,980 --> 01:30:02,840
Now if they’re not coming, you should say:
“Mother, please come through my head. Mother,

635
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:09,840
please come through my head.” Please say
thrice. Umm. Now please put the left hand

636
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:21,160
like this, and with the right hand try to
see if there’s a cool breeze or a hot breeze

637
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:28,400
like vibration coming from your fontanelle
bone area. Now if you have not forgiven you,

638
01:30:29,610 --> 01:30:36,610
or if are not yourself, or if you are not
forgiving others, it will be hot. But now

639
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:44,220
try to forgive. Forgive yourself and forgive
others. It will cool down, I’m sure it will

640
01:30:44,650 --> 01:30:45,730
cool down.

641
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:52,330
Now once more only, please put your right
hand towards me and again put down the head

642
01:30:52,330 --> 01:30:59,330
and with the left hand, please try to see
if there’s a cool or hot breeze like vibrations

643
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:09,270
coming out of your fontanelle bone area. This
is the actualization of baptism. This is what

644
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:20,260
is the Brahmarandhra Bheda that they call
it. Now it’s done. Don’t doubt. Now please

645
01:31:28,490 --> 01:31:35,490
raise both the hands towards the sky and push
back your head and ask any one of these questions,

646
01:31:36,970 --> 01:31:43,970
three questions, three times. First one is:
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the

647
01:31:45,730 --> 01:31:52,730
holy Ghost?” Or, you can ask: “Mother,
is this the all-pervading power of Divine

648
01:31:53,320 --> 01:32:00,320
love?” Or you can ask: “Mother, is this
the paramchaitanya or ruh?” Ask any one

649
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:05,550
of these questions three times.

650
01:32:05,550 --> 01:32:12,550
Take down your hands. Such cool is coming
from you to Me now. Now don’t doubt that

651
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:21,970
it’s air-conditioning or nothing is not:
air-conditioning is not in your head, is coming

652
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:28,970
out of your head. So don’t doubt yourself.
All those who have felt cool breeze or hot

653
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:38,700
breeze on your fingertips, on your palms or
through your fontanelle bone area, please

654
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:47,860
raise both your hands. Aah! All Americans
have got it! Aah!

655
01:32:58,010 --> 01:33:01,970
I bow to you, all saints. I bow to you. (To
one person) You didn’t feel, sir? What’s

656
01:33:01,970 --> 01:33:08,970
the matter with you? You didn’t feel it,
the cool breeze? No? You’re the only person.

657
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:21,860
Why? Just put your hands; it will work out.
Just put both the feet apart. Now? Are you

658
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:41,630
a doctor? [Mother asks a yogi to work on him.]
Anybody can see that. [I.e., see the vibrations,

659
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:55,250
Ed.] It’s all right. Now all those who have
not felt, are there any? One, two, three,

660
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:12,440
four. (This one, two. Three, four is not in
the cassette)
