1
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,600
So here we are in Finland and

2
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,460
that's... are begetting itself a little bit,

3
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,180
because is the end of land, you see, so

4
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,380
all the problems come and settle in the end, you see?

5
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,400
And that's how we've see here, there are lots of negative forces

6
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,880
that have been working very nicely,

7
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,880
and also there are so many seekers.

8
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,160
So it's more attraction for them to come here and attack the seekers.

9
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,680
So now when you take to Sahaja yoga, you have to know that

10
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,020
Sahaja yoga is like the light coming in your life.

11
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,240
And the light which comes

12
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,840
gradually shows you everything that you have.

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,140
For example, you are carrying the snake in your hand.

14
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,220
Somebody says, "Throw away the snake!" you see.

15
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,440
You are in the darkness, you think it's a rope.

16
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,580
So you don't want to throw away the snake.

17
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,940
But the light comes in, you see the snake in your hand,

18
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,800
you get afraid, you throw it away. You get afraid.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,420
And somebody might just run away, thinking that the snake has come

20
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,580
from Sahaja yoga.

21
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,980
So the people who come to Sahaja yoga also

22
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,600
will be like that. They'll come to Sahaja yoga,

23
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,720
and they will be upset about themselves,

24
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,940
"Oh god, you see, I am in this condition!"

25
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,980
And they will not like to face the reality, will run away.

26
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,580
So you have to be very patient with them. [I HAVE/AM?]

27
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,760
A little complication piece.

28
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,780
So if somebody is coming to Sahaja yoga, say,

29
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,100
he is coming from complete darkness, from complete ignorance,

30
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,840
you see. Maybe he's already half mad.

31
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,580
You will not know, what his mental condition is.

32
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,900
Maybe he is suffering from some sort of a horrible disease,

33
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,080
could be cancer, could be anything. Because

34
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,680
he would have been to gurus, this, that, there could be anything.

35
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,100
And maybe they are not suffering yet from that.

36
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Or they are suffering so well that they can't heal it.

37
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,420
So it's very complicated. So one should not - first of all -

38
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,960
Know, first principle of Sahaja yoga: "Never get disappointed!"

39
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,680
Never get disappointed!

40
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,840
Sometimes we have to work hard. I've worked on people

41
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,120
for twenty-four hours and I found they are good for nothing.

42
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,020
Just like stones. If I worked on stones, at least

43
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,560
I would have created the Ganesha out of them.

44
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,600
You find there is nothing, nothing has come out of that, all that

45
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,480
work of puja. So there is nothing to feel frustrated in Sahaja yoga.

46
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,660
It's our... whatever we have to do, we have to do,

47
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,760
we shouldn't worry about the fruits of it.

48
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,640
It's one of the main principles of Gita is: [INDIAN LANGUAGE]

49
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,080
Though the karma is there, but not to be thought. [INDIAN LANGUAGE]

50
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,760
"We should not worry about the fruits." And that's what it is.

51
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,980
So that will keep you on the right track.

52
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,140
Otherwise you may get frustrated. And I have known people,

53
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,300
how they have been breaking heads and... So one day I said,

54
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,560
"Why are you so much worried?" See, it happened in Boston. They said

55
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,760
"Mother, do You mean to say, 'All of them are going to go to hell'?"

56
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,320
I said, "I don't say that. But that's hope. [THAT'S GATE?]"

57
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,760
But I would say that at least you should not give up hopes.

58
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,740
Till the end we should try to save them.

59
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,260
And things would work out. And it has started working out there.

60
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,580
In the same way, we have to know that in the beginnig

61
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,720
you never get many sahaja yogis. Never, whatever you may try.

62
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,960
Even in India I started with one sahaja yogi.

63
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,940
Because we have to have a foundation, proper foundation, you have to

64
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,920
have proper. Also, Divine doesn't want us to have too many people.

65
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,100
Because there would be just useless people joining us.

66
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,040
So we have to know that first of all, we have to have solid, good

67
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,580
sahaja yogis. And those who call them for sahaja yogis have to build

68
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,300
up themselves in such a manner that they are very good sahaja yogis

69
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,880
and there are no catches, nothing. And their attention is good.

70
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,480
First ones they are established,

71
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,020
then we can build up the whole thing above them.

72
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,940
But otherwise it so happens that if the foundation is weak,

73
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,780
the whole building can go down.

74
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,580
So we have to have few sahaja yogis. We can't afford to have many.

75
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,320
Though you will see when I go - like deflected,

76
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,540
then thousands they will be there.

77
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,060
Everywhere. I mean it's not... Italy I went, Milano...

78
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,240
They have never seen my face, they have never known who I was.

79
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,900
But the all hall was full. I don't know how many thousands people.

80
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,820
And you had to just wait through it.

81
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,260
Everybody was so enthusiastic. I could see the future also.

82
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,720
So we got about ten people out of all that.

83
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:58,200
Then ten people more, ten more. That's how it started gathering.

84
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,980
Because since Sahaja yoga, you have to become [UNCLEAR].

85
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,660
Becoming is the problem. If you don't become something,

86
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,880
you are no good in the Sahaja yoga.

87
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,640
So, this is a very very big problem, should never get frustrated,

88
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,560
never get upset about it. If anybody says anything to you, after all

89
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,000
he is blind, so doesn't matter. Have pity on him and don't get angry

90
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,140
[ABOUT IT?]. There are maybe some fanatics, somethings, you see,

91
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,280
they are against Sahaja yoga naturally.

92
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,420
Because they are fanatics, they are not wanting reality.

93
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,180
So all such things will happen. You will have to show your patience

94
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,100
and a complete forbearance. That is very important.

95
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,260
Never become frustrated. Remember we have,

96
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,440
we should try to perfect it. The more you'll perfect it,

97
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,580
the better it will be for our basic things,

98
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,600
our foundation, which has to be very strong.

99
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,680
And once the foundation is strong, then you can go ahead with it.

100
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,940
But just now to begin with, you should not talk about Me much.

101
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,100
You just say, that, "She is the ordinary human being,

102
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,080
like person the most." If you don't want to tell lies, you can just

103
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,120
say that, "All right, She is all right, we shouldn't discuss that,

104
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,320
let us discuss something else. Let us know about science.

105
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,540
That's better. Then you see, then we know Her", like that, you see.

106
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,300
Just keep it for the further discovery.

107
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,780
If you go on making them understand that it is for their benevolence

108
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,060
or their own energy and their own maneuvering,

109
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,860
they should keep it to themselves, they will be happy.

110
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,000
And not to tell them about Me much.

111
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,460
And the miraculous things of Sahaja yoga should not be described

112
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,040
or talked. Like Heidrich talked to them about the photographs

113
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,980
with these two persons, but they have been doing Sahaja yoga.

114
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,360
But normally, never show them any miraculous photographs.

115
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,040
Because they will always say, "You have managed it and

116
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,620
you try to be with it sort of a... kind of a... maneuvering."

117
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,480
For that I would say that...

118
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,180
[ASIDE:] Smoke is not all right.

119
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,240
So, you should

120
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,200
limit yourself to some things. Like

121
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,340
telling about Sahaja yoga, about Kundalini, about all these things.

122
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,680
But about Me or about miraculous photographs

123
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,500
and all miraculous things you should not talk.

124
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,760
Keep it in a general way.

125
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,040
And also you shouldn't say, "It's a puja," and things like that.

126
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,900
Because very few people can come to puja, you know that.

127
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,200
So everybody need not know about puja, need not know about things.

128
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,780
But what you can tell them is that there are chakras,

129
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,620
they are to be cleaned out and they are to be kept in balance.

130
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,940
And we have to rise the Kundalini, how to rise the Kundalini,

131
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,320
also get advanced. And you say that, "Just now let's use Mother's

132
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,640
photograph for the time being. But later on, we are becoming, we are

133
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,100
free independent guru-beings first, then you don't have to use

134
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,760
Mother´s photographs." Then they'll never give up.

135
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,400
Isn't it? So, all they'll fight for it!

136
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,000
And thirdly, they are afraid of collectivity.

137
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,400
So you have to say that, "Because we are not collective, that's why

138
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,040
we are frightened, and if good people all collect together,

139
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,740
if righteous people..." Like that if you talk, they won't be afraid of.

140
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,960
You see, now, only the thugs combine with,

141
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,300
only the thieves combine. The good people don't combine.

142
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,760
So we have to combine good people. So then they will understand

143
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,980
that part, and they won't be angry. Otherwise,

144
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,060
if you say, "We have to have collectivity", they must be thinking,

145
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,040
"They are up to something." That will be the suspicion. It is always!

146
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,640
Because you'll, you only see that nobody combines for love. If they

147
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,880
combine together, they only combine for what you call, is the fight.

148
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,680
Or the hatred, or could be some sort of a sinister stuff, you see.

149
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,480
Otherwise they never combine. If you say, "We are for love,"

150
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,700
they'll tell, "Oh, we know this kind, the story we know, this love."

151
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,940
So if you have to really bring them round through discussion

152
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,000
and argument, you must, first of all, be very good to Sahaja yoga.

153
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,280
That means that, of course the knowledge of Sahaja yoga is too vast,

154
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,740
but you should be in such a mood and such a state and such

155
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,320
a personality, that they should see that there is something special

156
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,100
about this person. And then they will accept you much better.

157
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,940
All right? That's what we have to do and not to get frustrated.

158
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,820
It's a fun! It's just fun. That's all!

159
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,840
We don't get this, all right, we have other one. Doesn't matter!

160
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,940
And now I've been going to countries and countries and countries,

161
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,640
now I would say that first venue I went to, Italy,

162
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,600
- which is today is a great Sahaja yogi nation -

163
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,740
I stayed in a hotel, like this.

164
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,160
And Mr. Gavin had arranged to stay in a hotel and there was going to

165
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,900
be a press conference. And there a very huge meeting for which also

166
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,520
I paid for a big hall. Literally.

167
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:44,220
So where we were there, with me was Gregoire's first wife. Venda.

168
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,080
And they gave us the, of course, room and all that was nice,

169
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,940
and we stayed there. But when in the evening we went down,

170
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,580
not a single soul from the press and not a single cockroach even

171
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,160
for the meeting! And before that we got,

172
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,280
I for the things went out to do the postering!

173
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,440
And she was so worried that, "If catch us and something

174
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,720
will happen." I said, "Nobody going to catch you. [TAKE IT with Me?].

175
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,980
Just like we will do." I went and did all the postering, because

176
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,580
we were the only people there.

177
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,260
So this is how it is. Despite that, not a single soul, who came in.

178
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,300
Not a single soul. It's all right. This was fun, you see.

179
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,880
It happened that time, so I could tell you today to you to laugh.

180
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,720
So that is how. They'll real..., they'll realize it

181
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,800
later on in Sahaja yoga. Gradually they [THEY WILL BE KNOW]

182
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,280
[THAT FOR] they have been doing, how they were stupid. How they were.

183
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,560
And they'll enjoy it to themselves. So all humans are important

184
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,200
in Sahaja yoga. Very important. Because that gives a variety

185
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,180
and an interesting theme.

186
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,480
So everything has to be taken as fun.

187
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,480
I wish everybody could completely understand this,

188
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,380
and relax completely on this point. Never get frustrated.

189
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,620
If somebody is not all right, doesn't get vibrations,

190
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,740
you should just smile a little bit, "All right, next that will be."

191
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,500
All right? So may God bless you!
