1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,130
So we’ll have the experience now.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,240
It will take about five minutes

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,900
for you because if all the chakras are discussed

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,350
already the attention is on that.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,830
Is very simple to put your hands towards Me.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,070
Sahaja Yogi : Everyone steps out his shoes, will you ?

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,810
Shri Mataji : It’s better. [to the Sahaja Yogi].

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,880
You’ve done a good job Ah

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,830
Just put your hands towards Me.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,120
Just like this.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,360
[Shri Mataji takes vibrations of the audience]

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,940
Left.

13
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,810
Now, left hand towards Me and right hand towards the Mother Earth.

14
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,250
We’ll give you a balance. You need not close your eyes just now, let’s see.

15
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,080
Put your right hand towards the Mother Earth.

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,600
As I told you yesterday left side is our conditioning,

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,260
conditioning, subconscious and collective subconscious,

18
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,660
very much at work here.

19
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,110
But also is an emotional side.

20
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,860
Now put your right hand towards Me and left hand towards the sky.

21
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,870
Right hand towards Me, right hand towards Me like this.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,890
Sahaja Yogi : Put your left hand towards the back.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,460
Shri Mataji : Are you feeling the cool breeze in the hand?

24
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,060
You are already thoughtless, there’s no thought,

25
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,580
but just see if you are feeling the cool breeze.

26
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,060
Sahaja Yogi : It’s better [inaudible].

27
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,560
Shri Mataji : Much better

28
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,750
Are you?

29
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,060
Let’s see.

30
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,210
[Shri Mataji blows in the mike].

31
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
All right?

32
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,830
Are you feeling any cool breeze in the hand?

33
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,200
All right, now put your left hand on top of your head,

34
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,750
just here,

35
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,090
fontanel bone area.

36
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,350
Are you feeling?

37
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,760
It’s a very subtle thing.

38
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Are you?

39
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Pay attention.

40
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,430
Shri Mataji : [to the Sahaja Yogi]. Working out ; good?

41
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,060
All right. Now, change over.

42
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,880
See the left hand, with the right hand. Just pay attention there, see.

43
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,170
Believe that you are the Spirit.

44
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,930
So just you have to say in your heart: “I am the Spirit”, in your heart.

45
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,090
Say it seven times, it will work out.

46
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,790
Releasing.

47
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,470
Is it all right?

48
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,650
Are you feeling the heat coming out?

49
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,450
Little heat.

50
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,410
All right, now turn, change, see now.

51
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Right Swadhishthan.

52
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,050
All right?

53
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,300
Sahaja Yogi : Right Swadhishthan

54
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,330
Shri Mataji : Left [UNCLEAR]

55
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,670
[Shri Mataji washes her hands with water].

56
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,590
Now, just see, if it is working cool breeze…

57
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,090
[Shri Mataji blows in her hands].

58
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,000
Feel it. Just put your hands like this.

59
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,240
It’s good.

60
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,340
You are all thoughtless. If you see, there’s no thought in your mind.

61
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,140
And complete silence.

62
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,700
Enjoy this.

63
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,460
This moment is going to transform your life, take it from Me.

64
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,260
You may not realize today but you’ll realize it very soon.

65
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,340
Ah, strong.

66
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,130
Have faith in yourself, that’s the main thing.

67
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,020
It’s beautiful.
