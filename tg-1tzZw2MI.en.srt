1
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:42,824
Marriage is an auspicious occasion,

2
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:48,587
is the most auspicious occasion in the life of human beings.

3
00:00:49,126 --> 00:00:53,211
It is auspicious, that's why its joy giving

4
00:00:53,412 --> 00:00:56,562
and the vibrations flow

5
00:00:56,763 --> 00:01:00,483
with that auspiciousness all over the world.

6
00:01:00,684 --> 00:01:06,257
The joy of Sahaja Yogis today in England, London

7
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:09,465
should spread all over the world.

8
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:15,137
Marriage is meant to give joy,

9
00:01:15,544 --> 00:01:20,806
is meant to give cheerfulness, happiness

10
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:28,294
and all the blissful things that we can think of achieving

11
00:01:28,495 --> 00:01:38,548
through our combination with two human beings, we can say.

12
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:46,625
It's a very close and private relationship

13
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:49,788
which has to be respected.

14
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:55,554
It is not to be in any way dishonored

15
00:01:55,755 --> 00:02:00,012
or indiscreetly squandered away.

16
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,709
Those who cannot respect their partners in life

17
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,433
will never be respected anywhere else.

18
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,955
Those who ill-treat or in any way

19
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:20,222
try to spoil the image of their partners

20
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:23,256
are harming themselves.

21
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:27,407
Try to understand each other,

22
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:29,760
decorate each other,

23
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:34,619
not correction, but decorating. Like an ornament,

24
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,837
when added to a personality decorates that person,

25
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:43,041
in the same way, try to decorate another person.

26
00:02:43,242 --> 00:02:46,962
So the decorum and decency of life

27
00:02:47,163 --> 00:02:50,001
comes from this auspicious relationship.

28
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:52,658
That must be maintained.

29
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:56,622
Marriage is the bondage that keeps the society

30
00:02:56,823 --> 00:03:02,776
in its own beautiful bondage of Mother's grace.

31
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:11,654
Give up all your old ideas,

32
00:03:11,855 --> 00:03:19,921
all your so-called modern methods

33
00:03:20,122 --> 00:03:23,782
by which we have ruined our married lives.

34
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:29,263
If you cannot enjoy your own wife or your own husband,

35
00:03:29,464 --> 00:03:31,781
there's nothing in this world you can enjoy,

36
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:37,142
because the relationship is the most intimate and very sacred.

37
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:41,605
So you have to forget that you live independently,

38
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:48,169
now you live as one person, one personality,

39
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,922
supporting energy,

40
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:57,056
complimenting each other in complete concord.

41
00:03:57,257 --> 00:04:01,580
This creates that peace which we are talking about.

42
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:05,556
If the marriages are not successful of two persons,

43
00:04:05,757 --> 00:04:10,941
how do we expect the whole nation to live happily? Think of it.

44
00:04:11,142 --> 00:04:17,066
At this level, the seeds of peace are sown.

45
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:21,319
So we have to be sensible people, that's the main part of marriage is:

46
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,205
how far we are sensible about it.

47
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:29,920
It's easy to get into tantrums, get into tempers,

48
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:36,674
to get into some sort of an indecent, indiscreet habit.

49
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,809
But the person who is sensible

50
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,262
never crosses a certain limit of that decency.

51
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:47,588
Once you cross it, it is very easy to cross again.

52
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:51,245
That's what today when we read about Rama

53
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:54,550
is that He is a maryada purushottam.

54
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:57,852
Maryada is the boundary in which one has to remain.

55
00:04:58,053 --> 00:05:00,158
A woman has to remain in her boundary

56
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:03,422
and a man has to remain in his boundary.

57
00:05:03,623 --> 00:05:06,050
Now to think that the woman is dominated by man

58
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:07,944
or man is dominated by woman

59
00:05:08,145 --> 00:05:12,883
comes from a kind of a complex and this complex must be given up.

60
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:17,130
You are complimentary to each other.

61
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:19,259
You decorate each other.

62
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:25,249
Never talk ill of your husbands and never talk ill of your wives.

63
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:31,527
This is the key of having an exclusive married life.

64
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:35,073
If you start talking of each other to others,

65
00:05:35,274 --> 00:05:39,050
that exclusiveness, that trust is finished.

66
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:44,553
So you have to trust each other. The trust in God,

67
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:50,280
children imbibe when they start learning from their parents

68
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:53,102
how they trust each other.

69
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:57,637
So you are the nest where the tomorrow's great children

70
00:05:57,838 --> 00:06:00,203
are to be born,

71
00:06:00,404 --> 00:06:06,247
to be established and to grow as great saints.

72
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:10,771
So it is such a great occasion that nine marriages have taken place.

73
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:17,100
Nine is a very auspicious number for Me.

74
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:19,882
There are nine planets, there are Nava Durgas.

75
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,466
Nava Durgas are there.

76
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:29,565
Nava Durgas are the nine forms of Durga.

77
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:32,627
Nine forms of Mother.

78
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:35,722
And that is something so great today has happened.

79
00:06:35,923 --> 00:06:39,664
It's a very good day and all of you

80
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:43,389
should understand the value of Sahaja Yoga marriages.

81
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:48,308
You have to create a model marriage for all the English,

82
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,953
for all the Americans, Europeans and also Indians.

83
00:06:52,154 --> 00:06:54,337
Because Indians learn from you all these things.

84
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:56,483
If you have model marriages,

85
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:59,879
they will go in for model marriages also.

86
00:07:00,557 --> 00:07:05,499
So it is important for people who live in England

87
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:12,722
to understand the depth of this occasion

88
00:07:12,923 --> 00:07:18,397
and the esteem of what you mean

89
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:22,762
to the whole universe and to the peace.

90
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:27,954
The enjoyment is your own, is exclusive.

91
00:07:28,236 --> 00:07:32,702
But in Sahaja Yoga, it is so collective, you could see that.

92
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:37,476
It is so collective, you have so many brothers and sisters

93
00:07:37,677 --> 00:07:42,544
and we are all enjoying the joy of

94
00:07:42,745 --> 00:07:47,563
you couples who have joined together as husband and wife.

95
00:07:47,764 --> 00:07:51,287
So one has to understand that marriage

96
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:56,264
should not make you narrow minded or selfish

97
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:58,771
or in any way cut off from others.

98
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:03,710
All relationships are beautiful in their own forms.

99
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:09,248
Like you have brothers and sisters, you have mothers and fathers,

100
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:12,918
you've got Sahaja Yoga and you have got the children.

101
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:19,573
All in their own form should be given what they deserve,

102
00:08:19,774 --> 00:08:25,247
what they have to have, what the right thing is to be done.

103
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:37,748
Marriage gives you now a lever to be dharmic, to be moral.

104
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:45,985
This teaches you how to respect the chastity of others

105
00:08:46,186 --> 00:08:49,428
and your own chastity.

106
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,658
We have to teach ourselves.

107
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:56,009
You know how much damage has been already done

108
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,046
by having bad marriages, divorces.

109
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:03,033
We have to teach ourselves, we have to bear up a little bit,

110
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:07,553
we have to educate, re-educate and

111
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:12,101
improve ourselves and not to say that

112
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:16,029
"I am such and such, what can I do?"

113
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:22,129
You have to bring glory to the system of marriages

114
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,447
because it is the system established by God Almighty,

115
00:09:27,648 --> 00:09:30,345
is not established by human beings, is a wrong idea.

116
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:36,291
It is established by God Almighty to have an auspicious occasion

117
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,851
where such an auspicious thing is taken,

118
00:09:39,052 --> 00:09:42,770
the sacredness of this is to be maintained

119
00:09:42,971 --> 00:09:48,931
and has to be done in such a way it is a very decent relationship.

120
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:53,055
All the culture,

121
00:09:53,256 --> 00:09:58,123
all the beauty of gracious living

122
00:09:58,324 --> 00:10:02,119
flows through happy married life.

123
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,319
Not vulgar, not showing,

124
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,527
not cheap,

125
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:13,622
but a dignified, enjoyable, cheerful,

126
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:18,994
welcoming, giving companionship.

127
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:24,975
I am sure you all realize the importance of it

128
00:10:25,176 --> 00:10:30,707
and I am sure you all must have prepared yourself for this occasion.

129
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:36,416
And I would like to see among all of you,

130
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:44,603
who really shows the complete acceptance of your partners

131
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:49,324
as part and parcel of your being

132
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:54,626
and the graciousness with which you handle them.

133
00:10:54,983 --> 00:11:00,060
I bless you all. You are all saints and saints have married here.

134
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:02,845
All the angels and all celestial beings

135
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:05,393
must be singing praise of you.

136
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:10,080
So be careful and assume,

137
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:16,760
assume your positions as in Hindi language, we say biraji,

138
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:24,128
to assume that position in your full esteem and glory.

139
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:29,065
We all are with you all the time to help you to sustain

140
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:30,563
your relationships.

141
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:34,777
All of us must see that we sustain their relations,

142
00:11:34,978 --> 00:11:39,577
make them feel the sweetness of married life.

143
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:45,179
All the teasing, and all that should add up to their relationship

144
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,552
and the whole enjoyment of their companionship

145
00:11:49,753 --> 00:11:55,470
should flow to us as the ripples flow towards the shores

146
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:58,356
and again are repelled back into the ocean,

147
00:11:58,557 --> 00:12:02,849
in the same way, it should be such a give-and-take

148
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,879
and such a beautiful thing.

149
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:11,408
For that, the key of married life is purity.

150
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,651
Purity is the only way you can keep your married life

151
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:18,995
absolutely all right.

152
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:22,263
Whatever has happened in the past, just forget it.

153
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:24,317
Now starts the new life.

154
00:12:24,518 --> 00:12:30,078
After this, don't hide anything from your wife or from your husband.

155
00:12:30,838 --> 00:12:33,714
Everything must be told,

156
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:36,812
it should be straightforward life,

157
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:42,973
absolutely a straightforward life, extremely pure.

158
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:47,987
And this purity, everyday practiced

159
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:50,728
will be seen very soon in life,

160
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:56,042
that marriages always elevate a person.

161
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:59,593
But purity is the key of married life.

162
00:12:59,794 --> 00:13:02,580
And I hope you will remember those words.

163
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:06,615
Try to keep your mind pure.

164
00:13:06,816 --> 00:13:16,139
Do not suspect your wives, nor deceive, vice versa.

165
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:23,150
Keep a very straightforward relationship

166
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:28,105
and learn how to be that way, your children will learn from you

167
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:31,554
and there's no time taken now

168
00:13:31,755 --> 00:13:36,137
for the whole world to be transformed, once we learn this trust.

169
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:38,688
Not in money alone,

170
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:44,017
but in every way, a trust, a complete trust.

171
00:13:44,218 --> 00:13:48,565
As you trust yourself, you must trust the other,

172
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:51,766
who is not other anymore.

173
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,276
So those who have been married before, those who are married,

174
00:13:55,477 --> 00:13:59,674
who are going to get married, and those who are married today,

175
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:03,035
for all of them, I bless you

176
00:14:03,236 --> 00:14:11,569
with a very deep enjoyment of this understanding,

177
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,969
the joy of your purity,

178
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:21,981
the beauty should flow all your lives, eternally.
