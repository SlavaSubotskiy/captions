00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:05,041
Easter Puja. Istanbul - Turkey
22 April 2001.

2
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:20,083
Today we have gathered here

3
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:25,542
to do the puja of Easter.

4
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:31,458
In the history of spirituality,

5
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,333
it is one of the greatest days

6
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:41,500
when we find Christ rose from the dead.

7
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,166
It is very significant and symbolic

8
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,458
that in Sahaja Yoga, also

9
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,250
what we have done,

10
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,333
is to rise from the dead – into life.

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500
It is to be understood

12
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:07,083
that resurrection is the message for all of us,

13
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,542
for the whole world.

14
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,291
We have to resurrect ourselves.

15
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:20,417
There was no need for Jesus to do that.

16
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:25,208
But He was a model, model of a saint,

17
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:28,208
model of a realised soul,

18
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:32,375
model of a person who came all the way

19
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,625
from the heavens to save us.

20
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,125
So this resurrection is also

21
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,125
part and parcel of our lives.

22
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:47,083
It is so symbolic, so very symbolic,

23
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,125
that we were,

24
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:56,083
in our consciousness, lost people.

25
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,083
We had no control over ourselves

26
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:04,041
as to know the way our mind told us to go.

27
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,083
We had no balance with the mind

28
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,208
and our physical being,

29
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:13,083
no more balance of any kind in life

30
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,250
and used to go at random,

31
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,166
whichever way we thought was good.

32
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,250
There was no wisdom about it.

33
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:28,250
As it is, Jesus was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha.

34
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:33,083
It’s a very difficult task He has performed.

35
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,250
He used to convince people

36
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:39,041
who were absolutely ignorant about spirituality,

37
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:44,166
who just knew about money and nothing else.

38
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,041
He came in those days

39
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:53,041
when people had no idea about spirituality at all, at all.

40
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:56,041
But, somehow,

41
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,125
it all worked out

42
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,083
in such a beautiful manner

43
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:05,125
that people have started understanding

44
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:10,250
that He communicated that resurrection is the important point.

45
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,083
He knew when the resurrection takes place,

46
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,125
the kundalini rises

47
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:22,125
and connects you to the Divine Power, which is all-pervading.

48
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,125
Then you start understanding

49
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,166
that there’s a life beyond

50
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,041
the life that you have made.

51
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,208
There’s another type of life,

52
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:38,208
a higher type of life, which connects you to the Divine Power.

53
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,250
And then this Divine Power gives you the Absolute Truth.

54
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:48,125
If you grow more and more,

55
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,041
you will know Absolute Truth

56
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,125
because so far you don’t know.

57
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,166
So we have been doing wrong things,

58
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,166
doing in the wrong way, getting lost.

59
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,208
Also with listening to people who were just boasting

60
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,041
and were saying they know about the Truth.

61
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,041
But when you yourself discover the Truth,

62
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,083
you are a different person.

63
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:17,000
You discovery is so innate and so real

64
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:20,041
that you discard all that is unreal.

65
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,083
Very easily you can discard it

66
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:26,041
and you don’t find it difficult to get rid of it.

67
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:32,041
In this conference, as you know, we have more of Muslim people,

68
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:38,041
Islamic people, who have been so much misguided all over the world.

69
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:41,166
They have been told all kinds of stories

70
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:45,041
and hatred among people or others.

71
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,041
This Islamic bhoots

72
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,125
is going from bad to worse

73
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,041
and people want to believe in it.

74
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,083
Especially in my country there’s a very, very big problem

75
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:01,125
with these Islamic influence

76
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,041
because they are nowhere near Islam

77
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,166
and nothing to do with Mohammed-sahib,

78
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,333
but they are thinking

79
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,250
that they’re correct and what they’re doing is correct.

80
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:17,166
They’re trying to spread Muslim religion.

81
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,166
What’s the use? What’s the purpose? I can’t understand.

82
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,250
Unless and until you get your realisation,

83
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:28,041
you are a useless human being, good for nothing.

84
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:31,166
You can hate others, you can beat others,

85
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,250
you can kill others and it’s going on all over the place.

86
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,250
Surprising thing that all this nonsense is going on

87
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,083
everywhere in the world in the name of Mohammed-sahib.

88
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:48,166
So in one shot, one side you put Christ

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,208
for another crucifixion,

90
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,125
on the other side Mohammed-sahib for his crucifixion.

91
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,041
They cannot fight, you see.

92
00:05:56,125 --> 00:06:02,041
They’re on the same line. They’re on the same understanding.

93
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,041
How can they fight if

94
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,083
their disciples are fighting so badly  all over

95
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,041
that sometimes it really brings you,

96
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:15,041
when you only hear about how people are fighting for nonsense.

97
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:25,125
In His life, Christ did not marry.

98
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,041
He did not and He never needed also.

99
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,041
He did not marry.

100
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:36,166
And at a very young age He was crucified.

101
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:42,125
That crucifixion shows that He was not afraid of death

102
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:46,000
and He knew that He would resurrect.

103
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:50,083
This He had to do through the Agnya Chakra.

104
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,208
Agnya Chakra is, as you know, is very constricted.

105
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:56,083
And through that constriction He had to go through,

106
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:59,166
for which He had to get killed.

107
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:04,041
And He accepted that. He accepted

108
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:10,041
with full heart that that’s the ordeal He has to go through.

109
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,250
In the same way, your Sahasrara

110
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,041
can be only achieved through the Agnya

111
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,125
and the Agnya has to be opened.

112
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:23,041
But for that, you don’t have to get hanged,

113
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,041
you don’t have to be crucified,

114
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:30,041
but you have to crucify your ego.

115
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,125
The first point is ego.

116
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:37,166
We have such ego that you cannot get rid of it.

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,208
We have subtle and subtle ways of having egos

118
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:45,041
like “I have come from this country, I must have ego,”

119
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:49,041
“I come from this kind of family, I must have ego.”

120
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,041
All kinds of stupid things they do,

121
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,208
which are really sinful and they think

122
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,291
they’re very great if they have ego.

123
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,041
This ego, you have to fight,

124
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:03,083
otherwise your resurrection is not possible,

125
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:09,041
your attention cannot pass through the Agnya Chakra.

126
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,250
As long as they have given us satanic identifications,

127
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:16,083
it will not work out. It’s a very subtle happening

128
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:21,208
— very, very subtle happening — that you should see your own ego.

129
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:25,041
After Realisation I said, 'You know yourself.’

130
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,250
The first thing you will know is that you have too much of

131
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,125
conditioning and too much of ego.

132
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,041
Like in India, I find people have so much conditioning

133
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:40,166
of their so-called rituals — very ritualistic.

134
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:45,083
Everything is a ritual with them and they cannot get out of it.

135
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,166
That’s all the conditioning is,

136
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:51,166
but ego is the worst part in the West, more in the West,

137
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,041
where I don’t know what they think of themselves.

138
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,000
In that ego they get lost.

139
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,250
And they cannot see what’s wrong with them,

140
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,250
with their own community, with their own people,

141
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,041
who claim to be such and such a thing.

142
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:11,125
So this ego has really dominated so much.

143
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:17,000
So far in the history, so many countries, nations, have been

144
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,333
really tortured and butchered because of the ego of some people.

145
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:27,041
Once they will realise

146
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,250
how horrible they have been, how satanic they have been,

147
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,166
how aggressive they have been, they’ll give it up.

148
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,250
But they have to realise and, for that, I said,

149
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,291
'You have to have your resurrection.’

150
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,166
Without the resurrection, you will not know at all,

151
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,166
you’ll not be conscious of what wrong you have been doing.

152
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:52,250
It is very, very surprising how people go on doing wrong things,

153
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,166
advertise them and come out as egos.

154
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:01,000
When I read the newspapers, I say,

155
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,125
'They’re all stupid people all around.’

156
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,250
— absolutely very, very

157
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,166
stupid in the sense that they have no understanding

158
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,166
of what they are doing. They are just killing people,

159
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:21,041
enjoying the killing and they’re so violent it is impossible

160
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:25,250
to understand what sort of life they are going to have

161
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,083
after death – even before death.

162
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,250
In this whole thing, you see the whole picture of the world.

163
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:37,083
You’ll find all such countries who are still fighting for nonsense

164
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,166
are very, very poor,

165
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,041
are having very bad time

166
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:47,166
and they are about to be completely finished.

167
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,125
But they don’t want to see why they are suffering,

168
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,250
why what’s happening, what is the problem.

169
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:58,125
In the countries where there are affluence, lots of affluence,

170
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:04,125
they also got lost. They too need resurrection.

171
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,083
They have to rise above materialism

172
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,166
and see for themselves what they’re doing is wrong.

173
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,250
They are like, actually, cheats.

174
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,250
They are cheating the society all the time.

175
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,041
I think the whole economics is based

176
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:24,041
on cheating, how you can cheat people. And in that cheating,

177
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,333
you don’t even realise that you are doing something

178
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,166
to make people so insecure.

179
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:36,000
So this money business, also, is such that

180
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,166
it makes you very greedy and you start giving too much importance to money.

181
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:48,041
This is one thing to be understood from the life of Christ.

182
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:54,250
He was a very simple, poor man, son of a carpenter.

183
00:11:56,083 --> 00:12:01,041
And to Him, money was nothing but an absolutely useless thing.

184
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,250
To Him, Spirit was everything.

185
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,333
And He was preaching and telling people

186
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:10,375
that You must have spiritual awakening. Very important.

187
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:14,000
Try to understand that there is life

188
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,208
beyond all this and then you should get

189
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:23,166
the best results out of this life,

190
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,250
which you are just wasting.’

191
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,250
He was so intelligent and

192
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:34,000
the way He discussed with all those great fathers from the Church

193
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,166
about the religion and all that,

194
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,458
it’s amazing how a little boy

195
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:44,041
could understand so deeply about religion.

196
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:48,333
He was a small boy at that time, no doubt,

197
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:55,041
but He was a person from the Divine, created by the Divine.

198
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:59,333
He was Shri Ganesha. He’s Aum. He’s knowledge, everything.

199
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,333
Despite that, nobody people recognised Him

200
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,333
because they cannot recognise the Truth.

201
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,166
They cannot understand the Truth.

202
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:14,000
They are so stupid that they can only

203
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:17,208
take to something that is falsehood, that is bad.

204
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,333
And ultimately they crucified Him.

205
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:25,041
This is a funny world where saints are crucified

206
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,000
and the devils are given so much importance.

207
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,375
But now the time has come

208
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:36,166
for all these people who are doing wrong,

209
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:41,041
who are trying to strangle others, will be strangled.

210
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:46,166
They will be all exposed.I’ve told you this is the year of exposure.

211
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:50,333
They’ll be all exposed if they are doing all such things

212
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,208
of aggression and of greed.

213
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:57,041
All their greed will be completely exposed

214
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,083
and they will be thrown into hell.

215
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:03,041
This is what I felt for this year especially.

216
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:07,333
This has to happen, so best thing is to take to your resurrection,

217
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:11,208
take to your higher life

218
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,041
and see for yourself 'What are you doing?’

219
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,333
What is the greatest thing to have?

220
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:21,166
Money? Power? It doesn’t help anyone.

221
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,125
People don’t have great name with that.

222
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,250
Nobody remembers anybody who’s a drunkard.

223
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,208
They don’t have statues of the drunkard people.

224
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:37,041
So who achieves something higher?

225
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:42,375
Who achieves great name like Christ?

226
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:46,250
Those who have sacrificed their lives

227
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:51,125
for the betterment of humanity, for helping them.

228
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,291
Why did they do it?

229
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,166
Because they loved human beings.

230
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,041
They loved human being.

231
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:04,041
When you love others, then you start thinking about

232
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,291
‘what is the best, what can you do the best for them?’

233
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,166
Now there are parents who are ignorant.

234
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:14,166
They don’t know what to do for their children,

235
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:20,333
so they try to dazzle the children  with

236
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,333
lots of things and food and this and that.

237
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:28,041
But children, if they are not brought up with love,

238
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:32,333
they’ll have no consideration whatsoever.They’ll go astray.

239
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,333
But, in case they know somebody loves,

240
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,458
for that love’s sake they will not go astray.

241
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,250
They will not do wrong things.

242
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,417
So the greatest thing about

243
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:49,208
Christ or anyone of these great people is that they loved.

244
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:54,125
They loved the people. They loved all human beings.

245
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,291
That is what we have to do.

246
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,333
Do we love ourselves, only our families,

247
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:06,166
only our country? Or [do] we love the whole world?

248
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:12,166
Do we live for the whole world or we live only for our limited circles.

249
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:16,041
We should find out 'What are our aspirations?

250
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:20,291
What are our desires? What do we want to have?’

251
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:25,125
If you are really thinking of other people

252
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,333
as your own, with love,

253
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:34,166
it’s so joy giving. You may have any amount of ornaments,

254
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:38,166
may have any amount of houses, any property, any money,

255
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,166
you may have any power,

256
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,041
you might be the prime minister of this

257
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,125
or the prime minister of another,

258
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:48,375
but if you have no love for others,

259
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,333
you cannot enjoy yourself.

260
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:54,125
Your enjoyment only comes through love,

261
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,375
that your capacity to love.

262
00:16:57,166 --> 00:17:00,041
There’s no other way you can enjoy yourself.

263
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,375
You may have television, you may have music

264
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,208
you may go for dinner parties, everything,

265
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,250
but still nothing penetrates.

266
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:14,166
Nothing is there to give you real joy.

267
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,333
That’s what Christ has taught us,

268
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
that He had love for all the human beings

269
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:24,333
and He wanted to prepare them for the Resurrection.

270
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:28,375
He came before Sahaja Yoga came in.

271
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,333
If He had not done that job,

272
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:36,041
it would have been difficult for Me to achieve it.

273
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,166
So He had prepared the stage for Sahaja Yoga.

274
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,041
That now your Agnyas are opened

275
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,250
and through the Agnya you can take the kundalini upward

276
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:53,417
through the Sahasrara and open the fontanel bone area.

277
00:17:54,166 --> 00:18:00,166
All this He thought of was a part and parcel of His love for people.

278
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:04,125
And that’s what He did. And He cared for so many people.

279
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,041
He’s such a help to us in Sahaja Yoga.

280
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,083
Without Him, I don’t know

281
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,166
how could I have really broken the Agnya Chakra.

282
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,083
Because, as you know, Agnya is such a horrible thing.

283
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,500
People go on doing wrong things through Agnya

284
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,291
and they never feel bad about it,

285
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,250
never think they have done anything wrong,

286
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,500
they have harmed anyone, they have tortured anybody

287
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,417
or they have made others cry.

288
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:36,333
They go on with their Agnya, but they have no heart

289
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,291
to feel what they have been up to.

290
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:44,083
It’s Christ only. He shows us that you break your Agnya,

291
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,333
pass through your Agnya.

292
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Here they call it as a third eye.

293
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,333
The other day one lady came with a magazine of 'Third Eye’

294
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,208
and when I told her what it is she was surprised.

295
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,333
If your third eye is to be opened means

296
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:01,291
Christ is to be awakened within you, on your Agnya.

297
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,166
That’s the third eye. Now what He does by —

298
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,125
He creates a witness state within you.

299
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,291
You become the witness of the whole drama.

300
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,166
You start seeing the whole drama

301
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:18,333
and you are amazed how you are silent,

302
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,041
thoughtlessly aware

303
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,250
and how you are seeing everything without reacting.

304
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,208
This is where we have to believe that Christ has taken

305
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,333
His form in our Agnya.

306
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,166
His birth is there.

307
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,166
His resurrection is there,

308
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,333
all that we have got it already worked out.

309
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:44,041
Like a machinery, the whole being’s made

310
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,250
and we have different, different chakras and centres.

311
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:50,166
This is the last, most difficult centre,

312
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:56,333
which was really opened out by Jesus Christ.

313
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:01,125
He’s the one who dared it and who did it so beautifully

314
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:06,083
that we too have now capacity to look at our ego,

315
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,083
to see for ourselves, ‡What are we doing?

316
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:13,208
Why do we think we are something very exceptional?’

317
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,083
Once you start seeing the ego, you will be amazed.

318
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,166
Whatever work you may do, whatever you may do, you’ll never be tired

319
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,041
We get tired because all the time ego is saying,

320
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,083
'Oh, you are so great.

321
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,125
You are doing so much work for others.

322
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,041
You have achieved so much,’ all that.

323
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:37,125
So then the ego goes on all the time

324
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:41,208
pointing out all this false greatness about us

325
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:45,125
and we get tired that 'We are so great and why should we work?

326
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,041
Why should we help others?’

327
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:51,375
Like that, funny ideas start falling in our mind

328
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:56,166
and what we do is that we feel very tired out.

329
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,208
Fighting with those ideas, we feel very tired.

330
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,250
Now, our whole situation

331
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:08,291
is made much simpler by the life of Christ.

332
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,041
But look at the Christian nations. They are juxtaposition.

333
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:17,333
They are on the other side of Christ’s teachings.

334
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,041
They are the most aggressive countries.

335
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,333
They aggress people so much

336
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:28,250
that in the whole world they are regarded as something

337
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:33,041
very great and like they’re the kings or something.

338
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:37,041
I know this because we were in slavery in India

339
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:41,417
and I was surprised that these people came from outside

340
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,041
and were nicely become master.

341
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:48,291
They were masters and used to treat us so badly,

342
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:53,041
used to really make slaves out of us.

343
00:21:54,041 --> 00:22:00,250
So the slavery started and then all such things started in India,

344
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,333
as well as abroad.

345
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,041
Everywhere people started thinking

346
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,250
that they are great – and they were Christians.

347
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:12,041
They used to go to church and from the church what did you learn?

348
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,041
How to dominate others, how to show them down,

349
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,333
how to take away all that belongs

350
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:23,333
to the poorer people or to the less stronger people.

351
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,125
It’s a thing we have seen ourselves.

352
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:32,375
So this happens to people who have this ego, very, very powerful.

353
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,375
And they try to take over

354
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,166
things that belong to other countries.

355
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,166
What right have they got to take somebody’s country,

356
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,250
I can’t understand.

357
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:50,375
All these complications are there.

358
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:54,208
In the modern time they’re the worst.

359
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:57,291
It was never so bad as it is today.

360
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:03,041
We had Hitler. We had people of that kind once in a while.

361
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:06,125
But the whole world was together on one side.

362
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,208
Nobody was confused.

363
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:14,041
Nobody knew that we have to fight all the time.

364
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:17,333
Now, maybe because of newspapers, I don’t know why,

365
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:21,125
nobody knows which side is correct, which is not correct.

366
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:24,333
It’s being such a dispute about everything

367
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:28,166
and people don’t try to understand the reality of the problem.

368
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,417
And they’re killing left and right all kinds of people.

369
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,166
It is very surprising how,

370
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:39,083
in this world, human beings are killing

371
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,208
each other much more than the animals do.

372
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:46,333
We are the worst, worse than the animals,

373
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:54,166
that we are killing ourselves, our own clan, our own people.

374
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,333
In India also we are surprised how

375
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:01,041
they are killing — Kashmiris are killing Kashmiris.

376
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,291
In the same way, everywhere you go, you find

377
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:08,333
they are fighting among themselves.

378
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
If you go to Africa, you will be surprised how

379
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,333
they are fighting among themselves.

380
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:17,166
I mean, now the principle of fighting has come up very strong

381
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:21,291
and people think fighting is a very important part of human beings.

382
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:25,166
Anything you say, immediately fighting will start.

383
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:29,333
Now look at Christ and His life.

384
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:33,250
He didn’t fight anyone. He didn’t argue with anyone

385
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:39,166
and He accepted, accepted the death on the cross.

386
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:43,125
He accepted it because He knew

387
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,250
that it is for the resurrection,

388
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:48,375
for not only His, [but] for the resurrection of the whole world.

389
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:51,291
And this is what we have to learn.

390
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:54,333
We have to be the models of resurrection.

391
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:57,166
We see all these things happening.

392
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,333
We’re upset also about it

393
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:03,166
and when after Realisation

394
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:06,333
people see that surroundings are full of this,

395
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,333
their own people are like this, they start fighting

396
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:13,250
for nothing at all and they realise

397
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:17,125
that 'These are my own people who are doing this nonsense.’

398
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:19,333
You can’t correct it. You can’t do anything.

399
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:25,083
But if your Agnya is clear, if your ego is finished,

400
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:31,417
if there is no domination of any kind in your mind

401
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:35,083
– and also [if] your conditioning is finished,

402
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:40,041
then you become the channel of creating peace.

403
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:45,041
You are the one, wherever you are, you can create peace.

404
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:50,041
This is something, a special thing for Sahaja Yogis to know,

405
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:54,291
that if you have no Agnya, you may look like you are suffering,

406
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:57,333
but you are not. You are doing it for others,

407
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:02,333
for surroundings, for your friends, for your neighbours,

408
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:05,333
you can say for your countrymen, for all of them.

409
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,250
When you have no Agnya

410
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:13,333
you become such a big source of Divine Force

411
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:16,041
that it can work out anything.

412
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,208
It can change, transform people.

413
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:25,250
It can happen like that and

414
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:28,417
it has happened to many people before, individually.

415
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:33,125
But now collectively I’m sure all this anger,

416
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,166
all this temperament of aggression

417
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,333
and all these challenges

418
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:43,083
from all these nasty people can be brought to an end.

419
00:26:43,417 --> 00:26:47,041
With the people who have no ego,

420
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:52,125
with the people who are not justifying their wrong things,

421
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:59,166
with the people who have a clear cut idea as to what is the Truth.

422
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:03,250
They may speak. They may not speak. It makes no difference.

423
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:07,166
Whatever they are, but they are such a big shield

424
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,125
against those aggressive forces,

425
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,375
which are ruining the peace of the world.

426
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:15,375
So Christ did it for the peace,

427
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:18,166
to bring peace on this Earth.

428
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:21,333
It’s very important there should be peace,

429
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:24,333
but if there is no peace within, how can you have peace outside.

430
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,291
It’s very surprising how so many countries

431
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:32,333
who talk of peace are engaged in wars and fighting.

432
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:34,250
How can you have like that?

433
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:37,250
They have no solution. They don’t understand.

434
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:44,125
The only solution I find is to transform them in Sahaja Yoga.

435
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,333
That’s the only one.

436
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:48,041
You have to take out their ego.

437
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,000
You can see in many people, it resists.

438
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,291
It is there and working.

439
00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:58,000
This ego is a very, very dangerous thing people have.

440
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,208
So this one was the one

441
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:07,041
which was really handled by Jesus.

442
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:11,375
He tried to neutralise your ego.

443
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:20,333
He tried to take out the problems of the ego

444
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,291
to make you a humble, mild personality.

445
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:28,041
To say that a humble and mild person

446
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:32,166
is always intra [into] danger is a wrong thing to say.

447
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:38,166
See them. When the people are aggressive

448
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,125
and people are trying to dominate,

449
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:46,375
the humble man is the winner, not the one who dominates.

450
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:54,041
So main thing is now to watch out for

451
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,375
your Mr. Ego, how it works. It’s very interesting,

452
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:01,375
very interesting to see how it makes a drama.

453
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,166
how it tries to cover up things,

454
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:08,208
how he tries to show that you are superior to others.

455
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:12,333
It is to be seen. It is to be seen very clearly

456
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:16,166
what this Agnya is up to.

457
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:20,458
It’s a very, very mischievous thing,

458
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:25,041
very harmful thing and most embarrassing also.

459
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:28,125
So these egoistical people are

460
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:31,333
like that and ultimately they become nervous people

461
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:35,333
— very nervous and think no end of themselves.

462
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,041
First they try to control others.

463
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,208
But then they are needed to be controlled. They are like that

464
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:47,458
because they are all the time trying to control others

465
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:50,250
and they don’t know how to control themselves.

466
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,291
Who is the child crying so much?

467
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:58,375
Why is he crying?

468
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:10,458
Must be something wrong.

469
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:17,166
Normally children keep very quiet in my lecture.

470
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:34,250
Now this ego is also like this child.

471
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,250
It doesn’t hear anything, doesn’t understand anything.

472
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:41,500
It just goes on disturbing everything.

473
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,417
In the same way, our ego also behaves,

474
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:48,125
without having any collective knowledge, without having

475
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:51,375
'What are you up to? What you are doing?

476
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:55,542
Who, are you harming?’ — nothing, just a satisfaction,

477
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:59,375
such a blind satisfaction that you are doing something

478
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:01,333
to assert your personality.

479
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:05,125
You see, if you just watch your ego, you’ll laugh

480
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:08,375
and enjoy the buffoon, you’ll see what a thing it is.

481
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:10,458
‘It has been befooling me so much,

482
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:14,500
what a horrible thing this ego was.’

483
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,250
At the time when Christ was there,

484
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,500
the people have such a lot of ego.

485
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:23,000
Nobody talked about it. Nobody said anything.

486
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,083
So this was the best way that He could show us

487
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:31,542
that you can break your Agnya by sacrificing your life

488
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:34,166
— not in Sahaja Yoga, not in Sahaj Yoga.

489
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:37,041
But in a way, in Sahaja Yoga also,

490
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:41,375
if you have an ego you should first of all the witness state.

491
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:44,542
It’s the other way round. If you have ego,

492
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:48,333
you cannot have witness state. If you cannot have witness state,

493
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:53,417
you can have improve your ego. It’s a very confusing thing.

494
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,041
Now supposing you develop a very big ego,

495
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,542
then you go on justifying it all the time.

496
00:32:02,542 --> 00:32:04,667
You think, ‘Whatever I have done is good. After all,

497
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:08,291
it’s very good for everyone, good for me.’

498
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,542
Self certification starts.

499
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:13,250
With that, you can never see

500
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:15,458
what you are doing to yourself,

501
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:17,417
what you are doing to others.

502
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:21,208
It’s something, such a blind-folded nonsense.

503
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:25,417
When this ego comes up in that way,

504
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:30,667
then, I mean, we can have Hitlers, we can have all kinds of things.

505
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:35,417
Any small point they take and form a group of people

506
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:38,500
doing this kind of thing – anything.

507
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:42,500
They will say that ‘Now, we are people who are spiritual.

508
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:46,000
So we have a group and we are spiritual people

509
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,458
and whatever we do is the right.’

510
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:54,208
But who says it is right? By what law is it right?

511
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:58,083
And we have had so many cults and this like that,

512
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,417
everywhere, where people joined them, kill themselves,

513
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:05,583
had all kinds of problems. How can that be spiritual?

514
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:10,250
In spirituality the first and foremost thing is

515
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,291
that the person becomes very meek, very humble,

516
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:22,041
very humble. His heart — humility is the power.

517
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:25,500
His humility is the one that works

518
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:29,625
and his humility is the one that glorifies.

519
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:32,417
It is not the aggression.

520
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:37,208
See, Hitler came and died. Who worships him?

521
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:42,083
Others also came. Like Mussolini came, died. Who worships?

522
00:33:42,709 --> 00:33:45,667
There are so many like that who came and went away.

523
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:51,166
They don’t even want to have their statue, so bad as they were.

524
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:56,458
So those who have this ego are really very stupid people

525
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,375
in the sense that they do all wrong,

526
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:01,458
thinking it is the right thing to do.

527
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:05,667
Ultimately, they are recognised as absolutely

528
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:09,542
very, very wrong type of people.

529
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:13,291
People don’t want to take their names even.

530
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:18,417
So the time can prove what are they and what they’re doing.

531
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:25,291
It’s a very, very calculated work of the Divine.

532
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:29,542
You shouldn’t play into the hands of their ego.

533
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:33,375
Try to see yourself. ‘Oh, Mr Ego, so you are there.’

534
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:39,125
Try to watch. And that time, if you take the name of Jesus,

535
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,000
ego will go away. Just say

536
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:50,333
the mantra of Jesus and ego will disappear.

537
00:34:53,291 --> 00:35:00,375
Another side of this horrible ego is the conditioning.

538
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:05,291
That also has a very, very, very subtle —

539
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
for example, supposing if somebody comes to your house

540
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:16,542
and starts saying that ‘Ah, what a dirty carpet.

541
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:20,166
I don’t like this colour. That thing I don’t like’

542
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:23,583
without understanding that you are hurting another person.

543
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,542
Talking like that, he comes inside.

544
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:32,208
And then, you see how stupid he has been

545
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:36,208
because nobody likes such a person who is talking like that.

546
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,250
But to him, it is very important

547
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:43,500
that he should correct because he has a conditioning

548
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:47,125
that a particular type of carpet is good

549
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:51,208
and another is not. That conditioning works.

550
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:53,375
And he goes on talking nonsense

551
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:55,583
that ‘This is not good, that is not good.’

552
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:57,458
You cannot enjoy anything.

553
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,417
You cannot enjoy anything.

554
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,041
You go to any home, you don’t like it because there’s conditioning.

555
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:07,166
You know of something else which is good.

556
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:10,083
No – so they can’t enjoy.

557
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:14,417
Everything they decide on their conditioning.

558
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:16,583
[There] Is nothing independent.

559
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:21,250
It has nothing to do with the intrinsic personality.

560
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:24,458
Intrinsic value of that thing.

561
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:29,375
Just like that, 'Oh, I don’t like it.’ It’s not good.

562
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:32,667
It should not be said by Sahaja Yogis.

563
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,125
Never use this word.

564
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:38,417
You can find out from Me. I never do that.

565
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,291
Whatever it is I say, it’s all right.

566
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,458
I never criticize it.

567
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:48,625
This criticism business comes from this conditioning

568
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,125
because you have had such conditioning.

569
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:54,333
Supposing you are an Englishman you have English conditioning.

570
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:59,583
Now, correction comes.

571
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:04,333
Their cows got this disease.

572
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:08,625
How did they get the disease when you are such perfect people?

573
00:37:10,417 --> 00:37:14,375
Then in Europe the animals got one disease.

574
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:16,250
How is it they got

575
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:20,417
this disease when you think you are the cleanest people living ever?

576
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,417
Just watch out why?

577
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:26,291
It’s all their own conditioning

578
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:30,667
that ‘We know everything. We are the best in the whole world

579
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:35,041
and we have a right to rule everyone.’ Now have it.

580
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:39,625
Now those who are very rich people, like America and all that,

581
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:43,083
used to think no end of themselves.

582
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:45,125
Now what has happened?

583
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:50,625
Suddenly it has become a country where everybody has to pity.

584
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,208
Why? What is the reason? Why suddenly it has happened?

585
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:58,166
It’s always the nature which corrects you

586
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,625
by giving the other side of it.

587
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:04,250
Anything you try to boast of

588
00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:07,542
or you try to put your conditioning of others, you keep it

589
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,458
it comes up.

590
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:14,583
It works in such a great manner that you can’t imagine.

591
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:19,125
And then it does not work out,

592
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:24,250
then there are earthquakes. All kinds of calamities come.

593
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:29,166
There were a group of people who were white-skinned

594
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:35,500
near the River Mississippi and they were called as rednecks

595
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:39,041
because it was always hot, their necks were always hot,

596
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:42,166
they were such angry, hot-tempered people.

597
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And these rednecks were known to be very cruel.

598
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:51,125
They used to kill people and put the blame on some other

599
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:56,333
people from aboriginal people and arrest them and destroy them.

600
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:59,458
It went on and on and on.

601
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:03,125
But one day this Mississippi got flooded,

602
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:09,166
so much flooded it entered all the houses of these rednecks, you see

603
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:11,583
and I saw them running away

604
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:15,083
with all their belongings which they could not carry also.

605
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:18,333
Some of  they were leaving behind, some they were running

606
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:20,625
and, while running also, they were losing it.

607
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:24,083
Like that, the whole chaos took place of these rednecks.

608
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:27,125
And now, I am told, they are much better.

609
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:32,250
All that nonsense they had of killing all the black people and

610
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:35,041
torturing them, now has come on their heads.

611
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,500
Mississippi has taught them a lesson.

612
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:42,125
So how the nature also doesn’t like conditioned people

613
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:47,667
— conditioning is creating a big problem now, even now,

614
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:50,166
in all the countries, like racialism.

615
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:54,583
Racialism is a very bad conditioning.

616
00:39:55,417 --> 00:39:59,125
I mean, if somebody’s black or white or red, what does it matter?

617
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:01,625
God has made that person.

618
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:04,458
I always say that in America,

619
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:07,667
if they removed all the people who are not white-skinned,

620
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:09,625
what would be left there?

621
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:13,458
They don’t know how to sing,. They don’t know how to play.

622
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:16,500
They don’t know how to operate.

623
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,166
All the Indian doctors and Indian nurses will come away

624
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:22,333
and what will they do?

625
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:26,667
Imagine, thinking no end of themselves, they are great racists.

626
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:30,291
Even now, they are, but gradually they’ll definitely improve

627
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,458
because they should know their deficiencies.

628
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,041
This world is one and you need people from every country

629
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:40,000
to help each other. But this conditioning of

630
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,333
thinking themselves to be something great

631
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:46,583
the very bad conditioning. It is a mixture of ego

632
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:50,583
with conditioning, conditioning giving the ego

633
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:53,417
that ‘we are the best.’

634
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:57,625
But I am very happy to know that after Realisation,

635
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:02,333
it so happens that this resurrection,

636
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:07,625
Sahaja Yogis start thinking, understanding

637
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:11,291
what is wrong in their own community,

638
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:16,458
what is the mistake they have been committing.

639
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:20,083
They just become like that — alert.

640
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:22,083
And they start telling

641
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:25,208
they are the ones who are doing this kind of nonsense.

642
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:27,458
Imagine. It is very surprising

643
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:32,125
how you become conscious of the defects of your own country.

644
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:34,375
It is so important, is Agnya.

645
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:37,583
That’s what I think Christ had realised,

646
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:41,041
that Agnya should break. Unless and until Agnya breaks,

647
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:45,625
people cannot go further and that’s why He crucified himself

648
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:49,625
and then resurrected because without killing the Agnya,

649
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:51,500
you cannot resurrect.

650
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:56,250
All these things have worked out so well now

651
00:41:56,667 --> 00:42:01,417
that the whole world is seeing you like a panoramic view,

652
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:06,166
of complete destruction of the nonsense.

653
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,625
They are seeing this very clearly

654
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:13,083
and you see now these people who would not even look at us,

655
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:19,583
who had a very stiff nose and stiff lips and stiff neck

656
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:25,041
— all is relaxed. They are wondering why this is happening.

657
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:27,583
‘From when did we get this curse?’

658
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:30,417
So for the Europeans specially,

659
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:34,375
they have to understand the beauty

660
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,417
and the love and the greatness of other human beings

661
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:43,208
and then that will so much satisfy them.

662
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:48,709
Why there is so much problem now of this recession, how it is come.

663
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:53,166
Recession is nothing. It is the same Mr. Ego.

664
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:59,583
It is the same conditioning, which was like a snake was eating up.

665
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:02,333
Now it has receded. It is full.

666
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:05,333
It doesn’t need any more. It’s quite full.

667
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:11,458
And maybe it is now in danger of getting indigestion, I think.

668
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:16,291
So that these two snakes that were eating human beings are receded.

669
00:43:17,667 --> 00:43:21,083
It’s the best time where you can see the drama.

670
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:25,583
Drama of ego and your conditioning.

671
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:29,542
How these two things have eaten up human beings.

672
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,250
One should feel shy.

673
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:36,542
One should feel a little bit modest about it.

674
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:41,458
When you are full of ego, you don’t even see anything.

675
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:47,417
Or putting a conditioning on others, it’s horrible, I tell you.

676
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:51,375
I can’t understand how can they put a conditioning on others.

677
00:43:53,417 --> 00:43:58,417
It is now, you people all enjoy, say, for Indian music.

678
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:01,041
But when the British were ruling us,

679
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:04,250
they used to think it was a horrible noise going on.

680
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:07,583
They could never understand.

681
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:12,083
Now they are paying such a lot to attend the program for music.

682
00:44:12,709 --> 00:44:15,709
That is also a kind of a rebuff, but

683
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:19,417
also they don’t understand. Still they will go

684
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,041
because it’s regarded as a very big fashion

685
00:44:24,667 --> 00:44:26,458
to listen to Indian music.

686
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:31,250
So it is your ego also is so stupid

687
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:33,500
that God knows when it will give in.

688
00:44:34,125 --> 00:44:36,458
Today it will say, ‘This is the best thing.’

689
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:38,417
Tomorrow it will say, 'No, no, no, no.

690
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:40,625
We should take the other one. That’s much better.’

691
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:44,291
In this, I see, they have no discrimination.

692
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:47,583
Basically, people have no discrimination.

693
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:51,250
Those who have ego are indiscriminate.

694
00:44:51,709 --> 00:44:55,583
They cannot discriminate between evil and good.

695
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:59,000
And such people have been now,

696
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:02,417
thank God, have been punished quite a lot.

697
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:06,542
But it is the life of Christ, His model,

698
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:13,458
proves that your resurrection is so essential,

699
00:45:13,709 --> 00:45:19,500
which is so innate, that unless and until you get it, you are lost.

700
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,500
Whether it’s a country, whether it’s a person

701
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,709
or any organisation. This ego that you have

702
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:31,083
can ruin, ultimately, is now been proved,

703
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:35,250
can completely take you away from reality.

704
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:38,250
That is the thing that blinds you,

705
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:41,417
which can — another ego can blind you also.

706
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:44,625
Like we have those priests, we have those mullahs

707
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:48,375
and all these people. They are the ones who have this

708
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:54,125
tremendous power to misguide

709
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:58,625
you because your ego has no discretion sense.

710
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:01,250
It doesn’t even think like that.

711
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:04,250
And when they are specially,

712
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,500
not so much on the ego side, but on the conditioning side,

713
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:10,625
it’s even much worse – much worse.

714
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:14,250
Because when you are conditioned,

715
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:17,208
you start believing into all kinds of nonsense.

716
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:20,166
And you start ruining your health with that.

717
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:25,625
It is a very, very surprising thing how people understand

718
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:29,291
and like things which are very destructive.

719
00:46:30,709 --> 00:46:32,291
But you can manage.

720
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:35,500
These are the modern times, where you can advertise,

721
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:38,667
you can do all kinds of enticement, everything

722
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:42,166
and you can manage this Mr. Ego very well,

723
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:45,625
which pampers you. In this pampering,

724
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:50,083
ego gets completely drowned and

725
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:53,375
it loses its control over its own personality.

726
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:56,291
Thus, many by people get lost into it.

727
00:46:57,458 --> 00:46:59,709
Now Christ has sacrificed His life

728
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:02,291
and then He resurrected.

729
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:04,709
In the same way, all such people

730
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:08,166
who have ruined their lives have to come up

731
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:13,125
through resurrection. there’s no other way out  through Sahaja Yoga.

732
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,291
When you understand your own value, you’ll understand everything.

733
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:22,083
Otherwise, what is it? You are looking through your eyes

734
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,125
or somebody else’s eyes?

735
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:27,333
You’re hearing through your ears or somebody else’s ear?

736
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:32,208
It should be your own, so know thyself.

737
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:36,667
When you know thyself, everything will work out very well.

738
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:42,333
Out of this only, out of this category of people who know themselves

739
00:47:42,542 --> 00:47:44,583
Sahaja Yoga can be built up —

740
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:47,583
not by people who do not know themselves.

741
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:54,083
It’s a very, very long subject. I could go on on these two subjects,

742
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:57,333
but the main thing is we have to be thankful

743
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:03,083
to Christ for bringing this resurrection

744
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:06,458
into play so that we get our discretion.

745
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:09,333
Divine discretion, we’ll get it.

746
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:14,583
It’s such a struggle, such a path He created,

747
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:20,542
that we could go through this ordeal very easily,

748
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:25,417
which will kill our ego and our conditioning.

749
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:30,041
I am happy Sahaja Yogis will realise it

750
00:48:30,417 --> 00:48:33,125
and respect it within yourself,

751
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:37,291
that you are seeing your ego and superego

752
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:40,583
so clearly and that you could be above it.

753
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:44,166
May God bless you all.
