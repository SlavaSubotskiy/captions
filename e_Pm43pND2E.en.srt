1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:06,000
I would like to have some questions from you
about it.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,240
And then we’ll see how it works out.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,780
All right?

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,849
And not to be afraid, there’s nothing to
have any fear about kundalini.

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,599
Because you must have read such big, big books
saying that kundalini burns you, kundalini

6
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:20,599
does this.

7
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:22,169
No she is your own mother.

8
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:23,409
She doesn’t do anything of the kind.

9
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:26,380
These are the people who have never known
what kundalini is.

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:36,060
It’s like somebody putting the fingers into
the plug and saying electricity burns you.

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:45,680
They are unauthorized people who have done
all this, and that’s how they have suffered.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,769
So any questions please?

13
00:00:50,769 --> 00:01:00,109
Can’t think; if the kundalini rises above
this you become thoughtless just can’t think.

14
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:03,600
And when she gets out from here you start
feeling the cool breeze from your head.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,360
Really a cool breeze you feel it and from
your fingers.

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,750
As simple as that

17
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,840
You are still doubting something.

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,549
Ask a question.

19
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:21,020
Can’t hear.

20
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,259
Loudly.

21
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,200
Come, come, come here.

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,439
Come

23
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,910
(Lady inaudible)

24
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:37,110
All right All right May God bless you sit.

25
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,039
She is saying that have you to pray to kundalini?

26
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:46,510
No nothing you don’t have to.

27
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:55,009
You see prayer before realization has no meaning
it’s like telephoning without connection.

28
00:01:55,009 --> 00:02:02,899
There’s nothing to pray nothing to pray
nothing to pray.

29
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:12,190
(Lady inaudible) Can you come here?

30
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:41,430
(Man: I think everybody has got a question
to ask but they don’t know how to ask you)

31
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,030
They don’t want to?

32
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,730
What, What Questions?

33
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,240
Ask now What is there?

34
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,320
What is you don’t know?

35
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,170
I know English at least so ask me any question
in English.

36
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,370
Now what did you say?

37
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,370
(Lady)

38
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,560
Oh very good question.

39
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,120
That’s a good question.

40
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,670
That’s a good one.

41
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,150
Yes sit down sit down sit down.

42
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:19,210
She asked me a question if it is awakened
can it die out?

43
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,250
It doesn’t.

44
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,040
Once it is awakened it goes up it opens out.

45
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,080
But, but is there.

46
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:34,552
At the first shot you see it goes really in
a big way you get it in a really big way.

47
00:03:34,552 --> 00:03:35,552
You remember.

48
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:42,700
But then it goes back and looks after other
parts where there’s a problem so the force

49
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,750
is reduced.

50
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:53,410
But then you have to learn how to keep the
force there and how to raise it and this is

51
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,630
called as vidya, called as the knowledge.

52
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,820
How to raise the kundalini….

53
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:05,330
Side B: ….What is all this about?

54
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,230
So that part you have to know.

55
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,890
I am here to decode it.

56
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,610
Somebody come and told me, Mother I feel here
tickling, all the time tickling, I said this

57
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,079
centre is not all right you have to open this
centre.

58
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,060
Now how to open this centre then I had to
tell that person you have to do this very

59
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,060
simple method.

60
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,810
You see certain movements, because it is flowing
from your hands, certain movements how to

61
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,490
do it, which are the deities on different
centers if you come to know about it.

62
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,360
For example this centre is the centre of Christ.

63
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,800
Between the optic chiasm is placed a very
subtle centre of Christ.

64
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,620
In the Indian scriptures He is called as Maha
Vishnu.

65
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,789
Now He was born on this earth to suck the
ego and superego.

66
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:57,319
His crucifixion was there to suck our sins
means the ego and the superego.

67
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,880
But He is to be awakened.

68
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,620
Unless and until He’s awakened it cannot
happen you go to church or you pray to Him

69
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,620
nothing will happen.

70
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,870
But if kundalini goes and stops there, and
if you say Lord’s Prayer, it will rise.

71
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,280
Is the proof that it is Christ’s centre.

72
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:23,509
Now this very important point that He should
be awakened that Christ was for this was never

73
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:25,659
known to Christians.

74
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,080
It’s a living process.

75
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,590
He said I’m a living God.

76
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:37,900
And when they went to India the way they talked
about Christianity was something absurd.

77
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,289
So Hindus still believe that this one who
has to redeem us has to come.

78
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:46,990
They don’t know that He’s already born
and crucified and He’s the one.

79
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,710
He is Maha Vishnu who is described in Devi
Mahatmyam very, very clearly.

80
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,229
He was specially made.

81
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:58,680
Who was His father; who was His mother all
described.

82
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,759
But the people who know English have no repor
with our ancient scriptures and those who

83
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:10,919
went from here have no repor with Christ.

84
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,940
That He’s to be awakened within us.

85
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,419
He said I am to be born.

86
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:21,849
And how to awaken it nobody knew only through
kundalini you can do it.

87
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:27,080
He said, it’s said in the bible I’ll appear
before you like tongues of flames.

88
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,039
Now what are these tongues of flames?

89
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,029
Go and ask these people.

90
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:37,400
These Jews do they know?

91
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:45,090
Mohammed has very clearly said that you are
to become a peer; you have to be born again.

92
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:53,469
I mean namas is one of the very good ways
of raising the kundalini, if you are using

93
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:55,490
the Sahaja Yoga method.

94
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,410
Means you get your realization and then you
do namas.

95
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,320
You’ll be amazed.

96
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,400
Everything has a meaning only when it is a
living thing.

97
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,809
Otherwise it’s dummy.

98
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:08,360
Everything is a dummy stuff you see like this
is a dummy thing.

99
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,879
I shout at it or do whatever you like its
not going to work.

100
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:20,110
That’s why everything is a dummy and that’s
why people say oh Christianity is wrong.

101
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,969
If you go to the Muslims they will say the
Jews are wrong.

102
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:27,070
The Jews will say the Muslims are wrong, the
Hindus are wrong.

103
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,470
I mean they are all blaming each other.

104
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,780
If you have to learn about yourself better
go to the other party.

105
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,360
But they are all dummies.

106
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,469
Once you get realized you will know they are
all connected with each other absolutely one

107
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:45,150
there’s complete harmony and concord.

108
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,909
Christ Himself has said those who are not
against Me are with Me.

109
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:55,270
Now go and ask these priests who are those
who are not against Him; who are with Him.

110
00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:02,719
I mean, He was not even given sufficient time
only for four years He could talk and He was

111
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:03,719
killed.

112
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:08,779
Everywhere they have done a nice pickling
up of all these great people.

113
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:21,550
But Sahaja Yoga completely exposes their advents,
their purpose, their places within us and

114
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:27,630
also establishes all the fundamental things
that are described in all the scriptures and

115
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,599
their core relationships.

116
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,930
It’s such a fantastic thing.

117
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,120
How it establishes?

118
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,210
By proving it.

119
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,290
I’ll tell you one example, a simple example.

120
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,791
There was a gentleman from Iran he was a doctor
he came to see me.

121
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:47,850
I mean it is now we cannot contact him because
he’s in Iran.

122
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,510
But he came to see me he was a Muslim.

123
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:56,030
And I told him that Mohammed Sahib was born
as Nanak Sahib in India.

124
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,030
He could not believe it.

125
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,030
He said how can it be?

126
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:03,390
Though Nanak Sahib had said it in a way, because
Nanak Sahib was sleeping and somebody told

127
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:07,650
Him that you are placing your feet towards
Mecca he said all right I’ll turn my feet

128
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,770
to other side and the Mecca came that side.

129
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,820
He said I can’t believe it’ I can’t
believe it.

130
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,290
I said but Mohammed Sahib Has said that He
is the last.

131
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:24,200
I said I’m not sure of that but maybe He
must have decided to come back the way people

132
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
are.

133
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
He could not believe it.

134
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:34,760
And he had stomach cancer, which is caused
by one of the reasons is fanaticism.

135
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,980
I told him you have to believe in Him.

136
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:43,130
He was one of the incarnations of the Primordial
Master and He was the same Abraham was the

137
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,150
same Moses was the same Socrates was the same.

138
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,460
And you have to believe it.

139
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,780
He said I can’t believe it.

140
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,100
I said I can’t cure you.

141
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,070
Then he went back and he was very sick.

142
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,580
His wife said now what is there after all,
you see, we became Muslims because our parents

143
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,070
were Muslims and they told us Mohammed Sahib
was the last.

144
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,790
After all you are to be saved.

145
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:06,540
Then he came and said all right Mother whatever
you say I’m going to say.

146
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,780
I said now you pray to Nanak Sahib instead
of Mohammed Sahib because it is Mohammed Sahib

147
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,270
who’s angry with you.

148
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,010
He got cured; he’s still living.

149
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,010
He got cured.

150
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,010
It’s so simple.

151
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,010
We can’t believe it; it is so fantastic.

152
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,900
It is worth seeing yourself with your own
eyes.

153
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:28,310
The other day only, in Scotland, there was
a Gentleman was suffering from terrible, terrible

154
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,310
arthritis.

155
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,950
He got completely cured and he came to see
me in Edinburgh.

156
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:40,760
Arthritis absolutely curable; Diabetes is
absolutely curable; paralysis is absolutely

157
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
curable.

158
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,510
These all come out of your imbalances.

159
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:51,390
If you want to treat a tree and if you just
treat a flower or a leaf you cannot treat

160
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,390
the tree.

161
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,000
You have to go through the sap.

162
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,010
Sahaja Yoga is a system by which you go through
the sap of a personality and treat the whole

163
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,250
body as a whole.

164
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:07,171
Because the whole is the one, which is to
be looked after and not a part of it, because

165
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:09,830
you are a part of the whole.

166
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:15,330
And once you get connected with the whole
that whole that primordial being looks after

167
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,760
you.

168
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:22,070
And this is what has exactly happened to us
that we are all separated from the whole and

169
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:27,120
we have to become one with that with all our
awareness and understanding; so that that

170
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,320
whole looks after us.

171
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,670
So coming back to your question about kundalini
that it falls off is a true thing with some

172
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,430
people it does go down.

173
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,540
But all the forces that are divine are looking
after you.

174
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:49,180
You have to little bit cooperate with your
kundalini and she comes up she makes you beautiful,

175
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,730
absolutely beautiful.

176
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,990
Now any more questions?

177
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,590
Man: Could you explain what exactly you have
to do?

178
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,760
That’s the exact point.

179
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,220
You don’t have to do anything.

180
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,010
You see I have to do something about it not
you.

181
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,860
In the beginning then you can do it.

182
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,540
Like this light is here all right?

183
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,580
This is enlightened.

184
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,930
Now there’s another candle, which is not
enlightened that candle has to sit straight

185
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,080
just keep the wick out that’s all.

186
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,930
And this candle has to just go near that and
that gets enlightened.

187
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,101
I mean, I’m not doing anything about it
that also I must say because sometimes the

188
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:32,250
ego gets challenged; you know somebody says,
why Mother you?

189
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,790
I said you better do it.

190
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:39,670
I’ll be very happy to be replaced.

191
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,541
If you can come and do it, nothing like it.

192
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,541
You see it’ll be such a change.

193
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:45,541
But what can I do?

194
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,790
I have to do it.

195
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:55,160
Otherwise I’m a happily married woman; I
have my children, grandchildren, everyone

196
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,690
there, I have no problems.

197
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:03,890
But I see your problems, and I see that spirit
in you, and I just feel in all my love and

198
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,990
compassion that you must know it; that’s
all.

199
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,390
And once you know it you can do it yourself.

200
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,060
Like one light can enlighten many.

201
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,060
Isn’t it?

202
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,160
It’s as simple.

203
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,420
You become that.

204
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,960
You don’t have to do anything about it;
you have to just put your fingers like this

205
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,850
and the power flows into you.

206
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,920
It’s that simple.

207
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,980
You won’t believe but it is so because you
are ready.

208
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,640
You are just ready to be enlightened.

209
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,740
Now this instrument is made, if it is not
put to the mains what’s the use?

210
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,740
But how do you put to the mains?

211
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,010
Just put to the mains, that’s all.

212
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,580
The mains are there and this is ready you
just put to the mains.

213
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,580
You are just there.

214
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:46,580
Like a television set to a villager if you
tell, he won’t believe that it is so fantastic.

215
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,320
That there are all things around you; he will
say I can’t see anything.

216
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,380
How can he believe it?

217
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,410
When you put to the mains and you start seeing
the television manifesting, which is so fantastic.

218
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,760
In the same way, you are a special instrument
created by God.

219
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,380
You are just put to the mains.

220
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,940
You don’t have to do anything.

221
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,660
What did you do for your evolution?

222
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,410
When we became human beings from a monkey
what did we do?

223
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:15,720
Nothing, we did not cut our tail or anything
it just dropped off.

224
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,770
In the same way, we don’t do anything for
this also; it’s just there; you are just

225
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,890
ready; you just get it like that.

226
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,430
You don’t know how fantastic you are.

227
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,460
You don’t know that, na?

228
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,590
I know that.

229
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,100
But you will also know very soon.

230
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,020
When you know you will be amazed how fantastic
you are within.

231
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,480
It’s said all ways, all the scriptures,
all the great people have described you as

232
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
very great.

233
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,890
All of them have described.

234
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,280
But you must have faith in yourself that you
are great, no doubt.

235
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,540
And that instrument is ready, just ready.

236
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,410
It is to be applied to the mains and once
you start manifesting you can give it to others.

237
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,870
It’s that simple.

238
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:54,080
You can’t believe it I know, but it is so,
you will see that very soon.

239
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,970
Do not doubt it too much all right?

240
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,280
Otherwise this brain will be working khat
khat khat.

241
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:05,900
That’s why I’ve said for a while you should
stop thinking about it then it will work out.

242
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,790
Because I’ve seen people who go on doubting
very much they take time.

243
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:18,280
Just open, open out yourself, you must open
yourself fully and it will work out.

244
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,510
After all you want to have your realization
isn’t it?

245
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,130
What else you want?

246
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,680
You don’t want to doubt for doubting sake.

247
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,840
What’s the use of doubting also?

248
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,690
I mean if there is supposing I say there’s
a diamond here.

249
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:35,530
You will all run not only you but people from
Australia will come if I say it is free available.

250
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,100
Don’t you think so?

251
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:43,720
They will say worth going by plane, if there’s
such a big diamond available.

252
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,790
So no use doubting.

253
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,790
Just have it.

254
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,090
You have a diamond in your heart.

255
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:52,000
No doubt it will spark.

256
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,210
Do not doubt.

257
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,680
This mind has been doubting all the time,
what has it given you?

258
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,490
Nothing it will give you problems and headaches.

259
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:09,810
Don’t be doubting Thomas’s; be trusting.

260
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:15,430
Come here; come.

261
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:25,860
Lady: do you find people’s problems stop
them getting realization?

262
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,890
Problems it stops a little sometimes little
bit.

263
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,880
But I know all the permutations, combinations
now.

264
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,520
So I can get over all the problems; I think
so.

265
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,200
All right?

266
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,940
I know many permutations and combinations
now of problems.

267
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:49,340
In the beginning you’ll be amazed in this
England I came here when my husband got elected

268
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,480
to this job.

269
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:57,040
For four years I worked on six people, for
four years, can you imagine?

270
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,430
And now they just get it like that.

271
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,720
Now I know all the permutations, combinations
of English people and England and western

272
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
people.

273
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,639
Now I’m going to America and I’ve been
there before also; so keep your fingers crossed;

274
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:13,760
I’m sure I’ll work it out there also.

275
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,120
Everybody’s an interesting sample of some
combination.

276
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,100
But I know all the keys somehow; I’ve studied
it and I’ve put all attention to it.

277
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:27,160
It has worked out and all these problems I
know what you all have.

278
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,260
Somehow it works out so don’t you worry
about that.

279
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,840
If there were no problems, there was no need
to do this.

280
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,049
I mean you would be just there.

281
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:39,960
There has to be problems.

282
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,960
Any other problem?

283
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:56,210
Man: We’ve got seven chakras over there;
can you please tell us what part each one

284
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,210
plays?

285
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,210
That’s good.

286
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,710
Now all that is so elaborate I may not be
able to tell you today; but can you come and

287
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,710
show?

288
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,070
But I will be able to say in short, all right?

289
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,809
Now he is coming; he will show you.

290
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:22,210
Now the first chakra which is below the kundalini
the first one is the very important centre,

291
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:31,160
which is bestowed by a deity, which is the
embodiment of innocence.

292
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:36,100
Is the centre of innocence, the first chakra.

293
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:42,519
To explain it more we can say when we were
at the carbon stage, carbon stage.

294
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:46,500
Now Carbon is a very important element, you
know that.

295
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:52,790
In the periodical laws it is placed in the
centre; it is tetravalent means it has four

296
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,900
hands either it can give four hands or take
four hands.

297
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:01,549
And at that stage only the nature started
producing life.

298
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:04,870
So that is the stage where we were at carbon
level.

299
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:10,110
And nature is innocent a chair doesn’t get
angry with you.

300
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,270
Its only we can get angry.

301
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:19,399
So the nature that we are, is innocent our
basis is innocence.

302
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:21,779
We are surrounded first by innocence.

303
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:24,520
We are basically innocent people.

304
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,450
So this is the first centre, is of innocence.

305
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,629
Then the second centre that you see.

306
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:32,570
Actually the Nabhi we can take it.

307
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:36,269
Is the second centre and the third centre
are connected.

308
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:40,850
From the second centre arises the third centre.

309
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:49,659
The second centre is the centre of our seeking.

310
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:52,870
This one manifests our solar plexus.

311
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:57,460
And this caters to our seeking.

312
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:04,019
As amoeba we were seeking our food through
our stomach; it is in the stomach we can say.

313
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:08,080
Actually they are all placed in the medulla
oblongata; they are placed in the spinal chord.

314
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,750
But they manifest outside the plexuses.

315
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:19,549
For example, the first one manifests the plexus
called as pelvic plexus, which is responsible

316
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:21,570
for our excretory functions.

317
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,600
All right?

318
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:28,499
Now the second one, which is the one I told
you just now, manifests the solar plexus,

319
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:30,240
is for our seeking.

320
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,419
And now you are at a stage where you are seeking
the ultimate the beyond.

321
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:40,710
But there are people who are still seeking
money, there are people who are still seeking

322
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,470
other things.

323
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:48,070
But I take if for granted that you are seeking
divine.

324
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,779
So the seeking reaches that state at that
centre.

325
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:56,559
The other centre that comes out of it is the
centre of action.

326
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,690
The seeking has to put into action.

327
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,049
Otherwise supposing you are hungry you have
to go into action to get it.

328
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:10,039
So this is the centre of action within us,
which works within us all the activities for

329
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,039
the future.

330
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:22,249
It thinks and all the activities that we require
for our mental or our physical needs.

331
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:25,320
So this is a center of the creator.

332
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:33,529
The above centre to that is the centre which
is the centre of Heart as we call it.

333
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:38,380
Is the centre which represents your sense
of security.

334
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:46,470
When the child is about twelve years of age
this centre creates anti bodies in your sternum

335
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:51,990
bone and these antibodies by the time the
child is about twelve years of age go into

336
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:59,520
the whole body and they are the ones who react
to any invasion on the body.

337
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:06,929
And these antibodies react; say for example,
all our injection system works on that.

338
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:14,019
We put a little virus, which is an outsider
invader inside the body and when you put that

339
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:16,270
they get energetic to fight.

340
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:20,179
And because of their energies they fight the
disease and we get cured.

341
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:22,509
This is the principle of that is.

342
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:25,570
This is the center of our sense of security.

343
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:32,419
When we are insecure then this centre starts
pulsating and emitting more antibodies and

344
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:33,419
looking after us.

345
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,679
And this is a very important centre within
us.

346
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,440
But there are other two other centers on sides
of it; one is of the mother, one of the father;

347
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
on both sides.

348
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,760
I mean they have sub centers also.

349
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,639
Now this one can be called as the one which
manifests cardiac plexus.

350
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:54,940
Then above that is the centre which is behind
here, is the centre of our collectivity.

351
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,649
Is the centre where we become one with the
whole.

352
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:01,990
Is the centre which gives us the idea that
we are one.

353
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:07,860
By this centre we become also the witness
of the play of the divine later on when it

354
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,860
is enlightened.

355
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:13,860
It is a very important centre by which we
talk to others, we communicate to others on

356
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,129
the right hand side.

357
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:21,440
On the left hand side emotionally we become
attached to people.

358
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,980
Then above that is the centre as I told you
of Christ or we can say the centre of ascent.

359
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:36,019
There is the door, which goes into this area
of limbic area, which is grossly known as

360
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:38,169
limbic area, which is the kingdom of God.

361
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:42,730
And above is the last one here where this
point.

362
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,110
The whole thing is one centre the limbic area
and this point.

363
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,940
When the ego and superego are sucked in, the
kundalini rushes through, and this fontanel

364
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,379
bone area becomes very soft and you start
getting the cool breeze from that part.

365
00:23:56,379 --> 00:24:00,830
Now in short I’ve told you but in details
you can go through the book it’s all written

366
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,239
down about these centers.

367
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:08,239
Which are the basic seven centers but there
are many other centers, which are sub plexuses

368
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,450
of this.

369
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:14,840
Amazingly there’s one thing that all these
centers are manifesting the plexuses outside

370
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,809
and all these plexuses.

371
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:22,519
For example here, the plexus is the one that
looks after the pituitary and the pineal,

372
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:24,140
these two things.

373
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:30,989
So it is related absolutely with the gross
as well but we go from inside outward while

374
00:24:30,989 --> 00:24:32,890
the doctors go from outward inside.

375
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:37,080
Which you cannot go you cannot enter into
a tree through a leaf you can enter only through

376
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,940
the sap into it.

377
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,299
These are in short I have told you.

378
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:44,971
But there are all these things are clearly
written down in a book that they will give

379
00:24:44,971 --> 00:24:45,971
you.

380
00:24:45,971 --> 00:24:46,971
They have got it.

381
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:47,971
Have you got that book?

382
00:24:47,971 --> 00:24:48,971
You can get.

383
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:49,971
It’s a very small booklet.

384
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:51,130
Do you charge any money for that?

385
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,130
No?

386
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,130
It’s free?

387
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,130
You charge a little.

388
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,130
How much?

389
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,750
Man: Ten pie or something.

390
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,149
Ten pie or something they charge.

391
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:05,289
You see because maybe, so far all these boys
have been printing it and paying for it for

392
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:06,289
the whole also.

393
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:10,030
I mean this thing requires money no doubt,
but these boys have been doing it.

394
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,159
And it’s all right not much you see.

395
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:18,639
Birmingham is a cheep place that way I must
say compared to some places I went to.

396
00:25:18,639 --> 00:25:24,870
Also everybody is trying to fund it so that,
I mean there is no sort of any profit basis

397
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,870
or anything.

398
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:31,070
But like ashram we have got we have got say
ten people they take a house they live there,

399
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,370
look after it and that’s an ashram.

400
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:38,390
There’s no sort of a profit making or any
fees or anything.

401
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,789
Because they live there, they have a house,
they live there that’s all.

402
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:41,809
It’s as simple as that.

403
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:46,179
We do not have any such organization; there
is nobody who is organized in it.

404
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:47,919
You cannot organize God.

405
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,679
So there’s no organization they are there
because of their free will, because of their

406
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,440
freedom and because of their love and because
they feel responsible that they should do

407
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,440
it.

408
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,799
There’s no force on you; there’s no compulsion;
there’s no money taking; there’s no membership.

409
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:11,419
Man: Is it also possible please for any of
those centers to awaken without the knowledge

410
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:15,369
of the individual?

411
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:24,540
You see, sometimes it happens, that a person
can be attacked from the sides and then that

412
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,970
centre can go on emitting too much.

413
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,020
Like in cancer it happens.

414
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,539
That one of the centers you see, say for instance
the stomach.

415
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:39,669
If you are eating say something which is irritating
the stomach centre, then what happens that

416
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:46,309
this centre receives all the energies from
everywhere, all the stored up energy and starts

417
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:47,470
working very hard.

418
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,789
When it starts working very hard, it gets
dislocated.

419
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:55,820
When it gets dislocated, what happens that
there is no relationship left with the whole

420
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:02,519
and the cells starts growing more than in
relation to the whole.

421
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:05,110
And we say malignancy has been set in.

422
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,249
And like that can happen they can get over
excited.

423
00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:13,590
But the energy from other centers is brought
in one and they get over excited with out

424
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,499
any relationship to the whole.

425
00:27:15,499 --> 00:27:17,249
And that’s a very dangerous situation.

426
00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:22,730
Such a thing can happen and sometimes it can
happen on certain centers where people just

427
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,730
get possessed.

428
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,720
And they think they have got some sort of
a great experience.

429
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
Is not so.

430
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,940
Like there was a lady who always felt she’s
getting out of her body.

431
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,419
Ultimately she got her cancer.

432
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:34,750
Now, of course, she is cured; she’s all
right.

433
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:39,429
But these all such experiences come from the
left and the right side.

434
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:40,429
Not from the superior.

435
00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:45,600
The one experience on the left hand side is
of the collective subconscious because on

436
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,629
the left hand side of this channel that you
see is the collective subconscious.

437
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:55,510
Now we do not know because these are unknown
areas for us; the collective subconscious

438
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,409
on this area and the collective supraconscious
on this area.

439
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:02,080
Now, for example, spiritualists they work
from the collective subconscious; very dangerous

440
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,429
thing to do.

441
00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:06,549
We have nothing to do with spirits, nothing
to do with them.

442
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:09,210
We are in the centre and the present.

443
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:14,559
If you indulge into spiritualism, you’ll
find you develop a very funny situation and

444
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,539
I don’t know how they end it up.

445
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:22,899
Apart from mental trouble, you’ll be amazed,
I’m amazed at it myself, that all the cancer

446
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:30,619
patients I’ve seen so far are all attacked
from the left side not from the right side.

447
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:34,619
Those who are attacked from the right side
is the supraconscious the collective supraconscious

448
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:36,110
are the people like Hitler.

449
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:43,919
Who get possessed by very, you can say very,
very dominating personalities who are dead

450
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,519
or those who lived in the future great planners
this that they get attacked.

451
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,360
And once they get attacked there’s an outlet.

452
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,639
For example you can say Hitler was like a
medium and he transformed other people into

453
00:28:56,639 --> 00:29:00,039
that kind of a frantic temperament.

454
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:04,999
I mean it took him eleven years to build up
that kind of a domain of Satans you see but

455
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:06,100
it took eleven years.

456
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:11,470
And I would blame then the people who allowed
this to grow and once this grew up and suddenly

457
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:15,220
it blew up them then they realized; oh God
where are we?

458
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:20,480
So these attacks can come from these two areas
they are called as Adiboutic and Adidevic

459
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,030
in Sanskrit language.

460
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:28,879
But this is, is the spirit; is the Atma; is
the superior; is the super most experience

461
00:29:28,879 --> 00:29:35,039
where you become the spirit itself, your spirit
not somebody else’s.

462
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,999
So all these experiences are not healthy;
they should be avoided for all those who are

463
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:41,999
seeking reality.

464
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:46,241
I mean if you want to have some jugglery,
then it’s a different thing but it is a

465
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:48,389
very dangerous thing to play with it.

466
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:51,989
All these gurus are using only this either
left or the right side.

467
00:29:51,989 --> 00:29:53,929
They use the spirits and that’s how they
mesmerize.

468
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:57,850
That’s a very dangerous state.

469
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:04,659
The other day Sahaja Yoga has become so powerful
now that they these people gave realization

470
00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:07,410
to an archbishop of black magic.

471
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,410
Can you imagine?

472
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,960
I was amazed.

473
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,750
And this fellow was quite all right then he
went home and he found everything was moving

474
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,750
around.

475
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,519
This all the things that were there were moving
around.

476
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:23,360
Now the spirits were tempting him back they
thought if we show some sort of this jugglery

477
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,999
he will be back again.

478
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:27,090
And they telephoned to me Mother now what
to do.

479
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,389
I said why did you give him realization?

480
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:30,419
There was no need to give him realization.

481
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,330
He said just he came and he got it.

482
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,139
I said leave him alone I’ll look after him
you don’t worry.

483
00:30:34,139 --> 00:30:37,409
It happens now.

484
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:42,369
This Sahaja yoga is so great imagine giving
realization to the archbishop of black magic.

485
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:44,519
I mean this is too much.

486
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,809
It’s doing.

487
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:47,090
It’s happening.

488
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:57,480
Man: May I say by the way that um I can see
a white aura around your head for the last

489
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
hour.

490
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,570
Yes it’s true, but I would say don’t see
that.

491
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:03,159
You’ll see many things because I’m something
more; there’s no doubt.

492
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:04,159
Quite a lot I am.

493
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,940
That you have to discover later.

494
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,429
You can see many things.

495
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:13,659
But I would say don’t say anything because
this also seeing is not the thing experiencing

496
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:18,299
is the thing and that’s why you must experience
your being.

497
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:20,749
And People have seen me in many forms many
things.

498
00:31:20,749 --> 00:31:22,309
That’s not important.

499
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:23,870
That’s not important.

500
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:28,049
Important is that you must get your realization.

501
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:30,799
I must be something isn’t it to do it?

502
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,789
No doubt there must be something about me.

503
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:34,929
But I don’t want to talk about it just now.

504
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:38,330
I’m very tactful; you better find out.

505
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,602
Lady: Why is peace and tranquility adjusted
on your face?

506
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:48,289
On my face?

507
00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:49,539
You are also going to get it.

508
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:51,299
That’s all I can say.

509
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:53,889
It is there inside.

510
00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:58,269
It is all whatever is inside comes out isn’t
it?

511
00:31:58,269 --> 00:32:03,309
You are all peace, tranquility everything
inside you are also the same not only me.

512
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:06,669
You have to just feel it.

513
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:13,100
You will, you will no doubt, you will no doubt.

514
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,100
I assure you.

515
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,769
That’s why I’m here; I want you to enjoy
that what I am enjoying.

516
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:16,850
That’s all.

517
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,440
You see it’s like a drunkard who cannot
enjoy his drink.

518
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,289
That’s why I say that I am a capitalist
because I have all these powers and I am the

519
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:26,710
greatest communist because I must share.

520
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,429
I can’t help it without sharing.

521
00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:34,919
So this such a combination, all right?
