1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,680
Sahaja Yogi: And Her family members and Herself

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,200
were the victims of considerable oppression and even jailed,

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,600
at the time when … prior to British withdrawal.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,000
Two thousand years ago?

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,960
Shri Mataji: So that was the calendar they started.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,080
Sahaja Yogi: That was when it started.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,520
Shri Mataji: It's very ancient, even at the time of Shri Krishna.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,480
Sahaja Yogi: It's a most ancient lineage.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,680
She's doing this spiritual work since 1970.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,560
The work She's doing is granting en-masse Self-realization

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,120
to seekers of truth.

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,480
There is no organization, there is no money paid.

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,000
We call ourselves Sahaja Yogis.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,040
We're professional people, we're business people,

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,760
we're ordinary members of the public

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,600
who just conduct their lives in a perfectly normal way.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,920
And She is, I think, well known

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,880
for being an outspoken critic of many of the false gurus

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,520
that are purveying their ways in the marketplace today.

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,520
So, She'll tell you anything you wish to know

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,120
about Her message and the work that She's doing.

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,120
Basically, it's to put you in touch with your spirit

23
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,240
so that you become a master of your own Self.

24
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,760
You don't depend upon a guru,

25
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,880
you don't depend slavishly upon any other external influence,

26
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,040
but you become master of your Self.

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,680
So without any further introduction

28
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,120
I'd like you to meet Mataji Nirmala Devi.

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,360
Shri Mataji: Now, I think, we should have questions first.

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,560
Journalist: What is Self-realization and how do You grant it?

31
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,480
Shri Mataji: Self-realization

32
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:12,120
is the epitome of our evolutionary process,

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,560
which is a living process

34
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,760
through which you achieve your higher Self.

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,360
Even Darwin, who was an atheist, did say

36
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,920
that as human beings have come so far

37
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,040
they will achieve their absolute.

38
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,520
So, to achieve your absolute means to get Self-realization.

39
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,920
The purpose of our life, the meaning of our life

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,560
is only achieved when we will get connected

41
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,920
with the divine Power, which is all-pervading.

42
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,120
Now, one need not believe in the divine Power,

43
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,960
but you can see the manifestation of this living divine Power

44
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,120
when you see a flower becoming a fruit.

45
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,240
All living work is done by this divine Power.

46
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,200
But we are not aware of it.

47
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,720
At this human stage we are not aware of it.

48
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,720
But once this happening takes place in your awareness …

49
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,440
it's not just suggesting

50
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,880
that you become something great or on … on mental level,

51
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,840
but actualization of this experience is felt

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,640
in your awareness, on your central nervous system.

53
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,040
You can feel that you have become — again I say, you have become,

54
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,320
not told or brainwashed, but you have become —

55
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,920
collectively conscious.

56
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,360
Is a state where you can feel

57
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,400
your Self inside and others' too.

58
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Now, the knowledge of this is the knowledge of the roots.

59
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,720
Whatever we have achieved is the knowledge of the tree.

60
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,920
But if the tree outgrows itself from its root, then it may die.

61
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,600
So it is time that we should find out about the roots.

62
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,800
And to know about that, we have to become a subtler being.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,400
At this human awareness you cannot.

64
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,960
But sometimes it challenges the ego of people.

65
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,320
They think, "Why not? I am such and such, why shouldn't I know?"

66
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,640
But you cannot. As you have to have a microscope

67
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:35,000
to see things deeply,

68
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,680
in the same way you have to have

69
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,080
this new awareness within you, this dynamic awareness.

70
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,280
Of course, the nature of Self is that it is collectively conscious,

71
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,760
that it is the source of peace and bliss,

72
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,280
that it is the truth and love.

73
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,320
That's the nature. And you become that. You become.

74
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,400
It's not only mental, but you really become.

75
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,480
Because whatever is mental is artificial, man-made.

76
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,520
Journalist: And do You perceive this … this collective unconscious

77
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,760
or this collective consciousness mentally?

78
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,080
Shri Mataji: Yes. The unconscious becomes conscious,

79
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,720
means it comes into your central nervous system.

80
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,840
It is within you.

81
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Everyone has said it: Christ has said it, Mohammed has said it,

82
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,200
Buddha has said it, Mahavira has said it.

83
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,160
Everyone has said the same thing.

84
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,200
Like Lao-Tze, then, say, Zen system —

85
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,680
everything has said that you are to be born again,

86
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,680
there has to be some transformation within you.

87
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,400
They didn't tell us lies.

88
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,640
But the trouble is people can use this for their own purpose

89
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,880
and mislead others.

90
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,040
That's a different point.

91
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,400
But logically,

92
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,320
the disciples or the seekers also must know

93
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:15,400
that you must feel your own powers, you must feel your Self.

94
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,080
Otherwise what's the use of just following somebody

95
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,800
where you achieve nothing of your own?

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,720
What did you achieve is the main point you should see.

97
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,720
Journalist: And how do You grant this Self-realization en masse?

98
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,720
Shri Mataji: Yes. That's the only thing is new today,

99
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,440
is that it can be done on mass level.

100
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,040
That's why in India it is called as Maha Yoga.

101
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,280
Formerly it was done for one or two persons,

102
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,840
but now on very mass level you can do it.

103
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,680
We had once — they were there —

104
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,720
six thousand people in a village called Khudus.

105
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,640
All of them got realization.

106
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,760
In India is very easy because they are not so complicated.

107
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,440
But Indians take it for granted.

108
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,280
They know what Sahaja Yoga is, they know what realization is.

109
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,080
I mean, they are trained that way,

110
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,480
or I should say they are conditioned that way,

111
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,560
that they understand it faster.

112
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,960
But when the Western people get it …

113
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,600
they are sometimes difficult,

114
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,600
but once they get it they are very deep

115
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,400
and they think this is the solution,

116
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,200
the only solution for all the calamities.

117
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,200
So they work it out very seriously,

118
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,400
and really, they are doing very good work.

119
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,280
Journalist: Is it harder to grant Self-realization to Westerners?

120
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,600
Shri Mataji: I used to think so, but the other day, in Adelaide,

121
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,840
I was amazed that they got it without any difficulty.

122
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,040
So many of them, there must be about three hundred people in that hall,

123
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,080
it was all packed — and they all got it.

124
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,520
So all My ideas about that also are now changing,

125
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,960
that suddenly I'm meeting the right type of people, I think.

126
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,000
Journalist: But how is it that You actually

127
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,680
give them this mass level of consciousness?

128
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,240
Sahaja Yogi: How do You do it, Mother?
Shri Mataji: How do I do it.

129
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,560
As I said, it's spontaneous.

130
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,480
A seed, if you put it in the Mother Earth,

131
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,600
it sprouts by itself. You cannot say how you do it.

132
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,600
But … because you are just ready for it.

133
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,040
It's like one enlightened light can enlighten another light.

134
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,200
Even if you put your hands towards Me like this, you can get it.

135
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,360
It's so simple. And then you can give it to others.

136
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,960
Once you get it, you can give it to others.

137
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,360
Journalist: And with due respect,

138
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,360
we get a lot of Eastern visitors to Australia now,

139
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,760
with different prayer or different types of religion.

140
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,080
But who do we know is leading us,

141
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,200
and who do we know is misleading us?

142
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,960
Shri Mataji: You see, you must use your brains. For everything.

143
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,800
God has given you a very good brain and logic.

144
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,640
And logically, you must reach proper conclusion about your realization.

145
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,520
First of all, you must truly find out

146
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,760
whether you want your realization or not.

147
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,320
Because if some people want to fly in the air,

148
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,240
then I can't give that.

149
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,800
If some people want to have diamonds — that I can't do,

150
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,560
some sort of funny miracles that they do, all these tricks.

151
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,800
So you have to be honest, first of all, about it.

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,560
Secondly, you must know that this is Love of God

153
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
and you cannot sell it in the market.

154
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,400
You cannot purchase ...(unclear)

155
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,720
That's one of a very important things one should know.

156
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,880
Because they pamper your ego in a way

157
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,360
that you are purchasing your guru, that he is in your pocket.

158
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,000
That's what one feels.

159
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,760
But you cannot pocket the guru, guru has to be higher than you.

160
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,360
Then you have to find out the lifestyle of such a guru.

161
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,400
How is he? How he lives? Is he an honest man?

162
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,960
Is he a righteous person? Or is he…

163
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,400
You must find out the credibility of such a person.

164
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,960
Apart from that, you must find out the credibility

165
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,400
of the followers also, what are they doing.

166
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,560
There are so many gurus who have got followers for eighteen years,

167
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,280
sixteen years — and they are epileptic!

168
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,320
If the guru can't even look after their health,

169
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,600
then what's the use of having such a guru for yourself?

170
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,000
But human beings are very competitive

171
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
in certain things, it seems.
Journalist: Sorry, really?

172
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,880
Shri Mataji: They are very competitive, amusingly.

173
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,320
Like, they see a person coming out of the pub, falling in the gutters,

174
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,440
and they enter into the same pub. Sort of thing, you see.

175
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,520
It's sort of a competition that they get into.

176
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,200
And they think, "Why, this man has gone to this guru, so I'll go."

177
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,560
It's a fashion!

178
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,480
People talk, "Who is your guru?" And the other says, "This is my guru."

179
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,000
It's … really, I can't understand how people can do that.

180
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,440
Journalist: Yes, but, You see, it's sprung up like that.

181
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,800
Shri Mataji: Yes. What I'm saying, this is a special time,

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,200
a time of your resurrection, the time of your judgment.

183
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,280
So, there is a need. There is a need.

184
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,520
But people are so vulnerable

185
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,760
and so naive, I would say, very naive,

186
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,720
not to understand who is right and who is wrong.

187
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,840
It's very simple. People come out of the jail,

188
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,520
wear a funny dress and go to America,

189
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,680
sit in a square and start singing something funny.

190
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,200
Everybody will: "Oh, look at him, what a very great…"

191
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,200
Moreover, a kind of a inferiority complex, I think,

192
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,680
people have who are householders.

193
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,800
They think they are very selfish, they are rearing their children

194
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,640
and looking after their household. It is not.

195
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,800
It is one of the greatest jobs, is to be properly married

196
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,600
and to have nice children.

197
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,960
But if you see somebody wearing that dress —

198
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,880
he "has given up everything in the world", you see —

199
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,240
you feel so enamored.

200
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,120
It's superficially you cannot judge it.

201
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,920
Journalist: Do You believe Yourself to be the (unclear)?

202
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,160
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

203
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,880
Journalist: I asked that, er,

204
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,320
do You believe Yourself to be the only true Guru

205
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,760
or are there other organizations that offer enlightenment as well?

206
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,000
Sahaja Yogi: Do You believe that You are the only true guru

207
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,640
and are there other organizations who offer enlightenment?

208
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,880
Shri Mataji: There are many true gurus also in India,

209
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,200
it's not true that I'm the only true guru.

210
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,760
But I'm the only Mother, I should say.

211
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,400
Because these true gurus, who are living in Himalayas

212
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,160
and other places on the hills, don't want to come down.

213
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,000
They don't want to mix with people.

214
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,200
I sent one fellow with great coaxing and persuasion to America.

215
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,440
He ran away within three days from there. He said,

216
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,480
"They can't understand, they are just the other way round people.

217
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,400
They can't understand God. They understand dollars."

218
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,400
So there are many gurus. And they recognize Me quite all right.

219
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,920
That's why when they say that "She is the …

220
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,840
what did you say … greatest saint" or anything,

221
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,480
is all said by these gurus, only have told them.

222
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,600
Journalist: What about in the West,

223
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,280
do You think that they are — gurus or not gurus —

224
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,600
but do You think that they are of religious organizations?

225
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, some people have taken oaths, you see.

226
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,680
It's a good enterprise to make big money, you see.

227
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,000
Now imagine, one guru has made six thousand crores of rupees.

228
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,680
Now, crore is hundred and then … hundred and then … thousand…

229
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,720
Sahaja Yogi: Sixty.

230
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,600
Shri Mataji: Thousand and then…
Sahaja Yogi: Multi-billion.

231
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Shri Mataji: Hundred thousand and then hundred of that is one crore.

232
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,800
So six thousand crores of rupees he has made in India alone,

233
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,200
God knows how much in the Swiss Bank.

234
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,120
Another one has got fifty-nine Rolls-Royces.

235
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,520
Another one who has run away from India has purchased three aeroplanes

236
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,480
and thirty-five Rolls-Royces.

237
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,080
They have a special liking for Rolls-Royce, I think.

238
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,400
Seems so. One must understand that it's a very big enterprise.

239
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,320
Even Oberoi [owner of Oberoi Hotels] cannot afford it.

240
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,640
Journalist: You could say it's got good knowledge of the marketplace.

241
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,340
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

242
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,600
Shri Mataji: Yes, they know, you see, they're very clever.

243
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,680
Not only, they have employed people to tell them about it.

244
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,720
You see, they have employment of, also, publicity department.

245
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,520
They have every sort of department. I mean, it's a big enterprise.

246
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,600
Journalist: For being a guru.
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

247
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,400
Journalist: Being a guru is a big enterprise.

248
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,960
Sahaja Yogi: Being a guru is a big enterprise.

249
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,880
Shri Mataji: Very big enterprise if you can venture it, really.

250
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,400
I mean, some English people have tried it.

251
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
They have been successful, but not so much as Indians.

252
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,480
I think Indians are clever to do that job.

253
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,840
Sahaja Yogi: I've missed the point you were asking.

254
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,600
Journalist: Yes, I think…
Sahaja Yogi: But she asked

255
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,760
are there any enlightened gurus in the West.

256
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,760
Shri Mataji: Did you?

257
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,000
Journalist: Yeah. Are there genuine spiritual leaders in the West?

258
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,920
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, yes, I said so, there are many.

259
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,600
Yes, there are many. All over the world they are, not only in India.

260
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,200
Journalist: Do You consider some of the Western

261
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,160
religious organizations to be genuine?

262
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,720
Shri Mataji: They are all genuine because they believe so,

263
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,520
but they don't create genuine effects. That's the point is.

264
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,640
You may believe something is genuine in ignorance, see?

265
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,800
For example, you may believe that a particular diamond

266
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,560
is a real diamond, because they're ignorant about jewellery.

267
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,440
But when you want to sell it in the market,

268
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,160
you find out that it's not so.

269
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,240
That's what is happening to our religions now.

270
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,800
The thing is, all religions have to seek within themselves

271
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,200
and get their Self-realization. Which they are not doing.

272
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
They're, too, having buildings.

273
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,960
They, too, are having organizations.

274
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,160
They're, too, having … what you call … big market places.

275
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,760
All that is … all coming to economics again,

276
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,200
or to politics at the most,

277
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,480
but not to God.

278
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,640
Journalist: How is it that the, er,

279
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,040
there are gurus in the world that won't come into the West?

280
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,600
Why do You come to the West?
Shri Mataji: Me?

281
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,200
Sahaja Yogi: The ones that … there are many that won't come to the West.

282
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,640
Why have You come to the West?

283
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,280
Shri Mataji: You see, because I'm the only

284
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,280
venturesome person, I think.

285
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,200
Journalist: Sorry, what did You say?

286
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,680
Shri Mataji: I said I'm the only venturesome person.

287
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,120
But apart from that, I must tell you, it was so arranged

288
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,480
that My husband got elected to this job in England,

289
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,640
elected by 134 nations, four times unanimously.

290
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,520
Journalist: What do You think …

291
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,720
how long have You lived in the West now?

292
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,960
Shri Mataji: No, I don't live here much, you see, I go to India also.

293
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,000
I've been traveling quite a lot.

294
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,120
I've been to India, I've been to all the places,

295
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,560
and I have to go about with My husband also. I've been to Russia,

296
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,360
I've been to China, all over the places, Argentina, every place.

297
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,640
Journalist: Apart from the material circumstances of life,

298
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,080
what do You think is different between the West and the East?

299
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,920
Just forgetting the material circumstances,

300
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,240
You know, what do You think

301
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,040
is different about us?
Shri Mataji: Western people?

302
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,880
Journalist: Yeah, and the Eastern people.
Shri Mataji: They are very…

303
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,280
Sahaja Yogi: Other than material aspects.
Journalist: Yeah.

304
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,440
Shri Mataji: No, they are very honest people, very honest.

305
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,160
Journalist: Western?

306
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,640
Shri Mataji: Very honest, they are very honest people.

307
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,520
Really, they are honest, no doubt of it.

308
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,680
And about themselves also they are very honest.

309
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,720
I have tremendous regard for them.

310
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,560
You see, the Indian real gurus, as you may call them,

311
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,880
are even frightened of Indians, leave alone the Westerners, you see.

312
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,240
They think they'll be crucified or their throats will be cut.

313
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,000
They have been tortured also, I must say.

314
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,320
One fellow cannot walk

315
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,520
because his legs were broken and hands were broken.

316
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,560
Because, you see, there is a big struggle

317
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,440
between the reality and unreal things.

318
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,480
Because these people are having a business proposition.

319
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,800
You understand that.

320
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,920
It's a very big business organization.

321
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,040
So, if anybody says anything against it,

322
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,840
then they can pay people to get after you,

323
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,560
they can kill you, they can do anything they like.

324
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,400
It's a mafia.

325
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,560
It's not easy, to face these horrible people.

326
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,080
They are all multimillionaires.

327
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,640
Journalist: Have You suffered similar experiences

328
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,200
and people try to kill You or…

329
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,360
Shri Mataji: They try, but doesn't succeed.

330
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,440
Yesterday only we had a meeting and there were two boys

331
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,520
from this TM, I think paid by TM, whatever it is.

332
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,560
They tried to be very funny.

333
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,360
And I'd say the whole public got after them; they ran away.

334
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,160
They said, "Now you can't have it, dog-in-the-manger policy

335
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,000
you have got. Now you can't have it, so let us have it at least."

336
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,440
So they went away.

337
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,960
They try. It's all right. I mean, I expect all that.

338
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,800
Journalist: Can You just tell us something if the … Your …

339
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,200
Your yoga school is developed from…

340
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,280
Sahaja Yogi: It's not a yoga school.
Journalist: No, it's…

341
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,600
Sahaja Yogi: You get your realization, and you then become a person

342
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,240
who becomes a realized person. And you just…

343
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,120
Journalist: But it has started from … through the influence of…

344
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,280
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Not influence.

345
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,560
I got my realization when I went to India.

346
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,800
I've been looking. I've been to all these false gurus,

347
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,880
all these places where I saw some shocking things happening,

348
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,440
and I … absolutely shocked and disillusioned.

349
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,440
I was about to come home, but somebody had given me

350
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,160
Mataji's telephone number. She was in India at that time from England.

351
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,880
And I went to Her and I thought,

352
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,680
"My goodness, this is all so very different."

353
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,600
I was starting to feel incredibly peaceful and joyful,

354
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,920
and amazing things were happening inside me,

355
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,120
which were very … very wonderful,

356
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,080
and it all seemed so normal. And yet so…

357
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,400
Shri Mataji: And healthwise. First of all he improved healthwise.

358
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,040
Journalist: What was your trade…

359
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,720
Sahaja Yogi: I'm a doctor. I mean, I was very skeptical…

360
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,360
Journalist: General practitioner?
Sahaja Yogi: No, I've trained as such,

361
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,640
but I've been practicing in natural health

362
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,480
because I'm a bit disillusioned with the medical side.

363
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,960
And many of my patients had been going to India

364
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,320
on these spiritual pilgrimages — and coming back worse.

365
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,720
And I wondered why. Because I was reading all these books

366
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,600
that were saying these great gurus

367
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,880
and they were speaking about Christ, and Mohammed,

368
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,760
and Krishna, and all these things.

369
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,040
And they were coming back in a worsened condition.

370
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,440
So I thought the two things were a disparity.

371
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,120
On the one hand, they seemed to be those spiritual masters.

372
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,280
On the other hand, these people were coming back.

373
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,200
But they had a very good rationalization,

374
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,520
they'd say they were purifying themselves,

375
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,280
or they were cleansing themselves,

376
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,200
or they were going through some karmas, or something like that.

377
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,760
So I couldn't sort it all out.

378
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,440
So I went to India. I stayed there a few months.

379
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,960
And finally I met Mother.

380
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,120
And it seemed so logical, and so sensible, and so scientific.

381
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,400
I mean, it agrees with all the medical science.

382
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,400
It underpins medical science, in fact.

383
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,560
Shri Mataji: I've also studied medicine.

384
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,960
Sahaja Yogi: It was quite incredible. And now it just seems so easy.

385
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,720
Journalist: So you do some yoga practice

386
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,880
as part of your daily routine day?

387
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,120
Sahaja Yogi: Meditation in a very simplified form.

388
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,360
When you feel this cool vibration on your hand,

389
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,080
and above your head, and over your body,

390
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,200
you know that you are in meditation.
Shri Mataji: You are in meditation.

391
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,280
Sahaja Yogi: That's it. That's it.

392
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,160
Journalist: Do you do any sort of asanas or you just…

393
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,560
Sahaja Yogi: Not many. Just a few if you got a specific problem.

394
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,000
Shri Mataji: You see, it depends on. It's very scientific.

395
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,080
It depends on where you have a problem.

396
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,880
Say, for example, you have a problem in your stomach.

397
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,280
Now, you have to do certain exercise for that,

398
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,120
for a short time, till you get rid of it.

399
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,600
Or may be that you have to say certain mantras for that,

400
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,160
to excite, or to awaken, that part within you

401
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,040
into liveliness.

402
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,800
That's how … it is very scientific.

403
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,360
But gradually you'll know it, so easy it becomes,

404
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,320
the whole thing becomes so easy.

405
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,160
Because when you are expanding towards the periphery,

406
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,120
the whole thing becomes complex.

407
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,120
But when you integrate towards the center,

408
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,680
then everything is very simple,

409
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,960
you have to deal with simple principles.

410
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,640
And once you know how to manage that… for example, balance.

411
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,520
Balance in a person is very important.

412
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,000
Balance in a person is not dealt with

413
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,520
in, say … in medical science.

414
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,120
While we have one medical science,

415
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,520
then we have psychologists, we have this and that.

416
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,160
We have one doctor for one eye and another doctor for another eye.

417
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,480
Here, it's one person,

418
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,000
who is the one who cures you,

419
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,720
he diagnoses you,

420
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,400
he gives you realization — is everything.

421
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,960
The laboratory, the complete instrument is human being.

422
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,400
And this is created by God within you beautifully, it's all there.

423
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,880
Just to be connected to the mains, that's all.

424
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,280
It's all ready there.

425
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,240
I mean, nothing fantastic for Me, because I know it is there.

426
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,920
But once you get it, you are amazed how you have started working it out.

427
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,400
Because we are not aware of ourselves.

428
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,840
Every one of you can get it. Every one of you.

429
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,320
Journalist: How did You develop the Self-realization,

430
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,840
were You born with it or…

431
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,640
Shri Mataji: I was born with it.

432
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,200
Journalist: So, from the day You were born You knew it?

433
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,160
Shri Mataji: Yes. Yes.

434
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,000
Journalist: When did You know it that You have been born with it?

435
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,760
When did You discover it?

436
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,720
Shri Mataji: You see, it is like if I ask you a question

437
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,960
when did you discover you are a human being.

438
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,760
You won't be able to say.

439
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,040
It's as simple as that, you see. I was quite aware of it.

440
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,480
Journalist: When You say Self-rea— I mean, I know I'm a human being.

441
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,520
I mean, what do You mean by Self-realization here?

442
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,080
Shri Mataji: You can, everyone can get it.

443
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,000
As long as you are a human being, you get it, that's all.

444
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,040
Sahaja Yogi: It's a higher level of awareness than human awareness.

445
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,120
You're not using your thinking brain.

446
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
You're not using your emotional brain.

447
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,760
You're using what is basically the all-pervading Power of God,

448
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,400
the unconscious, about which Jung…

449
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,920
Shri Mataji: That is reflected within you.

450
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,760
Sahaja Yogi: Jung spoke about it.
Shri Mataji: You see,

451
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,960
it is reflected within you as Kundalini, we call it.

452
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,800
In Sanskrit language it is called as Kundalini.

453
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,840
But this also word is so terrifying to people,

454
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,480
those who have read about Kundalini; they get a fright.

455
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,920
She is your Mother, the one who has to give you the rebirth.

456
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,920
Now, there are people who have written so many such big books,

457
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,720
without knowing where the Kundalini lies.

458
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,960
Imagine. Absolutely vain.

459
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,960
Now, you can see it in some people, pulsation of the Kundalini.

460
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,280
We have got also on videotapes some of these things

461
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,720
when we saw on some people, where there was obstruction,

462
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,760
the pulsation goes out.

463
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,760
The pulsation, you can see sometimes

464
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,000
this triangular bone, sacrum, just pulsating.

465
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:37,640
But imagine, this thing was called as sacrum, means sacred.

466
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,960
And I asked the Greek people;

467
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,080
I said, "Why did you call it sacrum?"

468
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:48,080
They said, "We had a rapport with the Indo-Aryan group,

469
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,320
much before Alexander went to India,

470
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,400
and they told us that this bone is the sacred bone."

471
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,280
Sahaja Yogi: If you burn the bone,

472
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,240
the bone is so ossified that it's the last one to burn.

473
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,720
Shri Mataji: Yes, you need a very high temperature to burn that bone.

474
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,160
Journalist: I'll ask: You worked with Gandhi, didn't You?

475
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,640
What were Your impressions of Gandhi?

476
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,200
Shri Mataji: What are My impressions?

477
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,080
Journalist: Yeah.

478
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,800
Shri Mataji: Oh, he was a very great man,

479
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,920
very much needed at that time.

480
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,080
And if he had survived, he would have supported Sahaja Yoga

481
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,760
out and out, no doubt about it.

482
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,920
Journalist: Sorry?

483
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,480
Shri Mataji: If he had survived,

484
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,440
he would have supported Sahaja Yoga out and out.

485
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,080
Journalist: How much contact did you have with Gandhi?

486
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,880
Shri Mataji: It's quite a lot. As a child I was very close to him,

487
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,160
and he used to call Me Nepali.

488
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,760
Because according to My features were more Nepali,

489
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,640
My complexion was Nepali, he used to call Me Nepali.

490
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,000
And very affectionate towards children. Very affectionate.

491
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,520
Otherwise he was a hard-task master himself,

492
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,960
towards himself and towards others,

493
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:02,320
but very kind gentleman as far as the children were concerned.

494
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,600
And you could even overrule him by sweetness.

495
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,760
I mean, supposing he says, "I don't want to have any juice just now."

496
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,680
You can say, "Bapu, have a little bit,

497
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,440
otherwise we won't have," or something. He would just melt away.

498
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,120
So sweet inside.

499
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,680
Journalist: Have You seen the film version of him?

500
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,800
Shri Mataji: Yes, I've seen it.
Journalist: What do You think of it?

501
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,440
Shri Mataji: Film is very good, I must say. It's very good.

502
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,840
Journalist: Is it accurate?
Shri Mataji: Yes, very.

503
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,040
It is very accurate, but in some ways,

504
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,120
you see, I would say that …

505
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,600
for example, Gandhiji, you see, was an Indian.

506
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,360
And the Indian style of talking

507
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,000
is rather different from what you people talk.

508
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,240
Because you are very intelligent people and you're sharp-witted,

509
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,880
you see; you know words, I mean, you are very well read,

510
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,240
so you say few things in a very sharp way,

511
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,480
immediately you answer in a way that is …

512
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,880
very, I should say, acute, absolutely.

513
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,440
But he was an Indian, so the Indian, you see,

514
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,720
doesn't say such a … such … sudden …

515
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:12,440
he just springs with such a sudden intelligent remarks, you see.

516
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,320
They are gentler people, I think.

517
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,880
They speak in a gentler way, in a little roundabout way.

518
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,760
Sahaja Yogi: He couldn't sit on the floor properly.

519
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,080
Shri Mataji: That also you could find out

520
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,280
that he couldn't sit properly on the floor.

521
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,160
That's why— but that's not so important.

522
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,760
What I felt was the only thing…
Journalist: He did in the film.

523
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,160
I'm not a critic, he did in the film.

524
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,920
Shri Mataji: That's one thing about him,

525
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,080
and the essence of it is, you see,

526
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,800
that whatever was — which was such a short time

527
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,960
to bring forth such a deep thing —

528
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,240
I think he has done full justice.

529
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,760
Except for one point that Gandhiji never wanted to provoke.

530
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,400
He never used these sinister methods of provoking others.

531
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,240
He was a very genuine person, you see.

532
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,080
And I think that is little bit lacking.

533
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,520
He didn't do it to … just to, you see …

534
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,480
with a mind that would provoke others.

535
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,160
No, he wouldn't think of such a thing.

536
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,240
It was just he thought that if he … has no other way out.

537
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,240
Because you don't know what times we had.

538
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,360
I mean, in this picture he couldn't show anything.

539
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,160
It was very oppressive time.

540
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,400
For three hundred years, can you believe?

541
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,640
So to talk of anything was impossible.

542
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,960
My father himself went to jail many a times.

543
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,120
My mother went five times to jail.

544
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,080
Of course, later on he was Member of the Constituent Assembly,

545
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,480
Parliament, everything.

546
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,240
My brother is also a Minister of Steel now

547
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,640
in India, in the Cabinet.

548
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,840
But that time, it was so difficult, very difficult.

549
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,880
They used to torture people much more than is shown there.

550
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,640
Individually. They used to hound out.

551
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,320
Journalist: Do You know Mrs. Gandhi?

552
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,960
Shri Mataji: Oh, yes, I like her.

553
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,040
Journalist: Do You ever met her personally?

554
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,400
Shri Mataji: Yes, I've met her once or twice.

555
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,920
But I wonder if she remembers Me now.

556
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,240
You see, she is a very busy person.

557
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,320
I mean, she is a solution just now for us, we can say.

558
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,200
Journalist: What do You think are the immediate problems

559
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,240
facing India at the moment?

560
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,400
Shri Mataji: If they take to Sahaja Yoga, they can be all solved

561
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,000
because it also gives you material freedom.

562
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,960
It also gives you material blessings.

563
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,920
You see, we have too much black magic and all that in our country.

564
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,760
It's very heavy (…).

565
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,720
And once you get into those things, you get the poverty.

566
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,160
Journalist: Just on that point, Mother,

567
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,760
a couple of years ago in an interview You were more talking

568
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,520
about Self-realization and less inclined to talk about

569
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,400
so-called group miracle cures and so on.

570
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,520
I noticed in the press release

571
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,560
there's quite a heavy accent on cures.

572
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,640
Have You done that specifically,

573
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,960
to perhaps reinforce Your message or get Your message across?

574
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,440
Shri Mataji: Which one?

575
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,680
Sahaja Yogi: He is saying that there seems to be an emphasis

576
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,840
in the press release on curing.

577
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,320
Shri Mataji: No, no, I did not. Did you feel that way?

578
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,400
Oh God, I'm not doing that. Really.

579
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,520
Sahaja Yogi: "Has Your emphasis changed?" is his question.

580
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,880
Journalist: What I'm saying is that I gather that two years ago

581
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,560
that You weren't emphasizing it…

582
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,200
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. No, never, never, never.

583
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,640
Journalist: … but the press release that supports Your trip here

584
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,960
indicates the more … other side of it,

585
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,840
which, of course, has opened a little more skepticism.

586
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,000
Shri Mataji: Curing, it is a by-product. Curing is a by-product

587
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,560
of Self-realization.

588
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,320
You see, Self-realization is most important.

589
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,240
You see, God is not interested in curing every Dick, Tom and Harry.

590
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,720
Say, for example, Hitler wants to get cured. Should we cure him?

591
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
It's better cure for him to go to hell,

592
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,440
at least for one lifetime,

593
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,080
and then come back, to see what people have suffered.

594
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,200
So, it's never … accent is never on curing at all,

595
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,840
and I, out of compassion —

596
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,080
you see, because it works — I work out.

597
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,320
But this isn't important. I don't know why you felt that way.

598
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,440
I don't know what they have given you. I have no idea

599
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,640
as to what they have given you and what is accentuated,

600
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,080
but as far as I am concerned,

601
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,080
for Me Self-realization is the main thing. That's My job.

602
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,520
Sahaja Yogi: In fact, Mother takes emphasis away from curing

603
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,760
at the public programs.

604
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,560
Shri Mataji: I tell them not to cure anyone.

605
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,120
I said, if they want to cure, let them work on My photograph.

606
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,680
Let the photograph take all the load.

607
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,800
You don't take any load of curing.

608
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,680
Journalist: Perhaps then You better talk over

609
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,360
the situation with your public relations people.

610
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,400
Sahaja Yogi: We don't have any.

611
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,720
Shri Mataji: Any. We don't have any publicity, nothing.

612
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,800
They do it on their own, spontaneously.

613
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,880
They will realize if they have made mistake,

614
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,120
then put it right next time.

615
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,800
I don't know what's happening and all that. I don't know anything.

616
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,960
They are doing on their own. Let them learn.

617
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,640
They gradually learn, you see.

618
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,560
Better ways of healing and all that.

619
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,360
Let them learn. They'll all learn.

620
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,160
Journalist: Can we just clarify that:

621
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,280
do You claim that You can heal or cure?

622
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,480
Shri Mataji: I do not claim, I do it.

623
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,560
No question of claiming, you see.

624
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,200
I do it. I've done it. You can do it also.

625
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,720
Everyone can do it. This Doctor Warren has done.

626
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,760
He's cured so many people.

627
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,560
Journalist: You've just said it could be done through photograph.

628
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,760
Could You explain that?

629
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,560
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is surprising, you know.

630
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,760
Myself I was surprised, as you are,

631
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,120
that My photograph has also got vibrations

632
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,520
and people get cured with photographs.

633
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,360
In your country only when I came, the press was very kind to Me.

634
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,960
The reason was there was a lady who was sick with coma.

635
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,160
And they said she had got blood…

636
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,200
Sahaja Yogi: Cerebral aneurism.

637
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,360
Shri Mataji: Aneurism.

638
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,400
And one another disciple of Mine

639
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,000
took My photograph, put it under her head.

640
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,560
And she started getting all right,

641
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,120
in the sense that she started opening her eyes.

642
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,400
So the doctors got frightened. They said,

643
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,240
"Even if she gets all right, she will be damaged.

644
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,760
She won't be able to walk."

645
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,640
But today she's perfectly all right. Not only that,

646
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,920
but she is very hard-working Sahaja Yogini. So it's all right.

647
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,720
Journalist: How does it work? When you (…) the photograph.

648
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,800
Sahaja Yogi: How does it work? How does it work from the photograph?

649
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,480
Shri Mataji: From the photograph?

650
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,560
The photograph is a real image of Myself, you see.

651
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,480
And this My body has got a coefficience

652
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,400
which emits vibrations.

653
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,160
Same happens with the photograph.

654
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,680
That, too, has the same coefficience.

655
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,560
Of course, it hasn't got the other dimension,

656
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,760
but it also emits the vibrations

657
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,320
because of the coefficience being the same.

658
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,960
Say, even if you take Christ's photograph — it's not real,

659
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,800
because it's all come out of the unconscious, all right,

660
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,840
but there's a lot of imagination put into.

661
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,760
Any photograph if you take of any person, it is like that.

662
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,160
But there are so many things I've seen which are …

663
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,600
which have come out of the Mother Earth. They emit vibrations.

664
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,280
Like, Stonehenge in England has vibrations.

665
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,120
So many places like that have vibrations,

666
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,720
but not so strong as Mine, because I am a living person.

667
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,800
Journalist: What is Your idea of God? What is God?

668
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,200
Shri Mataji: My idea?

669
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,600
It's not only idea, but it's the truth that I feel about God.

670
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,800
God …

671
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,680
is …

672
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,400
difficult to put Him in words, isn't it?

673
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,400
Is the witness

674
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,680
of the play of His Power.

675
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,160
He is separated from His Power,

676
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,040
and He's just witnessing the play of His Power.

677
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,280
And the Power is creating,

678
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,840
is protecting, nourishing the creation,

679
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,520
and evolving it.

680
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,960
Till this play is up to the animal stage,

681
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,480
everything is under the control.

682
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,840
But to give it a greater freedom,

683
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,280
they have to give first freedom to human beings at this level.

684
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
So this freedom was granted.

685
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,480
So that you learn what is your mistake,

686
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,600
what is your right thing; you decide.

687
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,200
You develop yourself with that.

688
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,040
You create a balance within yourself.

689
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,320
And then you ascent to the spirit,

690
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,760
by which you know God's power flowing through you.

691
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,760
This is all the game is. In short I'm telling you.

692
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,080
So this God is the witness of this play.

693
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,920
He is the Father, we can say, and His power is the Holy Ghost.

694
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:11,400
And He sends His Son on this Earth to redeem people.

695
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,920
He plays a very important part, Christ, in our lives.

696
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,920
And all other Incarnations.

697
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,440
All of them have a meaning — and a place within ourself.

698
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,080
Christ also has a special place within us,

699
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,240
which is the gate of the limbic area.

700
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,160
Journalist: So You are a Christian, as well as being an Indian?

701
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,800
Shri Mataji: Oh, I'm not a Christian,

702
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,440
in the sense that I don't belong to any Church.

703
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,400
Neither I'm a real Hindu, Christian, everything.

704
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:48,720
Because they are all based on the same principle of God.

705
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,080
See, these are all flowers

706
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,560
who were …

707
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:04,280
on the same tree of life.

708
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,240
But people plucked it, saying,

709
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,840
"This is mine. I am that. I am that."

710
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,040
And then the flowers became ugly —

711
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,440
and dead.

712
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,240
That's why people think Christianity has failed you,

713
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,880
Hinduism has failed you, Islam has failed you.

714
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,280
It's not the Prophets. It's not the Incarnations.

715
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,680
It's we — by possessing them.

716
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,520
We cannot possess God.

717
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,720
We cannot possess religion, we are in religion.

718
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,520
Means religion is our valency.

719
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,640
Just like carbon has valency of four, we have valency of ten.

720
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,320
That is in this part of our being, where the attention is.

721
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,920
And if we are balanced people, if we live with moderation,

722
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,880
the ascending was fast.

723
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,800
But even the extremists of extremists have got realization.

724
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,600
So the grace is flowing

725
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,800
very generously, I should say, to achieve that.

726
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,040
Even alcoholics, you see, who come to Me — in alcoholic state —

727
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,400
become overnight wonderful people.

728
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,640
Journalist: Overnight?

729
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,320
Shri Mataji: Overnight, you'll be surp— overnight.

730
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,680
There are druggists and chemists and smokers.

731
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,920
Journalist: (…).

732
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,560
Journalist: Can You cure me of smoking?

733
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,720
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

734
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,080
Journalist: Can You cure me from nicotine?

735
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,280
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.

736
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,760
Journalist: Do You consider Yourself to be a saint or a prophet?

737
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,240
Shri Mataji: What is the relevance of this question?

738
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,440
Journalist: Well…

739
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,000
Shri Mataji: I just don't understand.

740
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,880
Everyone of them are asking, "Do you consider?"

741
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,400
If I was not considering Myself, why would I work like this?

742
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,160
Do I think I'm a thief?

743
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,520
Or what I think of Myself? You see, it's a funny question, isn't it?

744
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
You just tell Me. I don't understand the relevance.

745
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,520
Because everyone of them are asking these questions to Me:

746
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,880
"Do you think?" It's a— what is it?

747
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,960
I must be thinking something about it, I must be aware of Myself,

748
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,640
otherwise I won't take up this work.

749
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,520
See now: I have a husband who loves Me very much,

750
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,520
I have a very comfortable house of My own,

751
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,520
I have My own children and grandchildren.

752
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,240
I don't get anything out of this for Me,

753
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,840
except that I have a satisfaction that I'm sharing My joy

754
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,680
with all of you. All right?

755
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,960
Now, unless and until I'm aware of Myself,

756
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,720
do you think I will do such a thing?

757
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,800
Anyone of you will do this thing without getting anything out of it?

758
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,240
Can anyone in this world can do such a thing? Tell Me.

759
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,680
Without any purpose?

760
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,600
Journalist: Well, I think somebody's just called You

761
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,080
the greatest living saint and…

762
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,240
Shri Mataji: Yes. I mean, they can call Me anything, you see.

763
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,160
But what I'm saying — that, you see …

764
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,080
asking this question … supposing I said, "Yes, I think so."

765
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,960
Then you'll say, "She is very ego-oriented." All right.

766
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,080
If I say, "I don't think so," then suggest, "She's diffident."

767
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,240
You see, it's a very funny thing, you know.

768
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,680
So it's like a … this is a question that is irrelevant.

769
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,680
Unless and until I am aware of it, why will I do this work?

770
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,320
Journalist: I suppose, in the West we think of saints

771
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,640
with halos around their head, you see.

772
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,400
Shri Mataji: Yes, you can see that also if you become realized souls.

773
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,400
You do. You will see that. Many see that.

774
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,800
I will show you one photograph. Have you got that? Let us see it.

775
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,840
YOGINI: This is a nice one.
Sahaja Yogi: Ah, there. That one.

776
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,120
Shri Mataji: Just see this photograph. Can you explain?

777
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,040
Journalist: Sorry?

778
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,520
Shri Mataji: This photograph. I'm sitting in a village, outside.

779
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,880
And this … seven times this light fell on Me.

780
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,880
Have you seen Christ pray in that garden?

781
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,120
Journalist: Oh yes, yes.

782
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,800
Shri Mataji: And this is the photograph. See now.

783
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,880
There are many other things people have seen in My photographs.

784
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,760
There's one photograph where they have seen

785
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,240
lights coming out of My fingers, My toes.

786
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,600
They have got these photographs. So for you…

787
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,120
Journalist: Couldn't that just be a reflection from a glass

788
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,440
or something like that?
Shri Mataji: No, no.

789
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,000
This has happened seven times and when I put down My head.

790
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,200
None of them could see at that time. It's not through a reflection.

791
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,080
Ask the photographer if she can explain.

792
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,720
Sahaja Yogi: We had the expertation.

793
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,760
Shri Mataji: All artificial gurus would try this trick, you see.

794
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,600
Journalist: I understand You began

795
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,600
teaching Self-realization of people in 1970? Is that right or…

796
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,640
Shri Mataji: No, not Self-realization. I had "human-realization".

797
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,840
Journalist: Right.

798
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,280
Shri Mataji: I understood human beings at that time.

799
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,120
They are very complicated, I must say.

800
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,000
So many permutations and combinations.

801
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:40,040
And I had to study them thoroughly.

802
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,520
Because My father himself was a realized soul and he told Me

803
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,720
that "No use talking about God, saying anything about Him —

804
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,560
it will become another Bible, another Gita.

805
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,760
You have to find out a mass realization method.

806
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,440
It has to work on masses."

807
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,760
And also you have seen any discovery

808
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,040
which is not used for masses is wasted.

809
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,080
And he said, "Otherwise, same thing will happen.

810
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,760
You will be crucified or they'll kill you. You'll be finished."

811
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,040
Then I knew I had come for this work, to achieve that.

812
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:22,080
So I had to study, work it out,

813
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:27,400
the method by which en-masse evolution could be achieved.

814
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,400
And when I did it, I would say it was My human-realization,

815
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:37,600
in the sense that I found an opportune time to start.

816
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,720
Journalist: Will You continue to do this travel around the world

817
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,000
until You die or…
Shri Mataji: What is it?

818
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,080
Sahaja Yogi: Will You continue to travel around the world

819
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,280
doing this work until You die?

820
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,720
Shri Mataji: It's very futuristic.

821
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,040
I don't think of My death so far.

822
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,160
As long as I can do, I'll do it, but …

823
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,640
I mean, if some … these people are realized,

824
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,320
then, I think, they'll give Me some rest sometime, isn't it?

825
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,840
I must also have some rest. Now I am sixty years of age.

826
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,800
How long do you want Me to live? It's for you to decide.

827
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,600
If you take over, then I need not live.

828
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,680
Journalist: You spend more … most of the time in London now, do You?

829
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,520
Shri Mataji: Yes. Because My husband is there, My family…

830
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,320
And he is a very busy man himself, you see, he is a…

831
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,680
Journalist: Where did You come from originally in India?

832
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,760
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

833
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,640
Journalist: Where did You live originally in India?

834
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,080
Shri Mataji: Originally, near Ahmednagar.

835
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,360
It's the where the … our dynasty…

836
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,360
Journalist: I mean, of big cities where … is that near a big city?

837
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,920
Shri Mataji: It's a … it's a … district place,

838
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,720
it's not a very big city, Ahmednagar. It's very near…

839
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,240
Journalist: What is the biggest city it's near? Or…

840
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,280
Shri Mataji: I lived in … with My husband in Delhi

841
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,960
because he was with the former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri.

842
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,920
He was his secretary.
Journalist: Ahh.

843
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,480
Shri Mataji: Yes. And then I lived … he went to Tashkent also with him.

844
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,760
He was throughout with him. And then I lived in Bombay

845
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,640
because he was Chairman of Shipping Corporation of India.

846
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,040
For years together I lived in cities.

847
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,240
I studied in Lucknow, in Lahore, in Medical College.

848
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,080
That's how I lived in cities.

849
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,760
But originally, My family,

850
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,320
all of them come from this place, Ahmednagar.

851
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,440
I was born in a small little hill station,

852
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,640
which is on the tropic of Cancer.

853
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,800
Journalist: Mother, what about reincarnation?

854
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,160
Is that part of Your philosophy?

855
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,320
Sahaja Yogi: Is reincarnation part of Your philosophy?

856
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,200
Reincarnation.

857
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,680
Shri Mataji: Of whom?

858
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,680
Journalist: Of everybody.

859
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,760
When we physically pass away, do we return (…)?

860
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,080
Shri Mataji: Yes. Are you mean … you mean human beings?

861
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,040
Journalist: Yes.

862
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,400
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course, of course. Of course.

863
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,800
Journalist: Perhaps then You could look at another situation,

864
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,800
one of the mysteries of life. There are many people

865
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,760
who appear to be honest, sincere and work hard,

866
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,120
who suffer enormous tragedy and so on.

867
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,360
And there are people — I could name a couple but I won't —

868
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,720
who seem to flow through,

869
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,440
but they're not necessarily liked by their mate,

870
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,520
You know, by their fellow human beings.

871
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,880
Is there a reason for that, perhaps attached spirits

872
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,360
or something like that?

873
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,000
Shri Mataji: Going to false gurus is very dangerous,

874
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,480
is extremely dangerous. It's not so superficially to be treated.

875
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,000
You see, money I don't mind.

876
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,800
Because if they are thugs, all right, there are so many thugs.

877
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,320
We have mafia, we have all kind of things.

878
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,840
It doesn't matter, let them be thugs.

879
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,480
But it's not so simple as we think. It's very deep.

880
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,760
You see, they can bring forth all the diseases

881
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,080
which are incurable within us.

882
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,200
Say, myelitis … what you call … osteomyelitis,

883
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,400
cancer,

884
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,520
heart attacks — all kinds of diseases

885
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,800
which are absolutely incurable, beyond our control.

886
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,720
Then depressions, and then stresses within us…

887
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,880
also they can bring …

888
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:12,480
quite a lot of them give epilepsy to people, abnormal behavior.

889
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,080
Even in the plane if I am sitting, you see,

890
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,360
I find some people are just doing like this, like that.

891
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,840
And most of them have been to this TM.

892
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,480
They have paid thousands and thousands of pounds

893
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:29,360
to achieve that kind of a funny thing, burning this center,

894
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,440
by which their necks come out like that

895
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,440
and they are all the time twitching themselves or jumping.

896
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,640
Sahaja Yogi: He asked about spiritual possession too, Mother.

897
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,560
He asked about spiritual possessions.

898
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,840
Shri Mataji: Of course, this is spiritual possession.

899
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,600
Yes it is spiritual possessions. They become…

900
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,800
Journalist: And did You have a method of driving away that spirit?

901
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,720
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, I do. I do try. You see, even…

902
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,280
Journalist: So that's the key to solving many of these diseases.

903
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,440
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, of course, of course. Because, you see,

904
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,320
the cabbages are better sometimes than these people.

905
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,480
Poor things! You know, they are so suppressed

906
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,800
that even if you show them a garlic,

907
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,640
they are frightened and they tremble like this.

908
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,320
Garlic, can you imagine? They are afraid of garlics

909
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,280
and afraid of onions. I mean, what are their myths?

910
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:18,080
Some are just sex-points, without any sex activity.

911
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,640
Horrible things they are!

912
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,520
They are neither human beings nor animals.

913
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,800
Terribly possessed, no doubt.

914
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,480
They can be cured, absolutely.

915
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,320
We have cured so many like that. You can meet so many …

916
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,840
you won't believe them that they have been like that.

917
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:41,200
There's one gentleman here, standing, you can see him…

918
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,480
Sahaja Yogi: He was a flyer in TM.

919
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,920
Journalist: What's a flyer?
Sahaja Yogi: Who can levitate.

920
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,960
Shri Mataji: You see, all they levitate, so-called.

921
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,120
Sitting on the floor you have to jump, you see.

922
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,400
And then you think that you are flying. And then you get possessed.

923
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,080
And they just start … sitting down they just come out of their seats,

924
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,720
you see, as if somebody had ejected them out.

925
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,080
This is supposed to be flying.

926
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,680
Journalist: Do You (…)?

927
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,960
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

928
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,560
Journalist: You ruined his theory, didn't You?

929
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,320
Shri Mataji: Oh, horrible things they do.

930
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,880
In one of our ashrams, one fellow came

931
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:25,920
because he went to a barbershop and he was having a …

932
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,240
so he had to spend some time waiting outside.

933
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,400
So he saw one magazine there, where it was written about Sahaja Yoga,

934
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,600
in a magazine called Yoga Today.

935
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,280
They are not supposed to read anything else, you see.

936
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,720
They are banned. Everything is secret. It's all mafia style.

937
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,640
So poor man, you see, hesitatingly took that thing,

938
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,520
and he took that Yoga Today to read.

939
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,840
And there was My picture which said that "If you feel cool breeze

940
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,120
on this picture, then know that you are a realized soul."

941
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,680
So he tried to put the hands,

942
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,720
and in the barbershop hall he went into contortions.

943
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,320
So he got such a fright that he telephoned to our ashram,

944
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:06,000
and the gentleman who was on the phone

945
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,160
was also … not a TM but another type;

946
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,120
and he asked him, "Are you feeling hot?"

947
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,880
He said, "I'm boiling this side."

948
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,040
He said, "Have you done TM?" He said, "Yes. But how do you know?"

949
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,680
He said, "We know." Then he came down.

950
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,280
But when he came down there … and these people just took My name,

951
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,400
and the fellow went into such a contortion

952
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,560
and started barking like a dog

953
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,080
that all the Sahaja Yogis got a fright,

954
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,720
and they sent Me a SOS that "Mother, please come to our help!"

955
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,480
And I was going to have big … lots of people for dinner.

956
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,160
I said, "What's it happening?"

957
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,600
He said, "There's a fellow who came here, he's behaving like this,

958
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,040
and we are all frightened of him."

959
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,480
Then I told them what is to be done to pacify him.

960
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,960
But this fellow today is a very big Sahaja Yogi in London.

961
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:54,360
He was a manager of a very big estate company.

962
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,840
He lost his job, lost his money.

963
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,080
He became penniless doing this TM.

964
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,200
But now I am told this Rajneesh is coming to your Australia

965
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,400
to bless you all.

966
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,960
This fellow Rajneesh, who is ousted from America…

967
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,480
Sahaja Yogi: The orange people, they're called.

968
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,800
Shri Mataji: The orange people. He is trying to come here,

969
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,200
so be careful.

970
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,240
Sahaja Yogi: The government's already typing up its regulations now.

971
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,000
Shri Mataji: He's bought only thirty-six Rolls-Royces

972
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,240
and three aeroplanes.

973
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,680
I don't know what his ambitions are out of Australians.

974
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,680
Sahaja Yogi: He's been thrown out of India. Now that he got a dep—

975
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,160
Shri Mataji: Not thrown out, he ran away.

976
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,880
Sahaja Yogi: He'd run away, sorry. He had a deportation order in America now.

977
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,080
We hear this coming through.

978
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,680
Journalist: What's his name?

979
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,080
Sahaja Yogi: Rajneesh.

980
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,640
Shri Mataji: These orange people, you see.

981
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,160
Journalist: What is bad about Rajneesh?

982
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,440
Shri Mataji: Horrible.

983
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,440
Journalist: But why?

984
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,880
Shri Mataji: You see, what he does: he makes you into a sex-point.

985
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,840
He has mass sex. Mass sex, you see. Horrible things.

986
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,640
Journalist: Some people think that's all right.

987
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,280
Shri Mataji: Yes, those who like it go there and become mad, that's all.

988
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,880
That's all. You pay for it.

989
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,960
We have a film. I think we have a film. We can show you.

990
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,480
See, somebody has taken secretly the film of his work.

991
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,480
Sahaja Yogi: One of them, who is disenchanted.

992
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,480
Shri Mataji: One of them. He took a secret film of what they do inside.

993
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:29,080
And that was released in London, called as "God Who Ran Away".

994
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,000
And in that they showed this mass thing and all that.

995
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,120
So what he does: he makes people absolutely impotent.

996
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,280
They become impotent by his method.

997
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,400
Possesses them at the sex point. And talks about sex all the time.

998
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:45,320
So they are so restless that they become mad.

999
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,320
And they give him money as much as he wants, you see.

1000
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,560
He has told so many women that he was their husband

1001
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,760
in his previous lives. So they gave all their ornaments to him.

1002
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,080
One Indian lady gave all her jewellery to him,

1003
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,720
very expensive jewellery.

1004
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,800
So his brother and his … her … she was a widow.

1005
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,280
Her brother and brother-in-law came to Me with her,

1006
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,400
that "Please, Mother, cure her." I asked her, "Why did you give?"

1007
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,480
She said, "He was my husband in his previous life."

1008
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,800
I said, "Who told you?" She said, "He told me."

1009
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,880
I said, "But why do you believe?" She said, "I also feel the same way."

1010
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,800
I said, "But what about the husband whom you married,

1011
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,440
from whom you have children, who has given you all this jewellery?

1012
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,920
And why should you give it to this man, whom you never married?"

1013
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,560
"No, I believe what he said."

1014
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,280
She was absolutely in complete possession of him.

1015
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:41,360
And no one knows where she is now. No one knows.

1016
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,800
Journalist: There is … sorry … there are some other cults in Australia,

1017
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,400
and (…) would probably including the Moonies

1018
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,720
and the Hare Krishnas. What are Your opinions on them?

1019
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,840
Shri Mataji: Now, Moonies, of course, you know all very well.

1020
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,840
I need not tell about them.

1021
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,520
Journalist: You don't approve the Moonies?

1022
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,000
Shri Mataji: Of course not.

1023
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,480
You see, when you become a Sahaja Yogi, you start loving your parents,

1024
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:07,800
loving your children, loving everyone. You solve your problems.

1025
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,760
You don't hate anyone. You don't run away from anyone.

1026
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,760
On the contrary, if these things happen, this is anti-God activity,

1027
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,000
absolutely anti-God activity,

1028
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,640
that you get out of your families completely,

1029
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,800
you have nothing to do with anyone.

1030
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,720
This is absolutely anti-God.

1031
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:31,920
The another sect is our great, what you call them, Hare Ramas.

1032
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,600
And the first basic mistake they make

1033
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,000
is to say that vegetarianism is just way to God.

1034
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,520
Taking Krishna's name, specially.

1035
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:44,280
Because Shri Krishna, in Gita,

1036
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,560
the first chapter — is very outset —

1037
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,600
He told Arjuna that "You have to kill."

1038
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,440
Human beings, leave alone animals.

1039
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,800
Then he said, "How can I kill! Because there are my gurus

1040
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,720
and there are my relations!"

1041
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,000
So He said, "You have to kill them.

1042
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,920
To achieve a higher goal, you have to give up your lower goals."

1043
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,680
This is what exactly He told.

1044
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,040
Then later on it was introduced, in the Gita,

1045
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,200
that vegetarianism leads you to God. I don't know how.

1046
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,680
Because they said

1047
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:25,440
that the people who are left-sided, emotional people,

1048
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:30,840
eat more meat, which is scientifically not true.

1049
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:35,520
Those who are morbid people, those who are left-sided —

1050
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,920
means who have got … what you can say … conditioned people —

1051
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,560
they seldom eat meat.

1052
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,600
The people who eat meat are the rajasic people,

1053
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,920
are the people who are more aggressive, more active.

1054
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,520
So the inactive people eat less meat

1055
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,040
because protein acts as an activity.

1056
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,440
So it's scientifically also.

1057
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,680
But they don't understand science or anything, you see.

1058
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:04,440
These people are told that "You must not eat meat."

1059
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,400
Finished. That's the end of a way.

1060
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,920
Now, in India, out of poverty, so many people are not eating meat.

1061
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,640
By not eating meat if you go to God, then everybody else was wrong —

1062
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,800
because Krishna Himself used to eat and Rama Himself ate.

1063
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,880
Even Buddha ate it, because He died … because He died …

1064
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,240
Journalist: Buddha ate meat?
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

1065
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,760
Journalist: Ate … ate meat?
Shri Mataji: Yes, He ate.

1066
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:32,200
And He died because He ate a raw — by mistake — a raw meat

1067
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,760
of a … pig.

1068
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,600
Or a wild boar, just wild boar. Of a wild boar.

1069
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,720
So, He was eating. And in India

1070
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,680
only the so-called Brahmins don't eat, so-called Brahmins.

1071
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,160
Because they thought this is the best way of befooling people.

1072
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,960
But not that I am for eating meat or eating vegetables.

1073
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,680
It depends on your temperament, what sort of a temperament you have.

1074
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:00,600
Supposing you are very aggressive — it's better to eat vegetables.

1075
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,960
Journalist: Carrots.
Shri Mataji: Yes. Grass.

1076
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,360
But if you are non-aggressive

1077
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,280
and you get conditioned very easily, suppressed type,

1078
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,720
then you better eat meat.

1079
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,920
Sahaja Yogi: I'm afraid we're going to have to finish it there.

1080
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,840
Those that want to, you can see Mother privately and …

1081
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,560
for an interview if you want to.

1082
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,560
That can be arranged later. So, can we wind it up? Are there any…

1083
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,560
Shri Mataji: On one point I'll say about them

1084
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:31,400
that what these people are doing in India is something so shocking.

1085
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:36,920
I went to many places, in the district places,

1086
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,560
and the people like you, the newspaper people, came and said,

1087
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,600
"Mother, why are You carrying these people in the villages here?

1088
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,680
We have had enough of them." I said, "Why? What happened?"

1089
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,440
They said, "We have so many beggars now let loose.

1090
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:53,000
These people are now walking in the villages, you see, and begging.

1091
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,320
And they are torturing everyone there.

1092
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,280
Because our villages don't have so much money to look after them.

1093
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,360
In the beginning, of course, they tried."

1094
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,520
And they all bombard Me with questions

1095
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,560
that "Why do you carry these people? They'll also come here as beggars."

1096
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,080
I said, "No, they are all employed people.

1097
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:11,640
They are not beggars, don't be worried." They can't believe it.

1098
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,720
They said, "Now, first they came as aggressors

1099
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,640
and now they are coming as beggars and troubling us.

1100
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,560
And a person is begging at your house."

1101
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,920
Journalist: Is that the hippies?
Shri Mataji: Yes.

1102
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,720
The hippies and these, also these Hare Ramas.

1103
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,360
This is their special job.

1104
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:29,120
And you said that … you see, they say they are saints.

1105
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,800
So they said, "We can't even eat our food properly,

1106
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,960
because they are standing at your doorstep asking for alms, you see.

1107
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,480
Whatever we have we give them: 'Baba, save us from your problems!'"

1108
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,760
Journalist: It's like they play reverse

1109
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,240
(…), isn't it?
Shri Mataji: Yes. Imagine!

1110
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,160
And they think they are leading a very sane life, you know.

1111
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,840
For only eating vegetarian food,

1112
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,600
they think they are very sane people.

1113
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,840
God's people are never beggars.

1114
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,160
They must have self-esteem and self-respect.

1115
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:58,960
If they feel insulted, then they should give up this profession.

1116
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,920
Sahaja Yogi: OK, those that want to see Mother further, see Ian,

1117
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,480
he's at the back there.

1118
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:08,640
And we'll take it step further then. Thank you very much.

1119
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,040
Journalist: Thanks very much for Your time.

1120
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,200
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much all of you. Thank you very much.

1121
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,640
I hope you convey the message

1122
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,680
so that many people get their realization

1123
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,840
and you don't have any more diseases,

1124
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,560
anything left in this country.

1125
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,440
Sahaja Yogi: Let them know that Mother is speaking tonight

1126
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,440
and tomorrow night and Thursday night at the exhibition hall,

1127
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,960
exhibition buildings in Melbourne.

1128
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,440
And She gives the experience at the program.

1129
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,400
Shri Mataji: It acts. The main thing is it acts.

1130
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,120
Sahaja Yogi: She actually gives the experience

1131
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,600
of Self-realization at the program.

1132
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,800
Shri Mataji: Yes, I will, I will, there.

1133
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,800
It has to act. That's the difference between others and Me, at least.

1134
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,840
That much one can see clearly. It immediately changes you.

1135
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,600
Yesterday we had one cancer patient of liver.

1136
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,440
We should follow it, that case up.

1137
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,440
Now, doctors have told him, "Within one month

1138
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:01,320
you are going to die," you see. And I told him, "All right."

1139
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,680
I made him sit with his left hand towards Me and right hand outside.

1140
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,360
He started feeling much better. And healthier.

1141
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,840
And if he is cured, that's a proof.

1142
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,640
Sahaja Yogi: And it's happened many times, under medical supervision.

1143
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:18,080
Shri Mataji: I've also cured our president, Mr. Sanjiva Reddy.

1144
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,800
If you want, you can write to him and find out.

1145
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,760
He is cured of his cancer.

1146
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,480
Journalist: Where is that person that had cancer

1147
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,640
that you saw in Australia?

1148
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,960
Shri Mataji: Here in Adelaide. He came only yesterday,

1149
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,400
and he felt very much better after that.

1150
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,280
So many people felt better.

1151
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:37,440
Some people had stomach trouble, and some people had frozen arms…

1152
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,560
Everybody felt better.

1153
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,920
Their arms opened out, automatically.

1154
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,560
Journalist: When You claim cures like that,

1155
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:48,000
do You get flak from the medical profession and…

1156
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,600
Sahaja Yogi: When You claim cures like that,

1157
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,880
do the medical profession oppose You?

1158
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,600
Shri Mataji: No, I have many doctors who are My disciples now.

1159
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,920
Many doctors. You see, there are so many things still left

1160
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:00,000
to the doctors to do. I'm not interested in patients.

1161
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,520
But if they come to My program, they get all right.

1162
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,640
I'm not (…), I don't go to hospitals.

1163
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,720
Sahaja Yogi: It challenges too much, challenges too much

1164
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,080
within our fabric of knowledge.

1165
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,160
Shri Mataji: No, but they won't be angry with Me, I'm sure,

1166
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:13,040
because they are overloaded with patients.

1167
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,000
They won't be so angry, I can assure you.

1168
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,760
They won't be so angry.
Journalist: That's very true.

1169
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,680
Shri Mataji: You see, I'm not interested in curing,

1170
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,880
but they take … if they get cured, what should I do?

1171
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,440
Automatically they get cured.

1172
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,800
Sahaja Yogi: Certainly the people that develop their realization

1173
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,480
get better. That's not … there's no question about.
