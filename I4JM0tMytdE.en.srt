00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:44,794
- Today

2
00:19:45,471 --> 00:19:47,616
in this

3
00:19:47,616 --> 00:19:49,143
blessed place

4
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:50,957
of Mahaganesha

5
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,516
we have all assembled

6
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:57,071
to go deep into our own beings,

7
00:19:58,464 --> 00:19:59,789
To enjoy our own glory.

8
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:03,006
One has to remember

9
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,336
that the very first thing

10
00:20:08,226 --> 00:20:09,796
God created on this earth

11
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:11,516
was Shri Ganesha

12
00:20:11,516 --> 00:20:13,843
because he could emit

13
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:15,759
holiness.

14
00:20:23,976 --> 00:20:26,016
He exists as Chaitanya

15
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:31,116
and this Chaitanya exists
in the atoms and molecules,

16
00:20:31,116 --> 00:20:32,426
As you know very well,

17
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:37,199
As vibrations symmetric and isometric.

18
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,396
These vibrations

19
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:46,876
later on start expressing themselves

20
00:20:49,806 --> 00:20:51,066
in the plant kingdom

21
00:20:52,526 --> 00:20:53,789
as life force.

22
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:58,897
And you see how they are

23
00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:00,499
kept under a bondage.

24
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:04,096
A tree that is

25
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:08,666
a mango tree will grow
up to a certain point.

26
00:21:15,503 --> 00:21:18,949
A coconut tree will grow
up to a certain point.

27
00:21:21,826 --> 00:21:23,156
It's all under control.

28
00:21:24,836 --> 00:21:28,496
And then it is expressed in the animals

29
00:21:30,016 --> 00:21:31,156
where it binds them.

30
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:34,199
That's why they're called
pashus, inside their bondage.

31
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:41,356
But in the human beings, it is expressed as

32
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:44,249
auspiciousness

33
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:48,588
and ultimately as the epitome,

34
00:21:48,588 --> 00:21:49,588
as holiness.

35
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:53,629
Holiness

36
00:21:55,201 --> 00:21:56,993
is to be understood

37
00:21:58,976 --> 00:22:02,893
in its essence as
well as in this context.

38
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:12,051
Holiness is an innate
quality of personality.

39
00:22:14,726 --> 00:22:16,559
Where a person rejects

40
00:22:17,726 --> 00:22:19,519
all that is unholy,

41
00:22:21,996 --> 00:22:23,669
All that is inauspicious.

42
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:30,876
The ego doesn't play any part.

43
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:33,676
Up to the animal stage,

44
00:22:33,676 --> 00:22:35,636
ego doesn't exist.

45
00:22:35,636 --> 00:22:37,439
But in the human stage

46
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:40,786
you are given freedom to choose

47
00:22:45,356 --> 00:22:48,376
whether you want holiness

48
00:22:48,376 --> 00:22:49,209
or not.

49
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:52,439
But in the ego of man,

50
00:22:55,466 --> 00:22:56,299
he might say

51
00:22:56,299 --> 00:22:57,381
"what's wrong?"

52
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:03,951
And he may fight

53
00:23:06,316 --> 00:23:08,648
All the rules and
regulations of the Divine

54
00:23:08,648 --> 00:23:11,239
And take to unholy behavior.

55
00:23:14,446 --> 00:23:16,100
But then he goes amok.

56
00:23:19,943 --> 00:23:22,486
Today we can see the results

57
00:23:23,396 --> 00:23:24,609
in this short time.

58
00:23:27,046 --> 00:23:27,879
The results

59
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:31,159
of this defiance.

60
00:23:37,986 --> 00:23:39,136
In the West, especially,

61
00:23:40,696 --> 00:23:42,262
they're finding it impossible

62
00:23:42,262 --> 00:23:43,529
to retreat back.

63
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,314
To begin with

64
00:23:47,196 --> 00:23:48,586
people laugh at such people.

65
00:23:50,713 --> 00:23:53,043
They make fun of them.

66
00:23:55,846 --> 00:23:59,529
but holiness is the power within us.

67
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:04,766
As you have heard

68
00:24:04,766 --> 00:24:07,566
that Rajput ladies

69
00:24:07,566 --> 00:24:12,300
used to sacrifice their bodies so that

70
00:24:14,076 --> 00:24:18,299
nobody tries to destroy their holiness,

71
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,857
Their chastity,

72
00:24:20,246 --> 00:24:23,913
because they realise the power that lies

73
00:24:23,914 --> 00:24:26,343
behind this chastity.

74
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,386
This sense of chastity

75
00:24:39,786 --> 00:24:44,500
has helped so many women in this country

76
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:48,543
to lead a very dynamic

77
00:24:49,886 --> 00:24:51,586
and holy life.

78
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,115
It is said that without holiness

79
00:24:59,116 --> 00:25:03,570
you cannot work out

80
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:05,486
anything.

81
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:10,699
Even, I've heard that

82
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,299
in India

83
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,671
people believe

84
00:25:13,843 --> 00:25:17,043
that if you have to do wrestling,

85
00:25:17,214 --> 00:25:19,557
the wrestler has to be a holy person.

86
00:25:20,106 --> 00:25:23,643
If he's an unholy person, ultimately

87
00:25:23,644 --> 00:25:26,943
he will fail in life.

88
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:30,186
Even those who play other games

89
00:25:30,186 --> 00:25:33,596
have to be holy like Hanumana,

90
00:25:33,596 --> 00:25:36,571
otherwise, they cannot

91
00:25:36,731 --> 00:25:39,942
continue with their games

92
00:25:39,943 --> 00:25:42,729
and they might develop
some sort of problems

93
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,229
within themselves.

94
00:25:46,229 --> 00:25:51,186
The warriors who went on the wars

95
00:25:51,357 --> 00:25:52,929
and fought

96
00:25:53,814 --> 00:25:56,771
Other people had to lead a very holy life

97
00:25:57,276 --> 00:26:00,714
otherwise they would suffer.

98
00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:03,828
As you have seen people
coming back from Vietnam

99
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,614
have become mad people.

100
00:26:08,286 --> 00:26:10,657
In every walk of life

101
00:26:11,057 --> 00:26:13,514
holiness was the most important part,

102
00:26:14,871 --> 00:26:16,929
Most important subject

103
00:26:17,471 --> 00:26:19,343
that was to be looked after.

104
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:27,329
No reaction took place to
people who fought with Shivaji.

105
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:34,071
But when I see the reaction of
war in some other countries,

106
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:35,757
I'm quite surprised.

107
00:26:38,157 --> 00:26:39,700
The reason is

108
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:41,929
while fighting the war

109
00:26:42,286 --> 00:26:44,642
they fell into a trap of their ego

110
00:26:44,643 --> 00:26:48,029
and did not care for their chastity.

111
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:52,229
Chastity is not only meant for women.

112
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:53,729
That's a very wrong idea.

113
00:26:53,876 --> 00:26:57,257
It's very much more for men.

114
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,913
Those who lead a chaste life

115
00:26:59,914 --> 00:27:02,786
are the people who are glorious.

116
00:27:03,043 --> 00:27:06,186
Tejas Punja, as we call it.

117
00:27:09,979 --> 00:27:14,443
For Sahaja Yogis, the most important thing

118
00:27:14,614 --> 00:27:18,371
is to lead a very holy life.

119
00:27:18,443 --> 00:27:21,314
Everything else, is mundane.

120
00:27:26,243 --> 00:27:27,686
Christ,

121
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,143
who came on this earth

122
00:27:30,243 --> 00:27:31,857
As I told you,

123
00:27:31,986 --> 00:27:33,942
was the incarnation of the same

124
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,386
Holiness as Shri Ganesha.

125
00:27:36,629 --> 00:27:39,771
He had gone to this extent to say

126
00:27:39,843 --> 00:27:43,986
That thou shall not
have adulterous eyes.

127
00:27:44,771 --> 00:27:47,914
Even your eyes should be holy

128
00:27:50,243 --> 00:27:51,700
and innocent.

129
00:27:52,929 --> 00:27:55,729
Innocence gives you that holiness.

130
00:27:55,914 --> 00:27:58,356
As the children are

131
00:27:58,357 --> 00:28:00,171
holy people,

132
00:28:00,457 --> 00:28:01,857
because

133
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,900
they are so innocent.

134
00:28:06,129 --> 00:28:09,857
There are so many things to
be learned from children.

135
00:28:09,858 --> 00:28:11,628
In their simplicity,

136
00:28:11,629 --> 00:28:13,629
In their innocence,

137
00:28:15,229 --> 00:28:18,943
They do not indulge into
things which are unholy.

138
00:28:20,557 --> 00:28:23,643
Holiness is not only concerned

139
00:28:25,714 --> 00:28:28,614
with your married life.

140
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,814
Also, it's concerned
with your political life,

141
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,600
With your economic life,

142
00:28:38,786 --> 00:28:40,743
With your national life.

143
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,643
Chastity is the only keynote

144
00:28:49,457 --> 00:28:50,700
for improving

145
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,600
all the problems,

146
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:55,514
all the problematic

147
00:28:57,829 --> 00:28:59,400
questions

148
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:02,543
or else solving them completely.

149
00:29:04,557 --> 00:29:09,171
There's only one danger
among chaste people also,

150
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,114
that they might become extremely

151
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,829
dry

152
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:16,843
or could become

153
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:21,757
very hot tempered.

154
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:23,729
Sometimes also ego-oriented.

155
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:27,243
But just the opposite of Shri Ganesha,

156
00:29:27,443 --> 00:29:29,000
who is on the left side.

157
00:29:29,543 --> 00:29:31,571
Shri Ganesha's holiness

158
00:29:31,643 --> 00:29:34,857
is that of a child, eternal childhood.

159
00:29:35,143 --> 00:29:36,400
It's so sweet.

160
00:29:38,186 --> 00:29:41,186
The whole movement of his body

161
00:29:41,187 --> 00:29:42,700
is so delicate

162
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,557
and so sweet.

163
00:29:44,843 --> 00:29:45,900
Yet,

164
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:50,843
so charming.

165
00:29:58,972 --> 00:30:00,714
He eats

166
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,985
a Modaka

167
00:30:01,986 --> 00:30:03,071
which is a

168
00:30:03,072 --> 00:30:05,014
sweet which is

169
00:30:05,015 --> 00:30:06,428
very simple to make

170
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,957
and very tasty.

171
00:30:10,414 --> 00:30:11,642
To show that

172
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,470
we should have

173
00:30:13,471 --> 00:30:14,670
sweet

174
00:30:14,671 --> 00:30:16,299
temperament

175
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,900
Sweet nature.

176
00:30:22,586 --> 00:30:25,271
So the idea that people
who are very chaste

177
00:30:26,614 --> 00:30:29,386
are very rough, hot tempered

178
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:31,457
is absolutely wrong.

179
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:33,856
Especially for ladies.

180
00:30:33,857 --> 00:30:36,086
It's very important

181
00:30:37,257 --> 00:30:38,085
that

182
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,799
if they have to

183
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,199
understand Sahaja Yoga,

184
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,000
they must know that Shri Ganesha

185
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,542
works on the left side

186
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:47,843
and not on the right side.

187
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,371
This is a very big mistake

188
00:30:54,372 --> 00:30:57,142
when we start using
him on the right side.

189
00:30:57,671 --> 00:31:00,257
To express all our wisdom,

190
00:31:02,614 --> 00:31:04,157
All our love.

191
00:31:04,814 --> 00:31:06,671
Through holiness.

192
00:31:10,886 --> 00:31:13,685
There's no end to what I have to say about

193
00:31:13,686 --> 00:31:15,614
this great quality.

194
00:31:15,814 --> 00:31:18,843
Which all should imbibe,
respect and worship.

195
00:31:20,271 --> 00:31:22,314
Only thing,

196
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:24,100
when you meditate,

197
00:31:26,042 --> 00:31:28,827
just believe

198
00:31:28,828 --> 00:31:31,885
that your auspiciousness

199
00:31:31,886 --> 00:31:33,599
and holiness

200
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,428
is to be imbibed on your nerves

201
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:40,414
on your central nervous system,

202
00:31:40,586 --> 00:31:44,229
because that is the epitome of Chaitanya.

203
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,957
The Chaitanya that is flowing all around

204
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:49,129
if it is

205
00:31:49,757 --> 00:31:52,614
in the form of holiness

206
00:31:53,316 --> 00:31:56,543
even one glance of yours

207
00:31:57,153 --> 00:32:01,571
can bring beautiful fruits.

208
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:05,700
Can bring peace and solace.

209
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:09,257
So this

210
00:32:10,243 --> 00:32:11,886
innocence

211
00:32:13,543 --> 00:32:15,129
and holiness

212
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,957
Is the one which is peace-giving,

213
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:23,450
Which reduces frictions, tensions,

214
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,500
because you enjoy

215
00:32:27,943 --> 00:32:28,771
your

216
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,229
chastity.

217
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:34,799
Because you enjoy

218
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,357
your glory.

219
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,271
Please aspire

220
00:32:41,014 --> 00:32:44,157
To be the epitome of holiness.

221
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:46,214
May God bless you all

222
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:49,243
(places her hands together in prayer)
