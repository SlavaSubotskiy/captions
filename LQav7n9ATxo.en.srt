00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,960
Shri Mahavira Jayanti Puja 28 mei 1991, Gidgegannup, Perth, Australië

2
00:00:02,254 --> 00:00:07,894
Today we are going to celebrate the

3
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:12,453
birthday of Mahavira.

4
00:00:16,213 --> 00:00:22,613
Mahavira is the incarnation of Bhairavanath,

5
00:00:23,293 --> 00:00:27,653
or you call Him as Saint Michael.

6
00:00:28,293 --> 00:00:31,493
Now these two saints as you know

7
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:34,133
one as the Gabriel, Hanumana,

8
00:00:34,693 --> 00:00:39,493
and another is Saint Michael.

9
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:44,373
One is placed on the Pingala Nadi

10
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:49,293
and another one, Saint Michael, on the Ida Nadi.

11
00:00:52,693 --> 00:00:54,373
So,

12
00:00:56,493 --> 00:00:59,893
Mahavira

13
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:04,733
had to go through

14
00:01:05,053 --> 00:01:09,973
lots of search.

15
00:01:10,773 --> 00:01:15,253
Of course He was a

16
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:21,053
angel, but came as human being

17
00:01:21,773 --> 00:01:26,093
and He had to find out

18
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:33,853
the thing of the left side,

19
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:38,893
and how the left side acts.

20
00:01:39,853 --> 00:01:45,693
It's a very complicated thing, left side,

21
00:01:45,893 --> 00:01:49,733
is much more complicated than right side.

22
00:01:50,213 --> 00:01:56,253
On the left side we have also seven nadis,

23
00:01:56,693 --> 00:02:05,453
and these seven nadis are placed one after another.

24
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:10,093
They are described in books and given different names to them.

25
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:15,733
Now these seven nadis that are on the left side,

26
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:19,933
as you know, they cater to our past.

27
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:24,813
Say for example, every moment becomes a past.

28
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:29,453
Every present becomes a past.

29
00:02:30,453 --> 00:02:34,373
Then we have past of this lifetime,

30
00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:38,773
and also we have past of our previous lives.

31
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:42,493
Then all the past is built in within us

32
00:02:42,613 --> 00:02:44,893
since our creation.

33
00:02:45,613 --> 00:02:48,453
So all the psychosomatic diseases, as you know,

34
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:52,293
are only triggered by

35
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,733
the entities that appear

36
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:57,813
from the left side.

37
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:03,213
For a person, supposing he is suffering, say, from liver trouble

38
00:03:04,573 --> 00:03:07,893
and suddenly he's attacked from the left side,

39
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:10,693
specially Mooladhara,

40
00:03:12,373 --> 00:03:15,773
or any left side, left Nabhi,

41
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:20,973
because Mooladhara is the only one that is connected

42
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:24,173
with the left side, Ida Nadi,

43
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:29,453
and the right side PingalaNadi is connected with Swadisthana.

44
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:36,333
So the problems of Mooladhara

45
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:42,653
are really beyond the reach of human beings,

46
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:45,053
and when it is attacked,

47
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:48,693
any one of these chakras on the left-hand side,

48
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:53,573
then psychosomatic diseases

49
00:03:54,493 --> 00:03:57,053
occur into human beings.

50
00:03:57,173 --> 00:03:59,733
As I have told you many-a-times, now this is the center,

51
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:04,173
this is the another center, left and
right, they are on top of each other.

52
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:06,573
And using the right side too much,

53
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:09,053
goes up to a point and suddenly something happens

54
00:04:09,173 --> 00:04:11,253
on the left, triggers.

55
00:04:11,373 --> 00:04:16,853
So all diseases, say even diabetes,

56
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:21,053
is due to the psychosomatic efect.

57
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:24,493
A person who is very hard-working, thinks too much,

58
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:25,933
very right-sided,

59
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:27,773
suddenly something happens,

60
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,773
maybe also he might inherit that diabetes

61
00:04:30,973 --> 00:04:33,493
because of the past, and it triggers

62
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:36,573
and you get this psychosomatic problem.

63
00:04:37,493 --> 00:04:40,373
Now this psychosomatic problem

64
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:47,093
is only cured if you know what's the problem of the left side is.

65
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:54,213
So Mahavira went quite deep on to the left side.

66
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:58,333
Why I said it's difficult the left side is, because

67
00:04:58,453 --> 00:05:01,253
when you start moving on the left side

68
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:04,893
the movement becomes linear of course,

69
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,813
but it moves downward,

70
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:12,533
while the movement on the right side moves upward.

71
00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:17,133
So the movement goes down like that,

72
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:22,973
and then it coils up,

73
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:26,653
forms coils,

74
00:05:26,813 --> 00:05:28,853
and you go on moving with it

75
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,413
so you are lost in the coil.

76
00:05:32,853 --> 00:05:36,293
But the other one moves upward

77
00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:38,973
and the coils are not so many,

78
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:43,173
and because it is upward it's easy to get out of it.

79
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:48,533
So those people who go to the left,

80
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:52,573
by any chance, by thinking too much about their past,

81
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:56,933
crying about themselves and always complaining,

82
00:05:57,693 --> 00:06:01,773
are more difficult than the people on the right side.

83
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:05,693
But the right side people are troublesome to others,

84
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:09,333
while the left side people are troublesome to themselves.

85
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:12,253
That's how this left side

86
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:16,413
was to be found out properly, was done by Mahavira.

87
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:19,973
Of course He knew also, I think, all about it.

88
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:26,013
So He has mentioned practically,

89
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:29,773
in details, lots of things that can happen to a person

90
00:06:29,893 --> 00:06:32,013
who goes to the left side.

91
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:35,133
He gave the idea of hell.

92
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:39,973
He also described seven types of hell.

93
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,533
I mean it's so horrible that I don't want to tell you

94
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,813
what is hell is,

95
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:47,973
horrifyingly cruel,

96
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:50,853
horrifyingly joyless

97
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:57,813
and horrifyingly so repulsive that

98
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:00,453
you hate yourself when you understand

99
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:02,493
you have committed this mistake,

100
00:07:02,613 --> 00:07:06,213
you have committed this pap,  this

101
00:07:08,573 --> 00:07:09,573
sin;

102
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:13,373
and then what is the result,

103
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:15,533
what you get - the punishment part.

104
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:18,453
Mahavira worked it out everything,

105
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:22,773
He has given in all details what sort of punishment

106
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:27,293
is due to a human being who tries to be left-sided.

107
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:32,413
Also He has given about the person who is right-sided,

108
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,293
but not to that extent

109
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,853
because He had to deal with the combination,

110
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:39,373
but mostly with the left side.

111
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:44,573
As I have told many people before and here also I perhaps maybe,

112
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:49,733
that there is a soul that is

113
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:53,693
made out of the causal bodies

114
00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:58,333
of all the five elements.

115
00:07:58,453 --> 00:08:03,533
The causal, say for example, of the earth is fragrance.

116
00:08:03,813 --> 00:08:05,693
So this

117
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:12,053
soul which is made of the five causal bodies

118
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:14,373
and your centers,

119
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:20,053
plus we can say, also

120
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:28,093
it has got the control over the parasympathetic,

121
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:37,053
it sits on the spinal cord from outside

122
00:08:37,213 --> 00:08:41,773
and activates the parasympathetic nervous system.

123
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:46,773
So it has a connection with every center.

124
00:08:49,053 --> 00:08:51,933
Now this is the soul when we die,

125
00:08:52,293 --> 00:09:01,333
with the Kundalini and our Spirit goes into the sky

126
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:05,253
and it is the soul that guides now

127
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:09,853
the movement of our being, whatever is left now

128
00:09:09,973 --> 00:09:13,333
into a new being and that's how it works out.

129
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:16,373
So everything that we have done so far

130
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:19,213
is recorded in that soul.

131
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:23,053
When you were asking Me, "Mother, we see some sort of

132
00:09:23,173 --> 00:09:26,573
round, round things, you see, lying together.

133
00:09:26,693 --> 00:09:28,013
What is that?"

134
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:31,933
I told you this is our, this is a dead soul.

135
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:37,733
And now they have found out what I have told them.

136
00:09:37,853 --> 00:09:42,733
Because, you see, when a person dies

137
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:47,733
his soul shows you - like even now you can see,

138
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,973
round, round things:

139
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:55,733
there could be many, there could be one, a string -

140
00:09:56,813 --> 00:10:01,373
and they saw it under a microscope when I told them,

141
00:10:01,653 --> 00:10:09,773
that the soul within us is reflected on the cell,

142
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:14,693
which is the reflector of every cell.

143
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:18,853
So the part of the cell which is the reflector,

144
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:27,613
which is placed on one side of the cell

145
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:35,173
also has this soul reflected,

146
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:40,173
and the main soul which is on the back

147
00:10:40,293 --> 00:10:43,853
controls that

148
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:52,013
reflected soul which looks after every cell.

149
00:10:52,413 --> 00:10:57,293
Now they have found out that there is in that reflector

150
00:10:57,413 --> 00:11:01,053
this kind of seven loops,

151
00:11:01,253 --> 00:11:05,453
seven loops because it sits on the eight –

152
00:11:05,573 --> 00:11:10,013
seven chakras and the Mooladhara.

153
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:15,413
Now what He found out that, when people die

154
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:18,293
then some of the souls

155
00:11:20,453 --> 00:11:27,733
are born again just after few days,

156
00:11:27,893 --> 00:11:31,853
and these people are just very ordinary type of people,

157
00:11:32,013 --> 00:11:36,253
that's how He brought in a kind of category.

158
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:40,173
So they are - the people who have died -

159
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:44,173
they are of a category, one category,

160
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:51,093
where they exist for a very short time

161
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:53,733
in the collective subconscious

162
00:11:53,853 --> 00:12:02,133
and then they take their rebirth.

163
00:12:02,693 --> 00:12:04,613
They are very ordinary people,

164
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:08,293
aimless, useless people.

165
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:11,013
But there are some souls when they die,

166
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:13,413
they just hang in the air

167
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:16,533
and they are just waiting to find out somebody

168
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:20,293
who will fulfill their desires

169
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:24,013
which are not yet fulfilled.

170
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:27,693
Like there's a drunkard and a drunkard,

171
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:32,733
can join another human being who's living,

172
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,693
who would like to drink.

173
00:12:34,813 --> 00:12:38,293
So once he starts getting this...

174
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:04,253
So once it starts

175
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:21,733
getting into the habit of drinking,

176
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:25,893
some of these souls can just jump on that person,

177
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:28,813
and when they jump on that person

178
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,853
they can make him a real drunkard.

179
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,693
I remember of a lady who was a very short, petite person,

180
00:13:36,813 --> 00:13:38,173
came from Cuba,

181
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:40,693
in America when I went first,

182
00:13:40,813 --> 00:13:44,533
and she told Me that she's very sick of herself.

183
00:13:44,653 --> 00:13:46,973
And her husband told Me that she can take

184
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:52,613
one whisky bottle, full, neat sometimes.

185
00:13:52,813 --> 00:13:56,813
Looked at her, such a little thing. I said "How can she do it?"

186
00:13:57,133 --> 00:14:04,733
So, I put a bandhan on her and I saw a huge big Negro

187
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:06,693
standing behind her.

188
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,693
So I said, "Do you know some Negro?"

189
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:10,733
Immediately she jumped on Me. She said,

190
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:12,613
"Mother, You see that one?

191
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:15,813
You see that one, that's the one drinks, not me."

192
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:19,173
Of course I cured her

193
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:22,253
and after that she gave up drinking completely.

194
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:29,653
So whenever you start getting into a habit in a bad way,

195
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:33,333
you lose complete control of yourself

196
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:38,933
and a spirit sits on you, and it controls you.

197
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:42,893
And when it controls you,

198
00:14:43,013 --> 00:14:46,773
you do not know how to get rid of any habit.

199
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:49,453
That's why it's difficult to get rid of habits.

200
00:14:49,573 --> 00:14:53,333
Now in Sahaja Yoga when the Kundalini rises what happens

201
00:14:54,013 --> 00:14:57,813
that these spirits, these dead spirits

202
00:14:57,933 --> 00:15:01,053
leave you and you become all right and you give up.

203
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:04,493
That's how it works.

204
00:15:07,293 --> 00:15:10,733
I would say that all this Mahavira did not tell,

205
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:13,693
nor did He find out all these things,

206
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:16,933
because He was not a scientist, I think, or I don't know why.

207
00:15:17,053 --> 00:15:20,173
But what He has talked about is the hell.

208
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:24,973
And He has said that if you do this kind of thing

209
00:15:25,093 --> 00:15:29,053
in your lifetime, then what kind of a hell you'll get,

210
00:15:29,853 --> 00:15:34,373
and He has described the hell in a very,

211
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:40,813
I should say, openly and in a very detailed manner.

212
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:43,733
And it's really horrible to know

213
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:46,653
that a human being who thinks no end of himself

214
00:15:46,773 --> 00:15:49,413
ultimately will get to that kind of a hell

215
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:53,173
and some are permanently doomed to be there.

216
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:56,493
But as incarnations take birth,

217
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:58,413
also these devils, some of them

218
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:02,293
who are completely doomed to live in hell,

219
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:05,093
also take their birth.

220
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:09,813
And when they take their birth, they try to trouble us,

221
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:13,133
and they can take birth as, as you know, as our gurus

222
00:16:13,253 --> 00:16:15,893
and things. And everything is happening now,

223
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:19,893
you find it how these people are taking their birth

224
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:22,373
and how they are misleading us.

225
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:25,973
How they are using the left Swadisthana

226
00:16:26,093 --> 00:16:29,533
or we can call it the left side

227
00:16:29,653 --> 00:16:34,533
just to immobilize us completely.

228
00:16:35,013 --> 00:16:38,293
So when a person is possessed, as you must have seen,

229
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:42,253
a person gets possessed he cannot feel vibrations -

230
00:16:42,373 --> 00:16:46,413
there are all kinds of symptoms about such a person.

231
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:49,213
But in Sahaja Yoga what do we do

232
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,013
is to take the name of Mahavira,

233
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:56,333
because Mahavira runs all the way, all the way on the Ida Nadi

234
00:16:56,453 --> 00:17:01,493
and comes and stays here onto the -

235
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:07,493
we can say the point which is for our superego.

236
00:17:07,813 --> 00:17:11,373
And it sees, controls, works out, cleanses

237
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:13,533
and does all that is required

238
00:17:13,653 --> 00:17:16,773
to put a person right after Sahaja Yoga.

239
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:19,973
So we have to be really very thankful to Him

240
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:24,893
for doing this kind of work which is very filthy and dirty;

241
00:17:25,013 --> 00:17:27,653
because these people don't mind even

242
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:30,773
sitting in the bathroom, like that you can say,

243
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,653
or sitting with everything and meditating.

244
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:36,293
They can do anything, they are very dirty people,

245
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:37,693
absolutely dirty.

246
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:41,373
When they become tantrikas they try all kinds of dirty things,

247
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:45,053
and with that they actually create a problem

248
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:48,533
between themselves and the God.

249
00:17:49,373 --> 00:17:52,173
Say they'll go to a temple of a Goddess

250
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:54,733
and start misbehaving with a woman there,

251
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:56,893
so the Goddess will disappear;

252
00:17:57,013 --> 00:17:59,373
and once the Goddess disappears in that area,

253
00:17:59,493 --> 00:18:02,853
they call all these bhoots from the left side.

254
00:18:02,973 --> 00:18:07,173
So now we have all these souls which are lying, hanging in the air,

255
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:10,053
trying to come back

256
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:16,573
to a conscious thing and to possess someone.

257
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:20,573
Plus these, we have these masters of the left side

258
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:23,933
who know how to catch hold of these people

259
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:26,253
and put them on somebody,

260
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:30,253
or to remove from them someone and to put somebody else.

261
00:18:30,373 --> 00:18:32,293
So it's a continuous process,

262
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:37,493
and this makes a person absolutely mad and good for nothing.

263
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:40,853
Now when we know all this,

264
00:18:40,973 --> 00:18:43,853
still we get caught up on the left side.

265
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:46,373
Sahaja Yogis do get caught up.

266
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:49,813
That's why I think this Mahavira Jayanti

267
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:54,053
is a very, very great day for us to observe.

268
00:18:54,173 --> 00:18:56,653
Now why was He called Mahavira?

269
00:18:56,773 --> 00:19:02,733
Because only a person like Him - Vir means a person who is brave,

270
00:19:02,853 --> 00:19:07,093
who is chivalrous - because only He could do this.

271
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:11,413
So only He could enter into the being fully

272
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:17,173
and could kill or you can say destroy

273
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:20,333
those horrible rakshasas, devils,

274
00:19:20,453 --> 00:19:23,853
all these negative things that come to us.

275
00:19:24,253 --> 00:19:26,733
Now as you know we use left side very much

276
00:19:26,853 --> 00:19:30,133
for so many negativity that is torturing us;

277
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:33,013
but if there is no help,

278
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:35,973
say, from Mahavira we cannot do it.

279
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:38,093
We  call the name of Mahavira -

280
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:41,133
you could call Him Saint Michael, you can call Him by any name,

281
00:19:41,253 --> 00:19:44,533
but Mahavira because He was a human being.

282
00:19:44,653 --> 00:19:47,893
All this works out because of Him

283
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:50,173
and He is such a great identity.

284
00:19:50,293 --> 00:19:53,133
He, Himself took a birth as a human being.

285
00:19:53,253 --> 00:19:57,173
Difficult for saints to take birth as human being.

286
00:19:57,293 --> 00:20:01,293
Moreover, you see, the

287
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:06,893
whole concept

288
00:20:07,653 --> 00:20:11,133
of hell and all that is described

289
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:15,613
in any scripture is a fact: it exists.

290
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:19,093
And if you try to go in there, you see,

291
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:22,053
when I try to go there and to find out,

292
00:20:22,173 --> 00:20:25,893
I just go off to sleep sort of thing. In My sleep I find out

293
00:20:26,013 --> 00:20:28,373
all the things that are happening about a person,

294
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,773
how much he's caught up, what he's done.

295
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:34,893
It's a - not a easy thing to do with the conscious mind.

296
00:20:35,013 --> 00:20:37,213
You have to take to the subconscious

297
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,093
and you have to go into sushupti, in a deeper sleep

298
00:20:40,213 --> 00:20:42,573
to see what's happening in the left side.

299
00:20:42,693 --> 00:20:46,933
It's a very funny situation, I think,

300
00:20:47,053 --> 00:20:51,013
and for Sahaja Yogis also to enter in it, I would not advise it.

301
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:54,173
But one should get rid of the problems of the left side

302
00:20:54,293 --> 00:20:56,333
with the help of Mahavira.

303
00:20:56,453 --> 00:21:00,053
When this chakra is caught up what you find is a big

304
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:05,333
lump of bone coming out on the right side.

305
00:21:05,893 --> 00:21:08,653
So you have to take the name of Mahavira

306
00:21:08,773 --> 00:21:12,773
just to remove that pressure from the left side.

307
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:15,773
Now many people do not even know why they suffer:

308
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:18,613
Why should they suffer when they have done nothing wrong?

309
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:21,773
Because they are possessed.

310
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:24,973
Now even the viruses and all these things

311
00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:29,333
like psychosomatic troubles, like cancer -

312
00:21:29,453 --> 00:21:32,613
all, I would say the incurable diseases

313
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:37,573
are there because we are triggered into the left side,

314
00:21:37,773 --> 00:21:41,053
and that's why we are suffering from these diseases

315
00:21:41,173 --> 00:21:43,773
which are not curable.

316
00:21:43,893 --> 00:21:46,893
So we have to thank really very much Mahavira

317
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:49,413
who has given us this power

318
00:21:49,573 --> 00:21:52,253
to remove our left-sided problems,

319
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:58,333
who has given us this light in our hand,

320
00:21:58,453 --> 00:22:01,613
which He Himself vibrates

321
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:06,213
and He, Himself tries to throw some light

322
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:10,773
on the obscure things - about Me also.

323
00:22:10,973 --> 00:22:14,933
Because of Him only

324
00:22:15,173 --> 00:22:19,013
we can get cured

325
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:23,933
of so many physical and mental troubles.

326
00:22:24,053 --> 00:22:27,213
You know that the left side can be easily cured

327
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:30,493
if you use three-candle treatment.

328
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:34,333
That shows Mahavira is only fond of light,

329
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,253
He doesn't like darkness.

330
00:22:36,373 --> 00:22:41,293
And His idea is, I think that way,

331
00:22:41,413 --> 00:22:46,373
is to now fully go all the way

332
00:22:46,493 --> 00:22:50,333
to clear the left side as far as possible,

333
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,533
to help Sahaja Yoga to be established

334
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:59,613
in countries where I find still lot of this negativity is there,

335
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:01,413
lot of it.

336
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:03,893
So He is working it out, everywhere,

337
00:23:04,013 --> 00:23:07,053
and the psychosomatic diseases and all these diseases

338
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:10,413
also we can work it out with candle light and all that,

339
00:23:10,533 --> 00:23:13,573
with three-candle we can do this treatment.

340
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:17,773
So we have to be very thankful to Him

341
00:23:17,893 --> 00:23:21,493
that He has achieved this kind of entry

342
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:24,653
into the left side and has found out for us

343
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:30,013
what sort of problems exist on the left side.

344
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:35,773
It's such a nice thing that we have got today the chance

345
00:23:35,893 --> 00:23:39,173
to celebrate His birthday here

346
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:43,493
in a place which is really very much loved by Him.

347
00:23:43,613 --> 00:23:46,493
Now we may say that Mahavira is sometimes seen

348
00:23:46,613 --> 00:23:49,493
as a person who is naked.

349
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:53,493
So it happened that He had gone in a jungle to meditate

350
00:23:53,613 --> 00:23:56,613
and to find out about the left side

351
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:58,893
and when He got up, you see,

352
00:23:59,013 --> 00:24:03,373
He got caught up in one of the bushes

353
00:24:03,533 --> 00:24:11,453
and He had to torn off half part of that.

354
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:16,213
When that half part was torn off,

355
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:21,493
then He came out of those bushes and He was all right,

356
00:24:21,613 --> 00:24:25,173
but at the same time Shri Krishna appeared there on the scene

357
00:24:25,293 --> 00:24:27,853
as a little boy from a village

358
00:24:27,973 --> 00:24:30,973
and He said that "I'm a poor man,"

359
00:24:31,093 --> 00:24:34,373
this little boy said, "I am a poor person, I have nothing with Me.

360
00:24:34,493 --> 00:24:37,293
You are a king. You can always get your clothes.

361
00:24:37,413 --> 00:24:43,733
Why don't you give Me Your, this half cloth that You have?"

362
00:24:43,853 --> 00:24:50,653
And, they say so that it was given to this boy

363
00:24:50,773 --> 00:24:52,053
and who ran away.

364
00:24:52,173 --> 00:24:54,853
He was nobody else but Shri Vishnu.

365
00:24:56,653 --> 00:25:02,173
And this, you see, Vishnu took away that cloth

366
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:05,773
and of hardly for about two seconds or three seconds

367
00:25:05,893 --> 00:25:07,733
because He was a king you see,

368
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:09,653
and He hid Himself with leaves

369
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:12,973
and He went to His palace and got dressed.

370
00:25:13,093 --> 00:25:15,693
But imagine, the people, how negative they are.

371
00:25:15,813 --> 00:25:19,693
They just walk without clothes - Jainies.

372
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:24,093
They have, you see, all kinds of taboos

373
00:25:24,213 --> 00:25:27,813
against all the worms, everything.

374
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:30,893
It's said, these people have started,

375
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:33,973
that if you do not respect these little, little animals,

376
00:25:34,093 --> 00:25:39,693
like you can a, even serpent

377
00:25:39,813 --> 00:25:45,173
or any animal which is troublesome and bad,

378
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:52,253
but is a living thing, so it's to be preserved.

379
00:25:52,453 --> 00:25:54,173
Now these Jains are mad.

380
00:25:54,293 --> 00:25:58,013
I told you that they have gone to such a limit of vegetarianism

381
00:25:58,133 --> 00:26:00,413
that they try to save even the bugs,

382
00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:02,693
put the bugs in a hut,

383
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:07,133
and the hut has got a brahmin there.

384
00:26:07,253 --> 00:26:11,413
Now these bugs suck the blood of this brahmin

385
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:15,173
and once the brahmin is

386
00:26:15,293 --> 00:26:17,533
completely, I mean I should say, sucked in

387
00:26:17,653 --> 00:26:20,613
by these bugs, they fall on the ground.

388
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:23,453
Then they allow the brahmin to come out

389
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:25,773
and they give him a lot of dakshina, means

390
00:26:25,893 --> 00:26:28,013
they give him money as a reward

391
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:31,933
for helping the bugs to suck his blood.

392
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:34,253
This kind of vegetarianism is there.

393
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:37,973
Beware of vegetarians. You see even Hitler was a vegetarian

394
00:26:38,093 --> 00:26:41,013
so you can imagine what sort of a vegetarianism it is.

395
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:44,013
All these fads of vegetarianism and all that

396
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:46,253
are not at all required,

397
00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:51,293
and that's what Mahavira showed in His life,

398
00:26:51,413 --> 00:26:56,333
that it is not at all important to bother about food,

399
00:26:56,453 --> 00:26:59,333
what they should eat.

400
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:04,173
See, the whole theory of this vegetarianism has gone

401
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:09,693
to such a nonsensical limits that I have told people

402
00:27:09,813 --> 00:27:13,493
that we should give up vegetarianism, completely.

403
00:27:13,613 --> 00:27:18,613
Now also see the juxtaposition of what He wanted to do.

404
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:23,173
If you do not eat proteins you cannot fight bhoots.

405
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:26,373
A person who has bhoots in him must eat a lot of proteins,

406
00:27:26,493 --> 00:27:29,413
not carbohydrates but proteins, so that

407
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:33,613
it can fight those left-sided enemies.

408
00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:36,933
But here it is they have to be vegetarians.

409
00:27:37,053 --> 00:27:40,373
Now imagine they have left-sided enemies within them

410
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:42,213
and they want to be vegetarians.

411
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:45,693
Finished. How will they fight it?

412
00:27:45,813 --> 00:27:49,253
So all this is all we should say is pre-planned

413
00:27:49,373 --> 00:27:54,173
by the person who tries to, sort of say is -

414
00:27:54,293 --> 00:27:57,253
we can say like that, you see, a person

415
00:27:57,373 --> 00:28:01,733
who tries to remove the -

416
00:28:04,493 --> 00:28:10,373
or we can say that the person who tries to make the,

417
00:28:10,493 --> 00:28:14,013
these lower animals live,

418
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:16,773
rather than human beings, you see they're oppressors.

419
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:18,693
This is the stupid thing they do.

420
00:28:18,813 --> 00:28:23,573
Must know that I cannot give Realization to these worms

421
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:29,653
and to these fishes, or even to chickens.

422
00:28:30,053 --> 00:28:32,933
We require human beings.

423
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:40,893
So all this has happened because of human beings

424
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:44,933
going in juxtaposition of whatever is said.

425
00:28:45,053 --> 00:28:49,573
Like Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,"

426
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:52,893
and I've yet to come across a Christian

427
00:28:53,013 --> 00:28:56,453
who is not a Sahaja Yogi, without adulterous eyes,

428
00:28:56,573 --> 00:28:59,493
whether it's a woman or a man.

429
00:29:00,813 --> 00:29:05,253
So we go just the opposite of what we have been taught.

430
00:29:05,373 --> 00:29:09,493
In the case of same thing happened that Mahavira,

431
00:29:09,613 --> 00:29:13,813
what He tried to do was absolutely killed

432
00:29:13,933 --> 00:29:17,773
by these people who are trying

433
00:29:17,893 --> 00:29:22,773
to make this vegetarianism as a big religion.

434
00:29:23,453 --> 00:29:27,533
Also another thing was that this vegetarianism

435
00:29:27,653 --> 00:29:32,053
came into Jainism through one fellow called Neminath

436
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:37,613
who was a tirthankar at the time of Shri Krishna.

437
00:29:37,773 --> 00:29:40,453
He was to be married. In those days they were married,

438
00:29:40,573 --> 00:29:43,773
not only but they were eating all kinds of meats

439
00:29:43,893 --> 00:29:48,733
and so many lambs and goats came for the wedding of this man

440
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:52,933
so he felt that - uparati we call it, this:

441
00:29:53,053 --> 00:29:56,573
he didn't like it, he was disgusted, he was frustrated with that.

442
00:29:56,693 --> 00:30:00,173
With that frustration what did he do?

443
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,973
He said, "I will not eat meat."

444
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:07,173
And that's how vegetarianism started among Jainies.

445
00:30:07,293 --> 00:30:09,613
And that's how it's still going on,

446
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:14,733
and these Jainies I find are the
joyless people, absolutely joyless.

447
00:30:14,853 --> 00:30:18,533
They're so much fond of money, they run after the money

448
00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:22,093
and they go on behaving in such a peculiar way

449
00:30:22,213 --> 00:30:24,253
that you can't understand, I mean they are

450
00:30:24,373 --> 00:30:26,853
human beings but the way they behave you can't

451
00:30:26,973 --> 00:30:29,533
understand them, they're not normal people.

452
00:30:30,853 --> 00:30:35,253
So we realize that despite all that Mahavira worked out,

453
00:30:35,373 --> 00:30:42,893
still the people are supposed to be His disciples,

454
00:30:43,053 --> 00:30:46,053
they are Jains, and they are like this.

455
00:30:46,653 --> 00:30:49,653
So what we have to do now is to understand

456
00:30:49,773 --> 00:30:53,293
that in Sahaja Yoga we'd better not do something of that kind.

457
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:57,738
Whatever you are told, you have to understand why it is so,

458
00:30:57,859 --> 00:30:59,468
you know the modus operandi,

459
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:01,773
you know each and everything about Sahaja Yoga.

460
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,573
You know the whole subject

461
00:31:03,693 --> 00:31:07,333
so it's not proper for you to in any way,

462
00:31:07,453 --> 00:31:09,853
to succumb to any such arguments

463
00:31:09,973 --> 00:31:12,733
or any such big, big talks or big, big

464
00:31:12,853 --> 00:31:17,173
advertisement and take to something that is wrong.

465
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,413
It's very important.

466
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:24,293
We are Sahaja Yogis and we understand the balance.

467
00:31:24,453 --> 00:31:27,933
Of course I always say that Westerners for example,

468
00:31:28,093 --> 00:31:29,773
maybe Australians also,

469
00:31:29,893 --> 00:31:33,653
should take more to carbohydrates because they eat a lot of meat.

470
00:31:33,773 --> 00:31:35,693
So they can take to carbohydrates,

471
00:31:35,813 --> 00:31:38,373
but that doesn't mean vegetarianism by any chance.

472
00:31:38,493 --> 00:31:40,413
I mean, to compensate.

473
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:44,133
And in India I always say they must take to more meats,

474
00:31:44,253 --> 00:31:46,053
as will do, do them good.

475
00:31:46,173 --> 00:31:50,733
But then by no means I say that you just eat meat and nothing else.

476
00:31:50,893 --> 00:31:53,213
But a balance has to be found out,

477
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,013
and once you strike it

478
00:31:55,133 --> 00:32:00,053
then you'll be surprised that you'll feel so relaxed, so much better,

479
00:32:00,173 --> 00:32:02,493
so much enlightened

480
00:32:02,613 --> 00:32:06,253
and the vibrations will flow much better than normally.

481
00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:08,893
So for food, you have to be careful.

482
00:32:09,013 --> 00:32:10,813
Same about with clothes

483
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:14,493
that you shouldn't go mad after a suit all the time

484
00:32:14,613 --> 00:32:17,853
whether it's hot or cold or indifferent.

485
00:32:17,973 --> 00:32:21,533
What you have to do is to wear something that will suit you.

486
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:23,693
Now for example, in a climate like this

487
00:32:23,813 --> 00:32:27,413
you may require a suit or something to cover yourself,

488
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:29,893
but supposing you are in Ganapatipule

489
00:32:30,013 --> 00:32:33,573
or some place like that where it's not so cold

490
00:32:33,693 --> 00:32:36,453
or so hot, maybe it's dry.

491
00:32:36,573 --> 00:32:39,813
So what sort of a dress you should wear which is comfortable,

492
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:42,893
that should be found out. And whatever you find out

493
00:32:43,013 --> 00:32:45,293
that this is such a comfortable dress for us,

494
00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:47,213
you'd better do it.

495
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:52,813
Because what I have seen in many - you see, it's a thing that

496
00:32:52,933 --> 00:32:54,853
whenever I tell you something,

497
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,133
don't take it to the extremes

498
00:32:57,253 --> 00:32:59,053
and don't take a little bit of it.

499
00:32:59,173 --> 00:33:02,653
But when I tell you this thing, you must understand

500
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:05,933
that whatever is good for you,

501
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:10,773
whatever is your temperament, whatever is aptitude,

502
00:33:10,893 --> 00:33:14,413
you have to take something that will nourish that,

503
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:17,533
that will improve you and give you a balance.

504
00:33:17,653 --> 00:33:20,973
So to balance yourself, if you think of Mahavira

505
00:33:21,093 --> 00:33:24,733
you must think also of Shri Hanumana,

506
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:27,813
both these things are important.

507
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:31,733
It's not easy to tell all about Mahavira in this short lecture,

508
00:33:31,853 --> 00:33:36,093
but I think I have quite connected Him now with Sahaj,

509
00:33:36,213 --> 00:33:39,693
and you must have seen to it that how important He is

510
00:33:39,813 --> 00:33:42,133
and what an important role He plays.

511
00:33:42,693 --> 00:33:45,493
So May God bless you.

512
00:33:45,853 --> 00:33:49,053
Just start thinking about Mahavira I just,

513
00:33:49,373 --> 00:33:52,453
it's impossible to keep into the conscious mind,

514
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:54,733
it's just going into the left all the time.

515
00:33:54,853 --> 00:33:58,173
Because I just in the car thought I'd better think about Mahavira

516
00:33:58,293 --> 00:34:01,893
and since then it's all going towards the left, it's so difficult.

517
00:34:02,013 --> 00:34:05,453
But it will work out.

518
00:34:24,573 --> 00:34:26,413
May God bless you!
