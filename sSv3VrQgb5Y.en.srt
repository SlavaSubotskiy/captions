1
00:01:32,454 --> 00:01:38,385
It is such a joy to see so many Sahaja yogis

2
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,999
of such high evolution.

3
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sure all the gods and goddesses and the God Almighty Himself

4
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,480
must be overjoyed to see this achievement, no doubt about it.

5
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,840
But I was told that you want to know

6
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,200
higher ways or higher things

7
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,720
by which you would like to ascend higher and higher.

8
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,200
In the samadhi state first is the thoughtless awareness as you know,

9
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,999
called the Nirvichara Samadhi.

10
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:35,080
And then into the other state which is called as Nirvikalpa Samadhi

11
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,720
where it is doubtless awareness,

12
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,680
is two stages, Savikalpa and Nirvikalpa.

13
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,320
Most of the Sahaja Yogis now, are on the Savikalpa,

14
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,160
not yet at the Nirvikalpa,

15
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,360
and to rise up to the Nirvikalpa

16
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,280
we must understand that we have to do little more about it.

17
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,400
So far we had our physical problems, which are solved.

18
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:15,320
Physical needs, comforts cannot dominate us anymore.

19
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,760
We can live in any conditions, like Brahmapuri.

20
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,920
We enjoy all that. That shows that we have now risen above

21
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,600
the conditions that are laid down

22
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,120
by the material life or the matter.

23
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,520
That's a good state where we have reached,

24
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,200
which is also very difficult for people.

25
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,800
Normally, people are extremely fussy;

26
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:46,400
they are worried about worldly things, worldly possessions,

27
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,000
worldly material problems.

28
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,160
So many of them would come and tell Me,

29
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,560
"I haven't got this job, I haven't got that job.

30
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,800
This is to be done, that is to be done."

31
00:03:56,999 --> 00:04:00,920
Then the second subtler attachment

32
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,960
is to our emotional side,

33
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,999
like my mother, like my brother, my sister, my wife, my children.

34
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,240
And we go on bothering Sahaja Yoga for that,

35
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,440
that my friend should be cured, my brother should be cured,

36
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,720
my sister should be cured.

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,400
That's a very subtle thing we do not understand,

38
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,360
that in the realm of God those who enter can only be benefited,

39
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,360
not those who do not enter into that.

40
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,160
For example, if you have a relation living in India,

41
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:48,360
you cannot send him the benefits

42
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,480
of an Australian citizen. So first of all we must know

43
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,960
that they have to be the citizens of God's realm.

44
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,800
So unless and until we give them Realization,

45
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,999
take them to that level, they are not entitled.

46
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,920
So we should not have any obstinacy about it, no obstinacy.

47
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,360
Many of you have overcome that part

48
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:20,960
that you are not attached to a particular type of a relationship

49
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,560
who are not in Sahaja Yoga.

50
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,840
Many of you have got out of it.

51
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,240
But then how to overcome higher attachments?

52
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,280
Like there are attachments

53
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,560
that "I should write a book on Sahaja Yoga"

54
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,080
or "I should",

55
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,520
"I should paint something for Sahaja Yoga",

56
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,760
"I must earn for Sahaja Yoga", "I must do this for Sahaja Yoga".

57
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,880
This is also, in a very subtle way is ego,

58
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,840
that "I should be the leader of Sahaja Yoga".

59
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,880
Then there are jealousies.

60
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,800
If Mother says this is not good, you feel hurt.

61
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,560
If Mother says this is good, you feel happy.

62
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,680
That means you are still at a very subtler state of ego

63
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,320
where you think, that whatever you say should be approved by Me.

64
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,200
That is something is very subtle, and we do not understand

65
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,240
that if Mother is not approving of it, there must be

66
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,240
basic divine reason,

67
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,680
otherwise why should I not approve of it?

68
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,160
So when you have such subtler attachments also,

69
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,600
of a higher level we should say,

70
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,560
you must know that it's all the work of God

71
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,360
and we are just channels in the hands of God.

72
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:55,520
Now, we have a very good example, as I have told you many a times,

73
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,080
of the little cell at the tip of the root of a tree,

74
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,560
how it is so wise to avoid whatever is hard

75
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,960
and to take to whatever is soft and to embed the tree into the soil.

76
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,080
It has that innate wisdom with which we also are endowed.

77
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,440
And we have to work it out in such a way

78
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,040
that we do not get involved

79
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,200
into anything which is extremely hard.

80
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,680
Like, I would say, some people wanted to go to Tasmania.

81
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,040
By My hint I told them, "Don't go. It won't work out.

82
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,160
Tasmania is not a place where you can achieve anything."

83
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,400
I knew it was impossible.

84
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,720
But they thought they are going to do Sahaja Yoga great job,

85
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,120
so they went there.

86
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,280
They came back all possessed in a bad shape,

87
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,240
and then I had to get them all right.

88
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,640
So now you people don't misunderstand Me so much, as you used to,

89
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,160
but still you do things which should not be done.

90
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:10,200
To understand that whatever I tell you is for your ascent,

91
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,720
you need a kind of a state of mind,

92
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,440
a state of mind which is a detached mind.

93
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,160
And the detachment is visible,

94
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,000
very clear-cut in a person

95
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,520
that he's neither very emotionally attached

96
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,200
or he is neither, nor very physically attached

97
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,800
but he sees that the progress

98
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:40,840
of himself and of the society is the point.

99
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,760
Like the cell,

100
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,760
knows it has to progress for the betterment of the tree

101
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,560
but it has innate wisdom to do it in such a way

102
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,240
that it never harms himself

103
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,360
or does not harm the tree.

104
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,880
So the progress of a mind

105
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,920
which wants to develop, has to be such

106
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,440
that you should move with a balance, with a witness state,

107
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,240
and see for yourself how far you should go

108
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,720
and how far you should not go.

109
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,800
Going to extremes is not Sahaja Yoga style. Ascent is.

110
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,680
So even if you find somewhere,

111
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,720
you go and find that there is no response,

112
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,840
then you must know that it is nothing wrong with Sahaja Yoga,

113
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,000
nothing wrong with you, but perhaps

114
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,160
you have not approached the right place

115
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,560
or you have not approached the right way,

116
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,200
you have not done the way it should have been.

117
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,240
So change your style.

118
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,080
In Sahaja Yoga we have to go on changing our directions

119
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,480
according to the need of the hour.

120
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,240
You are not fixed quantity, rigid quantity

121
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,640
Most of the people think that we are so rigid

122
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,880
that we cannot move this side or that side.

123
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:22,040
The mobility of our movement is so great,

124
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,040
I say 360 degrees.

125
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Because you are stationed in the center in your Spirit.

126
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,000
You can move anyway you like

127
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,680
as long as you are centered in your Spirit.

128
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,040
But this is an important point which we miss

129
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,960
that we are centered in our Spirit.

130
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,520
And whatever movement we do,

131
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,800
as long as we are centered in the Spirit,

132
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,200
is necessary for our growth and for the growth of the collective.

133
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,360
Now let us see certain emotional sides we have,

134
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,200
how we can conquer. It's very simple is.

135
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,120
You are very fortunate, I should say, in a way,

136
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,400
than any other seeker so far

137
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,999
because you have before Me Myself sitting.

138
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,560
I am sitting before Myself and I see Myself

139
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,320
as a good example of following.

140
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:22,999
When you have someone like that, it's very simple to see.

141
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,520
People didn't have any such people or some leaders

142
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,080
or somebody who was an ideal.

143
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,680
So, it was all right that they went wrong.

144
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,120
But those who have something before them, that's very simple.

145
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,440
The secret is like this,

146
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,880
now when you are subtly attached to something,

147
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,960
so to say an emotional side of something

148
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,600
or you always like to be on the negative side

149
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,320
or too much of a positive side

150
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,999
in the sense that you aggress others,

151
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,400
then you must discriminate.

152
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,440
If it is an aggressiveness that you see in yourself,

153
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,840
witness within yourself, then you aggress yourself.

154
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,400
That is the best way to get rid of it.

155
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,040
If you are a hot-tempered person,

156
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,280
better get angry with yourself at least ten times

157
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,960
and then you will see that your temper will mellow down,

158
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,240
because all that is coming out will be directed towards yourself.

159
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,480
Now this is the discrimination you have to use

160
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,640
and be honest about it.

161
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,120
The another side could be that you are very left-sided, emotional,

162
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,999
extremely emotional about things and you cannot get over.

163
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,280
Then that's the best. Divert your emotions to Me,

164
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,440
put your emotions to Me, but do not aggress Me.

165
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,800
This is the discretion you have to use.

166
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:01,800
When you have aggression, you aggress yourself

167
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,760
and when you have emotional attachments, direct it.

168
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,360
It's very simple to do.

169
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,440
What pleases Mother? Very simple things. What does it please Her?

170
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,400
Very simple things pleases Her, like flowers.

171
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,320
Now people say that, "We were going in the garden, Mother.

172
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,880
We found these flowers for You." Is good idea.

173
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,040
But how much attention you have put to it

174
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,720
that we have to give a flower to Mother.

175
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,920
Now what flowers She likes? She likes fragrant flowers. All right.

176
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,999
From where should we get the fragrant flower? It's very simple.

177
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,680
It's a shop. When you are going around, be on the look-out.

178
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,600
There must be some shop with fragrant flowers.

179
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,720
In those months what flowers come in?

180
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,720
What flower am I going to give to Mother?

181
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,360
The whole direction changes.

182
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,200
You see, you become so beautifully attached to Me,

183
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,080
and I have to gain nothing out of it

184
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,280
but by attaching yourself to Me, you gain something.

185
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,440
Like the river Ganges flows,

186
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,600
and if you dip in the River Ganges,

187
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,640
the poor river Ganges doesn't get anything

188
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,760
but you get the blessings of river Ganges.

189
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,720
In the same way you have to think

190
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,040
that if we have to attach ourselves to Mother,

191
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,720
we must put our attention completely, entirely to it.

192
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,240
Little, little things you do. What should I do for my Mother?

193
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,680
How should I please? Is not what you give Me is important.

194
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,280
It is how much heart you put into it.

195
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,160
You know the story of Shabari. She was a very simple woman,

196
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,760
an old lady with very few teeth.

197
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,760
When Rama was coming she said, "What should I give to Shri Ram?"

198
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,960
All right, she went round and round. There were, in the forest,

199
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,880
some small little what we call berries, ber, and she thought,

200
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,720
"It may not be sweet for my Rama. How will I give Him?"

201
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,920
So she picked them up. She used to test it with her teeth.

202
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,680
One tooth she used to pierce in it and see if it is sweet.

203
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,480
And then she would collect those

204
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,280
and those who were bad she threw away.

205
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,680
When Shri Ram came, she said,

206
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,920
"Shri Ram, I couldn't get anything but these for You.

207
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,000
Will you have it?" Now, Shri Rama, being an incarnation,

208
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,080
knew the depth of the love of this lady. He took it up in His hand.

209
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,960
He knew that this is given by great love of a great heart.

210
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:35,160
So she says, "This I have tasted each one of them.

211
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,600
Don't have any doubts. I have tasted in every one of them.

212
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,880
They are all very sweet. You can have them."

213
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,960
So He puts it in the mouth, tells His wife,

214
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,680
"I have never eaten such beautiful fruits such great fruits before."

215
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,720
I mean, it's such a simple fruit, you see.

216
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,400
Sitaji, His wife, being an incarnation Herself, She said,

217
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,960
"You must give Me some. After all, I am your Ardhangini" -

218
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,400
is the half, better half.

219
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,080
But Lakshmana was getting angry.

220
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,000
He said," Who is this old woman sitting here and giving such ..."

221
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,520
We don't eat things, you see, eaten by others; we call it tustha,

222
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,360
is a uthistha, means if the one who has eaten something

223
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,640
is never given. And to Rama.

224
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,560
So he was very angry, fuming with temper.

225
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,800
So She takes it in Her hand and She tells Her brother-in-law,

226
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:28,640
"Oh, this is the best I've had, my brother-in-law.

227
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,360
I've never had such beautiful fruits."

228
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,400
Now he gets tempted and he says, "Really?

229
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:41,120
Can I have some?" She said, "No it's only for Me and My husband.

230
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,960
You better ask her." So He asks Shabari,

231
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,960
"Can you give Me some, please?"

232
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,680
The whole temper fizzles out and then He sees

233
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,000
the beauty of that fruit because it is done with love.

234
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,040
So this is what it is. Love which you have should be expanded.

235
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,600
And very simple. If you are attached to Me I am a person

236
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,400
who is so much spread out, all over. It goes into the whole,

237
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:18,280
it goes into the nature, it permeates everywhere.

238
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,800
Whatever love you give Me is not like a drop in a ocean

239
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:26,080
but is this ocean in a drop.

240
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,600
And that is what we must understand how to love Mother.

241
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,800
But when you love Me, you won't feel bad if I tell you something,

242
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:35,960
"This is not good for you, you should all not have done it,"

243
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,280
because if you want to be all right, you would say,

244
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,320
"All right, Mother, this was wrong. All right, I am sorry.

245
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,600
I'll never do this again."

246
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,600
This is a very simple way but it is a very difficult thing

247
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,200
for a human being. Is so simple.

248
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,999
I asked Warren that "Are they prepared to take up what I say?"

249
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,640
Then you will be surprised, when we are in love with someone,

250
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,840
we don't mind how we cross the roads, how we go there,

251
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,720
how we have to cross floods, this, that.

252
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,920
That force of love takes us there. In the same way,

253
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,440
the force of love for water,

254
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,760
for the whole tree, takes that little root - that innate wisdom

255
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,480
is nothing but the love he has for the whole tree -

256
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,440
that he goes to the water, sucks it in for that great tree.

257
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,920
It's not that it is important for the tree.

258
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,440
If there is no one tree, one root, doesn't matter.

259
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,640
But it is the wholesomeness of existence

260
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,800
that one feels when we become one with the whole.

261
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,840
And this wholesomeness is to be felt

262
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,960
and that's the greatest enjoyment.

263
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,840
The wholesomeness is to be felt within yourself.

264
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,720
Is the greatest enjoyment, and that is how

265
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,880
we progress higher and higher.

266
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,480
So the Savikalpa is this that we are still busy

267
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,880
with our relationships.

268
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,840
We, we notice that Mother has married us,

269
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,960
given us good husbands, good wives. We are very happily married

270
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,840
and we are enjoying our married life and we are looking forward

271
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,080
to greater marriages and better marriages.

272
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,320
But that's not the end of it, not at all.

273
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,560
This is just the beginning, just the start

274
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,720
and after this has happened,

275
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,080
if you get attached too much to it, then you have lost the point,

276
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,920
lost the point. The marriage has taken place.

277
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,440
Like an electricity, you see,

278
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,600
if you plug it to the mains,

279
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:46,000
it is not for getting attached to oneself,

280
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,120
but it is for the use of that instrument.

281
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,840
So the marriage is an instrument which is to be used,

282
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,160
which is to be completely understood

283
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,520
for the purpose of enlightening others.

284
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:08,760
So first thing is that Sahaja Yoga is our aim,

285
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,680
is our dharma, is our being.

286
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,320
That is the main thing. All the rest of the things come later.

287
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,400
Supposing then, you find your wife or your husband

288
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,160
are getting materialistic, better to depart.

289
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,040
Tell them, "No, we cannot." See, for Me this is important.

290
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,640
Marriage was just a means to an end. But the end is different.

291
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,440
So we can give up this means, we'll have another means.

292
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,080
And this is to be understood in its true color.

293
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,440
If your marriage doesn't give you progress in your spiritual life,

294
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,280
better to give it up.

295
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,760
And that's what I have been telling everyone about it,

296
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,040
how to get over your emotional problem.

297
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,040
Some people have aggressiveness in them.

298
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,160
Now when they are aggressive

299
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,480
then what happens that some people ...

300
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,999
I told you you'll get breeze; you are getting the breeze, all right.

301
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:10,680
And look at the shade.

302
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,440
You see how the nature, how the nature acts, how the nature helps.

303
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,200
Just look at the nature, how subservient it is. It enjoys that way.

304
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,320
You must have heard about what happened in Perth,

305
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,120
what happened everywhere.

306
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,320
See, the nature is so subservient. Why? What is the need?

307
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,960
Because it gets the blessings. It gets the beauty of wholesomeness,

308
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,560
of doing something for the whole. This is the wholesomeness.

309
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,040
The wholesomeness of the whole job is to be understood

310
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,760
and when it is understood, then only you realize

311
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,240
the beauty of you being Sahaja yogis.

312
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,280
Otherwise you just, for a limited thing, ”I got married,

313
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,960
I am much better, I got rid of my bad habits".

314
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,760
That's not sufficient.

315
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,600
The quality of wholesomeness, when is experienced within ourselves,

316
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,160
then only that joy comes in.

317
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,160
So we go up to a point and then we recede.

318
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,160
Like the sea, it goes up to a point and then recedes.

319
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,160
It does not go beyond a certain point.

320
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,280
It has its own maryadas. It knows how far to go.

321
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,480
But what does it do? It ascends as clouds.

322
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,400
It purifies itself, ascends as clouds and then meets

323
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,560
the Himalayas and then you get the rain

324
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,120
for the benefit all the others. It's a big circle that is made

325
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,200
and the wholesomeness of that circle is realized by the sea.

326
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,240
In the same way, you must know that

327
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,400
you are in that great circle of nature

328
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,080
where you have to play your own part in a full way,

329
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,360
and once you realize that mentally,

330
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,200
you should put it in your heart, the way I've said it.

331
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,760
Because to put it in the heart for some people is very difficult.

332
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,840
Like, they'll do My Puja, all right,

333
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,520
is mechanically, but some people may not even do any Puja,

334
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,520
they sit before the photograph and talk to Me heart-to-heart,

335
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,560
without saying anything.

336
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,280
And even in puja, when I see people doing Puja,

337
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,720
I know how far they are dedicated because the way they do it

338
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,680
with caution, with care, with awe, with understanding.

339
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,400
Everything is so beautiful. But if somebody is doing

340
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,280
just a ritual thing, I get a fright. I just don't understand.

341
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,520
Now next time he might hit My Foot or something like that.

342
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,000
So one has to be all the time ascending.

343
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Ascent has to be achieved and that ascent is only possible

344
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,400
when we start giving up all these ties and tags that we have.

345
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,880
These ties and tags keep us down.

346
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,080
So get over the ties and tags.

347
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,840
The other day I was telling Warren that, you see,

348
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,720
men and women after forty-five or fifty

349
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,760
still go on thinking of marriages. It is too much.

350
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,680
It's all right. After forty also one should be all right

351
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,960
but at least forty-five, fifty.

352
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,880
But even at sixty years somebody comes and says,

353
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,600
"Mother, get me married." Then I really get fed up.

354
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,120
As if My job is to get you married, like a clergyman.

355
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,800
So this is not the way. What is in a marriage?

356
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,640
Some people are seeking their husbands all their lives.

357
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,800
When are you going to seek the real one that is your Spirit?

358
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,920
So that category of people have to come up

359
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,160
and work it out in that manner.

360
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,240
Then only our family, our relationships,

361
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,640
our society will have some meaning in the realm of God.

362
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:46,120
Otherwise, it has no meaning. We have to be meaningful to Him,

363
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,480
not that He should be meaningful to us.

364
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,440
We should change our attitude towards Him,

365
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,840
that "What has God done for us? Let's see."

366
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,600
We should say, "What have we done for God?

367
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,160
What have we done for God?"

368
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,520
Then you will get ideas, what is to be done, how to spread out,

369
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,240
how to go ahead, how to work it out.

370
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,120
But still there are limitations, I know.

371
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,960
Some people have limitations.

372
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,600
They have limitations because they have a background.

373
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,160
Some of them come from countries which has a background.

374
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,320
And also the other one is that

375
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,160
the problem of these people, delimiting others.

376
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,120
When they come in contact with you, they try to delimit,

377
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:31,040
by their talks, by their, I should say,

378
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,480
talks without understanding what they mean,

379
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,040
some sort of frivolous, sarcastic things.

380
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,160
And people get impressed by such people. And if you get impressed

381
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,880
then you should know you are not a Sahaja yogi.

382
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,720
A Sahaja yogi is to be known by his character,

383
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:53,200
by his righteousness, by his behavior.

384
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,560
The behavior of a Sahaja yogi should be

385
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,280
extremely a peaceful behavior, peaceful.

386
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,040
Sahaja Yogis who are just rushing up and down, upset,

387
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,040
are not Sahaja Yogis.

388
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,880
Peaceful. Now how do you get your peace?

389
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,360
Peace comes from your Spirit.

390
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,680
Because you know you are in your Spirit.

391
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,960
You know that you are one with God Almighty.

392
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,920
What is there to hurry?

393
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,760
Where is He going and where are you going? You are together.

394
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,880
Whatever is there, you are there.

395
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,080
So what is there to hurry? What is there to just

396
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,800
hasten something or get upset?

397
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:38,280
Peaceful personality comes when you say, "No, not this."

398
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,960
When, when the haste start, then you should say,

399
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,960
"Not this, not this, not this."

400
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,480
Another could be that when you see somebody

401
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,320
whom you don't like or who has been harsh to you,

402
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,320
who has been cruel to you, you get annoyed.

403
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,920
And then again you will get disturbed.

404
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,480
At that time: "I forgive. I forgive. I forgive."

405
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,480
Main thing is, you have to be peaceful. Not that some people say

406
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,920
that "Mother, I try to forgive. It's difficult to forgive."

407
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,040
It's all mythical you know that very well. But what you have to say:

408
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,720
"I forgive. I forgive. I forgive," if there's disturbance.

409
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,120
Mine is another case. Supposing I see somebody who is a rakshasa,

410
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,840
then, you see, a kind of a thing builds in Me, which I don't know

411
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,960
what you should call in human words, but we can say

412
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:38,960
anti-forces against that person, like tremendous vibrations.

413
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,520
And when they are released, you see, they engulf that rakshasa.

414
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,120
He goes down in his own estimation, in the estimation of others.

415
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,720
Somehow or other, he gets destroyed.

416
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,320
In a modern way, he is not killed but in a way he is killed.

417
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,680
So this is what happens but that may not be with you.

418
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,680
So, what you have to do when you start feeling anything

419
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,600
anger against, say, some very devilish guru, supposing,

420
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,560
then you build it up in yourself and that built-up anger within you

421
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,640
will neutralize that fellow. You need not say it out.

422
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,920
You need not talk about it, but that built-up anger

423
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,360
will little bit trouble you also because it has a little reaction.

424
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,600
but when it is released it will have an effect

425
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,720
and such a person cannot stand a Sahaja yogi.

426
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,760
You see, there are so many things that happen,

427
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,000
automatically they'll happen.

428
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,880
As you know that I had told people that

429
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,760
”Don't bring Rajneesh people to Me". But they wouldn't listen to Me.

430
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,280
They brought three people in a program. And three of them collapsed,

431
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,040
collapsed just like a big boulder,

432
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,160
and I didn't know what to do with them.

433
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,920
So they were really literally taken off

434
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,880
as you would take out a big stone.

435
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,560
So, in that case I didn't get angry. I didn't do anything,

436
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,240
but as soon as they came the built-up force within Me

437
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,120
just froze them completely. I didn't do anything.

438
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,720
On the contrary, it was disturbing our program

439
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,120
but the built-up force could not wait; it just froze them.

440
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,000
So this is what is the other side of it,

441
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,440
that even if you hate any guru, you don't like him

442
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,160
because he has been so unkind, build up that force.

443
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,000
For that you need strength, because it's painful little bit.

444
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,800
Build up that strength within you, to hold that sword in your hand.

445
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,120
Then you get the sword and then you cut him off,

446
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,200
without doing anything. He is just cut off.

447
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,960
So going to that limit where we find

448
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,320
that some people are so sinful,

449
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:54,080
so horrid, so devilish that they should be punished, no doubt.

450
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,800
But for that you don't punish. Let the Divine do it.

451
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,800
But your force built-in within yourself can do it.

452
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,880
You should try all these things within yourself

453
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,960
and see it works out.

454
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,680
Now, for meditating, many people think that,

455
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,800
four o'clock get up, do this, this that, and it's very difficult.

456
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,080
In the beginning. There's no need for you to get up

457
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,840
four o'clock otherwise, but in the beginning it is necessary.

458
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,040
Because - why I say, get up four o'clock -

459
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,440
you are such, such slaves to your sleep

460
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,840
because you sleep such a lot.

461
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,960
Early in the morning you sleep such a lot.

462
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,040
So just to overcome that habit of yours

463
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,200
of sleeping, of sloth, you should be able to get up anytime

464
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,160
that you have to get up because we are on war.

465
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,560
We are on war path. Which time is free for us?

466
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,880
Anytime, whether I sleep or I am awake, I am fighting.

467
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,200
I don't find even a single minute that I am not working.

468
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,600
So this is what it is. You have to get up in the morning

469
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,960
because you have to train your body, "Better behave yourself."

470
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,840
Supposing your body cannot sleep on the ground,

471
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,600
make your body sleep. Let's see what happens.

472
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,000
This is a tapasya. This is the penance

473
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,000
through which the Sahaja yogis have to go

474
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,520
that they make their body their slaves in the sense that

475
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,880
they can use that body. That doesn't mean tomorrow I want you

476
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,240
to be sitting on the bed of thorns

477
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,480
and I have to always take the extreme side to which you people go.

478
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,360
But if your body tries to be funny, better tell the body,

479
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,560
"You behave yourself. What do you mean? Why can't you do this?

480
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,200
Why can't you do that?"

481
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,400
There are so many habits we have, which we should avoid.

482
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,360
Some people have habits of coming forward too much all the time,

483
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,280
to be in the public to be there all the time, this, that.

484
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,040
Tell yourself, "There's no need." If you are called, you better go.

485
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,840
Detach yourself from yourself and see for yourself.

486
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,520
As I said, I see Myself sitting before Myself.

487
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,280
In the same way, you see yourself sitting before you

488
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,000
and you tell yourself very clearly,

489
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,880
"Now, this is not the way it is to be done.

490
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,440
This is not the way. This is not Sahaja."

491
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,960
Why are you going forward all the time?

492
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,760
Why are you trying to show off?" Better rebuke yourself.

493
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,200
This is what I said, aggression to yourself.

494
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,920
And tell yourself that you have to be like a Sahaja yogi.

495
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,800
Sometimes I find people laugh at wrong times,

496
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,640
they cry at wrong times,

497
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,600
they do things at wrong times.

498
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,600
It's done, is done. Don't worry about that, but next time ...

499
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,640
Why did I do it? All right, next time I am not going to do this one.

500
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,320
This I did because I wanted to show off

501
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,320
or I was emotionally disturbed at the wrong time."

502
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:47,760
But the expression of love is very spontaneous.

503
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,920
But that spontaneity to come you must get rid of your habits.

504
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,760
Otherwise you can never become spontaneous.

505
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,960
A person who has got habits cannot.

506
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,680
The other day I was giving a lecture

507
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,240
and one fellow got up and went out

508
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,880
while just meditating, because he wanted to smoke.

509
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,680
So you can imagine, because of habits how we sacrifice

510
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,920
something that is so important, something so auspicious.

511
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,720
You can realize it that your habits within yourself are built-in

512
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,400
because there was no tradition of dharma also.

513
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,240
If there's a tradition of dharma, then what happens,

514
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,200
as I told the other day, explained to them,

515
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:36,880
that the fat cells in our stomach get the experiencer,

516
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,400
charmed, with the sense of virtue,

517
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,800
righteousness, of goodness, of innocence.

518
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:46,680
But if that is not so, it's like a dead ...

519
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,480
another cell going in the head

520
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,320
and experienced in dirty things, in doing dirty things,

521
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,440
in doing something that is destructive.

522
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,360
All these modern methods are destructive.

523
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,760
And then you get only the sensation from that

524
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,800
because it's a dead stuff, it needs a sensation all the time,

525
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,800
and they start doing all these things.

526
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:09,720
But now with the Kundalini awakening your dharma is built in.

527
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,520
Your cells are charmed by that.

528
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,760
So you use that power to enlighten your brain

529
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,640
which surrounds actually, as auras over the heart.

530
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,000
It's such a mutual understanding between the two

531
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,999
but you have to establish that mutual understanding.

532
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,680
Our idea is that

533
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,800
by God's grace we are so many,

534
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,360
and if we want, we can transform the world.

535
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,600
We can bring peace, joy and bliss to this world.

536
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,640
We could be blissful if we count our blessings.

537
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:59,800
And you'll be joyous if you get rid of your tags.

538
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:04,640
We'll have to fly, then only we can be joyous.

539
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,640
And for this we have to have our balance, our ascent

540
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:14,960
and then the desire to fly into the whole universe.

541
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,800
How to do it, you can find out yourself. It's not difficult.

542
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:24,280
How can I do it? Face yourself, find out about yourself.

543
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,400
Don't justify yourself. Don't be miserable.

544
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,480
Some people identify themselves with miseries

545
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,200
and like to enjoy their miseries.

546
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,600
Stupid things these are, absolutely.

547
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,280
Such miserable looking people have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

548
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,280
So, you have to be joyous, happy, balanced, well-behaved, sober.

549
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,400
Outwardly it will show whatever is inward.

550
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,080
All your dignity will express, if there's dignity.

551
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,720
See if you just have a dignity outside, it will drop out in no time.

552
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,800
So all these things can be built from inside out, not outside in.

553
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,120
And once they are built outside also, then they are best.

554
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,800
But outside, what we have to do is to put ourselves outside,

555
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:14,800
that's all. "Now Nirmala is sitting there. I am sitting here.

556
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,440
Now Nirmala tells Me, then I tell Nirmala.

557
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,720
"Let's work it out that way. And when we work it out,

558
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,800
then things will be very easy because now you have

559
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,080
a state where you are separated from yourself.

560
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,440
So that is the state of Nirvikalpa

561
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,200
where you are not attached to anything.

562
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,440
You don't have any habits, you are not attached to anything,

563
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,400
you have no diseases, you have no troubles,

564
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,400
you are above everything. You do not try to

565
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,840
complicate things for Me. You do not try to say things more than Me.

566
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,760
You just take it a hint, sufficient, "Mother said so. All right."

567
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,040
But some people have another bad habit,

568
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,480
"Mother said so. So this is so."

569
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,400
Use your discretion. How can Mother say? If She has said something,

570
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,280
there must be something in it, must understand.

571
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,680
Like Warren asked Me, "Mother, should I marry?"

572
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,040
I was stunned, you know, I was stunned.

573
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,280
But I didn't know how to tell him or ...

574
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,880
I said, "As long as you think you'll be happy, it's all right."

575
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,760
I mean any person, at that time who was not so mad,

576
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,520
could have seen the point, but that time he wouldn't understand.

577
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,200
In the same way, with everyone it happens

578
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,320
that when I tell you something, you don't understand.

579
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,000
Most of the marriages have failed where you have said,

580
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,400
"I want to marry someone," ninety-nine point nine.

581
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,480
When I have said you marry someone

582
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,360
because you have been living with that person, something,

583
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,880
such marriages also have failed, I have seen.

584
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,000
But mostly the marriages we have chosen do not fail

585
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,040
because there's a divine hand. It's all planned out.

586
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,999
May God bless you all.

587
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,000
There's one more thing, is a good news for all of you

588
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,760
which I must tell you,

589
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,680
is this that now I feel  that you all are at such a stage

590
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,320
when I say something, it acts on you.

591
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,240
You raise. You are raised higher.

592
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,480
If I am talking about something higher, it becomes.

593
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,440
Just now it has happened to you, no doubt,

594
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,280
but then you again sometimes come down.

595
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,520
So only you prop up yourself and that's it.

596
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,800
Just now it is at that state you are sitting, no doubt.

597
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:49,000
It's something good. I could not do that with people

598
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,080
who were not realized or just realized,

599
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,800
but with people of your level I can do it

600
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:57,400
and many must have felt that way, that we are there,

601
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:02,440
absolutely there. But again it falls down.

602
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,320
So be careful on that point. So, it's not a serious matter.

603
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,200
It's a thing to be very pleasant and happy

604
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,640
that we can all of us do it. It's very great.

605
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,440
You don't know, already whatever we have done is very great,

606
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,440
and we have to do greater and greater things

607
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,480
and that's what is very encouraging.

608
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,480

Small children chaiye.

615
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,640
Smal children please come up.

616
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:11,400
Not very small.

617
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,800
About six years, seven years.

618
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,640
[Hindi/Marathi]

619
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,760
Not very small. Not babies.

620
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:20,360
Shri Mataji will tell you what is to be done.

621
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,880
Go ahead.

622
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,840
[Hindi/Marathi]

623
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,280
You just start.

624
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,800
Come and sit down in front of Shri Mataji.

625
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,200
Sit down.

626
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,800
Come forward, come very forward, wash My feet. Come.

627
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,080
Now we will say the mantra of Shri Ganesha.

628
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,880
Now we will say again the mantra of Shri Ganesha.

629
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,280
That water should be kept separately

630
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,800
and now the water should be just poured in

631
00:48:06,999 --> 00:48:09,400
with the hundred and eight names.

632
00:48:10,999 --> 00:48:13,999
But that water you should [produce] for

633
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,160
SY: Distribution.
SM: Yes, distribution.

634
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,360
For the centers and cities.

635
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,480
This can be used for Sahaj center, garden, [unclear].

636
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,999
Now we are going to say the hundred and eight names of Shri Mataji.

637
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,720
[Hindi/Marathi]

638
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,480
And they repeat. Yes.

639
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,960
I will say first of all the name of Shri Mataji,

640
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,560
and then we will say it in the form of mantra.

641
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,880
For example the first name we say Shri Mata.

642
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:06,200
Then we say "Om twameva sakshat Shri Mata Sakshat

643
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,800
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

644
00:49:09,999 --> 00:49:12,680
That is the name.

645
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,280
Same tali.

646
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,920
We will say the first mantra as..

647
00:49:26,999 --> 00:49:29,400
Wait a little bit. Tali comes.

648
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,080
Shri Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali.

649

[Hindi/Marathi]

650
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,920
SY: What do You suggest?
SM: I mean it's all right [unclear].

651
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:08,080
SY: Just one person. One to represent, please.
SM: And they are just going to pour the water.

652
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,320
Robert, Robert and Chris could come. Few boys.

653
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,999
Get Chris and follow.

654
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:46,600

656
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,200
You have got the milk and the curd, etc. Just bring it here.

657
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,360
The other plate also please give, the other one.

658
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,960
The other tali?

659
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,680
You have a big tali here, isn't it? Another one.

660
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,480
Yes, give it to [Moti].

661
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,440
[Hindi/Marathi]

662
00:51:50,999 --> 00:51:55,120
Now, I am going to say the prayer to Shri Adi Shakti.

663
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:00,400
And you have to say this particular mantra

664
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,800
when I say Ya Devi Sarva Bhuteshu Vishnu Mayyeti Shabditah

665
00:52:05,999 --> 00:52:08,280
Namas Tasyai Namas Tasyai Namas Tasyai Namo Namah.

666
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,480
That is the word but I will tell you when to say that.

667
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,200
I'll start the prayer.

668
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:12,400
[Hindi/Marathi]

669
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:00,999
Three married couples please.

670
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,480
Those who have not done Shri Mataji's Puja before.

671
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,999
Come. Stand all together please. Stand together.

672
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,880
One white Shri Mataji? [Hindi/Marathi]

673
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
You come along.

674
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,960
You pass it to Shri Mataji.

675
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,999
This let it be here.

676
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,400
Now, we'll say the mantra,

677
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:31,960
hundred and eight names of Shri Adi Shakti.

678
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:38,999
The first mantra is Shri Mata.

679
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:38,000
All the ladies from the different centers please come forward.

680
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:42,000

682
01:23:51,999 --> 01:23:55,640
