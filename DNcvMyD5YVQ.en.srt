1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:10,260
Today, we are going to worship the Goddess.

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:22,520
That’s the, first the left side programming
is with Her, but later on, at Sahastrara,

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,360
She’s the Adi Shakti.

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,720
And, on the left side, whatever She does is
already written, as you must have seen, because

5
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:53,790
She’s the memory and She’s the wisdom
and, that She protects you, is shown when

6
00:00:53,790 --> 00:01:01,079
She uses Her power over the Ganas.

7
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:17,080
There are Ganas that are, as we know, responsible
for all kinds of corrections in you.

8
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:31,060
These are the Ganas which act through the
left side.

9
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:39,659
As we know very well that cancer is caused
by the problems of the Left side.

10
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:51,829
And, on the left side are these Ganas, which
are completely in unison with the Devi’s

11
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:53,049
powers.

12
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:58,030
She doesn’t have to tell them, She doesn’t
have to guide them, they are already built

13
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,810
up like that.

14
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:10,019
And these Ganas are the ones which, I should
say, target, they target the diseases and

15
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:16,640
cure you.

16
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,760
We have cured many cancer patients and many
left-sided people through the Ganas.

17
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,590
But Ganas won’t listen to anybody else.

18
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:38,329
And Ganapati is their leader, their controlling
power.

19
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:52,489
So, if your Ganapati is alright then problems
are less, but if the Ganapati is not alright,

20
00:02:52,489 --> 00:03:02,670
then all kinds of problems can come up and
they can torture you.

21
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:10,569
This is one of the things I am so particular
about, that we must get our Ganeshas corrected.

22
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:17,290
The other day I received a big envelope with
letters saying that, “Mother, difficult

23
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:25,049
to control Ganas,” but [it’s] difficult
to control Ganapati Himself!

24
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:29,230
So, what should we do when we get into traumas?

25
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:41,799
A simple thing is, at such a point when you
are in a trauma, and when you cannot overcome

26
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:49,620
this defect of the Ganapati, then what you
should do is to meditate.

27
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:56,930
Meditation is the only way you can overcome
Ganas.

28
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:07,829
The first of all is the upbringing of the
children and then the atmosphere as it exists.

29
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:20,729
With these two important factors, you can
do well with the Ganas but the problem is

30
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:28,099
that human beings get lost and they don’t
look after their Ganapati.

31
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:36,780
So, as you worship the Goddess, you are also
worshipping Shri Ganesha who is the power

32
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,370
behind Her.

33
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:51,341
But the greatest power that is belonging to
the Mother is your protection, protection

34
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:54,000
from all kinds of things.

35
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,500
All the left hand side protections are there.

36
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:06,110
They are described, as you must have learned,
in the Devi Mahatmyam, what a protections

37
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,340
She gives you.

38
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:19,360
So tremendous is Her protecting power, and
this protecting power gives you understanding:

39
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:38,379
how kind She is and how very, very protective
of you, extremely protective.

40
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:49,949
She’ll guide you all the time that you should
be protected, on the left side, and through

41
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:53,430
Her Ganas She looks after you.

42
00:05:53,430 --> 00:06:05,599
But on the right side also, those who are
on the right side, the Goddess puts Her powers

43
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:15,259
to put you right, to bring you back to normal
conditions, to humble you down and make you

44
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:28,180
understand that you are a child of the Mother
and you have to behave like a child.

45
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:36,240
But, if you go to extremes, then you develop
all kinds of complications of the right side

46
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,550
also, as you develop on the left side.

47
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:46,240
And the right side problems these days are
very, very common, which I have seen people

48
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,720
cannot get over.

49
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:56,699
So many diseases like Alzheimer and other
diseases come up, later on.

50
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,729
First it starts with the liver.

51
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:10,529
The liver is the main point, as we fall into
the trap of the liver.

52
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:20,789
If you are thinking too much, if you are futuristic,
if you are aggressive, then the liver goes

53
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:25,539
out because you use liver’s power to do
all that.

54
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:32,129
And when your liver power is over, you are
finished with liver power, you can develop

55
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:40,229
so many diseases, so many troubles that you
cannot overcome it, it’s very difficult.

56
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:46,699
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga, so many people’s
liver has been cured; so many people.

57
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:54,599
And it has been doing wonderful work as far
as the liver is concerned, but one should

58
00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:00,710
humble down and try to keep the liver alright.

59
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:11,919
So the protection is also built-in your body
by Ganas on the left hand side and by reactions

60
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:21,330
on the right hand side, but the greatest thing
is the blessings of the Mother: the way She

61
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:28,229
looks after you, the way She loves you and
the way She cares for you – which you should

62
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:30,789
never take it for granted!

63
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:40,699
You must meditate, you must meditate, is very
important, no question [that] without meditation

64
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:46,700
you cannot keep yourself alright – it’s
no question.

65
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:54,650
Meditation is the most important thing which
must be followed because that’s how you

66
00:08:54,650 --> 00:09:02,740
come close to Her vibrations, come to Her
nature.

67
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:10,380
Even animals are so sensitive to Mother, very
sensitive to vibrations; animals are, but

68
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:18,459
human beings have their own understanding,
have their own freedom, have their so-called

69
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:27,860
intelligence and they fall a trap to it; they
follow things which they should not do.

70
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:37,810
So what is necessary very much, in the country
like America, is the devotion and bhakti.

71
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,370
These two things are not there.

72
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:45,970
Indians take to Sahaja Yoga and go deep down
into it because they know what is bhakti,

73
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,160
what is devotion.

74
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,590
All this ego and all that melts away.

75
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,760
But this bhakti is to be enjoyed.

76
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,420
I don’t know how to create bhakti within
you – that I can’t say.

77
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:07,130
But I have seen people with bhakti, they have
achieved great heights, though it’s a left

78
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,480
side movement.

79
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,860
With the left side movement they have achieved
great heights.

80
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:20,399
I don’t know how the bhakti (devotion) and
shraddha (faith) has helped them so much.

81
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:30,670
In this, I must say, Indians are the best
because they have this power of bhakti and

82
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,670
of shraddha.

83
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:37,560
It’s not madness, it’s not madness as
they have here: I have seen people who get

84
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,940
into some sort of a cult or something, they
go mad.

85
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:51,149
It’s not madness, bhakti is love, and love
which is understanding, which understands

86
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:53,980
what is bhakti and shraddha.

87
00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:00,660
Unless and until you develop that bhakti and
shraddha within you, you cannot rise, you

88
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:15,600
cannot rise above your problems, you cannot
rise above your personality because bhakti

89
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,589
is something you cannot impose on anyone,
you cannot force on anybody.

90
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:31,630
You can make somebody mad and say that he
can do bhakti, but he cannot.

91
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:42,350
You have to have all your qualities absolutely
intact: you should be intelligent, you should

92
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:48,980
be understanding – everything should be
there, but at that time the joy of bhakti

93
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,780
is within you.

94
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:58,480
And this joy of bhakti when it starts flowing,
the Goddess Herself enters into your being,

95
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,250
I should say.

96
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:07,510
I have seen people, bhaktas, many great saints
in India who achieved a lot of height.

97
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,360
They’ve gone too far into it.

98
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:21,500
And if you read about them and, if you understand
them, you are amazed how, without any help,

99
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:30,040
without any guidance, how could they go that
deep and worship Devi?

100
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,800
Worshipping is not just out of sheer reading
or some sort of a chanting or anything, but

101
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:46,350
it’s the deep attention of your heart; I
think it’s Spirit.

102
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:54,779
If the Spirit is awakened within you, you
develop the bhakti and drop out all nonsensical

103
00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:02,910
ideas, all different things that have crawled
into your head, but you just develop the bhakti.

104
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:10,509
Now all these qualities described, of the
Devi [that] are left sided, are in the brain:

105
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:13,980
memory, ‘smruti rupena sansthita’.

106
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,209
Other things also – whatever are described
– are in the brain.

107
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:24,910
And then the bhakti reaches the state [where]
it just neutralises everything.

108
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:31,250
All the problems of the brain are neutralised
and you become a wise person.

109
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:36,370
So the greatest boon of the Devi is to give
you wisdom.

110
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:43,639
You can call it awareness, you can call it
anything but it’s a kind of a wisdom by

111
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:50,490
which you become absolutely a Divine personality.

112
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,920
That wisdom you must reach through your bhakti.

113
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:01,120
But, you see, we have people of all kinds:
some are very much in the shraddha, in the

114
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:09,560
bhakti, in the devotion but they are wrongly
placed and they don’t understand to whom

115
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,110
we should worship and where we should go.

116
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:23,279
Now Sahaja Yoga is a actualisation, Sahaja
Yoga is a Sakshat, is actualisation, in which

117
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:30,310
you know whom to worship and whom to surrender,
it’s not blind, in any way.

118
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:36,029
Whatever is blind bhakti can take you to any
kind of nonsense and that’s how many cults

119
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:44,450
have come up, many [of] these things have
come up, but that’s not a thing that sees,

120
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,540
that knows, that understands.

121
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:57,079
It should be understood by your intelligence,
by all your qualities – what is your bhakti

122
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,079
is like.

123
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:06,040
Now we have, through Kundalini awakening,
reached a very great height of understanding

124
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,829
of bhakti, the power of bhakti.

125
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:19,300
The greatest power of bhakti is that it protects
you, it protects you.

126
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:29,150
Those people who are suffering from any kind
of trouble, any kind of problems, just get

127
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:40,019
out of it because this bhakti of yours gives
you the right type of understanding, the understanding

128
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:50,230
of your Self; also the understanding of surroundings,
understanding of the whole Universe, why people

129
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:56,459
behave like this, why they are like this – all
this can be solved through your bhakti.

130
00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:04,139
It should not be blind, it should not be blind,
but it should be wise bhakti, wise with wisdom.

131
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:09,470
Only possible through Sahaja Yoga, I think,
otherwise, whatever bhakti people do like

132
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,750
mad, that cannot be bhakti.

133
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:23,750
You don’t become mad, you become a wise
man, wise man as we had so many in the past.

134
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,590
And the way they have talked about everything
is surprising.

135
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:37,860
How they have said things about human awareness,
about your ascent is remarkable and sometimes

136
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:46,910
I feel that they have really prepared a field
for me, a proper area for me, to talk to people.

137
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:58,180
Especially in India, I don’t know why, traditionally
we are very, traditionally we are very much

138
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,910
devoted people.

139
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,140
In the same way all over it should happen.

140
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:10,430
Because, in India of course there are mad
people also, there are cults, there are all

141
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:18,250
kinds of things, no doubt, but actually there
we have saints who have guided us very well.

142
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:24,050
Despite that you find in India people are
going astray, doing wrong things and wrong

143
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:27,050
type of worshipping.

144
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:41,840
This is true, no doubt, but it is just a funny
type of a madness, where there is no wisdom.

145
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,040
What is [the difference] between a mad and
a sane person is, that a mad person has no

146
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,700
wisdom.

147
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:54,540
And those who have also so-called wisdom,
or so they say, that “we are very wise,”

148
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,810
are sadly mistaken.

149
00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:03,590
Because the way they behave, the way they
commit mistakes, the way their whole attention

150
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:13,080
is, the whole working is, is sometimes surprising
but [it’s] because they have no wisdom.

151
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,450
First of all is, to test yourself you must
see, “Am I wise?

152
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,330
Am I wise?

153
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:25,310
Do I do wise things or I’m not doing?”

154
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,960
So many complaints come to me, about Sahaja
Yogis also.

155
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,790
I am surprised, why: why are they doing like
that?

156
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:37,250
I would say, still, they have not reached
the state of bhakti.

157
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:43,970
Bhakti and shraddha, these two things are
missing in the Western life, I must say.

158
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,090
We should come back, we should develop, we
should grow.

159
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,640
But, even in the Eastern life now it’s missing.

160
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,820
For them the ideal is now the Western life.

161
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:03,810
Once you take to Western life, that part is
over because the whole thing is judged with

162
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:14,050
ideas: what is beneficial, what is helpful
in life.

163
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:21,910
But bhakti and shraddha, according to them,
is of no use, that doesn’t help.

164
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:27,540
Most of the people nowadays think like that
but you are very few who have understood what

165
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,660
is bhakti and what is shraddha.

166
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:36,170
So, I would say, the Goddess gives you bhakti
and shraddha.

167
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,410
By what?

168
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:45,590
She gives you through your meditation; that
you see so many miracles happening in your

169
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,590
life and you are amazed.

170
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,150
“How this has happened?

171
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,240
We never expected this to happen.

172
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,720
How it has happened, how it has worked out?”

173
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,640
Also She corrects you.

174
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:04,330
All the time, if you are aware, She corrects
you and tells you, “Don’t go this way!

175
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,150
You are going on the ego side."

176
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,630
Or She’ll tell you, “You are going on
the left side."

177
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,540
She’s the one who corrects, throughout.

178
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:19,610
We get into diseases and we are trapped into
all kinds of things; it is because we don’t

179
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,610
have bhakti.

180
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:30,521
In the bhakti, you have to depend on the wisdom
of the Mother, wisdom of the Shakti, that

181
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:37,490
She looks after you, She finds you out the
way and She will help you.

182
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:45,570
If you start becoming on your own and thinking
that, “I am alright, I can do this, I can

183
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,370
do that,” you will find inevitably that
you are wrong, that you had a very wrong idea

184
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,960
about yourself and about the Divine.

185
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,950
So, what is the most important point is surrendering.

186
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,070
The word ‘Islam’ means surrender.

187
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:07,920
But Mohammed Sahib has described what you
should have before surrender is your Realisation.

188
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:13,800
But, you have seen, even after Realisation
people take time to settle down.

189
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:20,330
But once you are settled down you understand
that you are under a protection of the Goddess,

190
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:26,240
that you see every day how it works and how
it helps you.

191
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:34,310
Many people who are in Sahaja Yoga, so-called,
have great respect for me but are not fully

192
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:40,630
there; then they suffer and they have problems
and then they ask me, “Mother, how is it

193
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,060
I have got this problem?”

194
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:47,080
I don’t tell them, because you cant tell
anything to human beings, you see, they are

195
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,080
very aggressive.

196
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:57,290
But, the fact is because you are not one with
the Divine.

197
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:03,740
And with the Divine if you are one, you’ll
have nothing but compassion and love, nothing

198
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,740
else.

199
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,910
And everything you will do so smoothly, so
nicely.

200
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:13,750
People may not understand, like they crucified
Christ, they did all kind of things -agreed.

201
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:20,420
But now, you should ask for the protection
of the Goddess because that is the greatest

202
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:27,200
quality of the Goddess, that She protects
you from all problems, from all troubles,

203
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:35,010
from all kinds of nonsensical things that
can happen.

204
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,500
And there are so many things that happen.

205
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:44,780
I tell you, I was told that one of the leaders
of Sahaja Yogi was killed.

206
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,010
I said, “Not possible!”

207
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:52,840
And the fellow was in Rome, he was not killed.

208
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:59,140
So, it’s not possible that a young man should
be killed like that.

209
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,410
Of course, if somebody is old you have to
die, but that he was killed, was not a right

210
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,410
thing.

211
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:10,450
So it is the protection, not only physical,
mental, emotional, but spiritual protection

212
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,260
comes to you.

213
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,320
Spiritual protection in that what you do is
that you don’t do wrong things.

214
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,900
You don’t kill anybody, you don’t torture
anybody, you are not rude to anybody, that

215
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:29,160
is the situation into which you all can enter
because you are Sahaja Yogis.

216
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,210
You can achieve it.

217
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:40,430
You have a power to do it because you have
so much shraddha and so much understanding

218
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:47,910
that you have reached the certain state of
protection, of growth of wisdom.

219
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:54,580
Now first test your wisdom, you must test
your wisdom, “If I am doing this, is this

220
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,230
wise, is it good, why I am doing it?”

221
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:03,780
First test your wisdom, then you’ll find
out that many things you do which are wrong,

222
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,220
which should not have been done.

223
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:12,260
But first your wisdom must develop and you
must see that your wisdom works and helps

224
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,260
you.

225
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:17,210
I have seen now, yesterday’s drama (evening
programme play), you must have seen that girl

226
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:22,270
she is very sensitive and she could see through
her wisdom what was good.

227
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:31,360
If you cannot find out what is good and what
is bad that means the wisdom is lacking.

228
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:37,330
If you cannot find out what should you do
then the wisdom is lacking.

229
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:45,500
But, if you have the wisdom, then you will
immediately know that this is wrong.

230
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:51,610
Apart from that, you’ll be saved from all
kinds of problems; it’s a fact, I have seen

231
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:58,650
with so many people like that, who have been
saved, not only from death, but from all kinds

232
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:02,980
of catastrophes, all kinds.

233
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:09,520
And I was amazed how these Sahaja Yogis are
helped by the Divine.

234
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,250
Divine is a power, everywhere it exists.

235
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:21,680
But it will only help the people who are Sahaj
Yogis, who are divine – not the people who

236
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:29,490
are not, it will never help you, on the contrary
it might punish in a way that is never expected.

237
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:36,610
So, one has to be careful to test oneself,
what I call ‘introspection’: Have you

238
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:40,730
been wise in dealing with certain problems?

239
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,760
What has been your style?

240
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,580
Is it money oriented or it is domination oriented.

241
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:52,230
But what sort of a power it was that you were
working under?

242
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,250
You have to introspect to find out.

243
00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:02,930
And you will be amazed, very much amazed,
that even in the name of God you can do wrong

244
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:03,930
things.

245
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,820
Lots of wrong things have been done in the
name of God and that’s why today we have

246
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:14,590
such a big chaos of so called ‘religions’,
when nothing was religion with religion as

247
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:19,270
such, and those religious people who talked
about it – nothing wrong – but the way

248
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:23,630
people absorbed it and the way people used
it was wrong.

249
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:26,290
Because [what] they lacked is wisdom.

250
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:32,630
And the wisdom is the thing which really is
not just assumption that, “I am very wise

251
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:40,440
and all that,” but it asserts, it works
out and it shows what is good and what is

252
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,440
bad.

253
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:49,040
Wisdom is the sign of a person who is really
a realised soul of a very high level.

254
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:56,020
If you don’t have wisdom whatever you may
do, you might feel satisfied about it, but

255
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,220
the wisdom part is very, very important.

256
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:09,940
That is the most governing part within us
and as you know, Ganesha is the giver of wisdom.

257
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:24,040
That’s why Ganesha must be worshipped.

258
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:37,940
With the proper upbringing Shri Ganesha is
established, who is nothing but the giver

259
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:44,390
of wisdom.

260
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:52,390
And this wisdom is innate, you don’t have
to judge it, it’s innate within us, grown

261
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,970
up, just like any other qualities in us.

262
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:06,640
It takes time with some people, it takes time,
no doubt, but once it comes in, such a person

263
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:14,880
becomes quiet, simple and absolutely truthful.

264
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,450
He knows about it.

265
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:27,590
And this is the thing one should develop is,
“How far am I wise?”

266
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:32,370
You see in this world people are protesting
for this, protesting for that, fighting for

267
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,680
this, doing all kinds of things.

268
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:42,490
But if you have wisdom, then you don’t have
to do anything of the kind!

269
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:49,600
What happens is that automatically people
understand that he’s a wise man.

270
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,010
From ancient times everywhere a wise man has
been praised.

271
00:28:54,010 --> 00:29:00,770
He’s not worried about his financial side,
or emotional side, nothing!

272
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:06,160
What he is worried is, “Have I been a wise
person?”

273
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,670
That is the first sign of the blessings of
God.

274
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:18,850
The one who has blessings of Divine is a wise
person, he’s very wise and his wisdom is

275
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,490
shown by his silence.

276
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:32,020
And the Whole Power, the Divine Power, uses
that person as a media and works tremendously.

277
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,110
That man himself is surprised how it has helped
him.

278
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:44,049
A woman can have that, a man can have it,
anybody can have that wisdom, that profoundness,

279
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:54,530
that temperament which is so beautiful and
so empowering.

280
00:29:54,530 --> 00:30:02,290
Such a person doesn’t curse anyone, doesn’t
bother to curse anyone, but it works.

281
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:08,150
He never gets angry with anyone, but it works.

282
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:22,540
He doesn’t lose temper, no, but some temper
works and harms you which you never expected.

283
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:29,970
It is within us, within our power as human
beings, to be wise.

284
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:37,130
I have seen animals have such a sensitivity
to vibrations, extremely sensitive.

285
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,290
How?

286
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,670
Because their wisdom is intact.

287
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:44,100
It works in them, they are not conscious of
it.

288
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:51,750
The difference is, human beings are conscious
of their wisdom, that’s the only difference.

289
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:56,930
Animals have wisdom, but automatic, we should
say, natural.

290
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:05,810
But we have inculcated this, or we have developed
this wisdom within us, through what?

291
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:13,780
Through our meditation, through our understanding
of bhakti and shraddha.

292
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:21,850
So it’s very important to understand the
value of bhakti within us.

293
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,700
You cannot superficially touch it.

294
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,940
Those who are superficial will never get it.

295
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:39,050
Wisdom only comes through understanding what
is wisdom is.

296
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:45,320
You might find somebody extremely wise, he
may be your servant, may be your driver, may

297
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:51,390
be anyone, and you are amazed how such a person
can be so wise.

298
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:59,490
Because, maybe from his last life, he has
got it within him, or he has gone into it

299
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:03,010
and he found it.

300
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:10,060
Is not the estate of one person, is not the
property of one person but it can belong to

301
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,170
many of them.

302
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:19,110
So the Sahaj Yogi is the one who has to have
that wisdom, “Why I am doing this?

303
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,250
What is the need to do it?”

304
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,950
They don’t have to ask any questions, they
just don’t do wrong things.

305
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,750
They just don’t do wrong things.

306
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:30,030
They are always on the right path.

307
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:35,790
That is the sign of a Sahaj Yogi, I believe,
and which is the blessing of the Goddess.If

308
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:42,700
there is the Power of the Goddess working
in you, you will have the wisdom to work it

309
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,700
out.

310
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:48,300
Now you have seen many people coming to America,
doing all kinds of things.

311
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,330
They all have disappeared.

312
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,490
There’s no support to them, where are they?

313
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,650
They are finished.

314
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:59,750
Because they were money oriented, or power
oriented, I don’t know what they were oriented!

315
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,780
And they have lost it.

316
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:09,530
But for a person who is standing in his wisdom,
is the sage as they call him, is the saint

317
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,990
as they call it.

318
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:20,180
But, this can be every Sahaja Yogi could be
a saint, could be a sage, every Sahaja Yogi

319
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,420
could be that.

320
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:26,340
But if you lose your wisdom then you are no
good.

321
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:33,780
So, I have to tell you one thing: it’s your
wisdom which will save you.

322
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:39,010
Your wisdom will unconsciously help you.

323
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:47,190
There was one gentleman, Sahaj Yogi, once
he was going somewhere in the car and suddenly

324
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:52,020
decided to go on to another road, suddenly.

325
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:56,930
And what happened, that on that road there
was a very big accident and he would have

326
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:00,100
been in that accident.

327
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:05,910
Like that there are many incidents people
have told me, that, “Mother, how we were

328
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:15,929
saved, how we were brought to the brink of
death and then how we are just alive."

329
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:23,169
It is because the Divine needs you, Divine
doesn’t want you to die, or to finish off,

330
00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:24,879
it needs you very much.

331
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:30,279
It has to do its work and you are the instrument
of that Divine.

332
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:38,250
If you have wisdom you are the best instrument
for the Divine to work it out.

333
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:46,269
The Devi’s powers first of all existed in
Her body only and She killed so many rakshasas

334
00:34:46,269 --> 00:34:50,859
and evil people – She did, kill it, actually.

335
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:56,200
But now, there’s no need because you all
are there and you are the instruments.

336
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:01,970
And it will all work out in such a way that
all those people who are trying to destroy

337
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:13,140
the goodness, trying to destroy wise people,
they will be killed, they’ll be finished,

338
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,470
they’ll be destroyed.

339
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:19,140
This is not to be done through any outside
instrument or anything.

340
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:24,329
It’s your wisdom, is the biggest instrument
that will work it out.

341
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:30,539
Do you know, when I came to America first,
I saw such a horrible thing here: that people

342
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:36,710
were running after some horrible ‘gurus’
and I never came [again], after nine years

343
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,200
I came because I said, “These people are
mad!

344
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,759
How do they follow these horrible people?

345
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:43,269
And why do they believe into it?

346
00:35:43,269 --> 00:35:46,519
They have no wisdom to understand what is
the Truth is like."

347
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:51,789
And it works out, now, today, you can see
there are so many people here.

348
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:55,579
So, that is what is the wisdom part.

349
00:35:55,579 --> 00:36:00,380
And if this wisdom comes to Americans they’ll
come to Sahaja Yoga.

350
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,539
Not only come, but they will grow into it.

351
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:09,869
But the wisdom will be, to see, “What are
we going to do, what are we going to get,

352
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:11,720
what is our aim?”

353
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,099
All these things must be brought to them,
which is not done normally.

354
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:23,609
We must talk to them, and we must tell them
that, “What is within you is the Spirit.

355
00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:27,359
You should become the Spirit, everyone of
them has said so.

356
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,369
So why not do that?

357
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:31,550
And why not become the Spirit?”

358
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:37,030
So, then they will themselves feel, “Yes,
that’s true.

359
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:42,609
It’s said that you should become the Spirit."

360
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:45,910
They’ll go to Church, they’ll go to temples,
they’ll go here, there, not understanding

361
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,230
why they are doing it?

362
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:54,410
They need some sort of a protection, that’s
why they go, but this protection comes from

363
00:36:54,410 --> 00:37:01,400
your spiritual status, where do you stand
as far as the Spirit is concerned.

364
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:07,210
Those who have enjoyed the Spirit, I have
seen do not deviate from the right path.

365
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:13,440
But those who haven’t, they may call themselves
Sahaj Yogis, anything, but they can be very

366
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,440
wrong.

367
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,000
So, first of all, find out about yourself.

368
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:28,869
If you are a real Sahaj Yogi, if you really
want to be a instrument of This Power, then,

369
00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:35,609
what you have to do is to become full of bhakti
and shraddha for that.

370
00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:40,520
And this bhakti and shraddha is very joy giving,
I know that.

371
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:46,349
It never makes you tired, it never troubles
you, nothing!

372
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:50,900
But it’s very nourishing and beautiful.

373
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:57,589
But it should be at the right place with the
right aims and right understanding.

374
00:37:57,589 --> 00:38:01,700
For all that what you need again is wisdom.

375
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,770
And you should try to find out – are you
wise enough?

376
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:08,799
Are you wise, or are you not?

377
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:15,900
It’s very difficult for every human being
to find out whether you are right or wrong

378
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:21,740
because, you see the effects of this wisdom
all around.

379
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:30,559
So, the bhakti and shraddha to the Goddess
gives you, definitely gives you, wisdom.

380
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:39,220
We have had some people in India who did lots
of bhakti, so called, and showed lots of shraddha,

381
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:43,420
but they were not, they were not.

382
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:50,319
Just they were talking about it, or doing
all kinds of things about it but they were

383
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:51,319
not.

384
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:56,890
So wisdom is something a very innate quality,
very innate, its not superficial.

385
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:01,369
You cannot just say that this person, is he
wise or not.

386
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:09,839
It shows, just like a power, it’s a power
of understanding and is supported by the Power

387
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,319
of the Goddess.

388
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:13,010
So She is the giver of wisdom.

389
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:19,220
This is the biggest quality of the Goddess,
that She is the giver of wisdom.

390
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:23,230
And wisdom comes as a part of the evolutionary
process.

391
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:29,529
Now She has brought about all the evolution
so far, and to go further She is going to

392
00:39:29,529 --> 00:39:32,799
make you a very wise person.

393
00:39:32,799 --> 00:39:40,849
Even an ordinary sage in a village, in a far-fetched
places is respected if he is a real sage.

394
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:46,730
But, [if] he is a stupid fellow, what can
you do?

395
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:50,769
He may befool you, may do all kind of tricks
and things like that.

396
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:56,259
And then, does he get anything good for you?

397
00:39:56,259 --> 00:39:57,549
No, nothing.

398
00:39:57,549 --> 00:40:04,400
So first thing is: anybody who is supposed
to be your guru or supposed to be the person

399
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,150
who is guiding you, must have bhakti, bhakti
of the Goddess.

400
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,460
It’s very important to understand.

401
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:17,200
Modern things have such, come to such a limit,
that they have no respect for the Goddess,

402
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:23,009
no, they don’t even talk about the Goddess
and they just talk about something which cannot

403
00:40:23,009 --> 00:40:24,599
be explained and understood.

404
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:30,880
If they talk about Christ they won’t talk
about Him, that He is the one who said at

405
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,839
the cross, “Behold the Mother”.

406
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,579
What was the need to say that?

407
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:43,539
Because He didn’t want His Mother to get
into trouble, but He said, “Behold The Mother,”

408
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:47,930
that means, “Look out for the Mother who
is going to come."

409
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:54,740
They all have indicated and they have said
so but still we are busy with our own ego

410
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:00,900
and our own understanding and we run after
things which are not real.

411
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:06,279
First of all you must follow only thing that
is real, not unreal things.

412
00:41:06,279 --> 00:41:10,320
For that also, again, you need wisdom.

413
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,920
I think for that you need wisdom very much
more.

414
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,750
And that is something, whether you have the
wisdom first, or you have the blessings of

415
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:22,559
the Mother, is between the two.

416
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:31,330
So I have to tell you one thing that: before
you people start spreading Sahaja Yoga, please

417
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:32,510
judge yourself.

418
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:36,059
Just see if you are wise.

419
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:39,829
Also see for yourself if you have the blessings
of the Mother.

420
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:52,799
Only the wise are the people who know whether
they have the Mother’s blessings or not.

421
00:41:52,799 --> 00:41:56,970
For that we have so many ways of understanding.

422
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:05,799
First and foremost thing is meditation and
feeling your vibrations on the photograph

423
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:09,380
and facing yourself clearly.

424
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:14,970
If you are a realised soul, are you really
a good realised soul or not?

425
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,019
Are you deep or not?

426
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:19,890
Are your vibrations working out or not?

427
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:29,200
If you can see that then you will realise
that greater than all ambitions, the greatest

428
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:37,299
is to become a devoted, wise personality.

429
00:42:37,299 --> 00:42:45,019
That is the one that will give you the joy,
joy for all kinds of things.

430
00:42:45,019 --> 00:42:50,550
Otherwise it is just a human being like others
going about.

431
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:54,140
Now the time has come for this to work out.

432
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,319
It’s a special time, I should say.

433
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:01,059
Although, quite a lot of struggle for me,
no doubt, but doesn’t matter, I know, because

434
00:43:01,059 --> 00:43:08,480
I have landed myself in the area where things
are not so simple, it doesn’t matter.

435
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:15,349
But, on the whole, what I feel is you can
support me very much, you can support my work

436
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:18,290
very much, if you have that wisdom.

437
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:23,020
And the wisdom is to judge yourself: how many
people you love?

438
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,630
How you love?

439
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,990
How you talk to them?

440
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,859
What do you want out of them?

441
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:30,640
All this should come.

442
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,019
Judge yourself – introspection.

443
00:43:33,019 --> 00:43:35,000
Through introspection you can see it.

444
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,849
So, for a Sahaja Yogi is important is introspection.

445
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:44,740
Second one is meditation.

446
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:48,009
And third one is to take vibrations.

447
00:43:48,009 --> 00:43:49,710
It’s very important.

448
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:53,660
What I find, some of them say, “Mother,
we don’t do this, we don’t do that,”

449
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,660
“But why?

450
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,079
Why not do it?”

451
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,690
“We do Sahaja Yoga!”

452
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,309
Sahaja Yoga, which part?

453
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:04,279
If you are not doing these basic things, how
are you a Sahaja Yogi?

454
00:44:04,279 --> 00:44:09,380
And then lots of complications come out of
them, they also suffer.

455
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:16,500
I think one has to have again the wisdom to
understand what is Sahaja Yoga is.

456
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:22,799
No one understands that sometimes, and they
go on forming a group of people who are not

457
00:44:22,799 --> 00:44:25,799
at all understanding what is Sahaja Yoga.

458
00:44:25,799 --> 00:44:29,730
It’s a very, very deep personality.

459
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:38,430
Sahaja Yoga is not just by saying, “I am
a Sahaja Yogi,” but it’s a very deep personality,

460
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:46,900
and that deep personality has to be felt by
others as the wise, very wise thing.

461
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:53,630
Not that how much you talk or shout or give
lectures is important; is with peace, the

462
00:44:53,630 --> 00:45:03,230
tranquillity, the capacity to love within
you are important and that’s how people

463
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:09,740
can judge whether you are really blessed by
your Mother or not.

464
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:15,279
So, this is one of the things very important
when I’ve come to America just to protect

465
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:21,470
America from problems, because suddenly this
has grown into problems.

466
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:29,349
And it was inevitable because they were blind
here not to understand what’s going wrong

467
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:36,099
with them and that blindness has brought them
to this point that they start seeing their

468
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:42,970
ego specially, which has ruined them – money
orientation.

469
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:48,780
All this has shown how stupid they have been
to believe that they are very rich people

470
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:56,410
and they can do anything they want to with
their money and with overpowering of other

471
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:59,240
countries and other people.

472
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,369
First overpower yourself.

473
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:04,369
You have to know yourself first of all.

474
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:07,160
What’s the use of overpowering others?

475
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:15,410
Those who do not know how to overpower themselves
are always miserable, always in trouble because

476
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:16,410
it reacts.

477
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:21,269
If you try to overpower others, it reacts.

478
00:46:21,269 --> 00:46:29,240
For that you have to be absolutely introspecting,
again and again I have been saying this that,

479
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,240
“Introspect."

480
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:36,359
Of course, I must say, so many good Sahaj
Yogis have come out now and they have worked

481
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:40,140
it out, and they are very good, simple, wise
people.

482
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:47,779
It’s such a great hope for me, I never expected
I will work it out that good, but it has worked

483
00:46:47,779 --> 00:46:54,789
out and always, always, you must know you
have That Power within you and then must use

484
00:46:54,789 --> 00:47:00,000
that power and not fall a prey into nonsensical
ideas.

485
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,980
Thank you very much
