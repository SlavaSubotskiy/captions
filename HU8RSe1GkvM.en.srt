1
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:21,590
So today in the city of Vancouver, we have
gathered here to pray for, the country of

2
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:30,210
Canada, and also for the Canadian people.

3
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:39,309
Also we have to know that, there are lots
of negative forces working, and there has

4
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:46,690
to be some puja to be done, to the Mahakali
Force.

5
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,649
And so I thought today: ‘Let’s have the
puja for Mahakali’.

6
00:00:50,649 --> 00:01:01,779
So Mahakali Puja is the same as you do the
Devi’s Puja, but first the Mahakali Force

7
00:01:01,779 --> 00:01:03,059
came on this Earth.

8
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,479
Adi Shakti came as Mahakali and created Shri
Ganesha.

9
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:18,960
Then She ascended as Mahasaraswati, and with
that Force She created the whole universe.

10
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:30,770
In that She created this world, in a very
beautiful manner, with great arrangements

11
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:37,390
and organizing and on that were born human
beings because the temperature and all that

12
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:44,840
was made very congenial for human beings.

13
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:53,869
So this climate has also played a big part
on the temperament of the people, on the seeking

14
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:55,579
of the people.

15
00:01:55,579 --> 00:02:04,960
Like in India we can say, the climate is very
congenial for meditation.

16
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:12,409
It is been a traditional country from ancient
times, but from the very beginning we have

17
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:18,380
had seers who were seeking the Truth, in the
jungles.

18
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:25,260
The reason is this that, in India its climate
is so good that you can live in a jungle,

19
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,260
no problem.

20
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:33,569
So it was easy for them to get rid of all
the superficialities of life and to take seriously

21
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:39,310
– go to the jungles, dedicate themselves,
for finding out the Truth.

22
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,989
And thus they found out the Truth, that it
is the Kundalini which is the Force within

23
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:49,900
us which gives us Realization.

24
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:58,750
But this group, then scattered in different
places and they formed schools, were called,

25
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,879
or universities, called as gotras, and in
these schools were sent children from the

26
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,379
age of five years.

27
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:11,470
Till five years they lived with their parents
and then these children were sent there and

28
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:18,940
they were given all the education about day-to-day
life.

29
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,980
Their education system was very different.

30
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,270
By their education they made the children
very aware about everything, concentration,

31
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:36,689
and a complete celibacy because all the people
in a gotra could not marry.

32
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:42,110
Even today supposing I belong to one gotra,
I cannot marry a person in the same gotra.

33
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,010
So it is so much maintained even today.

34
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,099
Like in the university you cannot marry each
other.

35
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:52,060
So the children were kept like brothers and
sisters and they felt it all the time, brothers

36
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,120
and sisters feeling.

37
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:02,239
In the same way, you see, it has worked out
in many ways that the mooladhara chakra was

38
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:10,329
established very strongly in India, and that’s
why, though we had many other countries like

39
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:19,230
China, we had old China was there and also
Egypt, then we had Greece and also Rome.

40
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:25,820
All these countries did not pay much attention
to their mooladhara chakra and this mooladhara

41
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,190
was created by the Mahakali Power.

42
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:39,880
Mahakali created Shri Ganesha to emit holiness,
auspiciousness, wisdom, Divine wisdom; and

43
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,540
Her establishment of Shri Ganesha is also
within us on the mooladhara chakra.

44
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:52,130
But, if we do not pay attention to our mooladhara
chakra, then our powers become very weak and

45
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,050
we start catching from negativity much more.

46
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:01,080
Those who have good mooladharas do not catch,
so fast.

47
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:07,110
But we catch, we are harmed more by people
who are negative because they know that we

48
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,480
have bad mooladharas and they can affect us.

49
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,780
Now all the gurus and all those false gurus
came to western countries because they knew

50
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,300
they can affect much more here, than in India.

51
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,870
Like Rajneesh, nobody would accept such a
man.

52
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,780
Freud, nobody would accept such a person.

53
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:35,500
But here already Freud has done the necessary
harm to people and they were prepared to become,

54
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:44,640
vulnerable to these people, and on that background
these people came here and started acting

55
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,800
and they have been very successful.

56
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:55,660
All of them have been found out to be very
loose character and they are being exposed

57
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:01,130
and it’s nice that whatever is negative,
whatever is false gets exposed.

58
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,880
But still one has to remember that if we have
a strong mooladhara then Mahakali Power is

59
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:14,081
the strongest within us, because as I told
you, first She created Shri Ganesha, so all

60
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:21,880
Her Power are actually expressed in Aumkara
which is Shri Ganesh; and this Shri Ganesh

61
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:29,620
Power within us represents the complete love
of Mahakali and all Her Powers of destroying

62
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,720
the evil forces.

63
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:43,050
They go hand-in-hand we should say like, every
light has its glory around it, or glow around

64
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:53,340
it; in the same way the light of Mahakali
has the glow, as chaitanya, which is actually

65
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,330
nothing but Aumkara and Shri Ganesha.

66
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:05,960
Now Shri Ganesha has aspects, as I have told
them, that if you see the carbon from the

67
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,050
left, you see on the right side Aumkara, Aum,
written like that.

68
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,930
If you see from right to the left, you see
it as swastika.

69
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,090
If you see from down below upward, then you
see it as a cross.

70
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:25,620
And now they have verified it, they have experimented,
and the scientists have found out and have

71
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,490
now declared that it is so.

72
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,970
So that aspect of Aumkara which is within
us is the right side.

73
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,590
But the left side is the swastika.

74
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:43,690
And the swastika is a very, very sensitive
instrument that if you use it on the right

75
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:51,440
side then of course it is all right, it works
for construction; but if you use it for left

76
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,940
side, I mean in the anti-clock manner, then
it is destructive.

77
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:04,270
So swastika, when it is moving in its right
direction, clockwise in front and anti-clockwise

78
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:09,870
at the back, if it is moving in the right
direction, all negativity is thrown out on

79
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,670
the periphery, and absolutely they cannot
enter in.

80
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:18,640
But if it is moved on the left-hand side then
anybody can enter in.

81
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,610
So it is, even if you move a swastika, see
now, create a kind of a opening.

82
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,180
If you make a swastika and see, it opens out.

83
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,460
But if you move it this way, there’s no
opening.

84
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,820
It goes on closing, one on another.

85
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:42,649
So by moving it left side, it starts opening
itself to these negative forces.

86
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:47,900
This is exactly what has happened in the West,
that they had their mooladhara moving on the

87
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,779
left-hand side, the anti-clockwise.

88
00:08:50,779 --> 00:09:00,100
They went against their own principle of morality,
absolutely against Christ, and managed to

89
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,920
get all these bhoots into themselves.

90
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:10,610
Now Sahaja Yoga has one problem, in the West,
that people don’t want to hear that you

91
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,149
should be moral.

92
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:13,910
They find it very difficult.

93
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,120
If you tell them you have to be moral they
think we are fundamentalist or something like

94
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,120
that.

95
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:25,250
But it’s a fundamental thing that we have
to be moral people.

96
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,519
Now they are seeing the results of it, that
they have got AIDS, they have got all these

97
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,949
diseases, all these troubles; from that they
are learning that our mooladhara should be

98
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:37,540
all right, otherwise all these problems can
come.

99
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,750
But still they don’t want to accept it,
that they have done mistakes.

100
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,971
So this is another ego problem that they think:
‘Oh they are very much glorified and they

101
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:50,110
should be glorified, they did something new’.

102
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,600
I mean if you go and cut your nose, you don’t
glorify such people.

103
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:03,060
But something like that has happened and this,
kind of a nonsense is still stabilized, and

104
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,079
people don’t think much against it.

105
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:12,449
But the sufferings are so much, that whatever
you may try the sufferings are there, and

106
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:17,480
they have to accept that they have gone wrong,
and they have done such a wrong thing, and

107
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,000
that’s what they deserve.

108
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:31,060
But whatever it is, despite all their - you
can say the foolhardiness or tomfoolery, whatever

109
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:39,770
you may call it, they are to be saved, and
something has to be done for them because,

110
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:49,870
after all they are all seekers and they deserve
to be saved.

111
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,569
But with ego they don’t understand their
own benevolence.

112
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:57,140
To them benevolence is that their ego should
be satisfied.

113
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,819
So Sahaja Yoga is not like this that you just
put some spirit into somebody and the person

114
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:07,130
feels absolutely elated for a time being and
then is finished, but it is something that

115
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:13,410
has to grow, it’s a living process, it grows
within us, it takes time, and sometimes people

116
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,820
get frustrated with it.

117
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,200
But we should not.

118
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,689
We should know we are the foundations and
this is the most important work we are doing

119
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:23,100
in the history of spirituality.

120
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,459
So far, such work has not been done before.

121
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:33,040
So, this is such a big thing that we are doing
and we should be very satisfied with ourselves,

122
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,810
and should be confident, because this requires
people of quality.

123
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:46,040
Not necessarily you should be well-educated,
you should be highly placed; though to impress

124
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:54,839
people might be this might help, but still,
if you are deep people you can work out, in

125
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,900
no time.

126
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,220
If the soil is not good, then the tree has
to go deep down.

127
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,529
In the same way, when the atmosphere is not
good, we have to go deep down.

128
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:12,170
But one should never feel frustrated; one
should never feel upset, because even if you

129
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:18,180
are one person you are a Saint, and a Saint
brings all the luck, all the auspiciousness

130
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:24,480
to that country, so there’s nothing to feel
in any way desperate or unhappy about it.

131
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,430
But try to develop your depth by meditation
and by collective sitting down and talking

132
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,519
to each other.

133
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,860
I’m sure this will work out and this Force
of Mahakali will manifest.

134
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,320
After this puja I am sure something tremendous
should happen.

135
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,809
As it is you know that all these false gurus
have been exposed and are put on the shelves

136
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,040
now, most of them.

137
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,820
Some of them have died, some of them exposed
some - has happened.

138
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,029
Gradually they will all disappear.

139
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:55,230
We don’t have to worry about them.

140
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:00,930
We have to worry about ourselves that negativity
should not fall into us, and the negativity

141
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,699
that falls into Sahaja Yogis is the frustration.

142
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:10,639
They feel: ‘We are very few, others are
so many, why should we so few?’

143
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,800
I mean it’s all right.

144
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,529
That has to be that way, doesn’t matter.

145
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:21,450
And to have more people is not so important
as we should have quality.

146
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:27,839
We should have very good quality people who
are deep, who understand Sahaja Yoga, who

147
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,269
know it very well, because even if you have
too many and they don’t know anything about

148
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:34,740
Sahaja Yoga, they are useless.

149
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:42,999
So not only that you should have this love
of God’s Divine Nature but also knowledge

150
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:43,999
about Sahaja Yoga.

151
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:51,339
Both things are the same, actually if you
love someone you know about that person, everything.

152
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:58,920
When such a thing will happen all over the
world that, so many countries will accept

153
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:08,499
Sahaja Yoga, and so many will start talking
openly about it, on a very high level, then

154
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:14,860
even the countries which have not been able
to achieve much results, or we can say cities,

155
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,490
will suddenly jump up.

156
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,249
I have great hopes from Toronto.

157
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:23,410
Toronto will come up very well I think and
I’m sure tonight also, we’ll have lots

158
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,860
of people who will be sticking on.

159
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:33,259
Because no use having thousand people and
ultimately two turn up, that sort of thing,

160
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:34,360
common experience.

161
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,420
So this would be a better idea.

162
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:46,009
And today’s prayer should be, in our hearts,
that let us get very powerful Ganesha Shakti,

163
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:49,619
let us get that.

164
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:56,029
And second should be that this Shakti should
destroy all that is negativity.

165
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,139
Even not to be collective itself is a negativity.

166
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:07,180
All these collectivity problems, or all these
negativity problems must be destroyed by this

167
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,519
Mahakali Power which will manifest through
us.

168
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,519
May God bless you.

169
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:11,570
So now there should be washing….[HINDI]
