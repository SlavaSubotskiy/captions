1
00:00:02,976 --> 00:00:04,989
So today in the city of

2
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:07,172
Vancouver,

3
00:00:10,003 --> 00:00:12,158
we have gathered here to pray

4
00:00:13,882 --> 00:00:14,980
for,

5
00:00:19,371 --> 00:00:21,900
the country of Canada,

6
00:00:23,722 --> 00:00:26,808
and also for the Canadian people.

7
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:31,020
Also

8
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,780
we have to know that,

9
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,460
there are lots of negative forces working,

10
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:41,100
and there has to be some

11
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,540
puja to be done,

12
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,744
to the Mahakali Force.

13
00:00:47,188 --> 00:00:51,088
And so I thought today: ‘Let’s have the puja for Mahakali’.

14
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:55,401
So Mahakali Puja is the same as you

15
00:00:56,112 --> 00:00:58,740
do the Devi’s Puja,

16
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:02,906
but first the Mahakali Force came on this Earth.

17
00:01:03,107 --> 00:01:05,271
Adi Shakti came as Mahakali

18
00:01:05,472 --> 00:01:07,647
and created Shri Ganesha.

19
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:13,300
Then She ascended as Mahasaraswati,

20
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,800
and with that Force She created the whole universe.

21
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:22,980
In that She created this world,

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,512
in a very beautiful manner, with great

23
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,900
arrangements and organizing

24
00:01:33,142 --> 00:01:35,344
and on that were born human beings

25
00:01:35,544 --> 00:01:38,187
because the temperature and all that was made

26
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,946
very congenial for human beings.

27
00:01:44,763 --> 00:01:48,620
So this climate has also

28
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,037
played a big part

29
00:01:51,238 --> 00:01:54,479
on the temperament of the people, on the seeking of the people.

30
00:01:55,205 --> 00:01:57,500
Like in India we can say,

31
00:01:59,115 --> 00:02:03,017
the climate is very congenial for meditation.

32
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:07,940
It is been a traditional country

33
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,043
from ancient times,

34
00:02:10,515 --> 00:02:11,756
but from the very beginning

35
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:14,982
we have had seers who were seeking the Truth,

36
00:02:15,183 --> 00:02:16,645
in the jungles.

37
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:19,413
The reason is this that,

38
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:22,788
in India its climate is so good

39
00:02:22,988 --> 00:02:25,623
that you can live in a jungle, no problem.

40
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:29,059
So it was easy for them to get rid of

41
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:31,917
all the superficialities of life and

42
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,823
to take seriously – go to the jungles,

43
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:36,779
dedicate themselves,

44
00:02:37,846 --> 00:02:39,820
for finding out the Truth.

45
00:02:40,443 --> 00:02:43,739
And thus they found out the Truth, that it is the Kundalini

46
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:45,691
which is the Force within us

47
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,087
which gives us Realization.

48
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,580
But this group,

49
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:55,772
then scattered in different places

50
00:02:55,972 --> 00:02:57,690
and they formed schools,

51
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,996
were called, or universities, called as gotras,

52
00:03:01,817 --> 00:03:05,817
and in these schools were sent
children from the age of five years. Till -

53
00:03:06,157 --> 00:03:08,674
Five years they lived with their parents and then

54
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,843
these children were sent there

55
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:13,608
and they were given all the education

56
00:03:14,713 --> 00:03:18,136
about day-to-day life.

57
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:21,651
Their education system was very different.

58
00:03:22,747 --> 00:03:26,747
By their education they made the
children very aware about everything,

59
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,300
concentration, and a complete

60
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:35,678
celibacy because all the people in a gotra could not marry.

61
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:39,060
Even today supposing I belong to one gotra,

62
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,760
I cannot marry a person in the same gotra.

63
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:43,810
So it is so much maintained even today.

64
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:47,622
Like in the university you cannot marry each other.

65
00:03:47,823 --> 00:03:49,340
So the children were kept like

66
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,540
brothers and sisters and they felt it
all the time, brothers and sisters feeling.

67
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:58,003
In the same way, you see,

68
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:00,676
it has worked out in many ways

69
00:04:00,876 --> 00:04:04,660
that the Mooladhara chakra was established very strongly in India,

70
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,430
and that’s why,

71
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:09,244
though we had many other

72
00:04:09,444 --> 00:04:11,723
countries like China, we had

73
00:04:11,923 --> 00:04:14,493
old China was there and also Egypt,

74
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:16,428
then we had Greece

75
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:18,496
and also Rome.

76
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:21,552
All these countries did not pay much

77
00:04:21,752 --> 00:04:24,060
attention to their Mooladhara chakra

78
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:26,900
and this Mooladhara was created

79
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:29,845
by the Mahakali Power.

80
00:04:30,046 --> 00:04:32,620
Mahakali created Shri Ganesha

81
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,113
to emit holiness,

82
00:04:35,314 --> 00:04:37,180
auspiciousness, wisdom,

83
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,208
Divine wisdom;

84
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:42,147
and Her establishment of Shri Ganesha

85
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,293
is also within us on the Mooladhara chakra.

86
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:49,203
But, if we do not pay attention to our Mooladhara chakra,

87
00:04:49,404 --> 00:04:51,670
then our powers become very weak

88
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:55,019
and we start catching from negativity much more.

89
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,977
Those who have good Mooladharas do not catch,

90
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:00,595
so fast.

91
00:05:00,796 --> 00:05:03,638
But we catch, we are harmed more by people

92
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,220
who are negative

93
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,170
because they know that we have bad Mooladharas

94
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,370
and they can affect us.

95
00:05:10,993 --> 00:05:14,599
Now all the gurus and all those false gurus came to

96
00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:18,371
western countries because they
knew they can affect much more here,

97
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:20,071
than in India.

98
00:05:20,272 --> 00:05:22,493
Like Rajneesh, nobody would accept such a man.

99
00:05:22,694 --> 00:05:25,291
Freud, nobody would accept such a person.

100
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,112
But here already Freud has done the

101
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:32,992
necessary harm to people and they were prepared to become,

102
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:38,554
vulnerable to these people,

103
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,457
and on that background these people came here

104
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:43,158
and started

105
00:05:44,036 --> 00:05:46,640
acting and they have been very successful.

106
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:48,781
All of them

107
00:05:49,553 --> 00:05:53,541
have been found out to be very loose character

108
00:05:53,742 --> 00:05:55,380
and they are being exposed

109
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,140
and it’s nice that whatever is negative,

110
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,654
whatever is false gets exposed.

111
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:03,097
But still one has to remember that

112
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:05,130
if we have a strong Mooladhara

113
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,180
then Mahakali Power is the strongest within us,

114
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:10,620
because as I told you, first

115
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,312
She created Shri Ganesha,

116
00:06:13,526 --> 00:06:17,460
so all Her Power are actually expressed in Aumkara

117
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,272
which is Shri Ganesh;

118
00:06:19,835 --> 00:06:23,660
and this Shri Ganesh Power within us represents

119
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,773
the complete love of Mahakali

120
00:06:26,973 --> 00:06:29,419
and all Her Powers of destroying

121
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,335
the evil forces.

122
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:33,020
They go

123
00:06:33,453 --> 00:06:36,798
hand-in-hand we should say like, every

124
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:41,097
light has its glory around it,

125
00:06:41,298 --> 00:06:42,850
or glow around it;

126
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:44,940
in the same way

127
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,380
the light of Mahakali

128
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,900
has the glow,

129
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,820
as chaitanya,

130
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,595
which is actually nothing but Aumkara

131
00:06:55,795 --> 00:06:58,046
and Shri Ganesha.

132
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,025
Now Shri Ganesha has aspects,

133
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:02,444
as I have told them,

134
00:07:02,644 --> 00:07:06,620
that if you see the carbon from the left,

135
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,860
you see on the right side Aumkara,

136
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,579
Aum, written like that.

137
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,851
If you see from right to the left,

138
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:15,517
you see it as swastika.

139
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:18,051
If you see from down below upward,

140
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:19,890
then you see it as a cross.

141
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,565
And now they have verified it, they have experimented,

142
00:07:22,765 --> 00:07:24,484
and the scientists have found out

143
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:27,884
and have now declared that it is so.

144
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:33,184
So that aspect of Aumkara which is within us is the right side.

145
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:35,601
But the left side is the swastika.

146
00:07:35,982 --> 00:07:38,717
And the swastika is a very, very

147
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,900
sensitive instrument that if you use it

148
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,509
on the right side then of course

149
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,340
it is all right,

150
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,243
it works for construction; but if you use it for left side,

151
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:56,251
I mean in the anti-clock manner, then it is destructive.

152
00:07:56,835 --> 00:07:59,019
So swastika, when it is moving

153
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:01,060
in its right direction,

154
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:04,485
clockwise in front and anti-clockwise at the back,

155
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,740
if it is moving in the right direction,

156
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,566
all negativity is thrown out on

157
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:13,102
the periphery, and absolutely they cannot enter in.

158
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:15,869
But if it is moved on the left-hand side

159
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,175
then anybody can enter in.

160
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:21,491
So it is, even if you move a swastika, see now,

161
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:24,219
create a kind of a opening.

162
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,371
If you make a swastika and see,

163
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:27,695
it opens out.

164
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:30,567
But if you move it this way, there’s no opening.

165
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:33,375
It goes on closing, one on another.

166
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:37,340
So by moving it left side, it starts

167
00:08:37,939 --> 00:08:40,539
opening itself to these

168
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:42,186
negative forces.

169
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:44,940
This is exactly what has happened in the West,

170
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:48,868
that they had their Mooladhara moving on the left-hand side,

171
00:08:49,351 --> 00:08:51,429
the anti-clockwise. They went against

172
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,443
their own principle of morality,

173
00:08:56,553 --> 00:08:58,680
absolutely against Christ,

174
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:02,426
and managed to get all these bhoots into themselves.

175
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:04,612
Now Sahaja Yoga has one problem,

176
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:07,540
in the West,

177
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,717
that people don’t want to hear that you should be moral.

178
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,447
They find it very difficult.

179
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:16,793
If you tell them you have to be moral they think we are

180
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:20,589
fundamentalist or something like that.

181
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,540
But it’s a fundamental thing

182
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,792
that we have to be moral people.

183
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,899
Now they are seeing the results of it, that

184
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,340
they have got AIDS, they have got
all these diseases, all these troubles;

185
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,540
from that they are learning that our Mooladhara should be

186
00:09:34,844 --> 00:09:37,536
all right, otherwise all these problems can come.

187
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:40,373
But still they don’t want to accept it,

188
00:09:40,574 --> 00:09:42,585
that they have done mistakes.

189
00:09:42,786 --> 00:09:43,980
So this is another ego

190
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,340
problem that they think: ‘Oh they are very much glorified

191
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,159
and they should be glorified, they did something new’.

192
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,464
I mean if you go and cut your nose,

193
00:09:52,664 --> 00:09:54,561
you don’t glorify such people.

194
00:09:54,785 --> 00:09:57,028
But something like that has happened

195
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,340
and this,

196
00:09:59,962 --> 00:10:02,859
kind of a nonsense is still stabilized,

197
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,583
and people don’t think

198
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:06,216
much against it.

199
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:08,860
But the sufferings are so much,

200
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:11,924
that whatever you may try the sufferings are there,

201
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,369
and they have to accept that they have gone wrong,

202
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,678
and they have done such a wrong thing,

203
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,907
and that’s what they deserve.

204
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:22,540
But whatever it is,

205
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:24,755
despite all their

206
00:10:24,955 --> 00:10:26,291
- you can say the

207
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,060
foolhardiness or

208
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,716
tomfoolery, whatever you may call it,

209
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:34,425
they are to be saved,

210
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:38,459
and something has to be done for them because,

211
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:43,482
after all they are all seekers and they deserve to be

212
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,561
saved.

213
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:52,409
But with ego they don’t understand their own benevolence.

214
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:56,351
To them benevolence is that their ego should be satisfied.

215
00:10:56,915 --> 00:11:00,900
So Sahaja Yoga is not like this that
you just put some spirit into somebody

216
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,140
and the person feels absolutely

217
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,740
elated for a time being and then is finished,

218
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,015
but it is something that has to grow,

219
00:11:08,215 --> 00:11:10,420
it’s a living process, it grows within us,

220
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,820
it takes time,

221
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,758
and sometimes people get frustrated with it.

222
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,219
But we should not.

223
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,399
We should know we are the foundations and

224
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:22,521
this is the most important work we
are doing in the history of spirituality.

225
00:11:22,722 --> 00:11:24,020
So far,

226
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,259
such work has not been done before.

227
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:29,500
So, this is such a big thing

228
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,002
that we are doing and we should be very satisfied with ourselves,

229
00:11:33,203 --> 00:11:34,540
and should be confident,

230
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:38,072
because this requires people of quality.

231
00:11:38,548 --> 00:11:39,860
Not necessarily

232
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:42,559
you should be well-educated, you should be

233
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:44,464
highly placed;

234
00:11:45,043 --> 00:11:49,043
though to impress people might be this might help, but still,

235
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:51,123
if you are deep people

236
00:11:51,323 --> 00:11:54,140
you can work out,

237
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:55,840
in no time.

238
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,140
If the soil is not good,

239
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,292
then the tree has to go deep down. In the same way,

240
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:03,187
when the atmosphere is not good,

241
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:06,221
we have to go deep down. But one should never

242
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:08,300
feel frustrated;

243
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,292
one should never feel upset,

244
00:12:10,492 --> 00:12:12,509
because even if you are

245
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:14,460
one person you are a Saint,

246
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,451
and a Saint brings all the luck,

247
00:12:16,651 --> 00:12:19,484
all the auspiciousness to that country, so

248
00:12:19,684 --> 00:12:21,548
there’s nothing to feel in any way

249
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:24,032
desperate or unhappy about it.

250
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:26,980
But try to develop your depth by meditation

251
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,620
and by collective

252
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,270
sitting down and talking to each other.

253
00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:33,099
I’m sure this will work out

254
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:37,256
and this Force of Mahakali will manifest.

255
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,781
After this puja I am sure something tremendous should happen.

256
00:12:40,982 --> 00:12:43,620
As it is you know that all these false gurus

257
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,180
have been exposed

258
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,020
and are put on the shelves now, most of them.

259
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,373
Some of them have died, some of them exposed some - has happened.

260
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:55,116
Gradually they will all disappear. We don’t have to worry about them.

261
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:59,317
We have to worry about ourselves
that negativity should not fall into us,

262
00:12:59,964 --> 00:13:03,668
and the negativity that falls into Sahaja Yogis

263
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:05,294
is the frustration.

264
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,435
They feel: ‘We are very few,

265
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:09,235
others are so many,

266
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:12,311
why should we so few?’ I mean it’s all right.

267
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:15,329
That has to be that way, doesn’t matter.

268
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,020
And to have more people

269
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:21,879
is not so important as we should have quality people.

270
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,900
We should have very good quality people who are deep,

271
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:29,520
who understand Sahaja Yoga, who know it very well,

272
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:34,145
because even if you have too many and they don’t
know anything about Sahaja Yoga, they are useless.

273
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:38,530
So not only that you should have this love of

274
00:13:39,771 --> 00:13:41,543
God’s Divine Nature

275
00:13:41,743 --> 00:13:44,012
but also knowledge about Sahaja Yoga.

276
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:48,206
Both things are the same, actually
 if you love someone you know about

277
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:50,262
that person, everything.

278
00:13:51,227 --> 00:13:53,180
When such a thing

279
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,057
will happen all over the world that,

280
00:13:57,258 --> 00:13:59,820
so many countries will accept Sahaja Yoga,

281
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,741
and so many will start talking

282
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,851
openly about it,

283
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,852
on a very high level,

284
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:09,220
then even the countries

285
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,953
which have not been able to achieve much results,

286
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:16,290
or we can say cities, will suddenly jump up.

287
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:18,550
I have great hopes from Toronto.

288
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:22,540
Toronto will come up very well I think and I’m sure tonight also,

289
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,360
we’ll have lots of people who will be sticking on.

290
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:30,103
Because no use having thousand people and ultimately two turn up,

291
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,994
that sort of thing,

292
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:33,737
common experience.

293
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:36,548
So this would be a better idea.

294
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:40,099
And today’s prayer should be, in our hearts,

295
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:42,299
that let us

296
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,415
get very powerful

297
00:14:46,138 --> 00:14:48,983
Ganesha Shakti, let us get that.

298
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:51,198
And second should be that

299
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:53,340
this Shakti should destroy

300
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,418
all that is negativity.

301
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:58,646
Even not to be collective itself is a negativity.

302
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:00,657
All these collectivity

303
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:03,060
problems, or all these

304
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,747
negativity problems

305
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:08,180
must be destroyed by this Mahakali Power

306
00:15:08,381 --> 00:15:10,860
which will manifest through us.

307
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,860
May God bless you.
