1
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:59,219
Today is a special day, as you know; 
we are worshipping the Goddess

2
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:06,244
who came on this earth 
nine times before,

3
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:10,557
to kill all the demons 
and all the negativity,

4
00:03:10,851 --> 00:03:19,015
and relieve all the 
bhaktas to worship.

5
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:26,173
All Her work is already 
been described.

6
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:35,700
Despite that they find 
new type of devils,

7
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:43,437
new type of negative people 
have come back.

8
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,231
Perhaps it had to be.

9
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:08,162
This had to be, maybe, 
after all it’s Kali Yuga;

10
00:04:08,637 --> 00:04:13,224
and the drama of Kali Yuga 
would not be performed

11
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:17,373
unless and until 
they are there.

12
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:24,129
So to complete 
this drama they came.

13
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:38,291
But this time it’s going to be 
a very different type of war

14
00:04:40,673 --> 00:04:45,842
- it’s going to be the war 
of the peaceful people.

15
00:04:47,255 --> 00:04:50,753
And the peaceful people

16
00:04:51,009 --> 00:05:00,848
are the most successful people in 
every walk of life, even in the war.

17
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:06,197
It did not work out before.

18
00:05:06,622 --> 00:05:11,213
They say that when 
Genghis Khan came,

19
00:05:12,363 --> 00:05:20,076
he went to a very big monastery 
of Buddhists near Gaya

20
00:05:20,877 --> 00:05:23,388
and killed all of them.

21
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:27,114
There were about thirty 
thousand of Buddhists there

22
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:32,670
and they didn’t say a word, 
and they were all killed.

23
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:38,164
So people started 
disbelieving in Buddhism.

24
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:44,212
They said, “What kind of a Buddhism 
is here; why didn’t Buddha save them?”

25
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:49,352
That’s human style 
of thinking.

26
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:52,505
Buddha should have saved 
these thirty thousand people

27
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,305
these who were peaceful,

28
00:05:56,021 --> 00:06:03,933
who were resisting in a manner 
that was no resistance,

29
00:06:04,387 --> 00:06:09,207
and so they were all killed by this 
horrible fellow called Genghis Khan.

30
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:15,232
But you’ll be surprised, in 
this Kali Yuga this Genghis Khan

31
00:06:15,477 --> 00:06:17,926
has been praised 
by many authors,

32
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:21,158
and there are books 
written about him.

33
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:26,255
He was not a Muslim – was 
some sort of a crackpot.

34
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:32,274
He finished off many mosques,

35
00:06:32,606 --> 00:06:39,687
he destroyed many 
beautiful buildings

36
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:45,783
and also he came to India 
and ruled there for a short time.

37
00:06:46,702 --> 00:06:49,529
All that’s a history.

38
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:58,723
In the same way there 
have been wars

39
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,916
between Christians 
and non-Christians,

40
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:15,053
between Muslims 
and non-Muslims.

41
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:21,603
All kinds of wars we 
have heard of where

42
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:26,834
only the faithful got lost,

43
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,478
the real people got lost.

44
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:37,479
The one who worshipped 
God with full faith got lost.

45
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:42,847
So, many people 
become atheist

46
00:07:43,885 --> 00:07:46,586
and they said, “There is 
nothing like God,

47
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:49,724
nothing like His 
divine Power.

48
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:53,761
It never existed. We were 
stupid, we were foolish

49
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:56,390
to follow all this.”

50
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,848
And those who were 
in charge of religion

51
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,698
took full advantage 
of that and said

52
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:07,634
that these people 
were sinful people,

53
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,870
these people were 
not godly people,

54
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:19,074
and that’s how they were killed by 
us and we were victorious.”

55
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:27,191
The idea of victory they had 
that they have been successful

56
00:08:27,498 --> 00:08:31,923
“and so many people have 
been butchered by us.”

57
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:39,548
So we come to Kali Yuga,

58
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:48,026
and in Kali Yuga same thing 
has started in a subtler way;

59
00:08:48,276 --> 00:08:51,595
in a different way 
it has started that

60
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,474
there’s a big war going 
on between the people

61
00:08:56,814 --> 00:09:01,851
who are anti-God,

62
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:07,805
and who are using God 
for their own purpose.

63
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:13,488
Very dishonest, very corrupt, 
very cruel people,

64
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:19,519
and they are using 
the flag of God,

65
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:26,504
that banner which they 
have no right to use.

66
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:31,072
Then there are Sahaja yogis

67
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:38,498
who have got their realization, 
and they have to fight them.

68
00:09:39,157 --> 00:09:47,758
Now the difference in the previous 
wars and this war is very different.

69
00:09:50,301 --> 00:09:56,452
In those wars, you see, all those 
who were supposed to be victorious

70
00:09:59,452 --> 00:10:09,727
– this was after all the nine 
battles of the Divine Mother

71
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:15,714
– the negativity that came up 
and which became successful

72
00:10:16,071 --> 00:10:22,487
started feeling very confident that 
“we have achieved what we wanted.”

73
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:28,513
But in Kali Yuga now,

74
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:34,238
in the light of Kali Yuga

75
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:39,775
all those historical victories

76
00:10:41,163 --> 00:10:44,929
are regarded 
as shameful things,

77
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:51,417
as something very 
aggressive and nonsensical.

78
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:57,080
This is now being 
described everywhere.

79
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,600
Like the white-skinned 
people went to

80
00:11:03,502 --> 00:11:07,608
America and killed 
all the rest of them there

81
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:14,757
– now that is coming 
into light.

82
00:11:15,756 --> 00:11:23,457
All these people who thought 
themselves to be victorious:

83
00:11:23,738 --> 00:11:27,382
children, their grandchildren, 
their progeny’s ashamed of them,

84
00:11:27,695 --> 00:11:33,326
ashamed to call that 
they were their forefathers

85
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,907
– up till the last war.

86
00:11:39,038 --> 00:11:43,119
This awareness which has come

87
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:51,983
is the real victory of modern 
times, of this Kali Yuga:

88
00:11:52,701 --> 00:11:58,771
that everything that was 
accepted as a part of the game,

89
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:05,400
as the lifestyle 
you can call it,

90
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:11,167
is now being challenged in 
modern times everywhere.

91
00:12:11,461 --> 00:12:18,947
Whatever is aggression, 
whatever is oppression,

92
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:27,638
whatever is cruel is 
now punished also.

93
00:12:30,113 --> 00:12:34,681
You see so many war 
criminals must have escaped,

94
00:12:34,944 --> 00:12:38,730
but so many went into trials

95
00:12:39,043 --> 00:12:40,899
– never happened before.

96
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:44,517
Nobody took Genghis Khan to a trial.

97
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:47,780
Now in a very subtle way

98
00:12:48,055 --> 00:12:52,467
all these aggressive people 
are getting now afraid

99
00:12:53,008 --> 00:13:03,090
that they will be questioned, 
and they may be tortured.

100
00:13:04,322 --> 00:13:05,769
It started I don’t know where,

101
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:09,840
but definitely at the beginning 
of the Kali Yuga.

102
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:11,853
If you remember in this 
country was

103
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:16,434
a great aggressive man 
called Mussolini,

104
00:13:16,953 --> 00:13:20,102
and ultimately he was hanged.

105
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:23,997
In Germany there was 
a very powerful man

106
00:13:24,293 --> 00:13:27,109
called Hitler, and Himmler 
and all this.

107
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,933
God knows what 
happened to them

108
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:33,362
– even the Germans don’t 
want to take his name,

109
00:13:33,618 --> 00:13:36,396
they’re all ashamed of him.

110
00:13:36,936 --> 00:13:40,385
Then we had somebody 
say in England,

111
00:13:40,641 --> 00:13:43,801
Warren Hastings who 
came to India

112
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:45,871
– he was put to jail.

113
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:49,869
This was never done before.

114
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:56,864
If Napoleon aggressed people, he 
thought he was very victorious;

115
00:13:57,153 --> 00:14:03,260
but he could not continue 
with it, he had to face it.

116
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:11,226
You see anybody who 
has been aggressive,

117
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:20,989
who has been dominating, 
who has been very cruel, demonic,

118
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:26,464
has been taken to task 
mostly in his lifetime.

119
00:14:27,771 --> 00:14:34,729
Now, if not in his lifetime,

120
00:14:35,031 --> 00:14:39,172
afterwards he was maligned

121
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:43,006
and he doesn’t have a name 
like a hero or anything.

122
00:14:43,302 --> 00:14:46,778
People don’t want 
to erect their statues.

123
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:52,072
So the awareness has come 
in the mind of the people.

124
00:14:52,368 --> 00:14:57,608
Like a person like Stalin who 
ruled Russia once upon a time,

125
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,108
today you can’t see even 
one statue of Stalin.

126
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:05,536
These are modern times,

127
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,119
see the power 
of modern times;

128
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:12,922
and that is frightening 
to those people

129
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:17,878
who think they can get along 
with whatever they are doing.

130
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:24,602
It is going to be very 
soon understood by them

131
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:32,123
that they have to stop all this 
nonsense, otherwise they will suffer.

132
00:15:32,703 --> 00:15:36,213
It’s not those whom 
they are dominating

133
00:15:36,543 --> 00:15:39,895
but those who are 
dominating will suffer.

134
00:15:40,176 --> 00:15:43,426
They will suffer physically, 
they will suffer mentally,

135
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:45,326
hey will suffer emotionally,

136
00:15:45,582 --> 00:15:51,666
and also their fame 
will be in the mud.

137
00:15:53,020 --> 00:16:01,940
So today’s victory of the 
power of the Divine Mother

138
00:16:02,551 --> 00:16:07,644
is doing one very great 
work, is to expose;

139
00:16:09,071 --> 00:16:13,560
and this exposure will be

140
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:19,004
condemning publicly those 
people who are doing wrong.

141
00:16:21,115 --> 00:16:23,902
If you see from that point of view,

142
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:30,165
you will understand how 
we are victorious now.

143
00:16:30,961 --> 00:16:35,119
Many of you felt very sad 
that I didn’t get the award.

144
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:38,079
This award makes no 
difference to Me,

145
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:40,829
and to you also I must tell you;

146
00:16:41,098 --> 00:16:45,366
because you have come without 
I having any award,

147
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:49,419
and many will come without 
having any award as such.

148
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:55,320
But this time, for the 
first time if you notice

149
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:59,605
the people who got award 
are condemned.

150
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:06,027
Even now they are writing against 
it, even now they are criticizing.

151
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:11,733
So those who have been, they 
thought they were very smart,

152
00:17:12,027 --> 00:17:13,908
the smartness is out now

153
00:17:14,214 --> 00:17:16,252
and I don’t know 
how long will it go on;

154
00:17:16,508 --> 00:17:18,589
because even today if you use,

155
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:21,223
open a newspaper you 
find something about it,

156
00:17:21,511 --> 00:17:24,879
that how stupidly 
they have done it

157
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,563
– they can’t understand what was 
the reason they have done it.

158
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:32,001
Not only the people who 
selected are criticized,

159
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:36,858
but very much more 
the people who are selected.

160
00:17:38,469 --> 00:17:42,549
Now, as being Sahaja yogis, 
we have to know

161
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:46,726
what is the difference between

162
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:53,188
the consciousness at that 
time and awareness at this time.

163
00:17:56,384 --> 00:17:59,409
That time it was necessary 
to kill those demons, finish them,

164
00:17:59,715 --> 00:18:03,664
but they are back 
again on the stage.

165
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:12,178
Now at this time when 
it is Kali Yuga

166
00:18:13,078 --> 00:18:15,977
they are exposed,

167
00:18:18,071 --> 00:18:20,511
they are condemned,

168
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:26,931
they are put in the jail, they 
are now punished publicly.

169
00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:31,609
So the collective awareness

170
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:38,551
has got such a great victory 
I think, over these people

171
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,478
whom so many came, 
killed and died

172
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:44,034
without getting any 
punishment out of it,

173
00:18:44,278 --> 00:18:48,996
without getting any 
defamation out of it.

174
00:18:49,976 --> 00:18:52,753
Now let us see what 
is consciousness

175
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:57,103
and what is awareness.

176
00:19:08,434 --> 00:19:13,534
It is a subtle subject which 
I think you all can understand.

177
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,557
Consciousness is that

178
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,707
when you are made conscious, 
you become conscious about it.

179
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,571
Like I have My 
hand here all right,

180
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:32,690
but normally I am not conscious 
of it that I have a hand.

181
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:40,073
If a man is sleeping, he is 
not conscious that he’s sleeping.

182
00:19:40,692 --> 00:19:45,215
When you tell Me “You have 
a hand” I become conscious;

183
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:50,678
or something pricks Me, 
then I become conscious

184
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:54,761
– otherwise I am 
unconscious about it.

185
00:19:56,636 --> 00:20:03,889
I am absolutely unconscious about 
My eyes, I am seeing everything;

186
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:10,975
but supposing I become 
blind, I can’t see:

187
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:15,735
then I become conscious 
of My eyes,

188
00:20:15,998 --> 00:20:20,824
that I have got My eyes through 
which now I cannot see.

189
00:20:21,848 --> 00:20:29,057
So once you say there is this 
hand, the consciousness is there.

190
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:33,370
This we can say is the 
knowledge about the hand,

191
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:36,783
that you get knowledge 
about that.

192
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,918
But once

193
00:20:41,468 --> 00:20:46,324
you are not conscious of the hand, 
that knowledge is disappeared.

194
00:20:48,895 --> 00:20:53,375
So to say there is ignorance 
or there is knowledge,

195
00:20:53,657 --> 00:20:57,629
both things are just the same.

196
00:20:58,347 --> 00:21:06,270
You are not conscious of your hand 
so you are quite ignorant about it.

197
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,433
Now supposing somebody says,

198
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:13,059
“Your hands are very beautiful,”

199
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,440
somebody remarks likes that then 
I become conscious of My hand

200
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:24,465
which is beautiful; otherwise 
I never knew they were beautiful.

201
00:21:27,015 --> 00:21:32,021
So normally all human beings 
live at that level,

202
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:35,138
that somebody has to tell you.

203
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:38,406
Now somebody said, “You 
are wearing a very nice sari.”

204
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:44,996
All right. Then I look at it – yes, 
it’s very nice, I never knew.

205
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:52,329
So somebody has to tell you, 
then you become conscious;

206
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:57,063
otherwise you are not.

207
00:21:59,175 --> 00:22:04,114
So we all human beings 
at that level are like that.

208
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,776
Now, what is awareness?

209
00:22:09,907 --> 00:22:12,006
– that’s a different thing.

210
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:17,469
That means if I see

211
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:22,820
somebody is attacking Me 
I put My hand like this.

212
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,570
That means I’m 
aware I have a hand.

213
00:22:26,902 --> 00:22:29,289
I’m not conscious but I’m aware

214
00:22:29,608 --> 00:22:31,633
aware that I have 
a hand, I have to use it.

215
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,382
Like here in Italy you 
go on using your hands

216
00:22:34,676 --> 00:22:37,663
bringing them up all 
the time like this.

217
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:43,199
That means you know you 
are aware that you have got hands,

218
00:22:43,506 --> 00:22:46,250
that you have to use 
them for expressing

219
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:50,387
something more sort 
of emphatically.

220
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:59,316
So we are sort of also 
aware of our body,

221
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,448
we are aware of others,

222
00:23:04,288 --> 00:23:06,675
we know about others,

223
00:23:07,206 --> 00:23:10,455
we know what sort of 
a person another one is

224
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:16,087
– up till you are self-realized.

225
00:23:18,586 --> 00:23:21,473
After Self-realization what happens?

226
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,154
It’s 
very interesting.

227
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:32,199
After Self-realization you go 
beyond both these things,

228
00:23:32,689 --> 00:23:36,776
consciousness and awareness,

229
00:23:37,914 --> 00:23:43,327
because you go beyond thought.

230
00:23:45,313 --> 00:23:48,644
“You have gone beyond 
thought” means what?

231
00:23:49,113 --> 00:23:54,099
Anger, all kinds of ideas,

232
00:23:54,398 --> 00:23:56,936
all kinds of aggression,

233
00:23:57,199 --> 00:24:01,930
everything is maneuvered

234
00:24:02,198 --> 00:24:06,178
or worked through your mind.

235
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:12,984
So if your mind is lost, 
what will you do?

236
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:18,150
There’s no mind anymore.

237
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:22,676
You exist with reality,

238
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:27,803
so there is no mind 
to communicate.

239
00:24:28,575 --> 00:24:31,331
We call it “thoughtlessly aware.”

240
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:33,393
Means what?

241
00:24:33,725 --> 00:24:36,125
We have conquered 
all our enemies by

242
00:24:36,387 --> 00:24:40,406
giving up one enemy 
that was our mind.

243
00:24:41,076 --> 00:24:44,169
There’s no mind to suggest,

244
00:24:44,469 --> 00:24:47,513
there’s no mind to tell you,

245
00:24:48,165 --> 00:24:52,740
so once there is no 
mind you are lost.

246
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:56,258
Now it is being said that you ask

247
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:59,746
a question to yourself, 
“Who am I?”

248
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:04,488
As soon as you ask this question 
you become thoughtless,

249
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:07,026
so you get lost.

250
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:11,270
You cannot answer this question.

251
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,907
Otherwise you might say, “I am 
a woman, I am this, I am that”;

252
00:25:17,152 --> 00:25:24,735
“I am a bishop or I am a pope, 
I am this, I am that.”

253
00:25:26,196 --> 00:25:30,641
But once you are a realized soul, 
who will tell  you who arey ou?

254
00:25:30,902 --> 00:25:34,976
Because the one which tells 
you is the mind which doesn’t exist

255
00:25:35,282 --> 00:25:37,100
- no thought

256
00:25:39,026 --> 00:25:44,526
– means you get dissolved 
into yourself.

257
00:25:47,037 --> 00:25:49,599
This is what is reality.

258
00:25:51,982 --> 00:25:57,897
But you are aware also; 
now that’s another point.

259
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:06,684
If you ask yourself a question 
you are not there,

260
00:26:08,328 --> 00:26:10,130
but you are aware.

261
00:26:10,907 --> 00:26:13,219
If your Nabhi is catching 
you immediately you know

262
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,619
“My Nabhi is catching, 
I have got liver.”

263
00:26:17,949 --> 00:26:19,393
Don’t have to ask questions.

264
00:26:19,675 --> 00:26:21,387
Or somebody is standing near you,

265
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:25,893
his left Swadisthana 
– “Oh my God, it is this one!”

266
00:26:29,918 --> 00:26:32,037
If somebody is very angry 
and hot tempered,

267
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:34,646
immediately you’ll feel such 
heat from that person,

268
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:38,434
you’ll say, “Oh baba, 
I’ll run away from this man.”

269
00:26:39,353 --> 00:26:42,696
So this is a new

270
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:49,292
realm you have entered into reality,

271
00:26:49,643 --> 00:26:53,568
which you are never aware of before.

272
00:26:54,737 --> 00:27:00,592
Now supposing there’s a very 
bad man standing near you.

273
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:05,894
He might be a thief, he might 
be a murderer, anything

274
00:27:06,195 --> 00:27:09,251
– you will not be even 
conscious of it

275
00:27:09,551 --> 00:27:12,888
leave alone aware, normally.

276
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:17,320
But once you are a realized soul,

277
00:27:18,552 --> 00:27:24,858
you become aware of the whole.

278
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,377
That is reality.

279
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:33,108
What are the problems, 
in the collective

280
00:27:34,483 --> 00:27:37,936
you become aware of the collective.

281
00:27:38,505 --> 00:27:41,439
You become aware of the 
problems of the whole world.

282
00:27:41,764 --> 00:27:45,210
Now, this awareness is 
very different.

283
00:27:46,404 --> 00:27:50,666
The first awareness as 
I told you is like this,

284
00:27:50,984 --> 00:27:55,871
that if somebody tells you 
you are this and this,

285
00:27:56,215 --> 00:27:59,471
you become aware of it.

286
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:05,213
In this nobody has to tell you;

287
00:28:06,401 --> 00:28:09,401
it’s just there.

288
00:28:13,365 --> 00:28:17,809
You are there, you know what it is.

289
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:27,682
And this is what you have 
achieved in these modern times,

290
00:28:28,363 --> 00:28:31,951
which is the blessing 
of the modern times also,

291
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:37,339
that we know now who we are.

292
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:43,585
You always say, “We are the pure 
spirit,” yesterday also I heard it.

293
00:28:43,966 --> 00:28:45,917
Are you sure?

294
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:49,972
What makes you believe that,

295
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:55,094
that you are the pure spirit?

296
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:59,608
I mean, you haven’t seen 
your spirit, have you?

297
00:29:00,401 --> 00:29:03,509
You haven’t seen yourself 
what you are.

298
00:29:04,196 --> 00:29:07,139
Then how do you say you 
are the pure spirit?

299
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:13,858
It’s just you are saying 
something because I say so.

300
00:29:16,552 --> 00:29:22,470
But you are the pure spirit, 
because whatever the description

301
00:29:22,758 --> 00:29:25,220
of the pure spirit is given

302
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,774
that it is aware

303
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:36,292
of the divine Power.

304
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:41,217
It is aware of the divine Power,

305
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:46,211
and that is how you 
are the pure spirit;

306
00:29:46,755 --> 00:29:50,048
because only 
through pure spirit

307
00:29:50,361 --> 00:29:53,023
as your personality

308
00:29:53,311 --> 00:30:01,028
you can be aware of this 
all-pervading Power.

309
00:30:02,196 --> 00:30:09,346
This is written in all the shastras, 
in all the scriptures everywhere.

310
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:13,193
And what do you know 
about yourself?

311
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:22,025
– that you are the spirit, because 
you know about your own chakras,

312
00:30:22,537 --> 00:30:25,868
you know about your own nadis.

313
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:32,050
Now, what has happened is that 
you are separated from your self

314
00:30:32,343 --> 00:30:36,458
and you can see your self.

315
00:30:37,477 --> 00:30:41,652
You see yourself very clearly,

316
00:30:44,026 --> 00:30:53,254
and you start seeing yourself as the 
present and the past and the future.

317
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:57,930
“In the past what I was” 
– you see, you’re shocked now

318
00:30:58,217 --> 00:31:00,730
“my goodness, I was like this.”

319
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,164
You see it through this 
present state,

320
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,577
in the present state you see.

321
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:15,896
Then you start forgetting it, 
“Forget the past, forget the past.”

322
00:31:19,557 --> 00:31:22,813
Then still you have the future;

323
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:29,042
then you start thinking 
about the future.

324
00:31:29,977 --> 00:31:32,892
First, future they think 
about their own

325
00:31:33,204 --> 00:31:36,295
children, their wives 
- Sahaja yogis also

326
00:31:36,658 --> 00:31:43,375
– “What will happen to my children, 
what will happen to my wife?”

327
00:31:44,532 --> 00:31:49,364
Then they think, “What will 
happen to Sahaja Yoga?”

328
00:31:50,483 --> 00:31:54,327
Then they think, “What 
will happen to Mataji?”

329
00:31:55,564 --> 00:31:59,860
Also they think, “What will 
happen to this world?”

330
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:09,330
Because your awareness 
has expanded,

331
00:32:10,924 --> 00:32:15,324
you are not in the limited 
sphere now anymore.

332
00:32:17,255 --> 00:32:20,096
You can think of your children, 
you can think of your wife,

333
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:23,873
also you can think 
of the whole world

334
00:32:24,553 --> 00:32:29,541
and all the problems of 
the world you think about.

335
00:32:31,922 --> 00:32:35,421
So you have reached 
that state, all right;

336
00:32:35,764 --> 00:32:38,915
up to that state we are.

337
00:32:39,982 --> 00:32:42,870
Now what is the thing

338
00:32:45,045 --> 00:32:50,734
that covers up all this 
or gives you solutions,

339
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:55,384
say, for your children, for your 
family, your wife, everyone

340
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,071
– what is the solution?

341
00:32:59,547 --> 00:33:04,965
Your Mother believes in giving 
solutions, not only the problems

342
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,640
Because these days 
there are not problems

343
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:13,718
that existed in the Navaratri.

344
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:17,714
They no more exist,

345
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:24,595
that you can take a sword 
in your hand and go and

346
00:33:24,876 --> 00:33:27,415
kill someone; no, it doesn’t,

347
00:33:28,332 --> 00:33:31,994
it’s not possible – cut what?

348
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:38,279
So the today’s problem 
as they are, as we see

349
00:33:40,012 --> 00:33:43,942
– within us we see the problems,

350
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:48,966
we are aware of it and we 
want to do something about it.

351
00:33:49,889 --> 00:33:53,252
Whether we are in the past, 
present or future,

352
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:56,289
we see the problem.

353
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:03,545
So now what is the solution?

354
00:34:04,952 --> 00:34:13,028
We have no weapons, 
nothing to fight.

355
00:34:14,758 --> 00:34:16,933
We don’t know also, 
so many do not

356
00:34:17,214 --> 00:34:20,851
know even how to hold 
a sword in the hand,

357
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:24,618
nd so many don’t 
even want to hold it;

358
00:34:25,893 --> 00:34:28,737
because they are so 
much in compassion,

359
00:34:29,031 --> 00:34:32,500
in the ocean of compassion 
enjoying themselves nicely.

360
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,293
They are enjoying their own 
compassion and compassion of others,

361
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:40,174
compassion of their Mother.

362
00:34:40,781 --> 00:34:44,306
But then how to solve the problem?

363
00:34:49,503 --> 00:34:52,109
The problem can be solved

364
00:34:52,335 --> 00:34:57,715
if you become very 
powerful yourself within.

365
00:35:01,093 --> 00:35:03,893
Where is your attention?

366
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:10,411
You have to move inward.

367
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:13,248
Where is your attention?

368
00:35:14,786 --> 00:35:18,692
You have to become very powerful.

369
00:35:19,723 --> 00:35:24,496
I have done My job, I have 
given you realization.

370
00:35:25,477 --> 00:35:29,233
You have grown so much, 
I have explained to you,

371
00:35:29,489 --> 00:35:32,289
I’ve told you everything 
– it’s done.

372
00:35:32,795 --> 00:35:36,540
I have given you lots of love,

373
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:41,384
ocean of love I should say 
as you call it, whatever it is.

374
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:47,510
But now you have to 
nourish yourself.

375
00:35:48,073 --> 00:35:52,593
You have to become 
powerful within yourself.

376
00:35:55,468 --> 00:35:59,542
So what is the way you 
can become powerful?

377
00:36:04,526 --> 00:36:07,026
First you must believe

378
00:36:07,294 --> 00:36:12,019
that you have transcended 
your human personality

379
00:36:12,299 --> 00:36:17,823
and you have now become 
a super-human being.

380
00:36:23,594 --> 00:36:27,794
First of all this must come in.

381
00:36:28,448 --> 00:36:31,392
This is what we call as faith.

382
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:36,467
This faith is not false 
faith, is not blind faith

383
00:36:36,754 --> 00:36:42,623
that you believe into 
something, but it’s a fact.

384
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,536
I have a hundred times, 
I have told you

385
00:36:47,842 --> 00:36:52,933
that you have first of all 
faith in your ascent

386
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:57,194
in your position as Sahaja yogis.

387
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:03,688
For this meditation is 
very important,

388
00:37:05,203 --> 00:37:06,940
very important.

389
00:37:07,509 --> 00:37:13,146
Without meditation you cannot 
have full faith in yourself,

390
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,986
because you can’t know yourself

391
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:21,048
by saying, “Who am I?” You cannot.

392
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:29,085
You try now, ask a question within, 
“Who am I?” – you’ll be lost.

393
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:37,972
So what 
should be the faith then?

394
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:42,797
because when you ask the question 
“Who am I?” you are lost.

395
00:37:49,996 --> 00:37:53,521
So we reach a stage 
where I have to tell you

396
00:37:53,802 --> 00:38:01,145
that faith is not mental, it is 
not emotional, it is not physical,

397
00:38:01,507 --> 00:38:07,894
but it is a state of your own being

398
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:13,370
which we can call as 
a spiritual state.

399
00:38:18,202 --> 00:38:21,492
In the spiritual state

400
00:38:24,123 --> 00:38:29,743
nothing can disturb you,

401
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:35,199
nothing can overpower you,

402
00:38:36,017 --> 00:38:39,329
nothing can dominate you;

403
00:38:41,517 --> 00:38:44,917
because that state if you have,

404
00:38:45,277 --> 00:38:51,758
that means you are part 
and parcel of reality.

405
00:38:53,012 --> 00:39:00,899
Then you are a honored member 
of the God’s kingdom.

406
00:39:02,952 --> 00:39:11,783
Then you are the most 
revered personality.

407
00:39:13,371 --> 00:39:16,586
Then you are like a deity.

408
00:39:17,909 --> 00:39:21,140
Then you are like a gana.

409
00:39:22,784 --> 00:39:27,504
In that state when you are 
– it’s a state, again I say,

410
00:39:28,211 --> 00:39:31,867
beyond the human state

411
00:39:33,929 --> 00:39:38,552
– you are extremely powerful.

412
00:39:45,103 --> 00:39:48,759
There’s a story about 
Nizamuddin – great Auliya,

413
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,959
great Sufi in India.

414
00:39:52,397 --> 00:39:55,144
There was a horrible king

415
00:39:55,444 --> 00:39:58,756
I think what Shah he called himself;

416
00:39:59,387 --> 00:40:04,611
and he would not go and bow 
to him. So he was very angry.

417
00:40:04,899 --> 00:40:08,537
He said, “I can only bow 
to God and to nobody else.”

418
00:40:10,134 --> 00:40:14,127
This Shah said, “If you don’t come 
and bow to me tomorrow,

419
00:40:14,377 --> 00:40:17,627
I will cut your throat.”

420
00:40:18,354 --> 00:40:22,923
And that night, the throat 
of this king was cut.

421
00:40:23,903 --> 00:40:28,334
It’s a story, but it’s a real story.

422
00:40:30,247 --> 00:40:35,678
Somebody came and cut his throat 
– it was not Nizamuddhin Sahib;

423
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:39,089
he would not do that.

424
00:40:41,602 --> 00:40:45,583
So that state if you reach,

425
00:40:47,014 --> 00:40:52,802
what we call is 
the state of shraddha,

426
00:40:53,115 --> 00:41:00,417
state of shraddha

427
00:41:00,735 --> 00:41:07,167
which is enlightened, 
enlightened faith.

428
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:16,633
It’s a new type of mechanism;

429
00:41:19,308 --> 00:41:26,708
that is, you become part 
and parcel of the whole.

430
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:31,445
That means the moon, the star…see

431
00:41:32,477 --> 00:41:37,045
I tell you, I never told the sun that 
it should be there for the pujas,

432
00:41:37,332 --> 00:41:39,968
I never told, last time, 
I never tell him.

433
00:41:40,275 --> 00:41:44,612
There’s no need to tell, 
it’s all done.

434
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:50,666
I don’t tell all these vibrations

435
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,943
to make a cross or to show these, 
all these miraculous photographs.

436
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,743
I don’t there’s no need to tell;

437
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:07,778
they just do it by themselves 
I am sometimes surprised

438
00:42:08,107 --> 00:42:10,894
how ingenious methods 
they have of their own,

439
00:42:11,157 --> 00:42:14,559
how they manage things 
– I am myself surprised.

440
00:42:15,598 --> 00:42:18,498
I didn’t tell them that 
these two persons

441
00:42:18,773 --> 00:42:20,792
who were selected by this award

442
00:42:21,042 --> 00:42:24,955
should be so condemned 
by every newspaper.

443
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:28,655
It all works automatically,

444
00:42:32,168 --> 00:42:34,887
it just works.

445
00:42:35,249 --> 00:42:41,124
Only thing if I have anything is 
just complete, complete faith

446
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,246
that I am at that state,

447
00:42:44,838 --> 00:42:49,536
and that’s why there is 
complete patience, saburi,

448
00:42:50,127 --> 00:42:52,586
complete patience.

449
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,633
And that is what we have to learn.

450
00:43:02,758 --> 00:43:08,846
It will all happen in any case 
because you are all at that state.

451
00:43:09,521 --> 00:43:12,988
Only meditation is important, 
very important;

452
00:43:13,261 --> 00:43:16,352
for Me not, but for you all.

453
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:20,192
If you all can meditate now,

454
00:43:20,812 --> 00:43:27,996
just for ten minutes also every day,

455
00:43:28,911 --> 00:43:31,377
it will help you a lot.

456
00:43:32,428 --> 00:43:39,053
Now, why do we have all these 
statues and, I mean the Mother

457
00:43:39,626 --> 00:43:44,506
and the Hanumana 
and Ganesha, Christ?

458
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:48,341
Because to begin with, 
human beings cannot

459
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:53,225
understand anything which 
does not have a form.

460
00:43:55,106 --> 00:44:00,414
They cannot go deeper unless 
and until there’s a form.

461
00:44:01,009 --> 00:44:03,485
But they went to another 
limit of using any stone,

462
00:44:03,752 --> 00:44:08,082
anything, as God and all that.

463
00:44:09,837 --> 00:44:11,990
But now you have discretion:

464
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,859
you know what is to be worshipped,

465
00:44:15,144 --> 00:44:23,922
what is to be treated as a higher 
personality – that you know.

466
00:44:24,448 --> 00:44:29,087
But before that they would 
worship all kinds of people,

467
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:33,558
like now people worship pope, 
you know that very well.

468
00:44:34,746 --> 00:44:36,428
But now what to do?

469
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:39,970
They are not only blind,

470
00:44:40,317 --> 00:44:45,733
they are not only unaware, but 
they are also not conscious of it.

471
00:44:46,927 --> 00:44:51,409
They are all at such a level 
that you cannot tell them.

472
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:55,430
So you are a new type 
of people I should say,

473
00:44:55,726 --> 00:45:00,458
who have tried to fight 
it out, to struggle out,

474
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:05,345
to know about the absolute truth.

475
00:45:07,061 --> 00:45:11,815
Unless and until you know 
the absolute truth,

476
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:14,775
you are nowhere;

477
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:21,153
you have no discretion, you have no 
understanding, you have no wisdom.

478
00:45:22,437 --> 00:45:25,119
But once you know the absolute truth,

479
00:45:25,454 --> 00:45:30,802
then you should not by any chance

480
00:45:31,715 --> 00:45:34,666
be halfway this and halfway that.

481
00:45:35,362 --> 00:45:42,292
That’s a very dangerous 
state of affairs.

482
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:50,049
Say a seed is sprouted, it is 
neither a seed nor a tree.

483
00:45:52,736 --> 00:45:56,629
If it doesn’t grow it is useless.

484
00:45:57,067 --> 00:46:00,329
That’s happens to your 
awareness – I am again talking

485
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,920
of your consciousness, awareness

486
00:46:07,479 --> 00:46:13,266
– and then you are neither 
here nor there.

487
00:46:13,873 --> 00:46:20,610
There are many people who come 
to Sahaja Yoga perhaps, maybe

488
00:46:21,366 --> 00:46:24,510
to find some peace.

489
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:27,388
But I get letters:

490
00:46:27,638 --> 00:46:32,054
“My father is sick, my mother is 
sick, my sister is sick.”

491
00:46:32,367 --> 00:46:37,167
Then otherwise, “My husband is fighting 
with me, I am seeking a divorce.”

492
00:46:37,524 --> 00:46:39,655
Or thirdly, “I’ve lost all my money,

493
00:46:39,892 --> 00:46:42,536
I must have some money.”

494
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,431
Fourthly, “I am a great artist but I,

495
00:46:45,675 --> 00:46:48,423
my art is not selling.”

496
00:46:48,704 --> 00:46:53,754
All these stupid problems 
they bring for Me.

497
00:46:54,085 --> 00:46:59,240
Hah – “My children are no good, 
they are troublesome.”

498
00:46:59,532 --> 00:47:01,461
Then, “My wife is fighting with me,

499
00:47:01,722 --> 00:47:04,409
my mother is fighting with 
me, brother is fighting.”

500
00:47:04,648 --> 00:47:09,220
But I said, “What sort 
of Sahaja yogis these are?”

501
00:47:13,332 --> 00:47:18,815
The state of being one 
with the reality

502
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:27,576
means that the whole 
of reality is at your feet,

503
00:47:29,127 --> 00:47:31,770
whole of it works for you;

504
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:37,732
and once you even 
get a glimpse of that state

505
00:47:38,014 --> 00:47:45,233
I tell you, you become so much 
peaceful within yourself.

506
00:47:50,608 --> 00:47:54,402
If you say, “I am the king, 
I am the king,”

507
00:47:54,852 --> 00:47:57,942
if you say, “I am the beggar, 
I am the beggar,”

508
00:47:58,261 --> 00:48:01,407
what difference does it 
make to that state

509
00:48:01,695 --> 00:48:06,888
which is like a purest of pure gold,

510
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:10,999
which cannot be tarnished?

511
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:18,108
Such a state of mind 
we have to develop.

512
00:48:19,536 --> 00:48:23,353
It’s a more a challenge to us.

513
00:48:24,097 --> 00:48:26,978
We are Sahaja yogis, all right.

514
00:48:27,616 --> 00:48:30,561
We have got realization, all right.

515
00:48:31,191 --> 00:48:34,316
We can sing very well, all right.

516
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:38,106
We have achieved good 
positions, all right.

517
00:48:39,032 --> 00:48:42,006
We are nicely married, all right.

518
00:48:42,575 --> 00:48:45,475
We’ve got nice children, 
we have got everything,

519
00:48:45,749 --> 00:48:47,961
we have got jobs, this that.

520
00:48:48,281 --> 00:48:55,162
Now, suddenly one negative force 
comes in to trouble you – so what?

521
00:48:58,899 --> 00:49:00,893
So what?

522
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:08,632
Otherwise how will you 
know what you are?

523
00:49:10,126 --> 00:49:14,493
If there is no darkness, how will 
you know you are the light?

524
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:26,674
It’s a challenge to your own 
state, at what state you are.

525
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:33,093
The word “state” is not so 
explanatory. In Sanskrit is swarupa,

526
00:49:33,511 --> 00:49:35,717
swarupa

527
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:45,552
– “swa” is yourself 
and “rupa” is form or state.

528
00:49:47,274 --> 00:49:53,311
That state is possible 
for all of you

529
00:49:55,467 --> 00:50:00,298
by saying “Not this, not this, 
not this, not this.”

530
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:10,467
As it is, your mind has reached 
that state that there is no mind

531
00:50:10,798 --> 00:50:13,131
– you can do that.

532
00:50:13,798 --> 00:50:20,067
But you have to develop 
a kind of a personality

533
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:24,293
that realizes what you are.

534
00:50:27,509 --> 00:50:31,246
But in that realization

535
00:50:33,432 --> 00:50:36,344
you are just aware of it,

536
00:50:36,638 --> 00:50:38,613
not conscious of it.

537
00:50:38,932 --> 00:50:41,613
Ah, for example I’ll tell you,

538
00:50:42,804 --> 00:50:46,691
I am aware that I am Adi Shakti 
– I am aware, I know.

539
00:50:47,054 --> 00:50:52,429
But when you say “Jai Shri Mataji” 
I also say “Jai Shri Mataji,”

540
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:57,223
forgetting that I am the 
one you are talking about.

541
00:51:00,073 --> 00:51:05,493
This is actually, 
should be the state:

542
00:51:06,682 --> 00:51:10,332
that you are aware, yes, you 
are aware in the sense, in the

543
00:51:10,602 --> 00:51:14,102
- I don’t know how to say 
- but I am aware I am that.

544
00:51:14,351 --> 00:51:16,760
If you ask Me, “Mother, 
are You Adi Shakti?”

545
00:51:17,021 --> 00:51:23,686
I said, “Yes, I am” - because 
I know that, that I am.

546
00:51:24,097 --> 00:51:27,404
But when you say 
“Jai Shri Mataji” I forget that

547
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:32,698
I am Adi Shakti and I also say 
“Jai Shri Mataji” with you.

548
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:39,778
I forget; I have to tell, 
“No, no, You can’t say

549
00:51:43,381 --> 00:51:44,673
It’s very interesting.

550
00:51:44,985 --> 00:51:48,723
Now, you make Me sit 
here like a queen

551
00:51:49,042 --> 00:51:51,829
and give Me a presents, 
this thing, that thing;

552
00:51:52,092 --> 00:51:56,415
I mean, all right, that’s your idea.

553
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:08,247
But to Me, you see, I am 
complete in Myself, I think so.

554
00:52:10,398 --> 00:52:15,518
This in Hindi: “Me kahenge ki 
hum apne hi andar samma gaye”

555
00:52:16,674 --> 00:52:22,039
- “ I am got lost into Myself.”

556
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:25,687
All right, you do this, all right; 
you should do that, all right.

557
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,308
If you don’t do it, it’s all right.

558
00:52:30,957 --> 00:52:34,660
To Me it makes no difference; 
it may make difference to you,

559
00:52:35,023 --> 00:52:36,959
but to Me it does not.

560
00:52:37,248 --> 00:52:39,771
I have been saying that don’t 
give Me any presents,

561
00:52:40,009 --> 00:52:42,322
don’t give Me any 
presents, all these days.

562
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:44,583
So the only argument is that

563
00:52:44,845 --> 00:52:48,383
“In whole year we give You once, 
so why should You, Mother, object?

564
00:52:48,642 --> 00:52:50,456
because that gives us joy.”

565
00:52:50,721 --> 00:52:53,482
All right, if you think 
it gives you joy, do it,

566
00:52:53,794 --> 00:52:57,163
but to Me it doesn’t matter.

567
00:53:01,376 --> 00:53:04,994
Because I don’t think I am there.

568
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:12,496
I am just seeing you 
sitting here, all right

569
00:53:12,768 --> 00:53:16,268
– they are all realized souls, all right

570
00:53:18,754 --> 00:53:21,423
– but I am one of you.

571
00:53:22,735 --> 00:53:25,677
I don’t think I am very special.

572
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:30,987
But if you ask Me then I will say, 
“All right, I am Adi Shakti.”

573
00:53:31,255 --> 00:53:34,867
But I don’t think Adi Shakti 
is very special also,

574
00:53:38,162 --> 00:53:40,461
because I’ve no mind.

575
00:53:40,778 --> 00:53:43,065
But otherwise I don’t think 
it’s something special;

576
00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:46,721
because somebody is 
something, so what?

577
00:53:47,798 --> 00:53:53,320
Now supposing sun is 
sun, so what? – He’s a sun.

578
00:53:54,573 --> 00:53:58,257
If somebody is Adi Shakti 
– so Adi Shakti, so what?

579
00:54:00,062 --> 00:54:02,702
But for you it is creditable

580
00:54:02,931 --> 00:54:09,563
because you were not born 
realized, you got your realization.

581
00:54:10,562 --> 00:54:15,155
So you are special, you are great,

582
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,610
you have achieved something. 
I’ve achieved nothing;

583
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:21,535
I have been like this and 
I will be like this.

584
00:54:24,672 --> 00:54:27,922
Whether I fight the devils 
or I sit before

585
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:30,978
you makes no difference, 
I will be like this.

586
00:54:31,222 --> 00:54:36,845
But for Me you are great, 
because you have achieved this.

587
00:54:37,184 --> 00:54:40,978
Today to see you 
on this Navaratri day,

588
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:45,408
so many people sitting 
to worship Me;

589
00:54:47,879 --> 00:54:50,778
so many people are here,

590
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:55,884
so many Sahaja yogis 
- it’s so remarkable.

591
00:54:56,391 --> 00:54:58,886
It’s not My achievement I tell you,

592
00:54:59,106 --> 00:55:00,931
it’s your seeking.

593
00:55:01,156 --> 00:55:04,598
Because I have been on this 
earth many a times before

594
00:55:06,652 --> 00:55:08,358
that you know.

595
00:55:09,121 --> 00:55:11,339
But we never had like this.

596
00:55:11,611 --> 00:55:15,312
So many came, got crucified, 
died, this, that,

597
00:55:15,558 --> 00:55:18,518
but I never had people of this kind.

598
00:55:20,981 --> 00:55:24,502
So again we come 
to the same point,

599
00:55:25,117 --> 00:55:32,517
that we should be aware 
of ourselves

600
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:37,049
– complete shraddha 
in yourself.

601
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,197
If you have some shraddha 
in yourself,

602
00:55:41,509 --> 00:55:44,320
you’ll have shraddha about Me also,

603
00:55:44,984 --> 00:55:48,940
because we are not different.

604
00:55:51,134 --> 00:55:53,903
If you believe this is water,

605
00:55:54,172 --> 00:55:55,503
then everywhere there is water

606
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:58,822
I believe that that is 
water, isn’t it?

607
00:55:59,143 --> 00:56:01,911
Because I know this is water,

608
00:56:02,921 --> 00:56:07,321
so wherever in the world there 
is water, I know it is water.

609
00:56:08,747 --> 00:56:11,568
So if you know you are 
a Sahaja yogi,

610
00:56:11,982 --> 00:56:17,276
anywhere there is a Sahaja yogi 
you know there is a Sahaja yogi,

611
00:56:18,936 --> 00:56:23,101
But as far as you are 
concerned you forget

612
00:56:24,929 --> 00:56:29,297
how great you are, 
and how far you can go.

613
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:32,818
I am very proud of you, 
you don’t know.

614
00:56:33,088 --> 00:56:37,945
But because I am a humble person,

615
00:56:39,082 --> 00:56:41,911
I don’t know how to show off

616
00:56:43,596 --> 00:56:49,884
– so I have such nice children, 
so many of them, so lovable.

617
00:56:52,393 --> 00:56:58,105
Those bhaktas for whom She killed 
so many demons and all that

618
00:56:59,887 --> 00:57:02,203
were not like you.

619
00:57:03,092 --> 00:57:06,109
You are much better, 
much higher,

620
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:08,735
of a much greater quality.

621
00:57:09,017 --> 00:57:13,217
But you must know that you are,

622
00:57:13,535 --> 00:57:19,319
and don’t behave like 
those people who

623
00:57:19,632 --> 00:57:24,324
were of a very rudimentary nature.

624
00:57:24,824 --> 00:57:28,873
You are grown up, 
you have prospered,

625
00:57:29,307 --> 00:57:33,127
and now the fruits we can see.

626
00:57:35,403 --> 00:57:38,631
I don’t know what to 
do for you, really.

627
00:57:39,016 --> 00:57:42,798
But have faith in yourself.

628
00:57:44,937 --> 00:57:49,017
Then you will see how much 
faith you will have in reality,

629
00:57:49,255 --> 00:57:52,799
that there is reality with 
you at every step,

630
00:57:53,031 --> 00:57:55,717
every moment.

631
00:57:59,254 --> 00:58:01,355
No fear,

632
00:58:04,593 --> 00:58:07,463
no sense of achievement - nothing.

633
00:58:08,847 --> 00:58:11,006
Done now, finished.

634
00:58:12,518 --> 00:58:14,573
When there were five 
Sahaja yogis I was happy,

635
00:58:14,787 --> 00:58:16,613
when there are so many, I am happy.

636
00:58:16,872 --> 00:58:21,854
But I, when I see so many, I think

637
00:58:23,649 --> 00:58:31,107
there are so many powerful 
personalities who are one with reality.

638
00:58:33,248 --> 00:58:39,731
This collective oneness 
was never so.

639
00:58:41,261 --> 00:58:47,148
And so I would say that on this day

640
00:58:47,706 --> 00:58:51,841
what we have to do is to 
kill the devils within ourselves;

641
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,155
that’s all.

642
00:58:57,559 --> 00:59:00,453
If you want to really worship Me,

643
00:59:00,661 --> 00:59:05,041
that’s what you have to think, 
what are the devils within you

644
00:59:05,603 --> 00:59:07,117
– that’s all.

645
00:59:07,438 --> 00:59:10,098
So you don’t have to worry 
otherwise for outside devils,

646
00:59:10,355 --> 00:59:12,811
they cannot do anything to you.

647
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:18,312
May God bless you.
