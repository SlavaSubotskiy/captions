00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,947
﻿Adi Shakti Puja, Detachment, Rahuri (India), 11 December 1988.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,734
Puja has to start at the time, when it has to start

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,445
I’ve been waiting and waiting and waiting,

4
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:18,652
then I realised that today is a very good time

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:27,181
according to the calendar; but it is not in the morning,

6
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:30,781
so it had to be the third day of the moon

7
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:36,053
and as the moon is changing its phases in the day time,

8
00:00:36,254 --> 00:00:38,852
we had to wait till it started. I think,

9
00:00:39,053 --> 00:00:46,252
all these things have happened, of the theft and everything has happened, perhaps,

10
00:00:46,982 --> 00:00:51,331
to delay the Puja up to the point where it should start.

11
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:54,710
So in Sahaja Yoga we all go beyond time

12
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,602
and we don't have to worry about the timing;

13
00:00:57,802 --> 00:01:00,306
only when it's a formal function or something,

14
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:04,954
because the people are formal and they don't understand our styles.

15
00:01:05,154 --> 00:01:08,448
So we have to be present there at right time,

16
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:12,191
otherwise we should just allow the time to take its own course

17
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:17,196
and we should know in our own way.

18
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:31,450
Now for our travel and this tour, we have to realise

19
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:37,402
that we are here to achieve

20
00:01:37,603 --> 00:01:42,848
a certain amount of height in our detachment,

21
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:55,196
we have to rise into the realm of our state,

22
00:01:55,397 --> 00:01:58,534
while the circumstances around us,

23
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:06,198
they're surrounding us and they should not make us unhappy,

24
00:02:06,398 --> 00:02:12,083
or biased, or we should not react to them,

25
00:02:12,284 --> 00:02:19,404
on the contrary we should try to rise above that

26
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:26,512
if there are no events of mishaps.

27
00:02:27,528 --> 00:02:32,592
Then you cannot see the surmounting quality of the Divine.

28
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:39,569
If the surmounting quality of The Divine has to be seen,

29
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,218
we have to see the obstructions.

30
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:51,523
For example, if there is the flow of the water going on

31
00:02:52,803 --> 00:02:55,321
and it is smoothly moving,

32
00:02:55,521 --> 00:03:00,306
there's no happening as you call the gatarna,

33
00:03:00,506 --> 00:03:05,417
there is no happening, but if there is a stone,

34
00:03:05,717 --> 00:03:08,001
then the water splashes against it,

35
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:14,243
creates a beauty and surpasses it,

36
00:03:14,443 --> 00:03:22,834
this is the sign of Divine surmounting all the difficulties

37
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:27,066
that are supposed to be there.

38
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:30,623
Now we are proceeding to Puna

39
00:03:30,823 --> 00:03:34,969
and where we will be having a proper session

40
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:37,477
also for marriages and all that,

41
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:40,774
we will have to take a firm decision,

42
00:03:40,974 --> 00:03:45,199
I must speak about it today,

43
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,575
that the steadiness of the mind is very important for the marriages.

44
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:55,487
If you have certain concepts

45
00:03:55,687 --> 00:04:02,773
and if you are whimsical, it's better you don't get married,

46
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:07,566
because that's not found in Indian character,

47
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:11,499
once they decide for marriage they are married forever.

48
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:15,051
But if the mind is still wavering, going up and down,

49
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:21,793
it's a trick of the mind that wants to play tricks with others and enjoys,

50
00:04:21,993 --> 00:04:25,109
it is a sign of ego.

51
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:31,626
Absolutely a sign of ego and then you start playing games,

52
00:04:31,826 --> 00:04:35,420
you enjoy it, "yes, no, yes, no",

53
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:38,765
you go on enjoying those games

54
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:41,571
and later on you play into it so much that your marriages

55
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:44,282
can never be happy or successful,

56
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:47,779
that means you are not yet matured for marriage.

57
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,272
For marriage you are to be matured.

58
00:04:50,472 --> 00:04:53,288
But one of the reasons for this I find in the west is,

59
00:04:53,488 --> 00:04:57,183
that you have had no training at all,

60
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,459
parents have never told you how to behave

61
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,601
towards your husband, towards your wife,

62
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:07,156
how to make a marriage successful,

63
00:05:07,356 --> 00:05:10,289
that is a very important event

64
00:05:10,488 --> 00:05:16,833
and that we should try to establish ourselves in the marriage system,

65
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:24,083
instead of that, we use it as a nice trick playing ground,

66
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:28,240
we miss the point, who is the loser?

67
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,006
If you go on playing tricks like this

68
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:36,345
and playing with your ego, whatever you may do,

69
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:40,283
whatever type of marriages you'll have,

70
00:05:40,484 --> 00:05:43,380
you can never be happy. Now in the west, as you know,

71
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:49,112
I lead another life also and every person I have met,

72
00:05:49,313 --> 00:05:51,892
every person whatever country they may come,

73
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:57,189
nobody seems to be happy in their marriage, is very surprising.

74
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:02,650
it seems every wife finds something wrong with the husband,

75
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:05,633
the husband finds something wrong with the wife

76
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,906
and they have funny miserable faces,

77
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:14,333
they don't look like married people, but as if like criminals,

78
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,450
or something has really gone wrong with them.

79
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:20,742
There's no smile on their face, they look horrid,

80
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:23,473
because they have missed the point,

81
00:06:23,673 --> 00:06:27,187
marriage is to be enjoyed, is for your enjoyment.

82
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:37,814
Supposing one gives you ambrosia, Amrut as they call it

83
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:43,553
and then you start playing trick with it. Who is the loser?

84
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:51,406
So must know that we have to achieved that maturity

85
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:57,588
and enjoy that love, basically if something is very wrong,

86
00:06:58,072 --> 00:07:03,694
or if there's no possibility of a proper marriage,

87
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:07,790
in Sahaja Yoga we have arrangement, to give it up,

88
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,025
you can change your wife, change your husband,

89
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:14,192
no problem, but there must be some reason behind it,

90
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:20,105
just for fun's sake, if you want to spoil your life.

91
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:22,245
I'll try my level best to tell you,

92
00:07:22,445 --> 00:07:25,711
that don't spoil your life and of the other person.

93
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:30,414
But people enjoy sometimes, spoiling somebody lives

94
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:32,558
when it comes to the ego part,

95
00:07:32,758 --> 00:07:36,500
they themselves cannot enjoy, dog in the manger policy,

96
00:07:36,701 --> 00:07:40,339
dog in the manger cannot eat the grass,

97
00:07:40,364 --> 00:07:45,055
but barks at any bull that comes to eat it, it's like this,

98
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,724
neither they will enjoy, nor they will allow others to enjoy

99
00:07:49,924 --> 00:07:53,035
and when such stupid couples are there,

100
00:07:53,235 --> 00:07:56,046
I have such a headache all the time, reconciling them,

101
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:58,860
talking to them, asking them,

102
00:07:58,885 --> 00:08:02,465
I mean it becomes a marriage bureau for me.

103
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:05,265
And sometimes I reach such a conclusion:

104
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,908
no more marriages in Sahaja Yoga, had enough of it!

105
00:08:09,109 --> 00:08:13,864
Actually what have I to gain out of it? This nobody tries to understand,

106
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,319
what I am trying is to make you happy

107
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,546
to get you good husbands and good wives,

108
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:20,843
that you should have good relationships,

109
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:24,789
you should have great people on this Earth, to be born,

110
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,611
that we should have a society

111
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:31,587
which is beyond all these nonsensical societies

112
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:36,158
which is so great that we can create a homogenous family

113
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:40,523
among ourselves of purity and of holiness,

114
00:08:40,724 --> 00:08:43,329
instead of that, for petty nonsensical things

115
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:47,731
if there's a fight going on, one gets really fed up.

116
00:08:47,932 --> 00:08:52,146
Of course one has to try.

117
00:08:53,547 --> 00:08:56,447
But if you are bent upon cutting your noses,

118
00:08:56,647 --> 00:09:01,359
how can I go on clipping them back?

119
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,891
It's an eternal problem, if you marry your say, 75 people,

120
00:09:07,091 --> 00:09:11,201
you have the enjoyment of it. Now if it's a, say,

121
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:17,458
a ocean of, Indian Ocean say for example,

122
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:22,118
but then you get the Pacific Ocean back on your head

123
00:09:22,418 --> 00:09:27,765
with all the cries and weeping and shouting and screaming

124
00:09:27,965 --> 00:09:32,297
and all sorts of nonsense that going on.

125
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,843
So I again say that, now we are going to Puna

126
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:41,978
where all the marriages are going to be confirmed,

127
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:44,913
if you go on like this there's no end to it,

128
00:09:45,113 --> 00:09:47,910
also those people who come for marriages

129
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,484
and deny it twice, third time I don't ask them,

130
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:57,116
because it's a joke going on.

131
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:02,913
You do not know how many nights I have spent selecting people,

132
00:10:03,113 --> 00:10:06,478
as it is you are from twenty five, thirty countries.

133
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:11,462
Yesterday you saw that, you have different conditionings,

134
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:15,045
different styles, different everything,

135
00:10:15,621 --> 00:10:18,898
heights different, ages different, faces different,

136
00:10:18,923 --> 00:10:22,261
aptitudes different.

137
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:26,871
So combine all these things, so very difficult,

138
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:30,074
sometimes I think if you are overeducated,

139
00:10:30,274 --> 00:10:32,614
them better to give you a simple woman,

140
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:36,019
so that your little pressure is reduced, you can share

141
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,142
with her but if you are equally educated people,

142
00:10:40,343 --> 00:10:45,174
then both the heads may be...

143
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:56,499
So I have to think of many things and of vibrations,

144
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:59,363
but somehow or other you can defy

145
00:10:59,564 --> 00:11:02,144
and you try to defy it, alright doesnt matter,

146
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:05,736
but who is the loser is the point,

147
00:11:05,937 --> 00:11:08,845
today I had to speak to you about this, because in Sahaj

148
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:12,877
we have to take the way it comes as it comes,

149
00:11:13,277 --> 00:11:17,053
whatever comes in our way we should take it.

150
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:19,664
We should not sort of say, I have fallen in love.

151
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:25,270
There's nobody falls in love, it rises in love in Sahaja Yoga.

152
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:36,634
That is some funny idea, that one must fall in love;

153
00:11:36,714 --> 00:11:43,625
because you see that means you must do something sinful,

154
00:11:44,023 --> 00:11:46,683
or something absurd. So many people have told me,

155
00:11:46,883 --> 00:11:49,206
"Mother I have not fallen in love with her."

156
00:11:49,406 --> 00:11:52,060
How can you fall in love, you fall into some ditch,

157
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:59,253
or you may fall into some river of something like that.

158
00:11:59,454 --> 00:12:04,633
I didn't understand how do you fall in love, it's a solid stuff.

159
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:16,086
So this absurd idea of falling in love has to be given up,

160
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:22,102
if it means that you have felt the love,

161
00:12:22,302 --> 00:12:30,600
or if it means you have the sensitivity of feeling the love

162
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,612
or something I can understand, I'm a little explanatory,

163
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,311
but this falling in love business has been going on and on and on.

164
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:40,450
Now I would request you that in Sahaja Yoga

165
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:45,634
we cancel this terminology.

166
00:12:47,156 --> 00:12:53,511
So problems of marriages should not arise in Sahaja Yoga,

167
00:12:53,712 --> 00:12:57,528
you have chance for one month to decide for yourself

168
00:12:57,728 --> 00:13:02,955
and to find out for yourself. Little bit adjustments and understanding

169
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:08,190
can create such a beautiful world for you.

170
00:13:08,391 --> 00:13:13,660
It's just waiting there, but suddenly you decide on some spot,

171
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,077
suddenly you're alright I find, at the spur of the moment

172
00:13:18,102 --> 00:13:22,281
I find suddenly you say: "No", I say: "What's this?"

173
00:13:22,306 --> 00:13:24,875
The horse was going alright suddenly what has happened?

174
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,004
it has turned round? One can understand a horse,

175
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:32,207
but I can't understand human beings.

176
00:13:32,408 --> 00:13:38,346
So this whimsical behaviour suddenly,

177
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:43,197
can be very injurious to the growth of Sahaja Yoga.

178
00:13:43,397 --> 00:13:46,527
Whenever I go to England there's a list of people

179
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:48,969
from all over the country,

180
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,250
this marriage has gone rotten, that has gone rotten,

181
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:55,891
that has gone rotten, while I'm boasting to everyone

182
00:13:55,924 --> 00:13:58,569
that Sahaja Yoga marriages never fail.

183
00:13:58,594 --> 00:14:01,360
I know it's not true,

184
00:14:01,385 --> 00:14:05,935
but whatever I say is a Mantra, ultimately it becomes the truth.

185
00:14:06,235 --> 00:14:10,867
So time will come when no marriages will fail,

186
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:15,011
but you have to join hands with me and co-operate

187
00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:19,102
and should understand, how much I have worked hard

188
00:14:19,302 --> 00:14:23,914
to bring about these events.

189
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:27,729
And marriages should not make you happy or unhappy,

190
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:33,148
because to marry is not the ultimate in life.

191
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:36,413
But it happens after marriage people get lost,

192
00:14:36,613 --> 00:14:38,788
they don't come to Sahaja Yoga, after that, we are

193
00:14:38,988 --> 00:14:43,004
enjoying our honeymoon for the last three years.

194
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:46,835
Wonderful Sahaja Yogis who are leaders suddenly get lost,

195
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:50,483
that also may be a fall in love maybe, I don't know,

196
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:54,194
but this kind of nonsense, even if it is one or two

197
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:58,402
its such a headache.

198
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:03,999
And I really don't know how to solve these problems,

199
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,142
because I think there's no problem at all,

200
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:12,980
only thing you have decided not to enjoy the game.

201
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:17,597
Supposing you don't want to enjoy the food

202
00:15:17,622 --> 00:15:20,286
you can put some quinine on your tongue

203
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:26,296
and then say I don't like the food, something like that. It's absurd.

204
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:28,799
So try to help me in this,

205
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,348
otherwise I'll give up this marriage business I tell you

206
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,880
because it doesn't give me any joy or pleasure.

207
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:40,360
Even one person plays like that I just don't understand.

208
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:46,332
And for no rhyme and reason you should not say 'no'.

209
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:50,836
First of all your must look at yourself in the mirror.

210
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:53,329
What are you?

211
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:56,909
What is your education? What is your intellect?

212
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,762
What do you expect from another person?

213
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:04,301
How much money you have got? How much money the other person has got?

214
00:16:04,326 --> 00:16:06,628
Whatever you want to see, you can see for yourself,

215
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:11,320
to begin with, then compare.

216
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:18,065
But the greatest thing you have to think about, how many vibrations you have?

217
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,680
How much Sahaja Yoga the other one knows?

218
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,189
You are married for your ascent.

219
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:31,839
If the other person has vibrations much more than yours,

220
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:34,639
then your should not unnecessarily boast

221
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,532
of nonsensical gross things;

222
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:42,970
the person is much subtler, make yourself that,

223
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:47,229
whether it's a woman or a man I don't say,

224
00:16:48,937 --> 00:16:52,304
but I just say that see for yourself: where are you?

225
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:55,554
Specially for beginners who are beginning to take to Sahaja Yoga,

226
00:16:55,755 --> 00:16:58,039
is better to marry some mature Sahaja Yogi

227
00:16:58,239 --> 00:17:02,220
so that they can ascend very well, much faster.

228
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:05,979
And also if the other party is not so good, maybe,

229
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:09,581
we have to work, we have to save that person,

230
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:14,878
after all, they are not yet matured but they are Sahaja Yogis,

231
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:21,103
they want to do, so try to work it out in that way.

232
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,977
I think you will understand the seriousness,

233
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,469
this is the most important work

234
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:32,219
that ever happened on this Earth so far,

235
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,990
your marriages are very important

236
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:40,249
and you have seen the photographs with the Gods themselves have blessed you.

237
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:43,687
Because of my consent, because of my selection,

238
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:46,032
they all were present in your marriage

239
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,271
and how they were giving you tributes

240
00:17:49,472 --> 00:17:53,933
and how they were putting flowers on the brides.

241
00:17:54,134 --> 00:17:58,395
You have seen the photographs. If you have not seen I will show you.

242
00:17:58,795 --> 00:18:01,516
But if you are not a seeker and if you are not seeking

243
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,647
your higher ascent, then you go into

244
00:18:04,754 --> 00:18:08,496
nonsensical things and nonsensical ideas.

245
00:18:08,523 --> 00:18:11,977
So better be careful not to do such a thing,

246
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:16,820
don't think too much of yourself, another note of caution,

247
00:18:17,021 --> 00:18:21,922
that you see the way Indians pamper their son-in-laws,

248
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:24,626
so don't get mad.

249
00:18:24,826 --> 00:18:28,095
Also they pamper their daughter-in-laws very much.

250
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:31,547
It's done in India to create better relationships,

251
00:18:31,747 --> 00:18:34,531
because we don't have the balloon of ego so much here.

252
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:40,348
But here as soon as somebody pays attention to you, you go off,

253
00:18:40,548 --> 00:18:43,369
so better be careful. It's a custom here

254
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:48,750
to look after the son-in-law, to look after the daughter, there is a custom.

255
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:54,647
Now it is ingrained from ages, it doesn't mean that you are God,

256
00:18:54,672 --> 00:18:58,459
or you are in some superlative condition.

257
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:04,309
It's just that, that is how they pamper,

258
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:10,298
they look after the daughter-in-law, or the son-in-law, normally.

259
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:15,010
And you should not carry away ideas,

260
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:17,585
which I must tell you because it doesn't happen in the west,

261
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:20,959
I have seen, they don't care. Once that they are married,

262
00:19:20,984 --> 00:19:24,642
they are finished, it's not so, so please be careful.

263
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:27,448
When you are marrying Indians, you will find the parents

264
00:19:27,473 --> 00:19:29,810
will quite pamper you, look after you,

265
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:33,492
they'll call you to their house, do this, give you money,

266
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:38,993
give you ornaments, all kinds of things they'll do.

267
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:45,048
But still one has to understand that is just a custom

268
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:47,197
and should not get pampered, on the contrary should feel

269
00:19:47,397 --> 00:19:51,021
blissful about it, but when it is done I have seen suddenly

270
00:19:51,221 --> 00:19:55,046
they go off and they think no end of themselves,

271
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:58,016
their value system goes off.

272
00:19:58,216 --> 00:20:01,758
It's because, so far we have had no education,

273
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:05,408
no training about marriages.

274
00:20:06,676 --> 00:20:09,758
I am sorry I have to say this in the presence of many Indians.

275
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,279
Indians also you see, expect you to understand

276
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,440
their customs sometimes too much,

277
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:17,894
for example yesterday the garlands were given,

278
00:20:18,095 --> 00:20:20,489
at the time when the garlands were given,

279
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:23,387
you are not supposed to garland yourself,

280
00:20:23,587 --> 00:20:26,388
but some of you took the garland put it you,

281
00:20:26,589 --> 00:20:30,287
they regarded it as absolutely unmannerly,

282
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:33,568
but it is so, so when we are in India

283
00:20:33,768 --> 00:20:36,266
we have to understand Indians,

284
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:40,857
but when we are in the west we have to understand the western people.

285
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,372
For example in the west you just go on saying, thank you,

286
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:47,152
thank, thank you, sorry, sorry sorry, sorry sorry sorry,

287
00:20:47,352 --> 00:20:49,544
it is so confusing sometimes.

288
00:20:49,745 --> 00:20:52,518
We have to go on shaking hands with so many people,

289
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:56,738
I mean, I sometimes shake with nine hundred people at a time,

290
00:20:56,938 --> 00:21:01,071
and while they are going back again nine hundred people.

291
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:04,073
I think namaste is a better idea.

292
00:21:04,192 --> 00:21:07,151
See to shake hands with every sort of a person,

293
00:21:07,176 --> 00:21:10,966
you'll catch from every one, but is a custom,

294
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:14,170
it's custom so we have to understand this is a custom

295
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:18,975
and which is not to be resented, is not such a bad custom.

296
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:23,412
There's nothing wrong in it and maybe there is no logic.

297
00:21:23,613 --> 00:21:26,108
For example garlanding yourself there is little logic,

298
00:21:26,308 --> 00:21:29,895
you don't garland yourself, somebody else has to garland

299
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:32,666
and the ladies don't take garlands on their,

300
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:35,564
you see, because any man cannot garland a lady,

301
00:21:35,764 --> 00:21:38,611
because is only husband has the right,

302
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:41,209
see, so anyone won't garland,

303
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:45,254
or a son can garland the mother, but any man

304
00:21:45,455 --> 00:21:50,765
cannot garland any lady who is of a younger age,

305
00:21:50,836 --> 00:21:54,456
or who is not yet married and even if married,

306
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:58,204
she has to be an old woman like me, then it's alright,

307
00:21:58,405 --> 00:22:02,325
so these are customs very much ingrained and it's best or logic

308
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:06,726
that you cannot garland yourself and walk on the street,

309
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:11,083
even if the leaders here are garlanded

310
00:22:11,283 --> 00:22:14,376
immediately they take out their garland, except for the Gods,

311
00:22:14,577 --> 00:22:19,577
I mean I can carry with my garland but I also take it out,

312
00:22:20,934 --> 00:22:24,023
so these are few customs which must be understood

313
00:22:24,223 --> 00:22:26,724
and there's nothing wrong in it, there's logic,

314
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:29,842
whatever is illogical we can give up,

315
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:34,301
whatever is logical we have to lake it and understand it.

316
00:22:35,016 --> 00:22:37,670
So I am just telling you, that yesterday they started laughing,

317
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:39,821
children also started laughing, because they thought

318
00:22:40,022 --> 00:22:42,353
they are garlanding themselves.

319
00:22:42,554 --> 00:22:47,339
it's like doing Aarti to yourself, you know,

320
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:49,721
amounts to that.

321
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:52,992
So you can understand why they were laughing.

322
00:22:53,193 --> 00:22:58,594
They didn't mean to hurt you in any way, but this is the system.

323
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:02,470
Now coming to Sahaja Yoga,

324
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,376
yesterday was, Left Vishuddhi was too much.

325
00:23:07,597 --> 00:23:10,539
Perhaps in the morning I said you were allvery late

326
00:23:10,564 --> 00:23:13,724
for the formal programme, I don't know,

327
00:23:13,924 --> 00:23:17,727
whatever I say has to be just listened to, that's all.

328
00:23:17,928 --> 00:23:20,096
Only thing is next time we should not be late,

329
00:23:20,296 --> 00:23:23,229
in any formal programme, but it seems such a

330
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,611
Left Vishuddhi was there that I got a lump here

331
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:28,891
and I just knew what it was.

332
00:23:29,092 --> 00:23:33,256
So Mother says to you things which should not hurt you in any way

333
00:23:33,457 --> 00:23:36,733
and you should not take it that seriously but should understand that

334
00:23:36,934 --> 00:23:39,043
next time we should not do so, otherwise

335
00:23:39,244 --> 00:23:43,009
you are all wonderful people. You are beautiful people,

336
00:23:43,303 --> 00:23:45,225
I love you, I adore you, not only that,

337
00:23:45,401 --> 00:23:49,112
but I am very proud of you. I'm extremely proud of you,

338
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:51,387
but I have to tell you something sometimes.

339
00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:55,235
But if I tell you even wee bit then if you, get that upset,

340
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:58,998
I don't know what should I do.

341
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:02,983
So not to take things that seriously.

342
00:24:03,184 --> 00:24:06,538
There's nothing so much wrong.

343
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:10,031
In general I have to tell you things which you should understand

344
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:13,027
it's for our good, for our enjoyment,

345
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:16,082
everything to increase your enjoyment.

346
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:20,475
Even your ascent in Sahaja Yoga is to increase your enjoyment,

347
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:25,145
your sensitivity to joy to increase it more and more,

348
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:28,463
all this is done.

349
00:24:28,487 --> 00:24:33,257
