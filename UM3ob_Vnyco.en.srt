1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:11,650
I am very, very happy to see so many of you
coming down here for the program.

2
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:18,769
Actually, I bought this land at least, at
least twenty-five years back.

3
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:27,200
I couldn’t do anything about it as they
had lots of objections, this and that, but

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:35,390
then somehow, I planned the whole thing and
it all worked out.

5
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:44,670
Happy to see you all here but with all those
difficulties ultimately now you find so many

6
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,829
Sahaja yogis attending this program, My puja.

7
00:00:49,829 --> 00:01:04,680
I must remember My brother Baba who has worked
very hard for the propagation of Indian music,

8
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:12,380
classical music, all types of art, whatever
he could do.

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,640
It’s a very sad thing that he is not here
today to see you all.

10
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:32,509
He has done so much work religiously without
expecting any reward whatsoever and I wish

11
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:42,280
you could have him as your ideal and that
will work it out everything in that way.

12
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:51,550
There’s one thing about him I know, he never
tried to show off anything.

13
00:01:51,550 --> 00:02:04,580
He was very intelligent, educated man but
he caught hold of all the people of ordinary

14
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:16,879
living and he looked after them and he promoted
their skill of music and art.

15
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:35,870
With the same idea, I decided to have this
place dedicated to his idea of propagating

16
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:44,880
music and art and I am happy to see that that
idea has materialized.

17
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,920
But I wish [UNCLEAR.

18
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:53,870
EITHER had or that] My brother was here to
make you feel very happy about it.

19
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,220
He was a very loving and a kind person.

20
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,660
Never used to get angry with anyone, I’ve
seen that.

21
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:09,780
But always he gave Me a very good picture
of every person.

22
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:17,959
You can’t help it.

23
00:03:17,959 --> 00:05:03,730
[Speech in Marathi & Hindi begins]
Today I wanted to bless you all that 

24
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:28,840
you become completely musical in temperament
– rhythmic and entertaining to others and

25
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:36,530
not quarrelsome.

26
00:05:36,530 --> 00:06:55,440
Now as you have seen how the western music
is taking to wrong side, to the wrong progress

27
00:06:55,440 --> 00:08:01,800
and I don’t want you to fall into that.

28
00:08:01,800 --> 00:09:27,310
This will all disappear, I know because it
is [it is DEL] very destructive.

29
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:40,940
But 

30
00:09:40,940 --> 00:11:18,410
after 
coming to Sahaja also, if you 

31
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:41,220
have 

32
00:11:41,220 --> 00:12:39,050
the same destructive ideas, how 

33
00:12:39,050 --> 00:13:11,529
can anybody help you.

34
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:33,279
So 

35
00:13:33,279 --> 00:14:03,160
I hope you’ll fulfill My 
ideal 

36
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:25,900
about it.

37
00:14:25,900 --> 00:15:36,410
May God bless 

38
00:15:36,410 --> 00:21:42,159
you all.
