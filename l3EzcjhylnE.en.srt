1
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:47,147
Today we have decided to celebrate the Buddha
Jayanti, it's the day of Buddha's birth.

2
00:04:50,035 --> 00:05:06,755
In the whole
map of time, Buddha came to this earth at

3
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:13,015
a time when it was so important for Him to
come.

4
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:34,935
That time, especially in India, we had two
types of people: one, who were very ritualistic,

5
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:55,955
trying to be extremely strict and disciplined;
and the another were the people who were

6
00:05:55,955 --> 00:06:07,514
too much conditioned and were full of so-called
devotion to God.

7
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:24,305
So these two types of people were occupying
the area of seekers.

8
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:35,574
So it was necessary to neutralize these two
styles of seekings.

9
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:52,945
Buddha and Mahavira are, in essence, supported
by Hanumana and Bhairava - that is, as you

10
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:57,485
know, Gabriel and Saint Michael.

11
00:06:57,485 --> 00:07:10,585
The principle that took birth is the principle
of a disciple, and this principle was born

12
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:18,165
much earlier as the two sons of Shri Rama.

13
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:31,085
This principle was brought on this earth and
incarnated: one, to conquer the ego of human

14
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:39,574
beings; another one, to conquer the superego
of human beings.

15
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:49,634
Buddha, when He was born, He found that there
was misery everywhere.

16
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:58,665
And the misery, according to Him, was due
to the desires we have.

17
00:07:58,665 --> 00:08:05,685
So to be desireless is the best way to achieve
Nirvana.

18
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:10,355
That's what He came to conclusion.

19
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:12,505
But how to become desireless?

20
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:22,685
You are sitting in the sand, and if you see,
the sand doesn't get attached to anything.

21
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:26,665
You put anything on it, it will not spoil
anything.

22
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:35,285
You put water, it will stick on, and as soon
as you try to throw it away the whole thing

23
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:39,795
will disappear into thin air.

24
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:59,545
So to develop that kind of detachment, or
to develop a life which was desireless was

25
00:08:59,746 --> 00:09:01,174
His aim.

26
00:09:01,382 --> 00:09:05,635
And that's why I say He was a Disciple Principles.

27
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:17,975
So, the Disciple Principle has to find out
the way and method, while the Guru Principle

28
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:22,424
are the people who have already found out.

29
00:09:22,424 --> 00:09:25,635
Because He has to create a way and path.

30
00:09:25,635 --> 00:09:32,365
So, He studied all kinds of books, went to
many places.

31
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:34,555
He read Upanishadas.

32
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:41,584
Then He saw the people who are busy with Vedas
and were doing all kinds of ritualism.

33
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:54,225
With the rituals, they never got the Realization,
which is actually the first verse of Veda

34
00:09:54,225 --> 00:10:02,264
is that, "By reading the Vedas and by doing
all the rituals of the Vedas, if you do not

35
00:10:02,264 --> 00:10:10,924
become vida, means self-realized, vida word
means "to know", if you don't know the Divine

36
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:19,834
on your central nervous system, then you are
just missing the point.

37
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:23,295
It is all useless for you to read Vedas.

38
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:30,674
So He went into various areas of search.

39
00:10:30,674 --> 00:10:42,415
As today we find many seekers have been going
to many people to find out the truth.

40
00:10:42,415 --> 00:10:46,505
And He was tired, very tired.

41
00:10:46,505 --> 00:10:56,855
He thought all His seeking, all His working
hard, all His efforts, everything had just

42
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:58,155
made Him tired.

43
00:10:58,155 --> 00:11:03,555
And He thought it was all fruitless.

44
00:11:03,555 --> 00:11:18,644
So, He was lying under a Banyan tree, and
there the Adi Shakti gave Him Realization.

45
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:30,955
When all your searches are over - people search
in money, in power, in love, and all kinds

46
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:31,955
of things.

47
00:11:31,955 --> 00:11:41,065
Ultimately people start searching in various
groups, cults, gurus, all kinds of things

48
00:11:41,065 --> 00:11:47,245
- drugs, alcohol's, whichever way are possible
they try to search.

49
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:53,725
But when human beings try to search something,
then in their movement they either go to the

50
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:57,375
left or to the right.

51
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:06,924
And He, being such an ardent seeker, and such
a truthful seeker, He could see very clearly

52
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:11,375
that this is not the point of going left or
right.

53
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:15,465
But there has to be some ascent, but how to
achieve it?

54
00:12:15,465 --> 00:12:19,455
Who is going to give Him Self-Realization?

55
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:28,795
All that tiredness He laid down Himself under
the tree and suddenly He got His Realization.

56
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:42,445
When He got His Realization, He started understanding
why this problem of conditioning and ego is

57
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:43,445
there.

58
00:12:43,445 --> 00:12:53,245
He found out one thing: that people when they
read too much, and try to understand - through

59
00:12:53,245 --> 00:12:56,385
ritualism - God, then they develop their ego.

60
00:12:56,385 --> 00:13:04,725
The other side, He found out, that when people
just with some desires, go on praying to God,

61
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:11,145
"Give me this, give me that", they become
mad.

62
00:13:11,145 --> 00:13:19,715
And when He realized it, then only at that
moment when He was tired, He got His Realization.

63
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:25,695
This is exactly what is happening today in
the modern times.

64
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:35,395
That those who were seekers have been seeking
the Divine on the left and right hand side.

65
00:13:35,395 --> 00:13:39,015
Nowadays they are jogging.

66
00:13:39,015 --> 00:13:42,245
I don't know what they're going to achieve
through jogging.

67
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:44,755
They're jogging like mad.

68
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:51,975
Then there are ardent Christians, ardent Muslims,
fighting the whole world for their religion,

69
00:13:51,975 --> 00:13:58,395
for their God, for in the name of Mohammed
Sahib, in the name of Krishna, in the name

70
00:13:58,395 --> 00:14:02,555
of everything.

71
00:14:02,555 --> 00:14:07,505
Then they think their religion is in danger.

72
00:14:07,505 --> 00:14:09,295
I mean it is not.

73
00:14:09,295 --> 00:14:16,695
Neither the prophets nor the incarnations,
nobody is in danger, not at all.

74
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:20,795
How can they be?

75
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:25,155
And no religion if it is true religion can
be in danger.

76
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:30,215
But this He only realized after His Realization.

77
00:14:30,215 --> 00:14:39,585
But His followers who came did not see the
point that ultimately it is Self-Realization

78
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:41,725
He is talking.

79
00:14:41,725 --> 00:14:47,365
Actually he took all the care to see that
people should get their Self-Realization first.

80
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:48,655
Then anything else.

81
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:53,125
First of all He said, "You are not going to
worship Me."

82
00:14:53,125 --> 00:15:04,325
As you know we don't allow people to come
for My Puja unless and until they are fully

83
00:15:04,325 --> 00:15:07,115
established in Sahaja Yoga.

84
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:13,935
So He first said that, "You should be fully
established in your Self-Realization, that's

85
00:15:13,935 --> 00:15:15,375
all."

86
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:24,605
He would not talk about God, because once
you start talking about God, then He saw all

87
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:28,135
these horrible religions coming up in the
name of God.

88
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:35,615
When I first came to America, you will be
surprised, I did not talk of God, I did not

89
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:41,785
talk of bhoots, I did not talk of any religion.

90
00:15:41,785 --> 00:15:45,355
I just talked about Self-Realization.

91
00:15:45,355 --> 00:15:52,695
The reason was, I thought, if you get your
Self-Realization then you'll understand the

92
00:15:52,695 --> 00:16:06,205
rest of it, but no use talking to you -

93
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:15,885
about God or about Divine because first thing
is you must have your eyes, you must have

94
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:20,335
the light, otherwise what's the use of talking
about these things.

95
00:16:20,335 --> 00:16:25,655
But it so happened that Buddha did not give
anybody Realization.

96
00:16:25,655 --> 00:16:32,675
So it was all right for Him to talk about
the Spirit and not about God or any religion,

97
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:38,885
to such an extent that people say that Buddha
was an atheist - He did not believe in God.

98
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:47,755
No, it was a matter of His policy that He
did not want to talk about God.

99
00:16:47,755 --> 00:16:57,375
But what I found when I came to America that
this world is full of all kinds of things.

100
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:02,375
Firstly the tremendous ego that they have.

101
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:06,565
And secondly they are so much conditioned.

102
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:18,085
There were so many witchcrafts and forces,
I mean openly they are saying, "This is a

103
00:17:18,085 --> 00:17:19,285
witchcraft's school."

104
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:20,285
Openly.

105
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:24,105
Or, "This is a satanic powers school."

106
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:27,855
All kinds, I was surprised, openly saying
like that.

107
00:17:27,855 --> 00:17:35,195
And when I came to San Diego first, because
I came on My own, and the people who invited

108
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:42,305
Me had an organization called "parapsychology"
- is all bhoots.

109
00:17:42,305 --> 00:17:49,445
So they took Me round in a huge, big hall
and there were lots of people sitting down

110
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:51,965
and I saw all the bhoots.

111
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:54,835
(Shri Mataji laughing) I said, "Now what should
I do?

112
00:17:54,835 --> 00:17:55,835
Should I say the truth or not?

113
00:17:55,835 --> 00:17:58,855
They might start getting angry with Me."

114
00:17:58,855 --> 00:18:05,615
But I said, "Better to tell them, because
once they are lost in the bhoots, then what

115
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:07,355
will I do with them?"

116
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:10,765
So I told them, "This is all wrong, this is
all bhootish, it is all nonsense, you just

117
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:18,655
don't fall a prey to all these things, this
is not correct, you better get your Realization!"

118
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:23,915
And see, some people did get Realization,
and some people did leave that organization.

119
00:18:23,915 --> 00:18:35,855
Now, last time when I came I discovered in
'83 that the lady who was in charge sort of

120
00:18:35,855 --> 00:18:47,335
a person, has become mad and the gentleman
who was organizing all that has become bankrupt

121
00:18:47,536 --> 00:18:51,634
and has gone to Australia and the building
has collapsed.

122
00:18:51,835 --> 00:18:55,715
The bhoots must have done the job.

123
00:18:55,715 --> 00:19:05,405
It was such a problem for Me in those days
to talk against all this nonsense.

124
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:06,405
Then I went to some churches, they invited
Me.

125
00:19:06,405 --> 00:19:13,535
Now, in the church suddenly I found eight
or ten bhootish people got up and started

126
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,535
dancing.

127
00:19:14,535 --> 00:19:17,395
I said, "Where am I now?"

128
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:25,075
(Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) I am here to
tell them about the Spirit and see the condition

129
00:19:25,075 --> 00:19:26,075
here.

130
00:19:26,075 --> 00:19:32,875
What am I to tell them and they ardently
believed that I was an agent of God, of course,

131
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,135
but God meaning bhoot.

132
00:19:35,135 --> 00:19:42,615
It was impossible to understand how far people
have gone.

133
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:50,655
At the same time there was an onslaught of
all the fake gurus at that time and when I

134
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:56,115
said, "You cannot pay for it" they said, "You
better go back.

135
00:19:56,115 --> 00:19:57,935
We don't want you."

136
00:19:57,935 --> 00:20:04,685
So I went away and then came back after nine
years.

137
00:20:04,685 --> 00:20:14,525
So Buddha tried to talk only about Self-Realization
and not about God at all.

138
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:23,855
But His followers as they are always one better
than the other, tried to create a Buddhism

139
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:28,075
of their own style.

140
00:20:28,276 --> 00:20:32,544
And in this Buddhism, whatever He had told,
they did not observe it.

141
00:20:32,745 --> 00:20:38,835
Firstly He thought if there is ritualism and
puja an all that, before Realization where

142
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:42,295
will they land up?

143
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:49,975
So He said, "All right, you do not do any
puja to Me!

144
00:20:49,975 --> 00:20:53,374
Do not built any monument in My name!

145
00:20:53,374 --> 00:20:58,205
You should not worship anything!"

146
00:20:58,205 --> 00:20:59,505
So what did they do?

147
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:07,035
They are worshipping His teeth, they are worshipping
His nails, they are worshipping His hair.

148
00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:18,425
Now say, for example, if you get My hair and
you are not a Realized Soul, what is the difference

149
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:20,625
between My hair or anybody's hair?

150
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,315
Just the same.

151
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:29,645
Without Realization all this worship took
them to very bhootish area.

152
00:21:29,645 --> 00:21:35,765
That's how we find the Buddhists who are nowhere
near Buddha.

153
00:21:35,765 --> 00:21:41,445
Like if you go to Japan, you can't believe
they can be Buddhist.

154
00:21:41,445 --> 00:21:46,795
They are supposed to be Buddhist - Buddha
who is the compassionate.

155
00:21:46,795 --> 00:21:54,045
Then we have got Chinese who followed Buddhism.

156
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:57,345
They couldn't understand Buddhism either.

157
00:21:57,345 --> 00:22:05,005
And we have Tibetans where we had these horrible
lamas and we had other people in Ladakh and

158
00:22:05,005 --> 00:22:06,005
all that.

159
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:12,755
They are all doing nothing else but bhoot-vidya,
prita-vidya, smashaan vidya.

160
00:22:12,755 --> 00:22:18,585
So even His advent amounted to the same thing
as everybody's.

161
00:22:18,585 --> 00:22:28,965
Now Buddha told three things which are very
important, which are very useful for Sahaja

162
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:31,575
Yogis to follow.

163
00:22:31,575 --> 00:22:40,455
He said, "Buddham Sharanam Gachami.

164
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:46,615
- I surrender myself to the enlightened one."

165
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,685
Means what?

166
00:22:47,685 --> 00:22:52,595
I surrender myself to the one who is enlightened.

167
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:56,285
In this case one can say it was Buddha.

168
00:22:56,285 --> 00:23:00,045
In your case it is your Spirit.

169
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:04,235
You surrender yourself to your Spirit.

170
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:05,955
"Buddham Sharanam Gachami."

171
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:10,465
Buddha means the one which knows.

172
00:23:10,465 --> 00:23:19,715
Then He says another thing, "Dhammam Sharanam
Gachami" means surrender yourself to the religion,

173
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:23,805
which is true religion, which is the balance.

174
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:33,515
Now as you see, all these man-made religions
are so funny and you can't make much out of

175
00:23:33,515 --> 00:23:34,515
them.

176
00:23:34,515 --> 00:23:40,675
You can't explain if these are religions or these
are Mafias.

177
00:23:40,675 --> 00:23:52,385
The reason is, Buddha said, "You surrender
yourselves to Dharma."

178
00:23:52,385 --> 00:23:58,735
So the Buddhist thought, "surrender to Dharma"
means what you have to do is to become like

179
00:23:58,735 --> 00:24:06,485
Buddhist - means wear a dress like a Buddhist,
like Buddha used to wear.

180
00:24:06,485 --> 00:24:12,175
You don't become by wearing that dress Buddha,
do you?

181
00:24:12,175 --> 00:24:14,745
Or then they thought, "We should do something
more."

182
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:24,655
So some Buddhist got hold of a wheel, because
He talked of a wheel-of-life and all that.

183
00:24:24,655 --> 00:24:32,234
Absolutely, I should say, very unintelligent
way of understanding Buddha.

184
00:24:32,234 --> 00:24:36,295
And they would go on, you see, moving that
wheel like mad.

185
00:24:36,295 --> 00:24:38,785
You can't talk to them.

186
00:24:38,785 --> 00:24:41,705
You say, "Now, where is that road?"

187
00:24:41,705 --> 00:24:42,705
"Buddha."

188
00:24:42,705 --> 00:24:46,195
(Laughter) "How do we go there?"

189
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:49,405
(Laughter) Everything has an answer.

190
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:53,255
So I said, "Please answer Me."

191
00:24:53,255 --> 00:24:55,825
"This is the answer."

192
00:24:55,825 --> 00:25:02,915
So what is this answer going on?

193
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:07,685
Then these people thought we should find out
new methods.

194
00:25:07,685 --> 00:25:16,975
So some of them took to again Upanishadas
and started using also from there, making

195
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:25,735
jataka kathas like the stories which are very
absurd, funny stories, mysterious stories,

196
00:25:25,735 --> 00:25:28,975
this story, that story.

197
00:25:28,975 --> 00:25:41,845
At the same time Hinduism took another funny
role and they had a big assault of tantrikas.

198
00:25:41,845 --> 00:25:52,295
And when the tantrikas came in they brought
all kinds of ugly, horrible things in the

199
00:25:52,295 --> 00:25:59,475
- say about the sixth century it started.

200
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:12,065
And a complete belt starting beyond Calcutta
going towards Dwarika, complete belt got involved

201
00:26:12,065 --> 00:26:14,105
into tantrism.

202
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:19,815
So the same Buddhist later on, followed the
same tantric methods.

203
00:26:19,815 --> 00:26:27,715
So they tried to bring in everything from
this place, that place and a mixture, so now

204
00:26:27,715 --> 00:26:34,445
if you ask, "Now what's your religion?" they
say, "I'm Buddhist."

205
00:26:34,445 --> 00:26:35,665
"What Buddhist?"

206
00:26:35,665 --> 00:26:37,495
- "Dinayan, hinayan,

207
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:42,995
I'm Zen - this, that, all kinds of Buddhism is
there.

208
00:26:42,995 --> 00:26:48,415
Is impossible to understand really where is
Buddhism there.

209
00:26:48,415 --> 00:26:49,525
So what do these do?

210
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,585
One will shave their hair.

211
00:26:51,585 --> 00:26:53,645
One will shave their moustache.

212
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:56,035
Another one will wear this kind of a dress.

213
00:26:56,035 --> 00:27:00,325
(Shri Mataji laughing) This is the only difference
between from one to another.

214
00:27:00,325 --> 00:27:07,125
But the common point is that they are all
cheats, they all can deceive you, they can

215
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,125
tell lies without feeling funny.

216
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:13,345
They are very sly, very cunning and suicidal.

217
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:22,505
They can be very violent and the only desire
they have is to kill everybody who comes across.

218
00:27:22,505 --> 00:27:30,375
This is where Buddha's Buddhism has ended
up.

219
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:36,225
So now we are face to face with Buddha.

220
00:27:36,225 --> 00:27:43,175
But what He talked about was a spontaneous
happening of Self-Realization.

221
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:46,135
And He said, "You prepare yourself."

222
00:27:46,135 --> 00:27:52,754
All the time He said, "You prepare yourself
for Self-Realization and try to watch everything

223
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,754
without desire."

224
00:27:53,754 --> 00:27:58,925
This was just preparation for Sahaja Yoga
He was talking about.

225
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:13,675
But as you see, all the Buddhists today, if
you see them you'll be amazed that they are

226
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:15,315
neither here nor there.

227
00:28:15,315 --> 00:28:20,765
You just don't know how to place them, how
to understand them, how to make them feel

228
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,445
what Buddha taught or Zen has taught.

229
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:27,835
They are not in a condition to understand
anything.

230
00:28:27,835 --> 00:28:37,385
It's like, you see, the brain of a person
who is having all kinds of thoughts, like

231
00:28:37,385 --> 00:28:42,225
all the pebbles in one little pot, making
noise.

232
00:28:42,225 --> 00:28:45,965
God knows which one is making which noise.

233
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:52,695
And that's why today you find here is one
Lama, who was a guru of Hitler.

234
00:28:52,695 --> 00:28:56,185
Imagine: Hitler's guru was Lama!

235
00:28:56,185 --> 00:29:01,795
Now this mister Lama is going round the whole
world with his wrinkles which can be counted

236
00:29:01,795 --> 00:29:05,415
one by one and asking for money.

237
00:29:05,415 --> 00:29:06,965
Why does he want money for?

238
00:29:06,965 --> 00:29:17,075
He is the one who ran away from Tibet, from
Lhasa.

239
00:29:17,075 --> 00:29:21,285
And while running away he carried such a lot
of gold with him that he could not carry.

240
00:29:21,285 --> 00:29:26,425
So half of it he dropped it in the river and
with the half of it he reached India.

241
00:29:26,425 --> 00:29:32,935
With the half of it already he has made a
huge, big Buddha of gold, he has too much

242
00:29:32,935 --> 00:29:34,135
gold with him.

243
00:29:34,135 --> 00:29:43,665
And the rest of the gold that was salvaged,
was taken to Russia - to China, where I've

244
00:29:43,665 --> 00:29:45,295
seen it Myself.

245
00:29:45,295 --> 00:29:46,295
Amazed.

246
00:29:46,496 --> 00:29:54,014
He had gold, beer mugs, what you call
them, the huge, big things, like that.

247
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:55,375
Real gold.

248
00:29:55,375 --> 00:30:00,385
And such big plates of real gold for eating
food.

249
00:30:00,385 --> 00:30:01,385
Imagine!

250
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:10,435
Buddha talked of detachment, and they had
everything in gold or silver of a very expensive

251
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:12,155
quality.

252
00:30:12,155 --> 00:30:15,625
If you see their robe, clothes and all that
you'd be amazed.

253
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:23,945
Though they wore all those things as robes
of renunciation, but whenever they sat in

254
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:32,224
their own courtyard - courts and things like
that, inside all that they wore - inside wore

255
00:30:32,425 --> 00:30:40,615
all those dresses which were very heavily
done with real gold, with pearls and things,

256
00:30:40,615 --> 00:30:46,095
because I've seen with My own eyes.

257
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:49,245
I was amazed.

258
00:30:49,245 --> 00:30:53,065
So it is like somebody who says, "Oh, I must
get detached.

259
00:30:53,065 --> 00:30:54,925
Now I'm going to the seashore.

260
00:30:54,925 --> 00:30:58,165
I'm going to sit there and meditate."

261
00:30:58,165 --> 00:31:01,585
There he goes, and makes a compound round
himself.

262
00:31:01,585 --> 00:31:06,245
So I ask him, "Why have you made a compound?", "You
know, maybe thieves might come in."

263
00:31:06,245 --> 00:31:10,925
I mean you are detached what does it matter
if a thief comes, he will take you away, so

264
00:31:10,925 --> 00:31:11,925
what?

265
00:31:11,925 --> 00:31:15,305
You are there, doesn't matter, you can go
with a thief, you can go with anyone.

266
00:31:15,305 --> 00:31:17,065
Why are you worried about the thief?

267
00:31:17,065 --> 00:31:18,375
You are detached.

268
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:22,075
"Oh, you see, I am also worried that there
might be pick-pockets."

269
00:31:22,075 --> 00:31:25,625
"So why are you worried about pick-pockets?"

270
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:32,405
"Because maybe I have some money with me here,
and I have my bank account and I have my other, other

271
00:31:32,204 --> 00:31:36,744
things with me, so I am rather worried, see,
that a thief might come."

272
00:31:36,945 --> 00:31:40,015
So why do you talk of detachment?

273
00:31:40,015 --> 00:31:42,315
Why do you talk of sanyasa?

274
00:31:42,315 --> 00:31:52,275
So this kind of a nonsensical sanyasa started
after Buddha died, which was so very shocking.

275
00:31:52,275 --> 00:32:01,275
This led people to think that you can wear
any time an orange dress and then you are

276
00:32:01,275 --> 00:32:02,275
a sanyasi.

277
00:32:02,275 --> 00:32:06,635
If you wear an orange dress you become Buddha,
and you become a detached personality.

278
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:13,935
Now you can announce to the whole world that,
"I'm a detached personality" and what is your

279
00:32:13,935 --> 00:32:14,935
background?

280
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:20,374
"Nothing, I just was born out of this Mother
Earth and I'm sitting here nicely like Buddha."

281
00:32:20,374 --> 00:32:24,135
So people stupidly start giving them money.

282
00:32:24,135 --> 00:32:26,504
So they get the money.

283
00:32:26,504 --> 00:32:31,765
But actually, the background is that the fellow
might have come out of the jail in India for

284
00:32:31,765 --> 00:32:38,595
burglary or something like that, and now sitting
down here as Buddha.

285
00:32:38,595 --> 00:32:40,955
How will you make out?

286
00:32:40,955 --> 00:32:46,235
"Buddham Sharanam Gachami."

287
00:32:46,235 --> 00:32:52,265
So what we have to do is to establish ourselves
in Buddha.

288
00:32:52,265 --> 00:32:56,945
That is to establish within ourselves in our
Spirit.

289
00:32:56,945 --> 00:33:05,655
Unless and until we are established in our
Spirit, we cannot understand the intricacies

290
00:33:05,655 --> 00:33:11,495
of all the ignorance that we have around.

291
00:33:11,495 --> 00:33:18,225
So the best way to understand Sahaja Yoga
is to establish yourself in the Spirit.

292
00:33:18,225 --> 00:33:26,985
But those who are not intelligent, those who
are stupid, those who are selfish and greedy

293
00:33:26,985 --> 00:33:30,485
do not see this point.

294
00:33:30,485 --> 00:33:37,805
And they do not like it if a leader tells
them that, "You must establish in Sahaja Yoga,

295
00:33:37,805 --> 00:33:40,945
that you should have your Spirit manifested."

296
00:33:40,945 --> 00:33:42,965
They don't want to listen to it.

297
00:33:42,965 --> 00:33:48,885
They want to be in the group of Sahaja Yogis
because they don't want to be lonely.

298
00:33:48,885 --> 00:33:57,645
They would like to sing songs, music, everything
in Sahaja Yoga because they want somewhere

299
00:33:57,645 --> 00:34:03,845
to fit in, because they want an identity,
they call themselves Sahaja Yogis.

300
00:34:03,845 --> 00:34:08,895
But this identity is a false identity.

301
00:34:08,895 --> 00:34:13,645
You have to be identified with your Spirit.

302
00:34:13,645 --> 00:34:18,275
That is the part is, "Buddham Sharanam Gachami."

303
00:34:18,275 --> 00:34:22,755
The second is, "Dhammam Sharanam Gachami."

304
00:34:22,755 --> 00:34:25,025
What is "Dhammam", is Dharma.

305
00:34:25,025 --> 00:34:29,395
What is our Dharma, is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

306
00:34:29,395 --> 00:34:33,254
That means now we have become universal beings.

307
00:34:33,254 --> 00:34:42,825
We are no more Indians, no more Africans,
no more English, no more French.

308
00:34:42,825 --> 00:34:57,655
We all have become now Sahaja Yogis who are
the citizens of the Kingdom of God.

309
00:34:57,655 --> 00:35:00,865
We have no other identification.

310
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,475
This is our Dharma.

311
00:35:03,475 --> 00:35:10,615
We are now leading a universal life.

312
00:35:10,615 --> 00:35:17,765
But Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

313
00:35:17,765 --> 00:35:24,835
Still, so many of them still identify themselves
with some localized stuff.

314
00:35:24,835 --> 00:35:34,325
Now when we think of universality we have
to understand, that it's not only the religion

315
00:35:34,325 --> 00:35:40,745
or a country that separates us, but also a
kind of a quality.

316
00:35:40,745 --> 00:35:48,045
For example, if there are people who are Rajo-gunis
who are very active, right-sided people, they'll

317
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,285
combine together.

318
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:51,885
They may fight later but they combine.

319
00:35:51,885 --> 00:36:00,244
Then the people who are left-sided will combine
together, but both of these should cling onto

320
00:36:00,043 --> 00:36:08,654
those who are trying to ascend, who are in
the center.

321
00:36:08,855 --> 00:36:12,515
And there where we fail very much.

322
00:36:12,515 --> 00:36:24,525
Our associations and our understandings of
each other is deluded by our ignorance and

323
00:36:24,525 --> 00:36:37,895
we cannot understand who is for our ascent
and who is for our benevolence.

324
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:41,715
This happens with us in so many ways.

325
00:36:41,715 --> 00:36:48,265
We are universal beings and our culture is
"Sahaja Culture."

326
00:36:48,265 --> 00:36:51,385
We have given up all our nonsensical cultures.

327
00:36:51,385 --> 00:36:59,345
In every religion, in every country we have
seen the nonsense of our culture, so we believe

328
00:36:59,345 --> 00:37:03,624
in the spontaneous culture of Sahaja Yoga.

329
00:37:03,624 --> 00:37:06,555
So we are universal beings.

330
00:37:06,555 --> 00:37:15,805
And in this state of being universal being
you have to develop your collective consciousness.

331
00:37:15,805 --> 00:37:27,685
As first one is for individual, "Buddham Sharanam
Gacchami" - I surrender myself to Buddha.

332
00:37:27,685 --> 00:37:34,995
The second one is the one, I surrender myself
to the collective - in the sense, into the

333
00:37:34,995 --> 00:37:38,555
Dharma, the essence of the collective.

334
00:37:38,555 --> 00:37:41,725
Now what is the essence of our collective?

335
00:37:41,725 --> 00:37:48,695
What binds us together is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma,
the Pure Religion of the Universe.

336
00:37:48,695 --> 00:37:56,814
So once you understand that this is the thing
that binds you to each other, you must understand

337
00:37:56,814 --> 00:38:02,015
how important it is to keep to Vishwa Nirmala
Dharma.

338
00:38:02,015 --> 00:38:09,805
In so many ways I have been able to tell you
what is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

339
00:38:09,805 --> 00:38:21,104
So we have to understand the full content
of the Dharma that we are following and also

340
00:38:21,104 --> 00:38:27,795
to reflect it back to see, "Are we really
following this religion?"

341
00:38:27,795 --> 00:38:31,785
But in falsehood I have seen like somebody's
a Christian.

342
00:38:31,785 --> 00:38:38,345
Every Sunday he'll get up, dress up nicely,
go to the church, get up three times, four

343
00:38:38,345 --> 00:38:43,665
times, sing songs, this thing, do everything,
pay the money to the priest, pay to the church,

344
00:38:43,665 --> 00:38:52,125
pay to that, and then he thinks he has done
the job.

345
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:55,165
Very religiously he'll go and confess.

346
00:38:55,165 --> 00:39:00,335
Muslims, very religiously will do some things
which we cannot really understand.

347
00:39:00,335 --> 00:39:07,855
As in Spain I was told that people try
to crucify themselves, as a drama of course,

348
00:39:07,855 --> 00:39:16,585
but they do it just to protect Christianity
I think, and to crucify - God knows what!

349
00:39:16,585 --> 00:39:24,405
Then there are people in India who are following
Hinduism and the first principle, the basic

350
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:28,605
principle of Hinduism, that there is Spirit
in everyone.

351
00:39:28,605 --> 00:39:33,585
So how can you have caste and subcaste and this and that?

352
00:39:33,585 --> 00:39:37,455
If everybody has the Spirit you can't have
caste, subcaste.

353
00:39:37,455 --> 00:39:41,305
You cannot have division like that.

354
00:39:41,305 --> 00:39:48,345
So what we find in every religion, there are
problematic things but once you come to this

355
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:55,064
pure religion, then you see the essence of
it and the essence of it is that, that we

356
00:39:55,064 --> 00:40:01,935
are all Spirit and we are all related to each
other, we are part and parcel of the whole.

357
00:40:01,935 --> 00:40:03,795
So you go to the collective.

358
00:40:03,795 --> 00:40:08,305
So at the end He said, "Sangham Sharanam Gachami."

359
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:12,075
This is the very important point also.

360
00:40:12,075 --> 00:40:20,465
It's the most important thing is this "Sangham
Sharanam Gachami."

361
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:27,895
For example, we say that you surrender yourself
to collectivity.

362
00:40:27,895 --> 00:40:28,915
What does that mean?

363
00:40:28,915 --> 00:40:30,375
What does that entail (it is)?

364
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:40,925
As I was talking to your leaders here, I said,
"All of you should form one collective unit,

365
00:40:40,925 --> 00:40:42,635
a 'Sangham'."

366
00:40:42,635 --> 00:40:49,715
All the leaders have to know that they love
Mother from their heart, and they should never

367
00:40:49,715 --> 00:41:01,105
try to cut each other because somebody's trying
to tell them against them.

368
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:04,097
They should have love for each other.

369
00:41:04,097 --> 00:41:05,985
For example there's one Mr. X, who's a leader.

370
00:41:05,985 --> 00:41:15,115
Now a negative force incarnates and comes
and tells the leader that, "See the other

371
00:41:15,115 --> 00:41:16,365
leader is my supporter."

372
00:41:16,365 --> 00:41:23,205
So this fellow has a bad feeling, the another
leader has another bad feeling.

373
00:41:23,205 --> 00:41:24,915
This is going against "Sangha."

374
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:31,965
First the Sangha of the collectivity of the
leaders has to be fully appreciated.

375
00:41:31,965 --> 00:41:37,085
I enjoy the way when all these leaders meet
and beat each other nicely and enjoy each

376
00:41:37,085 --> 00:41:46,005
other, pull each other's legs and love each
other and patronize the younger ones and look

377
00:41:46,005 --> 00:41:47,005
after.

378
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,165
That's the beginning of Sangha.

379
00:41:48,165 --> 00:41:53,325
If the leaders are not in Sangha, what other
Sangha we can form?

380
00:41:53,325 --> 00:41:56,685
So the first is the Sangha of the leaders
is there.

381
00:41:56,685 --> 00:42:02,805
All those who try to break that Sangha must
know that they are negative people and they

382
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:05,364
are going to stab us.

383
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:09,955
Anybody who tries that, you should be very
careful.

384
00:42:09,955 --> 00:42:15,185
The second Sangha, collectivity, is among
the Sahaja Yogis.

385
00:42:15,185 --> 00:42:23,985
Now we are not, as I told you, Indians, or
we are not English or Americans or anything,

386
00:42:23,985 --> 00:42:26,475
so we should not form groups.

387
00:42:26,475 --> 00:42:32,925
What you'll find always, if there are five
Americans they'll stick on to each other as

388
00:42:32,724 --> 00:42:36,694
if they have been glued, and they can't move
away from each other.

389
00:42:36,895 --> 00:42:38,285
All of them will be together.

390
00:42:38,285 --> 00:42:43,064
If there are Indians, they will stick on together.

391
00:42:43,064 --> 00:42:48,385
If there are other kinds, they'll all stick
on together.

392
00:42:48,385 --> 00:42:51,155
Now we are no more that.

393
00:42:51,155 --> 00:42:52,554
It's finished!

394
00:42:52,554 --> 00:42:54,775
So what is there to glue to each other?

395
00:42:54,775 --> 00:42:56,125
But it happens.

396
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:58,605
We always glue to each other.

397
00:42:58,605 --> 00:43:00,995
I don't know why.

398
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,825
What is the need to do that?

399
00:43:02,825 --> 00:43:10,315
And very commonly we see that in India people
are behaving in a very funny manner.

400
00:43:10,315 --> 00:43:16,425
Last year I did not know, but people told
Me that some group came and they were all

401
00:43:16,425 --> 00:43:24,085
the time saying, "We are a great nation, we
are a great nation."

402
00:43:24,085 --> 00:43:28,035
They are not Sahaja Yogis.

403
00:43:28,035 --> 00:43:38,755
Our nation is Kingdom of God and our King
is God Almighty and we have no other King

404
00:43:38,755 --> 00:43:41,425
and no other nation.

405
00:43:41,425 --> 00:43:52,085
If you cannot transcend those barriers of
stupid limitations you cannot become Sahaja

406
00:43:52,085 --> 00:43:53,285
Yogis.

407
00:43:53,285 --> 00:43:56,415
But this is in a very gross way.

408
00:43:56,415 --> 00:44:06,395
But in a very subtle way, I see a lady who
is catching or who has badha will immediately

409
00:44:06,395 --> 00:44:08,525
crawl into another one - somehow.

410
00:44:08,525 --> 00:44:11,955
She may belong to any country, doesn't matter.

411
00:44:11,955 --> 00:44:21,815
You see, a bhootish woman, say, coming from
India, will crawl up to another one in Australia.

412
00:44:21,614 --> 00:44:23,354
Straight forward, march!

413
00:44:23,555 --> 00:44:27,055
Just start watching, "Where is she going?

414
00:44:27,055 --> 00:44:29,405
Oh God, that's it!"

415
00:44:29,405 --> 00:44:35,885
So the bhoots are very collective, a big fraternity,
great fraternity.

416
00:44:35,885 --> 00:44:41,585
If they see somebody who is possessed, this
bhootish person will immediately go to her.

417
00:44:41,585 --> 00:44:48,765
It is very surprising that the bhoots are
so collective.

418
00:44:48,765 --> 00:44:52,965
Apart from that, they know Me very well.

419
00:44:52,965 --> 00:44:54,905
They understand Me very well.

420
00:44:54,905 --> 00:45:01,885
Even a little child if he is caught up will
start crying before Me, shaking before Me,

421
00:45:01,885 --> 00:45:03,675
not coming before Me.

422
00:45:03,675 --> 00:45:10,515
But when they are realized, they don't understand
and moreover they don't understand a simple

423
00:45:10,515 --> 00:45:15,925
principle that we are now possessed by our
own Spirit and we are one.

424
00:45:15,925 --> 00:45:27,165
So they should stick on more to the person
who is a spiritually evolved personality.

425
00:45:27,165 --> 00:45:35,185
But instead of that, for them some "third-rater"
something is much more important than a person

426
00:45:35,185 --> 00:45:39,175
who is such a highly developed person.

427
00:45:39,175 --> 00:45:42,025
This is where we fail in our collective.

428
00:45:42,025 --> 00:45:47,314
A very subtle method of these negative people.

429
00:45:47,314 --> 00:45:51,855
Just finding out how to form a big formidable
group to attack.

430
00:45:51,855 --> 00:45:57,415
With that you lose your vibrations.

431
00:45:57,415 --> 00:46:04,755
Once you lose your vibrations then you say,
"Oh, this is too much.

432
00:46:04,755 --> 00:46:06,675
We must have compassion.

433
00:46:06,675 --> 00:46:08,645
We must have love.

434
00:46:08,645 --> 00:46:12,495
After all we are all Sahaja Yogis."

435
00:46:12,495 --> 00:46:17,895
So it's the compassion and love of bhoots
among themselves.

436
00:46:17,895 --> 00:46:22,625
They are talking of compassion to each other.

437
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:28,355
Even with Me they said, "Mother, you have
to be kind."

438
00:46:28,355 --> 00:46:35,695
I said, "Are you more compassionate than Me
that you are teaching Me?"

439
00:46:35,695 --> 00:46:45,525
If I'm saying anything to this lady taking
all My breath and all My energy on her, then

440
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:50,354
I'm doing it for her benevolence and it's
My compassion that is [why/working], but what you

441
00:46:50,555 --> 00:46:58,765
are doing is not for the benevolence but for
the destruction of that person.

442
00:46:58,765 --> 00:47:04,865
So no use supporting someone who is negative.

443
00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:10,165
Many negative persons who have been asked
to get out of Sahaja Yoga sometimes create

444
00:47:10,165 --> 00:47:17,125
this problem of coming, "Oh Mother, you know,
I'm so good, but they tortured me, they troubled

445
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,275
me so much."

446
00:47:18,275 --> 00:47:20,265
Now I'm seeing a bhoot in the person.

447
00:47:20,265 --> 00:47:22,585
I can clearly see.

448
00:47:22,585 --> 00:47:29,505
I can see the negativity, but if you do not
see, you will immediately start taking sides,

449
00:47:29,505 --> 00:47:34,445
"Oh God, look at this, poor thing is tortured."

450
00:47:34,445 --> 00:47:40,265
You lose your vibrations, you won't be able
to find out!

451
00:47:40,265 --> 00:47:45,155
So don't come under the spell of these murmuring
souls, as Christ has called.

452
00:47:45,155 --> 00:47:50,305
He said, "Murmuring souls are the greatest
danger."

453
00:47:50,305 --> 00:47:52,215
That I've seen in Sahaja Yoga.

454
00:47:52,215 --> 00:48:00,575
Those who murmur, talk at the back, go on
complaining are the greatest danger to Sahaja

455
00:48:00,575 --> 00:48:03,555
Yoga and ultimately to themselves.

456
00:48:03,555 --> 00:48:06,544
Because they'll be found out.

457
00:48:06,544 --> 00:48:16,105
So this is the another situation into which
we are not collective and when we are collective,

458
00:48:16,105 --> 00:48:24,445
we are collective for something which is not
ascending force.

459
00:48:24,445 --> 00:48:37,685
It is something surprising how we see people
in this world are inviting their destruction

460
00:48:37,685 --> 00:48:47,695
and we too, in a way, when we don't understand
what is collectivity, try to destroy our body

461
00:48:47,695 --> 00:48:52,505
of Sahaja Yoga.

462
00:48:52,505 --> 00:48:59,545
Today I'm telling you this because all these
things must be stopped now on the day of Buddha's

463
00:48:59,545 --> 00:49:00,814
birth.

464
00:49:00,814 --> 00:49:07,385
Buddha is the one who is in charge of your
ego.

465
00:49:07,385 --> 00:49:15,705
If you go beyond Buddha and start showing
off too much, then He pushes your ego into

466
00:49:15,705 --> 00:49:17,335
your left Vishuddhi.

467
00:49:17,335 --> 00:49:23,015
So you develop your left Vishuddhi and when
you develop your left Vishuddhi, what happens?

468
00:49:23,015 --> 00:49:28,615
That you start feeling guilty, meaning you
do not want to face the situation at all,

469
00:49:28,615 --> 00:49:31,525
but you say "Oh, I'm very guilty.

470
00:49:31,525 --> 00:49:36,085
I've killed you, all right, I've killed you,
I'm feeling guilty."

471
00:49:36,085 --> 00:49:38,715
We never face the situation.

472
00:49:38,715 --> 00:49:44,625
This is the ego which goes into the left and
creates this problem of left Vishuddhi.

473
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:51,975
It's not by any chance your style of bearing
up things, or you are being suppressed.

474
00:49:51,975 --> 00:50:03,015
But no, you have been oppressing others, you
have been egoistical and it has been so much

475
00:50:03,015 --> 00:50:11,375
that it has gone into the left Vishuddhi.

476
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,485
So you are trying to justify.

477
00:50:13,485 --> 00:50:21,515
Now I would suggest that if you really want
to understand Sahaja Yoga, first try to understand

478
00:50:21,515 --> 00:50:23,085
yourself.

479
00:50:23,085 --> 00:50:29,585
Then you see, "Where is my mind going now?"

480
00:50:29,585 --> 00:50:34,294
Some ladies who are used to, say gossip, they
come to Sahaja Yoga.

481
00:50:34,294 --> 00:50:41,225
They are all right, but sometimes that thing
comes, "Let's go and gossip about this lady".

482
00:50:41,024 --> 00:50:47,384
They'll just get up, walk on to another one who
must have been gossiped in last life, maybe.

483
00:50:47,585 --> 00:50:53,055
So go and talk to that person and tell something
against that person.

484
00:50:53,055 --> 00:51:01,075
(Shri Mataji laughing) Then they find out
another gossiper or they get another gossiper.

485
00:51:01,075 --> 00:51:05,675
Now, what I find is three great Sahaja Yoginis
are sitting and gossiping there.

486
00:51:05,675 --> 00:51:06,675
I say, "What are you talking?"

487
00:51:06,675 --> 00:51:11,775
"Oh, no Mother, we were discussing Sahaja
Yoga."

488
00:51:11,775 --> 00:51:13,705
I said, "Really?"

489
00:51:13,705 --> 00:51:23,895
(Laughter) Discussing Sahaja Yogis is never
discussion on Sahaja Yoga.

490
00:51:23,895 --> 00:51:29,685
If you are discussing people you are not discussing
Sahaja Yoga.

491
00:51:29,685 --> 00:51:37,855
Discussing Sahaja Yoga has nothing to do with
human beings or with Realized souls.

492
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:46,544
Thank God, you don't discuss Me, because I
must be making lots of mistakes.

493
00:51:46,544 --> 00:51:53,105
In relation to your culture, in relation to
your styles, in relation to the human style.

494
00:51:53,105 --> 00:51:56,515
For example, you have to say, "Thank you"
ten times.

495
00:51:56,515 --> 00:52:00,275
I might be saying it only three times or four
times.

496
00:52:00,275 --> 00:52:03,005
Or you have to say, "Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry."

497
00:52:03,005 --> 00:52:08,105
On the telephone even now, I never say sorry,
I say, "I beg your pardon?"

498
00:52:08,105 --> 00:52:11,395
But you see, people will say, "Sorry, sorry,
sorry."

499
00:52:11,395 --> 00:52:17,065
I start thinking, "Am I in the wrong or they
are in the wrong?"

500
00:52:17,065 --> 00:52:18,065
(Laughter)

501
00:52:18,065 --> 00:52:31,875
So when we start discussing others, what we
really do is to confront or to face someone

502
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:33,935
with your own limitations.

503
00:52:33,935 --> 00:52:42,135
And we start thinking, "He should have done
like this, he should have ..." What about

504
00:52:42,135 --> 00:52:43,135
you?

505
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:51,855
So best is, you discuss yourself with yourself
and you discuss Sahaja Yoga with others.

506
00:52:51,855 --> 00:52:56,975
This is the best way to get rid of one of
the greatest enemies of collectivity, is gossip.

507
00:52:56,975 --> 00:53:04,205
Is a human nature, you know, I think, to gossip.

508
00:53:04,205 --> 00:53:14,605
Another horrible thing we have, which Buddha
has tried to control, is a very subtle type

509
00:53:14,605 --> 00:53:16,974
of aggressiveness.

510
00:53:16,974 --> 00:53:22,205
That one of the games I play is of making
somebody a leader.

511
00:53:22,205 --> 00:53:23,965
It's a game, please remember.

512
00:53:23,965 --> 00:53:27,095
Even if I tell you, "I'm Mahamaya", you forget
it.

513
00:53:27,095 --> 00:53:31,855
Even if I tell you, "I'm playing a game",
still you forget it.

514
00:53:31,855 --> 00:53:34,335
You become so seriously leaders, you see.

515
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:38,195
It's nothing to feel that you are leaders,
there's nothing like leaders, there's nothing

516
00:53:38,195 --> 00:53:40,645
like that in Sahaja Yoga.

517
00:53:40,645 --> 00:53:43,925
But then I praise some.

518
00:53:43,925 --> 00:53:50,005
Now I had a mind to praise people today for
yesterday's program.

519
00:53:50,005 --> 00:53:55,665
The way it was arranged, the way it was done
beautifully, so many people came, is remarkable.

520
00:53:55,665 --> 00:54:00,295
But then I was thinking, "Should I say or
not?"

521
00:54:00,295 --> 00:54:08,975
(Laughter) If I say, next time, God knows
what I will see.

522
00:54:08,975 --> 00:54:17,095
(Laughter) So encouraging like this, will
it help or not?

523
00:54:17,095 --> 00:54:20,065
So I've been still discreet about it.

524
00:54:20,065 --> 00:54:26,544
Of course, I must say, yesterday's program
was very remarkable and we must really give

525
00:54:26,544 --> 00:54:35,825
a hand to Dave and to the leader, our Karan.

526
00:54:35,825 --> 00:54:37,755
(Applause)

527
00:54:37,755 --> 00:54:56,875
Despite all stupid opposition and nonsense,
they have shown how they have brought in so

528
00:54:56,875 --> 00:55:04,045
many people to Sahaja Yoga and how with complete
concentration they have been able to establish

529
00:55:04,045 --> 00:55:10,314
so many in Sahaja Yoga.

530
00:55:10,314 --> 00:55:18,795
So it is for you to learn from it, that despite
all problems and anything, without feeling

531
00:55:18,795 --> 00:55:28,635
bad about it, just see that you move like
a big elephant towards giving Realization

532
00:55:28,635 --> 00:55:39,335
to others, creating more Sahaja Yogis and
more Sahaja Yogis in America.

533
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:46,564
Those who had this aim in life that we have
to give Realization to people, we have to

534
00:55:46,564 --> 00:55:57,075
achieve establishment of Sahaja Yoga, they
never will have any problems of any kind.

535
00:55:57,075 --> 00:56:04,435
So never bring down yourself to the level
where you think that, "See, the food was not

536
00:56:04,435 --> 00:56:10,865
good, that was not good, this one was not
good, this fellow was torturing, that fellow

537
00:56:10,664 --> 00:56:12,494
was doing this."

538
00:56:12,695 --> 00:56:13,695
Nothing.

539
00:56:13,695 --> 00:56:16,365
This is not going to help you, help anyone.

540
00:56:16,365 --> 00:56:20,855
Not going to give you any marks, as they say.

541
00:56:20,855 --> 00:56:26,375
After all if you have to enter into the Kingdom
of God, one has to know that you have to have

542
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:27,385
certain marks.

543
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:33,975
Otherwise God will say, "You failed", (Laughter)
and you'll be surprised why the entrance is

544
00:56:33,975 --> 00:56:35,255
not allowed.

545
00:56:35,255 --> 00:56:41,595
You are thinking you are so intelligent, so
great, you see, how much gossip you have created,

546
00:56:41,595 --> 00:56:46,515
how much problems you have created, how many
leaders you have pulled down, how much you

547
00:56:46,515 --> 00:56:49,005
have befooled Mother and all that.

548
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:53,205
(Laughter) And there suddenly you find, "I've
failed.

549
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:56,625
(Laughter) What has happened?"

550
00:56:56,625 --> 00:57:00,015
So don't deceive your Self.

551
00:57:00,015 --> 00:57:03,225
Self is the Spirit.

552
00:57:03,225 --> 00:57:06,105
Don't deceive your Self.

553
00:57:06,105 --> 00:57:12,125
If you deceive yourself, ultimately you will
be deceived and despite the fact you have

554
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:18,064
been Sahaja Yogis, you have been to My Puja,
you have been here and you have been certified

555
00:57:17,863 --> 00:57:22,274
as Sahaja Yogis, there's light on your head,
still they will say, "Take another life,

556
00:57:22,475 --> 00:57:23,735
and then come back.

557
00:57:23,735 --> 00:57:33,075
Take another as, you see, failed, you have
to go through one year more.

558
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:35,875
Try another one."

559
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:36,875
(Laughter)

560
00:57:36,875 --> 00:57:42,015
So the easiest way to be a good Sahaja Yogi,
not to deceive your Self.

561
00:57:42,015 --> 00:57:43,695
Watch yourself!

562
00:57:43,695 --> 00:57:48,405
Where is this mind going?

563
00:57:48,405 --> 00:57:49,405
What am I thinking?

564
00:57:49,405 --> 00:57:51,175
What is my mind working now?

565
00:57:51,175 --> 00:57:59,405
Can I, this man is coming, can I give him
Realization?

566
00:57:59,204 --> 00:58:00,968
Should I start talking to him about Sahaja Yoga?

567
00:58:01,169 --> 00:58:04,075
Sitting in the train, you watch a person.

568
00:58:04,075 --> 00:58:07,465
"Ah, this is all right!

569
00:58:07,465 --> 00:58:10,175
Let's manage this fellow."

570
00:58:10,175 --> 00:58:17,554
All the time you have to catch human beings
like fishes are caught.

571
00:58:17,554 --> 00:58:22,455
I've taught you how to do it.

572
00:58:22,455 --> 00:58:26,865
To go on catching them, one by one, and create
a greater collectivity.

573
00:58:26,865 --> 00:58:40,435
If your attention is on that, then I will
say, "You have acted like Buddha", because

574
00:58:40,435 --> 00:58:43,825
Buddha just did that.

575
00:58:43,825 --> 00:58:49,825
From everywhere He collected people, told
them to follow a path of detachment and He

576
00:58:49,825 --> 00:58:55,475
asked them to wear clothes and things which
are for detachment.

577
00:58:55,475 --> 00:59:01,205
And He asked that you should detach yourself
from your families, everything.

578
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:08,565
This, all this, He did for one thing, that
they should be prepared for today's life.

579
00:59:08,565 --> 00:59:15,125
That they've done all these things, but we
don't want you to wear orange dresses, we

580
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:23,555
don't want you to do all these wrong things,
which are not needed today.

581
00:59:23,555 --> 00:59:29,075
They were all right in those days, but today
they are wrong because they are not needed.

582
00:59:29,075 --> 00:59:35,495
When it is not needed, why should you carry
on your head?

583
00:59:35,495 --> 00:59:39,655
Like the other day, I saw somebody carrying
a big boat on his head.

584
00:59:39,655 --> 00:59:41,345
I said, "What are you doing?"

585
00:59:41,345 --> 00:59:42,835
He said, "I'm carrying the boat."

586
00:59:42,835 --> 00:59:43,835
"For what?

587
00:59:43,835 --> 00:59:46,395
Why are you carrying the boat?"

588
00:59:46,395 --> 00:59:52,495
Said, "You see, I know there is no need to
carry the boat here because there is no sea,

589
00:59:52,495 --> 00:59:55,015
no water, nothing, but I'm just carrying."

590
00:59:55,015 --> 01:00:01,885
(Laughter) "But why are you carrying this
load upon your head?"

591
01:00:01,885 --> 01:00:08,345
"Ah, because I'm carrying, you know."

592
01:00:08,345 --> 01:00:09,425
(Laughter)

593
01:00:09,425 --> 01:00:11,505
That is how we are.

594
01:00:11,505 --> 01:00:15,544
We are carrying on with things which are not
needed.

595
01:00:15,544 --> 01:00:20,485
Like, "Mother, now I've been doing Hatha Yoga,
should I do some Hatha Yoga?"

596
01:00:20,485 --> 01:00:24,155
"But why do you want to do it?

597
01:00:24,155 --> 01:00:26,115
There is no need for you."

598
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:31,254
"No, no, Mother, but I've been doing it."

599
01:00:31,455 --> 01:00:34,955
(Laughter) "So do it now, what to do?"

600
01:00:34,955 --> 01:00:41,515
It's as stupid as this carrying a boat on
your head, that whatever is not needed unnecessarily

601
01:00:41,515 --> 01:00:43,955
wasting your time.

602
01:00:43,955 --> 01:00:51,845
"I'm used to this, Mother, I used to do this,
so I must do it."

603
01:00:51,845 --> 01:00:55,765
Everything is made very easy for you in Sahaja
Yoga.

604
01:00:55,765 --> 01:00:56,765
Very simple.

605
01:00:56,765 --> 01:01:02,475
You don't have to starve, you don't have to
fast, you don't have to become vegetarians,

606
01:01:02,475 --> 01:01:08,054
you don't have to go and sit in the sun or
meditate on Himalayas.

607
01:01:08,054 --> 01:01:09,855
Nothing of the kind.

608
01:01:09,855 --> 01:01:14,885
Comfortably you can sit down wherever you
like and you can meditate.

609
01:01:14,885 --> 01:01:18,625
Everything made easy.

610
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:25,845
And once you've found out your Spirit, you
can enjoy everything that's beautiful.

611
01:01:25,845 --> 01:01:31,595
Now on the whole, maybe for some people this
is really too much.

612
01:01:31,595 --> 01:01:36,845
In a Sahara Desert you are sitting, everything
blowing on your head.

613
01:01:36,845 --> 01:01:37,845
"What is this?

614
01:01:37,845 --> 01:01:38,915
How can we live here?

615
01:01:38,915 --> 01:01:42,355
Such a rough life!"

616
01:01:42,355 --> 01:01:47,225
But you don't feel that way, because you have
the comfort of the Spirit within you.

617
01:01:47,225 --> 01:01:50,625
It's the comfort of the Spirit.

618
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:57,015
And for the comfort of Spirit you don't need
anything, that's what you have.

619
01:01:57,015 --> 01:02:01,745
So do not carry on with nonsensical things.

620
01:02:01,745 --> 01:02:03,695
Because Buddha went round and round.

621
01:02:03,695 --> 01:02:08,685
As we came today to this program, I was just
thinking like Buddha.

622
01:02:08,685 --> 01:02:13,005
Going from this end, again coming from this
end, then I couldn't find it, then that end,

623
01:02:13,005 --> 01:02:14,005
then coming this way.

624
01:02:13,804 --> 01:02:15,784
Ultimately we reached here, they said it's blocked!

625
01:02:15,784 --> 01:02:21,124
I said, "Give him a bandhan."

626
01:02:21,325 --> 01:02:23,105
Finished, open!

627
01:02:23,105 --> 01:02:26,195
So this was blocked, that was blocked, go
this way, that way.

628
01:02:26,195 --> 01:02:28,435
All right, it was blocked for Him.

629
01:02:28,435 --> 01:02:31,135
So He went round and round.

630
01:02:31,135 --> 01:02:32,775
But it's not blocked for you.

631
01:02:32,775 --> 01:02:35,875
Why do you want to go round and round again?

632
01:02:35,875 --> 01:02:37,975
But that is what today everybody wants to
do the same way.

633
01:02:37,975 --> 01:02:41,485
"We must sacrifice, we must give up this,
we must do that."

634
01:02:41,485 --> 01:02:42,955
What are you going to sacrifice?

635
01:02:42,955 --> 01:02:46,015
What is there to sacrifice?

636
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:56,105
I would like to know in Sahaja Yoga.

637
01:02:56,105 --> 01:03:04,655
Of course, mostly people sacrifice their brains,
I think.

638
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:12,655
(Laughter) When nothing is to be sacrificed,
why do you want to become a goat of sacrifice?

639
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:21,784
So from Buddha's life, you don't have to learn
that He went in the jungles and He went, He

640
01:03:21,784 --> 01:03:25,605
did this and He did also renunciation.

641
01:03:25,605 --> 01:03:28,355
He gave up his wife.

642
01:03:28,355 --> 01:03:29,355
No!

643
01:03:29,355 --> 01:03:36,985
That's not needed now, that's over.

644
01:03:36,985 --> 01:03:44,314
This is where we fail and we cannot explain
to people that those who say, "But we must

645
01:03:44,314 --> 01:03:45,445
have renunciation."

646
01:03:45,445 --> 01:03:51,285
Renunciation we have from within, like the
sand, as I told you.

647
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:54,475
Detachment we have from within.

648
01:03:54,475 --> 01:04:03,085
But this is compassion, pure compassion is
the most detached thing.

649
01:04:03,085 --> 01:04:14,355
Is the most detached thing is the pure compassion,
or anything pure is pure because it is detached.

650
01:04:14,355 --> 01:04:18,165
It's a proper mathematics.

651
01:04:18,165 --> 01:04:20,605
Anything that is pure has to be detached.

652
01:04:20,605 --> 01:04:25,595
If it is attached it is contaminated.

653
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:26,775
See the logic.

654
01:04:26,775 --> 01:04:31,044
Absolute mathematics is there.

655
01:04:31,044 --> 01:04:34,505
If you have pure love then you are detached.

656
01:04:34,505 --> 01:04:38,995
Now supposing you love Mother - all right,
take that.

657
01:04:38,995 --> 01:04:47,215
Now you have say, pure love for Me, then you
won't get angry if I don't come to your house.

658
01:04:47,215 --> 01:04:51,705
You won't feel disappointed if I can't sit
in your car.

659
01:04:51,705 --> 01:04:56,485
You won't feel unhappy because I could not
touch your sari.

660
01:04:56,485 --> 01:04:58,935
Because, "I just love Mother, finished."

661
01:04:58,935 --> 01:05:01,575
It ends up there.

662
01:05:01,575 --> 01:05:04,215
Just pure love.

663
01:05:04,215 --> 01:05:09,185
Of course, I know these weaknesses, so I try
to please you, all right, all right.

664
01:05:09,185 --> 01:05:16,665
But actually, if you really love Me, "It's
all right, I love Her, and She loves me, finished.

665
01:05:16,665 --> 01:05:22,845
Whether She comes to my house or not, whether
She gives me a present or not, whether She

666
01:05:22,845 --> 01:05:28,925
pats me or not, whether I can see Her or not,
whether I can meet Her or not.

667
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:30,814
Makes no difference, I love Her."

668
01:05:31,015 --> 01:05:32,755
That's the purity of love.

669
01:05:32,755 --> 01:05:39,365
Where there's no expectation of any kind,
except that I love and that love is the ocean

670
01:05:39,365 --> 01:05:46,115
of enjoyment and the ocean of bliss, finished.

671
01:05:46,115 --> 01:05:52,705
Is the easiest thing to do, is to love.

672
01:05:52,705 --> 01:05:57,315
Just love.

673
01:05:57,315 --> 01:06:05,355
How your heart increases like an ocean - I
just love.

674
01:06:05,355 --> 01:06:08,825
The sea is not attached to any shore.

675
01:06:08,825 --> 01:06:14,285
When it has to come, it comes out, when it
has to go back, it goes back.

676
01:06:14,285 --> 01:06:17,675
When it has to give water for the rain, it
gives.

677
01:06:17,675 --> 01:06:23,825
The water goes as the clouds are formed, then
the water falls as rain, again it comes back

678
01:06:23,825 --> 01:06:25,165
to the sea.

679
01:06:25,165 --> 01:06:29,465
It doesn't stop anywhere.

680
01:06:29,465 --> 01:06:38,185
In the same way, if we just think, "Is the feeling
I have that I love Mother.

681
01:06:38,185 --> 01:06:39,415
What a feeling it is."

682
01:06:39,415 --> 01:06:48,465
That should be the end of everything, absolutely.

683
01:06:48,465 --> 01:06:55,215
I feel the same way; otherwise I would be
feeling every day guilty, "Oh, I didn't smile

684
01:06:55,215 --> 01:06:58,465
at that, I didn't give a present to this one.

685
01:06:58,465 --> 01:07:02,185
I should have brought something special for
that person.

686
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:04,185
I was late for the program."

687
01:07:04,185 --> 01:07:15,445
(Laughter) But I
don't feel guilty because it's all managed.

688
01:07:15,445 --> 01:07:21,145
If I had come earlier, all these hecklers
would have been there to trouble us.

689
01:07:21,145 --> 01:07:24,205
So all the horrible people disappeared and
we had the right people.

690
01:07:24,205 --> 01:07:27,355
Then I set down through.

691
01:07:27,355 --> 01:07:30,185
I didn't say, "I'm going back."

692
01:07:30,185 --> 01:07:31,225
There is no need to be nervous.

693
01:07:31,225 --> 01:07:36,115
If Mother is late, there must be some plan.

694
01:07:36,115 --> 01:07:39,235
If She is early, there must be some plan.

695
01:07:39,235 --> 01:07:44,985
If She's going by this plane and not by the
other, there must be some plan.

696
01:07:44,985 --> 01:07:47,034
Not to doubt it.

697
01:07:47,034 --> 01:07:49,655
If She's doing something, must be some plan.

698
01:07:49,655 --> 01:07:52,725
You know, Mother has Her own plans.

699
01:07:52,725 --> 01:07:55,945
Is a nice idea to think like that.

700
01:07:55,945 --> 01:08:00,495
"She has Her own plans, you know."

701
01:08:00,495 --> 01:08:08,685
Once you start feeling that way, such security
and such beautiful peace will spread in your

702
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:09,685
being.

703
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:12,054
And you will be quite satisfied.

704
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:16,175
Now, everybody brings food for Me, look at
that.

705
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:22,445
I mean, when I see that I get a fright, baba.

706
01:08:22,445 --> 01:08:27,675
(Laughter) I mean, look at that!

707
01:08:27,675 --> 01:08:35,285
I'm supposed to taste it, but even tasting
will be so much.

708
01:08:35,285 --> 01:08:43,925
(Laughter) But I've to eat, you know, because
if I don't touch one of them, then they will

709
01:08:43,925 --> 01:08:45,405
think, "Why didn't Mother touch?

710
01:08:45,405 --> 01:08:46,405
Must be something wrong."

711
01:08:46,405 --> 01:08:58,725
(Laughter) This is a very big problem for
Me, to keep you happy and to assure you.

712
01:08:58,725 --> 01:09:02,665
But I assure you that I love you all very
much!!

713
01:09:02,665 --> 01:09:07,814
Whether you bring food for Me, or flowers
for Me or anything.

714
01:09:07,814 --> 01:09:09,855
Does not matter.

715
01:09:09,654 --> 01:09:17,083
When I'm leaving Bogota, My heart is wrenching
out, I've seen the wrench of My heart, I've

716
01:09:17,284 --> 01:09:18,284
seen.

717
01:09:18,284 --> 01:09:22,205
Because I'm leaving all the new babes there,
that's all.

718
01:09:22,004 --> 01:09:28,974
Then I just don't want to face, I mean, the
thing, I feel, "Oh God, just see I'm leaving

719
01:09:29,175 --> 01:09:30,175
them."

720
01:09:30,175 --> 01:09:34,205
But, because I love them.

721
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:42,294
So I see, because I love them I feel it, so
it's all right, even this pain is all right, because

722
01:09:42,495 --> 01:09:44,245
I love them.

723
01:09:44,245 --> 01:09:48,895
I enjoy that pain because I love them.

724
01:09:48,895 --> 01:09:52,665
And then I come here and see all of you standing
at the airport.

725
01:09:52,665 --> 01:09:55,415
Whole thing is fulfilled again.

726
01:09:55,415 --> 01:10:04,215
Just not because you have come - because I
have come to love you.

727
01:10:04,215 --> 01:10:10,135
All this is such a beautiful rapport and such
a beautiful feeling.

728
01:10:10,135 --> 01:10:16,935
I want you all to enjoy this and not petty
things and small things which spoil your joy.

729
01:10:16,935 --> 01:10:23,715
These are all joy killers and that's why the
greatest joy killer is the ego nonsensical,

730
01:10:23,715 --> 01:10:28,534
which tells you, "Oh, why didn't Mother do
this or do that?"

731
01:10:28,534 --> 01:10:30,695
It's the ego part of it.

732
01:10:30,695 --> 01:10:35,075
That's why we have to think of Buddha and
celebrate his Jayanti within ourselves to

733
01:10:35,075 --> 01:10:45,565
establish Him to say that, "This ego cannot
take away our joy."

734
01:10:45,565 --> 01:10:51,275
Anywhere such idea just comes into your head
tell them, "Now Mister ego, I know you very

735
01:10:51,275 --> 01:10:52,275
well!"

736
01:10:52,275 --> 01:10:58,415
(Laughter) In the light of Buddha you can
see your ego very clearly.

737
01:10:58,415 --> 01:11:02,314
And He's the killer of your ego, He's the
one who finishes off your ego.

738
01:11:02,314 --> 01:11:11,175
So today we have to pray for the whole of
America which is really suffering from this

739
01:11:11,175 --> 01:11:15,745
nonsensical, mythical ego, which is being
exploited by everyone.

740
01:11:15,745 --> 01:11:21,024
People are befooling them, the media is befooling,
all the doctors are befooling, all the psychologists

741
01:11:21,024 --> 01:11:25,165
are befooling, all the governments are befooling.

742
01:11:25,165 --> 01:11:29,325
I mean, I don't know, everybody is befooled,
because they've got ego.

743
01:11:29,325 --> 01:11:31,915
If they had no ego, they could not have been
befooled.

744
01:11:31,915 --> 01:11:40,145
All these advertisements and all this hocus-pocus
that's going on, is because human beings have

745
01:11:40,145 --> 01:11:44,304
ego and they can't see it.

746
01:11:44,304 --> 01:11:52,605
So we have to say, "Mother, please take away
this curse of ego from Americans and America."

747
01:11:52,605 --> 01:11:57,925
That's why it is nice today we have this Buddha
Puja.

748
01:11:57,925 --> 01:11:59,974
May God bless you!
