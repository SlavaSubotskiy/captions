00:03:43,284 --> 00:03:50,308
Shri Mahavira Puja. Barcelona (Spain), 17 June 1990.

2
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:55,664
Today we are going to do  puja of Mahavira

3
00:06:55,864 --> 00:07:00,277
and we never had this puja before.

4
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:11,835
The reason for this was that

5
00:07:12,036 --> 00:07:18,642
Mahavira’s life was an ascetic’s life,

6
00:07:23,688 --> 00:07:27,617
just like Buddha.

7
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,258
Even more than Buddha it would be

8
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:41,102
because at the time when these two were born,

9
00:07:46,768 --> 00:07:53,360
the Brahminism of the Hinduism had taken a very funny form.

10
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:01,528
People had become extremely ritualistic

11
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:04,687
and they were worshipping all kinds of stones

12
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:10,741
and all kinds of things instead of worshipping only the swayambu.

13
00:08:21,123 --> 00:08:25,441
Who is that fellow eating food at the time.

14
00:08:26,782 --> 00:08:29,793
There is a gentleman who is eating food at the time of a –

15
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:33,486
Please tell him.

16
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:53,881
Let it be, let it be open (the window).

17
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,345
The ascetic life of Mahavira

18
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:05,386
was of a very, very extreme nature.

19
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:22,834
He was the one who was born in a clan of warriors, Kshatriyas,

20
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:31,252
and then He was also married.

21
00:09:34,077 --> 00:09:38,250
Also He had a daughter

22
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:43,039
and then He decided – because He knew He had

23
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:49,030
to do the work of the Divine –

24
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,762
He decided to take a sanyasa.

25
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,250
So He took the permission of His brother,

26
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,703
because His parents were dead.

27
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:08,028
He was a king, so He gave up all His material wealth,

28
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:13,185
everything and He became a complete sanyasi.

29
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:33,235
And He left His family, left His house everything behind

30
00:10:33,435 --> 00:10:40,398
and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms.

31
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:54,104
And the people who joined Him were very few

32
00:10:54,304 --> 00:10:59,574
and He asked them that : “ you have to also become ascetics”, munis.

33
00:11:06,384 --> 00:11:09,964
He was a reincarnation of St. Michael

34
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:18,290
and He resides on the left side

35
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,121
on the Ida Nadi.

36
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:25,574
And He looks after the whole of it,

37
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:30,742
right from Mooladhara onwards up to the Sahasrara.

38
00:11:36,052 --> 00:11:41,171
So St Michael was born as Mahavira,

39
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:49,087
meaning the greatest warrior.

40
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:57,630
But when He was born, the whole place got lot of prosperity.

41
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,987
That’s why He was called as Vardhaman, to begin with.

42
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:16,859
But His asceticism was there because of the Brahminism

43
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:18,978
that was so prevalent in those days,

44
00:12:19,178 --> 00:12:23,827
and people were absolutely drowned into it.

45
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:36,166
After Shri Krishna, these two persons, Buddha and Mahavira,

46
00:12:36,366 --> 00:12:40,402
both of them incarnated in India.

47
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,853
As you know, their history is very far out because

48
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:55,628
they were the children of Rama and they were two twins,

49
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:59,964
called as Lav and Kush.

50
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:11,886
So Rama led a life of a very great king,

51
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:16,125
benevolent king, and of lots of limitations,

52
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:19,325
mariada Purushottama.

53
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:30,947
Because of that, people became extremely serious and

54
00:13:31,147 --> 00:13:40,373
also very closed, because of Rama’s following.

55
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:49,410
Of course after every incarnation,

56
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,974
as they do not get their Realization, they get deviated

57
00:13:53,174 --> 00:13:57,967
and start going to the extremes of everything.

58
00:14:04,526 --> 00:14:10,326
So they went to the extremes and became very, very much –

59
00:14:10,526 --> 00:14:13,909
sort of quiet people wouldn’t talk to anyone

60
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:16,996
and would be very formal sort of people,

61
00:14:17,196 --> 00:14:22,379
because that was the life Rama had to live, lead.

62
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:36,557
And because Rama left His wife, many people at that time

63
00:14:36,757 --> 00:14:42,162
felt that wife is not to be paid so much attention to.

64
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:55,232
So Shri Krishna came. Actually Rama took birth as Shri Krishna

65
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:58,432
to overcome these conditionings.

66
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:10,404
And He said, “All this is leela. This is all a play.”

67
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:17,565
And that it is a play and you should have pure heart

68
00:15:17,765 --> 00:15:20,485
and you can play about.

69
00:15:20,685 --> 00:15:24,485
There is, as long as you have pure character,

70
00:15:24,685 --> 00:15:30,162
nothing can go wrong if you mix up with people freely.

71
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,081
So after Shri Krishna, people started becoming

72
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:47,869
very licentious and permissive

73
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:58,622
and they created poems and things of Krishna’s love stories,

74
00:15:58,822 --> 00:16:02,309
which was all false.

75
00:16:06,618 --> 00:16:10,450
Because He lived with Radha at the age of five or six years,

76
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,563
and with the, in the Gokul.

77
00:16:19,301 --> 00:16:24,331
So all these false stories about Him were used

78
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:29,318
for the licentiousness of the people.

79
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:41,271
So now, the situation was such, that the whole place

80
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:46,542
was getting completely drowned into immorality.

81
00:16:51,987 --> 00:16:54,746
The priests, the Brahmins themselves, had become

82
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:57,786
extremely immoral and

83
00:16:57,986 --> 00:17:03,343
were indulging into all kinds of corrupt practices.

84
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,182
Not only that, but they took to tantric,

85
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:22,751
tantric manifestations of using spirits and things like that,

86
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:33,482
and became very self-indulgent.

87
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:42,966
At that time Buddha, Lord Buddha and Mahavira were born

88
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:53,084
to de-condition people

89
00:17:53,284 --> 00:17:57,625
from this kind of an extreme behaviour,

90
00:18:02,773 --> 00:18:05,731
because whatever the incarnations tried,

91
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:10,550
people always went to the extremes.

92
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:20,293
So they found out that people were very much indulgent

93
00:18:20,493 --> 00:18:27,660
in killing animals and eating flesh all the time

94
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:35,260
and if you eat too much of flesh and all that you become

95
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,285
right sided personality

96
00:18:42,926 --> 00:18:47,854
and so then you become very aggressive

97
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:54,564
and start killing others.

98
00:18:56,389 --> 00:19:00,715
Moreover the people who were very much attached to their family

99
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:04,168
or to their children and all that

100
00:19:04,368 --> 00:19:10,312
would not do the work of the Divine

101
00:19:18,685 --> 00:19:23,778
and it was a very intensive work which He had to do.

102
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,564
So He made very strict rules as Moses did.

103
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:40,262
He said that nobody should kill

104
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:43,891
any animal and eat it first of all.

105
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:56,291
Those who are becoming the munis or the bhikshus

106
00:19:56,491 --> 00:20:00,973
should not even go on any bullock cart;

107
00:20:01,173 --> 00:20:05,903
should walk bare feet; should not even wear shoes.

108
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:14,794
They should shave their head completely;

109
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:19,429
should have only three changes, three dresses

110
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:25,346
with them of a big tunic-like thing.

111
00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:35,873
Whether it is sun or rain, they should not use any umbrellas.

112
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:46,319
They should eat before six o’clock; before the sun sets.

113
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:53,277
They should sleep only for five hours

114
00:20:55,563 --> 00:20:59,371
and all the time meditate and ascend

115
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:04,283
and then try to do the work of the Divine.

116
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:13,794
Then only they can do the work of the Divine.

117
00:21:17,564 --> 00:21:22,571
After they get their Realization that, He called as Kevalagyan,

118
00:21:22,771 --> 00:21:27,898
only the knowledge, only knowledge, means pure knowledge.

119
00:21:33,406 --> 00:21:35,793
They will develop Samvaddharshan means

120
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:40,057
integrated personality .

121
00:21:43,787 --> 00:21:48,724
and all the collective consciousness He talked of all, all these things

122
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:53,169
but as He belonged to the left side,

123
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:58,448
He has described hell very clearly.

124
00:22:03,703 --> 00:22:09,394
Fundamentally, basically there are fourteen hells according to Him

125
00:22:13,156 --> 00:22:19,744
and is horrible to read all that what He has described about hell.

126
00:22:23,332 --> 00:22:25,512
Because He wanted to tell people that

127
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:30,418
if you do all these wrong things you will go to hell

128
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,794
and He talked about, not about form, formly God,

129
00:22:40,994 --> 00:22:45,234
but formless God,

130
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:54,158
because He didn’t want people to again start ritualism

131
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:59,952
but get to right, right to the position

132
00:23:00,152 --> 00:23:05,207
where they could get their Self Realization to cleanse themselves.

133
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:14,946
So you can imagine how difficult in those days at Mahavira

134
00:23:15,146 --> 00:23:22,560
was even to be one of the candidates for Self-realization.

135
00:23:29,703 --> 00:23:33,341
It’s frightening for you.

136
00:23:35,198 --> 00:23:41,998
That’s why I never had this puja.

137
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:48,678
Because to do all these things first of all

138
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:51,411
and to become absolutely pure,

139
00:23:51,611 --> 00:23:55,722
then only He would give realization.

140
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,027
I wonder how many got realization.

141
00:24:05,227 --> 00:24:11,767
But the way He made rules for people was so strict.

142
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:22,414
Nobody would have followed Him.

143
00:24:22,614 --> 00:24:25,564
But He told them about the hell in which they will go

144
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:29,336
if they don’t follow.

145
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:38,159
So they were so frightened that they joined Him

146
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:43,126
and started following Jainism. ‘Jain’ means ‘the one who has known,

147
00:24:43,326 --> 00:24:47,882
who is enlightened, gnayan.’

148
00:24:55,148 --> 00:24:58,749
Is the, the same word is gnayan means ‘to know.’

149
00:24:58,949 --> 00:25:02,561
‘Ja’ – it means ‘to know.’

150
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,527
Just like the Jews. Is the same word

151
00:25:08,727 --> 00:25:12,917
is the ‘Jew’ means also ‘the one who knows.’

152
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:19,210
Moses also did the same.

153
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:23,518
He didn’t say that you should not eat meat

154
00:25:23,718 --> 00:25:28,065
but He said that if anybody is found with another woman

155
00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:31,741
he should be killed.

156
00:25:37,093 --> 00:25:43,337
The Muslims as they follow Sharia is made by Moses for the Jews

157
00:25:43,537 --> 00:25:49,235
because they had become so self-indulgent.

158
00:25:51,846 --> 00:25:55,834
The Sharia that is followed by Muslims

159
00:25:56,034 --> 00:26:00,200
is made by Moses for the Jews

160
00:26:06,772 --> 00:26:09,612
because when He brought those ten commandments

161
00:26:09,812 --> 00:26:12,932
He found the Jews were indulging into

162
00:26:13,132 --> 00:26:17,156
all kinds of nonsensical things.

163
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:25,002
But Jews very nicely put it on the shelf

164
00:26:25,202 --> 00:26:28,956
and the Muslims took to it.

165
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:40,822
So now this Mahavira style went to the extreme as usual

166
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:49,526
even Lord Buddha’s same thing.

167
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,084
Mahavira was the one who said that

168
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:59,536
you should not kill any animal,

169
00:26:59,736 --> 00:27:06,153
so now in India we have people who are absolutely abstaining

170
00:27:06,353 --> 00:27:10,845
from even killing bugs and killing even mosquitoes.

171
00:27:20,465 --> 00:27:23,684
How far human beings can go to stupidity

172
00:27:23,884 --> 00:27:27,686
can be seen from this.

173
00:27:33,257 --> 00:27:37,694
Nowadays there’s a custom, very common in India,

174
00:27:37,894 --> 00:27:40,282
that they take get hold of a Brahmin,

175
00:27:40,482 --> 00:27:45,016
put him in a hut and put all the bugs inside

176
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:58,421
and when these bugs have got completely, have got completely,

177
00:27:58,621 --> 00:28:02,808
fed up with the drinking of the blood of this Brahmin

178
00:28:03,008 --> 00:28:06,008
they just drop out.

179
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:14,124
Then this Brahmin is paid a big amount by the Jains

180
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:17,837
who have lots of money.

181
00:28:23,988 --> 00:28:28,235
They are vegetarians to such an extent

182
00:28:28,435 --> 00:28:32,227
that they don’t want to go to the bathroom,

183
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:35,353
but they’ll go on some sort of a open space

184
00:28:35,553 --> 00:28:38,942
that no animal should die.

185
00:28:47,573 --> 00:28:51,796
Such ridiculous things they do

186
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:59,423
and in the, in all doing all this abstinence and all that

187
00:28:59,623 --> 00:29:03,671
they are extremely money oriented.

188
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:11,754
Jains are just like Jews in India.

189
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:17,816
Jains and Jews are the same in their money orientation.

190
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:26,997
So the Jains won’t kill even a bug or a mosquito

191
00:29:27,197 --> 00:29:32,145
but they don’t mind harassing a man up to his death

192
00:29:32,345 --> 00:29:35,876
for their two rupees.

193
00:29:46,093 --> 00:29:52,461
So this extreme temperament is seen in every religion

194
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,070
and that comes because human beings start moving like

195
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:05,422
a pendulum from one end to another.

196
00:30:09,134 --> 00:30:13,039
An incarnation comes and tries to bring them in the center

197
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,840
but again they start moving on the other side.

198
00:30:22,024 --> 00:30:24,046
They cannot remain in the center.

199
00:30:24,246 --> 00:30:28,040
This is the problem of the human beings

200
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:35,313
and this is why all religions look so funny.

201
00:30:40,224 --> 00:30:42,929
When you see the way the Jains are,

202
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:45,659
I mean, you are surprised and

203
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:51,374
can’t believe how stupid they are; educated people, doctors,

204
00:30:58,413 --> 00:31:03,485
but they never know that, they never understand that they are stupid.

205
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,737
So this is the story of Mahavira

206
00:31:09,937 --> 00:31:14,380
where He has tried to bring in a kind...

207
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,896
(…) you will please sit down. Who is that lady?

208
00:31:17,096 --> 00:31:19,523
Don’t move around.

209
00:31:19,723 --> 00:31:22,007
You shouldn’t get up and walk when I am talking.

210
00:31:22,207 --> 00:31:24,286
All right? Tell her.

211
00:31:24,487 --> 00:31:26,309
They are eating, they are walking about.

212
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:31,223
Will you please tell the Spanish to behave themselves.

213
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:47,044
When I started Sahaja Yoga if I’d started like Mahavira

214
00:31:47,244 --> 00:31:50,998
how many would have joined Me?

215
00:31:57,838 --> 00:32:00,136
Even when we have raised the Kundalini,

216
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:05,910
you have got your Realization there is not much of detachment.

217
00:32:14,645 --> 00:32:17,508
Sanyassi meant that he had nothing to do with his wife,

218
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:21,350
nothing to do with his children, nothing to do with his family

219
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:26,518
or house or anything possessions, no possessions.

220
00:32:32,883 --> 00:32:36,093
But...

221
00:32:59,004 --> 00:33:01,004
And...

222
00:33:07,174 --> 00:33:13,668
They were given such a little to eat

223
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:16,938
without any, just boiled food,

224
00:33:17,138 --> 00:33:24,646
just boiled and such strict order.

225
00:33:36,287 --> 00:33:41,476
But in Sahaja Yoga I have first of all raised your Kundalini

226
00:33:41,676 --> 00:33:44,429
without telling you any ritual,

227
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:48,525
any what you can call strictness or anything about it.

228
00:33:48,725 --> 00:33:53,256
Just whatever you are, all right, get your Realization.

229
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:07,957
And I thought that by raising the Kundalini, by Self Realization,

230
00:34:08,157 --> 00:34:12,679
I need not tell them about hell.

231
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:19,175
Only by that, they will become quite detached and wise.

232
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:30,819
But even now what you find is that there are people

233
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:38,239
who get married in Sahaja Yoga and just get lost.

234
00:34:45,675 --> 00:34:48,528
Either the wife dominates or the husband dominates

235
00:34:48,728 --> 00:34:53,561
or both of them get completely lost.

236
00:34:59,413 --> 00:35:03,181
Normally in the western countries as soon as they get married,

237
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:08,461
first second day they start quarrelling

238
00:35:12,888 --> 00:35:17,499
and within one week they start talking about divorce.

239
00:35:20,274 --> 00:35:23,010
But in Sahaja Yoga when they get married

240
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:27,996
they just get attached to each other like glue you see.

241
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:36,689
Then there is no other interest left all the time thinking

242
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:41,546
of wife, wife, wife or husband, husband, husband,

243
00:35:46,966 --> 00:35:50,813
someone to go for honeymoon, someone to do it

244
00:35:51,013 --> 00:35:55,386
in a very big way with a reception and things.

245
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:05,079
The importance is given so much,

246
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:07,492
that it is unbelievable that

247
00:36:07,692 --> 00:36:10,977
whatever things we have left to come to Sahaja Yoga

248
00:36:11,178 --> 00:36:15,536
have become multi-fold

249
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,150
and this marriage system that we have started in India

250
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:31,213
is becoming a headache to Me now.

251
00:36:35,665 --> 00:36:38,954
Either they fight as usual and divorce

252
00:36:39,154 --> 00:36:45,106
or they get glued together. There’s nothing in-between.

253
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:55,980
They don’t understand that they have married for Sahaja Yoga

254
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:07,400
and they have to use marriage for Sahaja Yog only.

255
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:21,933
But this attitude of Sahaja yogis is very surprising,

256
00:37:22,133 --> 00:37:25,227
because I always felt after Self Realization

257
00:37:25,427 --> 00:37:30,558
they will be automatically sanyassis from within.

258
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:44,297
They will themselves be like Mahavira’s disciples,

259
00:37:48,676 --> 00:37:56,438
but what I find is that still they are always falling back into

260
00:37:56,638 --> 00:38:02,711
 the same ocean from which they have come on to the boat.

261
00:38:08,608 --> 00:38:12,224
For example, now somebody was fond of seeing films

262
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:17,011
or, say, football, of all the things football.

263
00:38:19,368 --> 00:38:22,047
So they are still busy with football.

264
00:38:22,247 --> 00:38:25,897
It's become a craze with football,

265
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:34,252
or a picnic or a holiday or a sea resort.

266
00:38:40,022 --> 00:38:44,853
After Realization how can you enjoy these things so much?

267
00:38:49,123 --> 00:38:54,318
That means you have not touched that depth within you yet.

268
00:39:00,032 --> 00:39:02,910
Your depth of joy you have not yet touched.

269
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,466
Still you have to touch it. Once you have touched that

270
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:11,753
you really don’t care for anything. Just don’t bother for anything.

271
00:39:17,377 --> 00:39:22,980
You are so self-contented you just enjoy your Self.

272
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:35,894
But I do not know if I should tell you about hell

273
00:39:36,094 --> 00:39:40,264
and frighten you, or I should put restrictions on you,

274
00:39:40,464 --> 00:39:47,391
but this is the one, Mahavira’s puja, I have been avoiding…

275
00:39:47,591 --> 00:39:50,591
so far.

276
00:40:00,684 --> 00:40:06,684
Even the ladies have to take out all their hair

277
00:40:08,766 --> 00:40:16,432
and wear only white one sari and one blouse, that’s all.

278
00:40:19,976 --> 00:40:23,808
No shoes

279
00:40:24,008 --> 00:40:30,939
and also had to walk. Never get into a bullock cart,

280
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:34,909
leave alone cars.

281
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:42,333
They had to get up at four o’clock, have their food till six only

282
00:40:42,533 --> 00:40:46,168
and then sleep off.

283
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,715
There is forty days purgation

284
00:40:55,915 --> 00:41:00,603
when you have to only live on water, only water.

285
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:09,749
Now in Sahaja Yoga it’s the other way round, it’s all enjoyment.

286
00:41:12,741 --> 00:41:15,087
You enjoy everything. You enjoy each other’s company.

287
00:41:15,287 --> 00:41:19,755
You enjoy music. There’s all enjoyment for you.

288
00:41:22,803 --> 00:41:26,846
But without touching your inner enjoyment you cannot,

289
00:41:27,046 --> 00:41:30,322
you cannot ascend. You must touch your inner enjoyment

290
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:34,534
and then enjoy everything else.

291
00:41:43,652 --> 00:41:48,246
And any hard word said, even one word said hard

292
00:41:48,446 --> 00:41:52,023
they had to repent and go on fast for days together

293
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:56,804
for saying one harsh word.

294
00:42:02,864 --> 00:42:06,164
But here people go, suddenly I find they are walking nicely

295
00:42:06,364 --> 00:42:09,791
and suddenly they get onto the horse of a ego

296
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:13,878
and start jumping on others.

297
00:42:20,036 --> 00:42:23,329
The whole, see is so jocular I tell you.

298
00:42:23,529 --> 00:42:26,965
I just watch suddenly what was, he was a nice fellow walking

299
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:29,043
just now. Suddenly what has happened to him?

300
00:42:29,243 --> 00:42:32,766
Suddenly he started behaving like this.

301
00:42:38,179 --> 00:42:40,932
I never wanted to frighten you about the hell

302
00:42:41,132 --> 00:42:44,994
but there is hell I must say.

303
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:55,035
And so one has to go deeper into your own enjoyment

304
00:42:55,235 --> 00:42:59,442
so that there is complete contentment.

305
00:43:07,553 --> 00:43:10,081
So the things that are said about Mahavira

306
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:13,572
are taken to the extreme that one day He was meditating

307
00:43:13,772 --> 00:43:16,680
and He had only one piece of cloth on Him

308
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,231
wrapped with a dhoti

309
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:23,589
and He had covered Himself up with one piece of cloth.

310
00:43:30,916 --> 00:43:33,415
So when He was coming out of His meditation

311
00:43:33,615 --> 00:43:39,867
His cloth got entangled with some bush.

312
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:44,586
So He had to take off half of it.

313
00:43:52,998 --> 00:43:58,039
Then Krishna came to tease Him as an, as a

314
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:01,985
what do you call, a beggar.

315
00:44:06,437 --> 00:44:09,689
And He said, “You are a king and You can always get

316
00:44:09,889 --> 00:44:12,110
something cloth but I am shivering,

317
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:17,021
so why don’t You give Me this piece of cloth that You have.”

318
00:44:23,045 --> 00:44:25,684
So He gave Him His cloth

319
00:44:25,884 --> 00:44:29,557
and covered Himself with some leaves and went into His palace

320
00:44:29,757 --> 00:44:32,216
and changed Himself.

321
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:36,523
Into His house and changed His clothes.

322
00:44:42,698 --> 00:44:45,180
So these horrible Jains

323
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,031
make His complete nude photographs so huge.

324
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:51,927
Hundred and fifty feet height nude

325
00:44:52,127 --> 00:44:57,479
absolutely nude into details they work it out, stupid things.

326
00:45:07,146 --> 00:45:09,523
And there are followers of His, so called,

327
00:45:09,723 --> 00:45:12,502
He never had such followers but they call themselves

328
00:45:12,702 --> 00:45:14,623
as degambaras.

329
00:45:14,823 --> 00:45:18,484
Means they do not have cloth but their cloth is all the directions

330
00:45:18,684 --> 00:45:24,089
degambar, directions are their cloth,

331
00:45:31,235 --> 00:45:34,789
and they’ll walk on the street, walk everywhere in the villages

332
00:45:34,989 --> 00:45:38,728
absolutely nude.

333
00:45:42,053 --> 00:45:49,145
I mean horrible things people do in the name of Mahavira.

334
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:56,231
Now as you have got realization

335
00:45:56,431 --> 00:46:00,618
I am sure you won’t go to that extreme.

336
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:12,540
But still you must learn to have self-discipline.

337
00:46:16,143 --> 00:46:21,676
If you have no self-discipline you cannot jump into that depth,

338
00:46:21,876 --> 00:46:27,845
where there is complete kavalyan, means absolute knowledge,

339
00:46:28,045 --> 00:46:33,886
absolute love and absolute joy.

340
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,039
So this self-disciplining is very important.

341
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:51,198
Of course, you need not go to the Mahavira’s extent now,

342
00:46:51,398 --> 00:46:54,321
because luckily I have given you Realization

343
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:59,656
but still do not go back to things, which you have left.

344
00:47:07,185 --> 00:47:09,441
As men also do stupid things

345
00:47:09,641 --> 00:47:12,509
also women do it in Sahaja Yoga which is surprising.

346
00:47:12,709 --> 00:47:19,067
People told me that they carry so many make-ups with them to India.

347
00:47:27,093 --> 00:47:31,385
What is the use? I just don’t understand.

348
00:47:31,585 --> 00:47:35,888
To, to I mean for Indians it is useless

349
00:47:36,088 --> 00:47:39,173
and it is absolutely useless for you also.

350
00:47:39,373 --> 00:47:43,030
You are saints. There is no need to load yourselves

351
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:47,664
with so many things unnecessarily.

352
00:47:54,132 --> 00:47:56,620
So if you again indulge into the same nonsense

353
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,691
that you have been doing; going to the hairdresser,

354
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:03,136
looking funny in the hair, all sorts of things if you do,

355
00:48:03,336 --> 00:48:08,101
then what’s the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga?

356
00:48:13,649 --> 00:48:16,494
Or following any fashion and these things.

357
00:48:16,694 --> 00:48:19,288
If you have to do the same thing again and again

358
00:48:19,488 --> 00:48:23,901
it is better, you don’t come to Sahaja Yog.

359
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:32,246
That’s all I can say. I cannot say like Mahavira that:

360
00:48:32,446 --> 00:48:36,563
‘you shave your hair,’ or ‘you wear just a white sari.’

361
00:48:36,763 --> 00:48:41,398
But I can only say that: ‘try to detach yourself.’

362
00:48:50,274 --> 00:48:52,812
I was sure with My experiment, that people

363
00:48:53,012 --> 00:48:58,457
when they get Realization gradually they’ll get detached

364
00:49:04,351 --> 00:49:06,843
and you all have to co-operate with Me:

365
00:49:07,043 --> 00:49:11,068
to see where is your attention.

366
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:20,226
What are we doing the whole day?

367
00:49:20,426 --> 00:49:24,274
What have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

368
00:49:24,474 --> 00:49:29,609
How many people we have given Realization?

369
00:49:30,228 --> 00:49:35,213
Everything seems to be important but Sahaja Yog.

370
00:49:38,736 --> 00:49:43,769
But Mahavira’s day people did not do any jobs, nothing.

371
00:49:43,969 --> 00:49:51,056
They had to live in jungles, they had to beg for their food

372
00:50:04,018 --> 00:50:08,645
and that’s how this Jainism has spread.

373
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:17,151
But what sort of a Jainism it is I have told you already.

374
00:50:20,613 --> 00:50:23,325
So unless and until you touch your depth

375
00:50:23,525 --> 00:50:26,397
you’ll become like any other religion,

376
00:50:26,597 --> 00:50:35,075
because you won’t be actually Sahaja Yogis, just nominal.

377
00:50:46,408 --> 00:50:50,034
So we have to work in such a manner that

378
00:50:50,234 --> 00:50:54,559
we understand ourselves and we understand our attention

379
00:50:54,759 --> 00:50:59,624
and we try to ascend.

380
00:51:06,356 --> 00:51:10,113
I don’t have to tell you. You yourself have to work it out

381
00:51:10,313 --> 00:51:12,791
in such a manner that you touch your depth

382
00:51:12,991 --> 00:51:18,610
and you become an ascetic within yourself.

383
00:51:24,943 --> 00:51:32,585
Then only you will be really doing the Divine work properly

384
00:51:32,785 --> 00:51:37,154
with proper understanding.

385
00:51:43,004 --> 00:51:47,264
Sahaja Yoga is the integration of all these great prophets

386
00:51:47,464 --> 00:51:51,798
and these incarnations.

387
00:51:57,508 --> 00:52:01,052
So I have to tell you that, whatever were your conditionings

388
00:52:01,252 --> 00:52:03,546
and all that, to get rid of them,

389
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:08,477
you must get out of this ocean of illusion.

390
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:22,454
So this is the only thing I can just now say about Mahavira

391
00:52:22,654 --> 00:52:26,906
but lots can be said because of the, He deals with the past.

392
00:52:27,106 --> 00:52:32,518
All His past lives and everything are described,

393
00:52:40,613 --> 00:52:42,961
but that is not so important. What is important

394
00:52:43,161 --> 00:52:47,034
is what is today the present.

395
00:52:50,688 --> 00:52:53,662
I hope My lecture goes into your head

396
00:52:53,862 --> 00:52:58,386
and settles into your heart

397
00:53:02,925 --> 00:53:07,297
and you understand what you have to do about yourself,

398
00:53:07,497 --> 00:53:12,614
about your ascent. You have to be genuine people.

399
00:53:17,733 --> 00:53:22,730
Then only it is going to show results in the whole world.

400
00:53:30,278 --> 00:53:34,902
I hope you will pass this tape to all the people

401
00:53:35,102 --> 00:53:41,451
so they should know why I didn’t have Mahavira’s Puja all these years.

402
00:53:48,942 --> 00:53:52,911
May God bless you all!
