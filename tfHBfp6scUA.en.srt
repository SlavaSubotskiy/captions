1
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,240
Today it's such a pleasure to be here again,

2
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,920
in Brighton;

3
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,880
and, slowly and steadily, I find

4
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,040
Sahaja Yoga is settling down in this place.

5
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,640
When I first came to Brighton just to visit,

6
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,880
I felt there must be many seekers in this place,

7
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,600
who might have been lost

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,640
and always had a great hope

9
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,840
that one day they will be able to come to reality.

10
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,120
Today specially is a very great day

11
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,320
because today is the birthday of Lord Buddha.

12
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,600
And in the morning, I talked to Sahaja Yogis

13
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,560
about His great incarnation,

14
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,520
and how He came on this earth

15
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,200
and He got His realization,

16
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,600
and then how He tried to spread

17
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,800
the message of realizations to others.

18
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,680
Many people believe and think

19
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,480
that Christ was an atheist … Buddha was an atheist,

20
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,680
while Christ was a person, believer in God.

21
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,600
And some people prefer Buddha to Jesus Christ.

22
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,720
It's something very amazing is that …

23
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,000
that when the people are born

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,440
in the particular circumstances,

25
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,320
they have to talk about things

26
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,720
which are very, very important at that point of time.

27
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,600
At the time when Buddha came on this earth in India,

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,160
we had too many ritualism of Brahmanism

29
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,360
and conditioning of the teachings

30
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,800
of those money-makers and commercializers

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,160
who wanted to make money in the name of God

32
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,800
and in the name of religion.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,320
So, to neutralize all that,

34
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:25,040
He decided not to talk at all, at all about

35
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,080
God,

36
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,840
about any particular religious ways,

37
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,160
but He said that you keep to the middle path of life,

38
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,160
eightfold middle path of life,

39
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,280
and that you first get your Self-realization.

40
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,480
To Him it was very important that one should get Self-realization.

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And that's what

42
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,200
He wanted to give as a message

43
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,480
and divert the attention of the people

44
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,960
from the idea of God or incarnation —

45
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,440
for the time being —

46
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,720
because He wanted to show that Self-realization is very important

47
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,280
and that without Self-realization you cannot understand God

48
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,480
or Divine Power.

49
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,920
So He was not an atheist.

50
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,080
He and Christ, I would say, were in a way contemporary,

51
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,280
but Christ came later,

52
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,280
and Buddha came about five hundred years before Christ.

53
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,200
They are so much related to each other,

54
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,840
so much close to each other,

55
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,400
so much identified with each other,

56
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,800
as if they are part and parcel of one being.

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,600
That only you can understand when you get your Self-realization.

58
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,000
Christ has said: “Those who are not against Me are with Me.”

59
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,400
Who are “those”, who are not against Him?

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,040
Because we have no knowledge as to real the origin of Christ,

61
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,640
from where He came, what was His origin,

62
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,880
how He was created in the heaven,

63
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,680
how He is the Son of God.

64
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,640
Whatever we see today as a person who came on this earth

65
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,200
to teach us about His father, God Almighty,

66
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,680
we just believe into that part,

67
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,880
which is a very limited part of Christ,

68
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,800
and Bible cannot contain that great personality.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,760
In the same way, Buddha has been dumped

70
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,920
into very small dimensions.

71
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,840
Only two persons realized it; they got out of it.

72
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,400
One of them was Viditama,

73
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,920
who went away to Japan and started the Zen system of religion.

74
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,240
But even today if you see the Zen,

75
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,120
which was nothing but dhyana, the meditation,

76
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,360
sahaja, spontaneous awakening —

77
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,760
is reduced to the same level as any other preaching.

78
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,440
I met the head of the Zen system.

79
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,640
He was very sick, and they brought him to Me

80
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,600
because he wanted to be cured.

81
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,320
And I was amazed that, not that he was a realized soul,

82
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,880
not at all a realized soul — but his Kundalini, which is the force

83
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,960
which is going to give him realization was all frozen.

84
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,880
And he had no desire to become self-realized.

85
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,360
I talked to him, I was amazed.

86
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,400
And I said, “How is it,

87
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,680
that according to Zen you have to be a kashyapa?”

88
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,560
Kashyapa means a person who is a realized soul.

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,760
That's the name of the university, as I told you yesterday in Lewes,

90
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,720
is the name of the university is kashyapa:

91
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,360
those who have no university,

92
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,680
in the sense, those who have the university of God.

93
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,360
So he said, “Oh, that's over now,

94
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,160
God is not making anybody kashyapas now.

95
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,800
Only from the sixth to the eighth century,

96
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,040
in two hundred years, there were only twenty-six kashyapas,

97
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,960
after that there were none. And I don't hope to be one.”

98
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,440
I said, “Why not?”

99
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,640
He said, “No, I have no hopes about it,

100
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,680
I'm just now appointed as the head of Zen, so I'm there,

101
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,840
but we don't get kashyapas these days at all.”

102
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,440
So with that he doomed all the hopes

103
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,280
of all the people to become Zen,

104
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,440
to become person who knows,

105
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,040
person who is a realized soul.

106
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,440
This one was very shocking to Me

107
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,000
because Zen is something so great.

108
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,560
There's so much expressive of Sahaja Yoga.

109
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,720
You cannot understand Zen unless and until you are a realized soul.

110
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,240
Even Bible you can't understand, you can't understand Gita,

111
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,080
you can't understand anything

112
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,080
unless and until you are a realized soul.

113
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,280
The second person who really emerged out of it,

114
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,000
all this ritualism and all that

115
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,480
that they had created out of Buddha's life,

116
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,400
was Lao Tze,

117
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,600
who preached about Tao.

118
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,640
Tao is the all-pervading Divine Power.

119
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,520
Power of love.

120
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,800
When He talked about it, He explained about it,

121
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,400
and He started another group of people,

122
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,240
who were to be given realization.

123
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,720
But that also today, I find, has become “Tao-ism”.

124
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,400
Everything becomes “ism” — means “imprisoned”.

125
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,160
It's not living, it's not there,

126
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,640
it's just a thought of Tao people read.

127
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,680
I have seen people … there's one gentleman in India

128
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,400
who has written a complete book on Tao.

129
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,840
He's not even a realized soul.

130
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,800
What is he writing? I was just wondering, with his blind eyes,

131
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,600
what is he describing, what colors can he describe?

132
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,600
So you must know that you have to be self-realized first.

133
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,280
Then see for yourself.

134
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,440
Then you will know whether there is spirit or not,

135
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,680
then you will know whether there are roots

136
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,800
to this tree that has grown outside,

137
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,840
then you will know where there is God or not.

138
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,960
Then you will know what these incarnations

139
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,280
have any meaning or not.

140
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,800
Just before that just to sit down and criticize

141
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,440
is not a sensible thing.

142
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,600
That's why Buddha … who occupies a very special place

143
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,440
within our being itself, He resides on this side.

144
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,960
This is the place where our ego is attached,

145
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,960
and He is the one who really controls our ego.

146
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,360
So this Buddha

147
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,720
also is such a part and parcel,

148
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,240
is to be understood only after you have got realization.

149
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,240
Without that you are still incomplete.

150
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,920
You are not that by which you will know.

151
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,720
Like Krishna has said: “Atmanyevatmana tushtah” [BhG 2-55].

152
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,080
Through the atma, through the spirit only you are going to know God.

153
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,520
Not through with this mental projection,

154
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,840
with these eyes, with these senses but through the spirit.

155
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,160
And where is the spirit within us?

156
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,360
The spirit lies in our heart

157
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,160
and is the reflection of God Almighty.

158
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,800
It's called as a kshetragya,

159
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,080
means “the one who knows the field of our action”.

160
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,960
The one who sees what we are doing,

161
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,440
who is the witness of what we are doing.

162
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,840
But He is not in our attention.

163
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,520
That gentleman wants to come, please come.

164
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,680
He is not in our attention.

165
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,760
And if He is not in our attention,

166
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,480
we do not know how to connect

167
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,160
ourselves with Him to have a rapport with Him,

168
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,000
to understand Him.

169
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,600
That's why first this spirit has to be brought in our own attention.

170
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,960
That's the most important thing,

171
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,240
and because this is not with us,

172
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,640
we are still incomplete, we make mistakes.

173
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,280
Because the absolute thing that is within us is the spirit,

174
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,040
while we live on a relative world.

175
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,360
Today somebody comes and says to  you all right.

176
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,680
Just now, when we were coming, there was a gentleman

177
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,520
who handed over a card to Me,

178
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,000
about … something about Christ.

179
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,640
He's telling Me about Christ, I really must laugh at it.

180
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,200
But supposing tomorrow Christ comes and stands before you;

181
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,440
will you be able to recognize Him, or will you crucify Him again?

182
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,040
How will you recognize Him? How will you recognize Buddha?

183
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,240
Have you got sensitivity to know who is Christ?

184
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,320
It's very easy to, you see, to represent Christ,

185
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,280
it's very easy because they think

186
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,360
that, after all, you see, everybody has a right to do what they like.

187
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,480
Even Hitler talked of God, can you imagine?

188
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,800
Hitler talked of God!

189
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,360
Everyone thinks he has got right to talk of God, to describe Him!

190
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,680
But first of all you must know

191
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,120
that no use deceiving ourselves,

192
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,520
we have to get our Self-realization.

193
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,600
We have to know ourselves first of all.

194
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,040
Now, Buddha's attitude towards His attainment was

195
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,560
that He was actually

196
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,320
touched by the miseries of the world.

197
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:54,520
He saw a person who was sick. He saw a man who was dead.

198
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,640
He saw an old man. All these things worked on His mind,

199
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,120
and He started thinking: “Why these miseries are there?”

200
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,880
So the whole search came

201
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:14,080
through the understanding for others.

202
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,640
That takes too much time because you have to go on neutralizing:

203
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,920
“Not this, not this, not wife, not children, not family…”

204
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,680
You go on negating, negating, negating;

205
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,240
all your lives you go on, one after another. Doesn't work out.

206
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,200
The other way is simpler — could be …

207
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,000
which of course by Buddha's attainment only

208
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,000
has been made even better …

209
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,000
all of them have done something for us within ourselves —

210
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,680
that first we look after ourselves,

211
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,480
find out about ourselves.

212
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,640
Are we realized souls?

213
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,840
Are we Buddhas?

214
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,960
Are we the people who know?

215
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,880
Let us be honest.

216
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,720
Then we have to know.

217
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,920
Now, what is the way to know is the point.

218
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Now, if I say that you will know — in your evolutionary process.

219
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,280
As you have evolved to be a human being, you will be evolved

220
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,000
to be a realized soul.

221
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,840
But there's a little difference as to what has happened so far

222
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,800
and what is going to happen later on.

223
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,520
So far, we have been evolved

224
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,400
through a method which was beyond

225
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,080
our freedom.

226
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,680
The nature worked it out, the nature within us,

227
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,160
the central force of evolution within us

228
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,880
has brought us to this position that from amoeba

229
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,320
today we are human beings.

230
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,640
But at this stage, when we are human beings,

231
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:20,840
to go further, there's a special mechanism.

232
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,840
Like, till to make this instrument,

233
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,520
we had to use other instruments to make it.

234
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,120
Now, once the instrument is just ready,

235
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,320
we have to just plug this one to the mains, and it's done.

236
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,120
As if you are made

237
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,960
to be ready

238
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,200
to be plugged to the all-pervading Power;

239
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:59,400
and by some special, spontaneous method

240
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,200
done by the living force within us,

241
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,240
we have to be plugged to the mains.

242
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,040
But the difference

243
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:19,240
between a human being and other animals

244
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,040
is this that human beings were given their freedom.

245
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,960
At the stage of, say, Adam and Eve,

246
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,640
if people would not have gone too far with their freedom,

247
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,920
it would have been much easier

248
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,920
to give realization to people at that time.

249
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,600
But when freedom is given,

250
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,120
then people misuse it. Or, they want to use it.

251
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,840
They don't want to obey, because to obey means, they think,

252
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,160
there is no freedom.

253
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,160
And that's how, when they started using their freedom,

254
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,640
they had to do things which were wrong,

255
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:12,280
which were anti-life, which were anti-evolution,

256
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,360
without realizing what they were doing.

257
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,360
When it reached the stage

258
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,200
when people found that was wrong, they gave it up.

259
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,520
Then another thing they tried,

260
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,280
it was like an error being corrected.

261
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,240
Then they corrected it.

262
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,600
That's how human beings have been trying,

263
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,040
experimenting with this, experimenting with that;

264
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,280
and then they come to a point where they say, “Given up now,

265
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,160
it's too much.”

266
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,560
That's the best point, I think, as Buddha had reached;

267
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:00,760
He was so tired, lying down under a banyan tree —

268
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,960
and He got His realization.

269
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,880
So now I am here before you to tell you

270
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,720
what is the mechanism.

271
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,120
You should not in any case accept Me fully, you should not.

272
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,800
That would be wrong on My part and wrong on your part

273
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
because you're free, you are free, not to accept or to accept.

274
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,080
But you have to keep yourself open

275
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,080
because this is a new category of knowledge

276
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,640
which I am telling you about.

277
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,160
About the roots, about which you do not know.

278
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,400
You know only about the tree,

279
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,560
but I want to tell you about the roots.

280
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,480
The best thing would be, first and foremost,

281
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,520
to be able to enter into the roots.

282
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,720
But you cannot!

283
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,000
As the human mind is,

284
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,560
it wants to know everything about everything first of all.

285
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,480
But see, here,

286
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,560
if you have to enter into this room

287
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,720
and there is no light, somebody tells you,

288
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,000
“All right, press that button and you get all the lights.”

289
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,600
And you do it!

290
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,320
It's all built in there, it's just there.

291
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,000
But if somebody starts telling, “All right, I'll tell you

292
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,880
there is something called electricity.

293
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,680
Now, that was discovered such and such era,

294
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,520
then there was this gentleman,

295
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,400
who discovered this part of electricity,

296
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:51,160
then we used the water power to generate the electricity,

297
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,440
and that's how there was a committee was formed” —

298
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,080
and the whole history about the Sussex electrical system.

299
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,320
Then you'll say, “Now, we are fed up, now will you stop it!”

300
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,960
It's like that.

301
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,560
So, if I have to tell you the whole history, it will be too much.

302
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,160
Best thing would be to press the button, see the light, enjoy it,

303
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,200
and then you can know about it if you want to know.

304
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,400
If you want to!

305
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,680
It is just like that. The knowledge of the roots

306
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,560
is greater than the knowledge of the tree.

307
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,280
But unless and until you know how to become that subtle

308
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,480
to enter into the roots,

309
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,760
whatever I talk is Greek and Latin,

310
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,400
or, for you people, I would say, is like Sanskrit language.

311
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,960
But still, I'll try to explain to you few things

312
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,240
that lie within ourselves.

313
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,960
But by listening to that,

314
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,320
I want to tell you, you cannot get your realization.

315
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,720
Whatever I may talk for hours together,

316
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,360
you will not get your realization.

317
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,960
It's a happening that has to take place within you.

318
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,280
Unless and until this happening takes place,

319
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,920
you cannot get your realization.

320
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,680
And it's a happening which is to be experienced by you, not by Me.

321
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,280
It is to be felt by you,

322
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,680
and by this happening you have to feel your own powers,

323
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,120
your own glory, and your own purpose.

324
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,480
So far, we do not know the purpose of human life,

325
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,280
why human beings were created from amoeba stage.

326
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,280
But then you know what is the purpose of this life.

327
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,200
I'm sure they must have told you something about Kundalini.

328
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Jason, did you tell them?

329
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,840
Not much?

330
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,840
YOGI: Very little, Mother.
SHRI MATAJI: Eh?

331
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,800
YOGI: Very little, Mother.

332
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,920
SHRI MATAJI: What's he saying?
YOGI: That he [UNCLEAR] very little.

333
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,040
SHRI MATAJI: All right.

334
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,160
So now here I would like to tell you something about it,

335
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,640
which you should take as a hypothesis just now

336
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,080
and try to understand. It's not very difficult, to begin with.

337
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,760
And later on, as soon as you get your realization,

338
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,960
it's the easiest thing to do.

339
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,360
We have within ourselves seven centers,

340
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,600
placed in our medulla oblongata and in the brain.

341
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,080
The first one lies below the triangular bone,

342
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,320
which is called as sacrum,

343
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,200
and it's called as the Mooladhara center,

344
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,840
which means “the support of the roots”.

345
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,960
It is the support of the roots.

346
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:08,160
And this center embodies our innocence.

347
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,080
The second one … and of course it manifests outside in the gross,

348
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,120
the pelvic plexus.

349
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,240
Now, the second one is the one that emerges from the third one,

350
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,800
which is called as the Nabhi Chakra, the third one;

351
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,400
and the one that emerges from that

352
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,680
is the second one, called as the Swadishthana.

353
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,480
Now, the Swadishthana Chakra in the gross —

354
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,360
because these are subtle centers, in the medulla oblongata —

355
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:48,320
but outside, in the gross, it manifests

356
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,040
what we call the aortic plexus.

357
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,360
If there are doctors here, they'll understand what I'm talking about.

358
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,800
Now, if you go further,

359
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
the Nabhi Chakra manifests outside what we call as the solar plexus.

360
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:09,720
Above that is the center that we call as the Heart center,

361
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,160
Anahata Chakra, cardiac center,

362
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,280
which manifests outside

363
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,520
the cardiac plexus.

364
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,560
And it has got, again, the left and right side.

365
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,480
Then we have the center at the root of our neck,

366
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,120
which is called as the Vishuddhi Chakra

367
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,640
and which manifests outside

368
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,800
the cervical plexus.

369
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,520
Above that, here where you see the red mark on My head —

370
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,520
this is just the window of that center —

371
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,360
between the pituitary and the pineal body,

372
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,320
where the optic chiasma cross each other in the center,

373
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,000
is a very important center called as Agnya Chakra,

374
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,280
which looks after our ego and our superego,

375
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,160
which you can see there passing through that,

376
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,520
crossing over like that.

377
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,240
And on the top of that is the last seventh center,

378
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,320
called as the Sahasrara,

379
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,800
meaning “one thousand petals center”.

380
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And that's the center …

381
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,800
is just in the limbic area,

382
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,600
and when you pierce through that in the fontanelle area,

383
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
you feel the cool breeze of the Kundalini, or the Holy Ghost,

384
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,200
coming out of your head.

385
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,800
This has to happen.

386
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,560
You cannot give false certificates.

387
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,880
You have to feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.

388
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,720
You have to feel the cool breeze in your hands;

389
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:59,600
that means you have to feel the all-pervading Power of God,

390
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,400
of Love,

391
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,160
which is called as Brahma Shakti in Sanskrit language

392
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,000
and in the Bible is called as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

393
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,680
For the first time you have to feel it

394
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,720
in your hands, in your central nervous system.

395
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,880
Because the seat of your spirit is here,

396
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,880
but the spirit resides in the heart.

397
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,440
Once the seat is touched by the awakened Kundalini —

398
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,840
which is in the triangular bone, if you see —

399
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,640
then you start feeling

400
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,720
the first the cool breeze and then in the hand,

401
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,600
you start feeling the cool breeze flowing from you.

402
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:52,280
Thus you manifest the power of your spirit.

403
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,960
It's a happening that has to take place. It's a living happening.

404
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,320
It's very easy to tell people, “All right, now you start jumping.”

405
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,120
You see, anybody can jump, what's so great in jumping?

406
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,400
Or if somebody says, “All right, take out your clothes.”

407
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,880
What's so great? Or, “Color your clothes in this way.”

408
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,800
Nothing so special, anybody can do it.

409
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,440
But can you take out cool breeze out of your head?

410
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,160
Your own head.

411
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,320
And when you get it, you can do it to others.

412
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,640
Even from the others' heads you can take it out.

413
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,600
This is the way it has to happen, the time has come.

414
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,560
This is a very special time, when so many seekers are born,

415
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,360
so many of them, in millions and millions of them;

416
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,920
and so many are lost also,

417
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,200
because of various reasons, because of attack on them.

418
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,120
From very childhood, a person who is a seeker is attacked.

419
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,680
Ultimately, his ego can attack.

420
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,440
He may have his own mental projections built in,

421
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,880
he may have horrible gurus, taking out money from him.

422
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,720
And there'll be people … will be maneuvering them,

423
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,960
there'll be people who'll be creating projection things

424
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,120
just to engulf them.

425
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,160
But to an Indian, it is easy — if they are Indians, of course;

426
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,960
if they are uprooted people and all are westernized, then I can't say.

427
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,280
But to a normal Indian, they know

428
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,840
it is the Kundalini awakening that gives you realization.

429
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,480
I don't have to tell them that this is so.

430
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,280
They know. They are not naive.

431
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,360
But in the Bible also it is written

432
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,600
that “I will appear before you like tongues of flames,”

433
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,440
and actually, when you see the Sahasrara,

434
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,480
it looks likes beautiful flames in seven colors,

435
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,360
most harmless, silently;

436
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,800
like this flame

437
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,120
but very longish flames,

438
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,200
and silently burning and opening out,

439
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,640
very cooling flames.

440
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,240
Even this flame can give you cool breeze.

441
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,080
It has happened with many;

442
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,800
and how it works out, that we have to see.

443
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,760
It's fantastic! It's too much to believe.

444
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,480
First of all, we have no faith in ourselves,

445
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,560
we don't know how can we get realization so easily.

446
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,960
People had to do this, people had to do that.

447
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,200
But time has come.

448
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,320
You have done everything in your previous lives.

449
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,520
You have starved yourself,

450
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,240
you have roamed about,

451
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,960
you have done all the tapasyas, the penance,

452
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,360
and today is the time for you to get realization.

453
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,400
And that's what it is.

454
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,000
But why doubt it? You don't have to pay for it.

455
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,200
Nothing is selling here, you know that. Nothing is selling.

456
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,480
Actually, you cannot sell God. You cannot sell God!

457
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,640
Those who sell are committing sins.

458
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,480
How can you sell love?

459
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,480
Love is not a saleable quality.

460
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,880
Then the love of God, how can you sell?

461
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,160
But we are so attracted by commercializing and all that.

462
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,760
Because everything is so commercialized.

463
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,480
And so traditional now that, for people

464
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,240
who says that you cannot pay for your realization,

465
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,920
they just can't understand how can it be.

466
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,160
Get out of this, get out of it!

467
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,360
And just know that commercializing is a sin

468
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:46,000
if you try to do that in the realm of Divine.

469
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,120
It's a sinful thing. Anybody who has done that is wrong.

470
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,160
Christ had taken a big hunter and hit all those people

471
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,120
who were selling near that church. That's what it is.

472
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,160
Today we find in all the churches, all the temples,

473
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,120
mosques and everywhere — are nothing but commercializing.

474
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,960
But that doesn't mean that those people

475
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,800
who propounded those great ideals

476
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,800
to balance yourself

477
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,120
on your Void as we call it —

478
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:26,320
they gave you the Ten Commandments to balance yourself —

479
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,800
that they were wrong,

480
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,560
that they did it just as a mental projection.

481
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,760
It's a fact, you have to balance yourself!

482
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,320
All of them tried to balance you,

483
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,840
gave you a method of moderation.

484
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,040
For what is this moderation?

485
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,160
Is for the ascent.

486
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,120
If you do not have balance in life, you cannot move.

487
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,720
Imagine a car going on two wheels on one side.

488
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,640
Even if there's a bicycle, you have to balance it.

489
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,760
You just can't ride a bicycle if you don't know how to balance it.

490
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,360
So this balance was to be established, and that's why

491
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,720
they propounded all these great ideals for all of you.

492
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,880
And all this is for your ascent

493
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,520
and not to be just settled down with that balance.

494
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,680
You have to ascend, and that ascent

495
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,280
is now very simple and easy

496
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,440
because the time has come.

497
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,560
As I told you yesterday, on the tree of life

498
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,800
there were very, very few flowers to begin with.

499
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,160
But today, at the blossom time, there are so many seekers.

500
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,240
A special category, the flowers as they call it.

501
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,080
They are flowers, no doubt;

502
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,560
when they called them flowers, it was true they were flowers —

503
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,560
but they went into wrong direction.

504
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,720
They were definitely flowers to become fruits.

505
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,320
And they will, God willing,

506
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,920
all of them will have to become the fruits.

507
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,120
May God bless you all!

508
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,000
I always ask people to ask Me questions,

509
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,240
but that doesn't mean that you should go on

510
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,520
taking time unnecessarily.

511
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:37,880
And, also, mentally, I can just satisfy you up to a point

512
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,480
because the mind cannot cross the barriers.

513
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,200
It has to be triggered into a space

514
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,880
of thoughtless awareness.

515
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:53,400
And what you understand through your mind

516
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,200
is only the signboard,

517
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,240
which you can read; but you have to enter inside,

518
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,120
and for that, the ascent has to take place.

519
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
That's important.

520
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,000
The other day in the university there was only one person

521
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,880
who asked many questions.

522
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,280
And he was the one who didn't ascend,

523
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,840
the rest of them all ascended.

524
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,240
It's very sad. And we have to work on him, of course;

525
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,600
he is going to ascend because he wants to ascend.

526
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,640
But the questions went on like that, and such a waste of time.

527
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,800
Because you are earnest seekers and truthful seekers,

528
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,280
please ask questions which will help everyone.

529
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,480
We have to be kind to everyone.

530
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,680
May God bless you!

531
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,840
If you have any questions, please ask Me.

532
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,720
Yes?

533
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,240
SEEKER: [UNCLEAR], is it dangerous

534
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,480
to split a mental cord? [INAUDIBLE]

535
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,520
SHRI MATAJI: Now, can you tell Me what he's saying?

536
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,160
Just tell it. I'll see, I have to be able to answer.

537
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,080
YOGI: Is it dangerous to split thoughts?

538
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,520
SHRI MATAJI: No, no, no! We are not splitting it.

539
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,120
You are sadly mistaken. That's not the point.

540
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:58,000
You see, a thought rises as a reaction to something, all right?

541
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,760
Rises and falls off, and then another thought rises and falls off.

542
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,040
In between the thought, there's a little space,

543
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,440
which in Sanskrit called as vilamba.

544
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,920
Now, the thought may come from the future, may come from the past,

545
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,960
but when it comes, it goes to the past, all right?

546
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,280
Now, what happens: that we see the rising of the thought

547
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,600
but not falling of the thought.

548
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,600
And in between the thought, this vilamba is the present.

549
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,640
Now, if I tell you, “Be in the present,” you cannot.

550
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,480
But you just go on thinking, thinking, thinking like mad.

551
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,640
On the cusps of the thought you are moving, just like mad.

552
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,440
But there's a realm beyond the thought,

553
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,000
which is complete awareness and thoughtless awareness,

554
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,240
where there is no thought.

555
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,440
And thought is a great joy killer.

556
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,400
I'll tell you how. For example, you are seeing these flowers now.

557
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,600
I am also seeing them.

558
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,000
Now, I am seeing it thoughtlessly, you are seeing it with thought.

559
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,880
So the thought arises: “From what shop She must have bought?

560
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,360
How much it must have cost?”

561
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,640
Because thought is not joy.

562
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,520
But I am just looking at it, without thinking.

563
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,040
The complete creation of this,

564
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,960
all the joy that is put into this,

565
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,480
all the joy that has been created by putting it

566
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,480
into this kind of a style, all that is silent

567
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,600
is just entering into My being

568
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,600
and giving Me that peace and the joy for which it was created.

569
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,200
Is a barrier; actually, thought is always a barrier!

570
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,360
But when you go beyond thought, it doesn't mean

571
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,400
that you cannot think but you become a master.

572
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,400
If you want you can think, if you don't want you cannot think.

573
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,000
But you are not driven by your thoughts. You see My point?

574
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,040
It's like the thought is riding you, now you ride the thoughts.

575
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,560
SEEKER: Can you prevent the thinking?
SHRI MATAJI: Can you…?

576
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,320
SEEKER: Can you prevent the thinking I have in my head?

577
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,360
SHRI MATAJI: Yes! If you want, you can just sit silent,

578
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,600
in your silence enjoying it. If you want, you can think.

579
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,960
But after that, whatever you think

580
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,080
has a special quality.

581
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,440
Because that thought that comes to you after your realization

582
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,800
is guided, enlightened by your spirit.

583
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,040
Say, a thought comes to you. For example, you are sitting here,

584
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,360
and you see something in the darkness,

585
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,880
and you think this is a serpent.

586
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,720
For example, you might think; you see, thinking anything is possible.

587
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,520
There's no control.

588
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,960
So you think it is a serpent going, and you are frightened of it,

589
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,560
and you try to save yourself. But supposing there is light.

590
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,080
Then the same thought tells you, “No, no, it's not,

591
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,320
it's just a rope lying there.”

592
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,800
With enlightenment, the same thought has a special quality.

593
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Because you see it in all its dimensions and understand

594
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,000
what does that mean, what it is like,

595
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,040
what is the absolute value of particular thought is.

596
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,280
And you just give up.

597
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,080
Whatever is not right, you just give up; whatever is right, you accept.

598
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,160
Because you see it clearly.

599
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,360
So far, there is no discrimination.

600
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,960
Now, a thought comes to a person

601
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,800
that “Let me go and murder someone.” This all comes from thought!

602
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,960
“Because I hate that person, I must murder that person.” All right?

603
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,040
It's all hatred working.

604
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,520
Now, you may obey that thought, somewhere,

605
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,240
and you murder that person.

606
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,080
And then, after the violence, the whole thing, the face changes,

607
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,840
and you become so nervous, and everything starts.

608
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,560
First thought takes you down there to kill the person,

609
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,560
and the second thought comes [UNCLEAR]:

610
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,800
“Oh God, what have I done!”

611
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,640
Both are wrong.

612
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,320
But if you are a realized soul, first of all you'll not hate anyone.

613
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,840
There are ways of neutralizing the hatred in Sahaja Yoga.

614
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,720
And neutralizing even the hatred of the person who hates you.

615
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,960
Love's powers we have never known before.

616
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,440
We only know the power of hatred, you see;

617
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,280
the way we are producing MX [MX missile], and this, and that —

618
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,280
is nothing, is based on hatred and filth.

619
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,240
If these people get realization — I don't know if they'll ever get it —

620
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,560
they won't produce all these horrible things,

621
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,400
which is making everyone shudder.

622
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,800
We have never used the power of love so far,

623
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,080
but that you cannot do it unless and until you have felt it,

624
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,280
after realization.

625
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,720
SEEKER: Will you please tell us something of the technique?

626
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,920
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, I will.

627
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,480
As I said … that it's a spontaneous thing,

628
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,440
it's done as a living process, all right?

629
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,800
Now, say, if I say that …

630
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,120
what is the technique of sprouting a seed?

631
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,040
That's a living process.

632
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,600
No technique, you just put it in the Mother Earth, it sprouts.

633
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,320
It's all built in.

634
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,520
It's a divine technique,

635
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,480
by which it works out, first.

636
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,600
But then you become the master of the technique yourself.

637
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,280
Then you can do it!

638
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,000
Because you enter into a new realm where you have the divine power,

639
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,920
by which you can do it yourself, you can maneuver it.

640
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,920
But how you get your realization? Is through the spontaneous process.

641
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,400
And a very simple process, is like this: a candle

642
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,760
which is enlightened can enlighten another light.

643
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,160
If the candle is there

644
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,280
and if the candle is in order.

645
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,240
But this candle, if it's a realized soul …

646
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,000
that it can also correct —

647
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,280
through its techniques, which you have to learn —

648
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,840
through its technique, it can also correct

649
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,400
the other candle which is not yet enlightened,

650
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,000
and then can enlighten.

651
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,640
It can do everything!

652
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:41,760
But the technique of that is to be understood very easily

653
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,760
because you become

654
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,400
a collectively conscious personality.

655
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,840
You become, again I say, you become. You become another personality.

656
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,000
Like an egg becomes a bird. That's how you become.

657
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,280
Then the bird has to just learn how to fly.

658
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,360
But how does a …

659
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,960
what is the technique for the egg to become the bird?

660
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:15,160
It's just to be put in the warmth of the mother hen.

661
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,920
No technique, it's all built in. That's the divine technique.

662
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,520
But then you learn the divine technique yourself, how to do it.

663
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,560
All right? So then, once you are realized,

664
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,320
by very simple method —

665
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,240
which is our job first of all, the job of the realized souls,

666
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,840
like the enlightened light — once that is done for you,

667
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,120
then you have to do for others.

668
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,920
Then you have to learn the technique.

669
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,360
But unless and until you are enlightened,

670
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:52,200
you cannot do any technique, because there's no power flowing.

671
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,720
To start this, you have to put it to the mains, isn't it?

672
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,200
Otherwise no use knowing the technique.

673
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,160
If you don't know how to start the car, no use knowing how to drive.

674
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,360
So let us first start it, and then you will learn the driving.

675
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,440
Answered all right now?

676
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,800
SEEKER: Having started, how long does it take to become realized?

677
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,600
SHRI MATAJI: No, you are realized at the start only. To begin with.

678
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,600
It takes hardly any time. You get realization first, in the sense

679
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,560
that you become collectively conscious, you become empowered.

680
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,000
But then … it takes hardly any time for some people,

681
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,880
only six, seven days they can become experts.

682
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,360
That's all, that's sufficient.

683
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,480
Some people take some time,

684
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,280
but depending on what obstructions you have in your centers.

685
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,880
If your centers are obstructed, then it takes little more time.

686
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:50,000
But if they are not, it doesn't take much time.

687
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,640
You become automatically endowed with that technique.

688
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,960
Now here we have at least fifty percent who are Sahaja Yogis.

689
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,560
We call them Sahaja Yogis once they become expert, before that not.

690
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,280
At least fifty percent people sitting here are that.

691
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,680
They're just like you, but there's a difference.

692
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,000
If you see, their faces are glowing,

693
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,760
you won't find any pimples or anything on their faces;

694
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,640
very soft skin, young looking, fresh; eyes are sparkling.

695
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,920
They are over here.

696
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,680
And that's how you become.

697
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,360
You become the masters of yourself. Because you become the spirit!

698
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,200
And spirit is the master because it guides you.

699
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,000
All right? We'll work it out.

700
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:44,240
That's a very good question! Why? Because you want it.

701
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,400
That's a good question that really helps everyone.

702
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,960
Should we have it now? All right.

703
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,760
You have been requested to take out your shoes for a purpose,

704
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,120
there's nothing to insult you or in any way to trouble you

705
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,560
but to help you all. Because the Mother Earth, you see, helps you.

706
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,840
We have to take the help from the Mother Earth,

707
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,440
so we put our feet on the Mother Earth.

708
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,960
We must know this Mother Earth helps us the most,

709
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,480
so we have to put our feet on the Mother Earth,

710
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:29,680
without much pressure, little apart, not very close to each other.

711
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,840
All right?

712
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:36,800
If possible, try to put the whole foot on the Mother Earth,

713
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,560
and sit comfortably.

714
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,960
Now, if there is anything tight, you can little bit loosen it.

715
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,200
If it is too tight. I mean, you should never be uncomfortable,

716
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,120
because your attention goes …

717
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,160
if there is any uncomfortable feeling, it goes there.

718
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,520
Also better to take out your spectacles and things

719
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,600
because it also helps your eyesight.

720
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,960
It helps so many things, so better to take out your spectacles.

721
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,920
Keep it safe somewhere, so your attention is not

722
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,800
sort of distracted by it.

723
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,520
It's a very, very simple method which we have to use.

724
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,800
First of all, as I told you — here you can see also —

725
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,640
yesterday I told you that these centers

726
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,120
are represented in our fingertips.

727
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,720
Muhammad Sahib has said: “At the time of resurrection,

728
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,080
your hands will speak.” Very clearly He said it.

729
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,680
And now this what happens: that your fingers,

730
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,320
they have got sympathetic endings here —

731
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,280
that much, of course, the medical science also agrees —

732
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,880
but these actually are your centers here represented.

733
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:48,280
So — five, six, and seven. Here also five, six, and seven.

734
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,120
On the two sympathetic nervous systems, left and right,

735
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,760
as you see here.

736
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,720
The gross is the left sympathetic nervous system,

737
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,760
but the subtle one is called as the Ida Nadi,

738
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:04,880
which is the one which caters to our desires.

739
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,720
The another one, on the right-hand side,

740
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,960
is the one called as the Pingala Nadi,

741
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,160
which manifests the gross …

742
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,800
channel

743
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,920
which represents the right sympathetic nervous system,

744
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:30,840
which is responsible for the creativity; is the action.

745
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,760
So one is for the desire — first we desire, and then we act —

746
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,880
so this is for the desire, for emotions,

747
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,960
and the right one is for the action.

748
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,080
So we use these hands gradually

749
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:49,480
according to the obstructions we have on our different centers.

750
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:54,080
But first of all we have to put the hands just like this:

751
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:59,680
little bit open, very comfortably put on your lap;

752
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,120
and you have to close your eyes.

753
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:06,400
That's very important, you have to close your eyes.

754
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:13,360
Just opposite of mesmerism. Please close your eyes.

755
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:18,120
Whatever has to happen will happen inside, not outside.

756
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,880
If I say, “Pay attention to yourself inside,” it's impossible.

757
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,920
But it will happen

758
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,440
when some happening takes place,

759
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,240
and your attention will be attracted inside;

760
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,560
and that happening is the awakening of the Kundalini.

761
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,840
Please don't open your eyes. If our eyes are open,

762
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,880
the Kundalini doesn't rise beyond a certain point.

763
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,640
Sometimes She doesn't want to rise at all.

764
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:55,880
So just keep your eyes shut and put your hands, fingers open,

765
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:01,360
little … not upward but downward a little bit.

766
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,040
Now, there's a little bit you have to pay attention to:

767
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,200
don't have to open your eyes,

768
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,760
remember that the left side is the desire.

769
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,360
And the desire is the pure desire

770
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:38,040
to become one with the Divine.

771
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,400
This is the purest desire, and that is represented

772
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,480
by the Kundalini, by this force,

773
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:51,080
which is placed in the sacrum bone, or the sacred bone,

774
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,400
in the triangular bone as they call it.

775
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,840
Now, the desire has to be kept fixed;

776
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:02,440
that means the left hand should to be kept as it is.

777
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,240
Now with the right hand we have to work out

778
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:11,320
the action of clearing our centers.

779
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,360
First of all, please put your right hand on your heart,

780
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,640
on the left-hand side,

781
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:23,680
because in the heart resides your spirit.

782
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,560
It's better to put it under the coat.

783
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,560
And just say …

784
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,960
or, we should say, ask a question:

785
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,640
“Mother, am I the spirit?”

786
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,080
Ask the question to Me thrice,

787
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,440
in your heart, ask a question: “Am I the spirit?”

788
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,640
Thrice.

789
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,960
This is an absolute question.

790
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,760
You are! But at this stage you just ask the question.

791
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,440
You are the spirit, no doubt!

792
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:16,480
But ask the question: “Mother, am I the spirit?”

793
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:25,280
Put both the legs properly on the ground,

794
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,960
separated from each other little bit.

795
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:33,600
Now take down this hand

796
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:38,320
to the left side of your stomach — don't open your eyes —

797
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,920
left side, and press it little bit with your fingers.

798
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,160
Here is the center

799
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:51,760
of your guide, your master.

800
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:58,000
Because the spirit is the guide and the master,

801
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,120
and as you have asked Me the question

802
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,000
whether you are the spirit,

803
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,240
you better ask another question here,

804
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:10,160
saying that “Mother, am I my own master?

805
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:15,560
Am I my own guru? Am I my own guide?”

806
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,720
Sincerely ask this question please.

807
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,120
Lower down on the stomach, on the left-hand side, lower down.

808
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,160
Yes. And put the left hand towards Me.

809
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,800
Left hand should be towards Me, which is a fixed point,

810
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,600
which is the desire that you want to become.

811
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:50,320
This question is to be asked ten times, because of Ten Commandments.

812
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:56,520
Or, there are ten petals to this center.

813
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:19,080
Now again, raise your right hand to your heart position again,

814
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,200
with your left hand at the same point.

815
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,480
Press it a little bit and, again, with full confidence,

816
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,520
please say for My sake, for your sake

817
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,760
that “Mother, I am the spirit.”

818
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,960
Just assert!

819
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,040
You have to say it twelve times.

820
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,800
“Mother, I am the spirit.”

821
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,600
As the spirit is detached,

822
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,160
is blemishless,

823
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,080
it cannot commit any mistakes,

824
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,040
it cannot have any guilt.

825
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,680
So raise the same hand, right hand — left hand keeping the same way —

826
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,400
to the left-side base of the neck.

827
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,000
To the left-side base of the neck;

828
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,960
it's very important, specially for western people

829
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:55,240
because they always feel guilty, for nothing at all.

830
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,240
You are not to feel guilty!

831
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:03,280
So, as you are the spirit, you have to say, “Mother,

832
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,640
I am not guilty.”

833
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,320
You have to say this sixteen times please. “Mother, I am not guilty.”

834
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,800
You are the spirit, and how can spirit be guilty?

835
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,400
Don't feel any guilt about anything whatever you have done,

836
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,080
the past is past. At this moment please say,

837
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,440
“Mother, I am not guilty, because I am the spirit.”

838
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,080
And what is your guilt after all,

839
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,080
compared to the forgiveness of God's love?

840
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,480
Because He's the ocean of forgiveness,

841
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,760
He's the ocean of compassion,

842
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,680
He's the ocean of love.

843
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,760
Now raise the same hand. Put the left hand towards Me,

844
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,480
that is important; you must keep the left hand towards Me on the lap,

845
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,680
fixed.

846
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,840
Say it sixteen times please.

847
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,480
“Mother, I am not guilty.” Please say it with full confidence,

848
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:16,360
is very important, I tell you. Most of you catch on that center.

849
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:29,800
Now raise your right hand above

850
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,520
onto your forehead, across.

851
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,720
Just put it there.

852
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:41,400
At this point, you have to forgive everyone.

853
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,240
Just forgive everyone!

854
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,600
Everyone you have to forgive. Put it across.

855
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,840
Some people say it's difficult.

856
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,800
It's a myth that we do not forgive,

857
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,040
because what do we do when we don't forgive?

858
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:00,600
So just say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

859
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,800
Sincerely please say that “Mother, I really forgive everyone.”

860
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,760
You have to just say it twice.

861
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,800
But it is to be said from your heart, then it will work out.

862
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,040
Now put this hand, after saying that, on top of your head,

863
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,600
at the place where it was soft bone in your childhood,

864
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:25,080
press it with your palm and just try to turn your head

865
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,080
in a clockwise manner, pressing it.

866
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,200
Just press it and turn it a little bit in the clockwise manner.

867
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,880
Press it with your palm, press it with your palm at the point

868
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:40,960
where it was soft when you were a child.

869
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:45,680
At this point, I have to say, I am helpless;

870
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:50,280
if you do not want to have your realization,

871
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,360
I cannot force it through. Because, as I told you,

872
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:56,520
you have been given your freedom, which is respected.

873
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,840
So here you have to say, “Mother, I want my realization,

874
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,680
please give me realization.”

875
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,760
Unless and until you say that definitely,

876
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,440
I cannot cross the barrier of your freedom.

877
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:13,320
So please say it clearly in your heart seven times:

878
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:18,240
“Mother, please give me my Self-realization.”

879
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,640
Seven times please.

880
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:49,280
Say it from your heart. Say, it, from, your, heart.

881
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,960
Very sincerely, that's important.

882
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,480
Earnestly you have to say that.

883
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:04,320
Now raise your hand and see if there is a cool breeze coming out;

884
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,400
or if there is a hot thing coming out:

885
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,440
maybe some people will get heat first.

886
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,320
You can change over the hand and see from the other hand,

887
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,400
and put the right hand towards Me.

888
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:17,320
You can see if there is a cool breeze coming in,

889
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,560
or a hot breeze coming in.

890
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,400
Why don't you see?

891
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,720
It's there, it's there, it's there!

892
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,080
Put your hand like this, right hand … like this … when … yes …

893
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,000
also … and now you see. It's there? All right, gradually.

894
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,840
Now you turn. Again see another hand.

895
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:47,400
Just try with another hand, you see?

896
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,840
Again change over and see for yourself.

897
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:03,480
This will help you to get a balance.

898
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,400
If you are feeling in your head,

899
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,200
then see if you are feeling in your hands as well.

900
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:25,080
Put your hands towards Me. See now if you are feeling in your hands.

901
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:30,400
She's got it. You've got it, yes!

902
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:41,640
If you put up your hands like this — open your eyes —

903
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,480
just like this,

904
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,800
you start feeling it in your hands: a little cool breeze

905
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,600
or a movement downward. Start first feeling it.

906
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:58,080
Are you? Good, good.

907
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:02,520
Some of you have a center caught up there.

908
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,400
All right?

909
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,680
Feeling it? Now bring it down and see for yourself

910
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,880
if you are feeling it in your hands.

911
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:31,280
Mm, very relaxed.

912
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,680
Are you? Good. What about you, sir?

913
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,160
Not yet? We will work out. (To a yogi) Just see…

914
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,720
Now, there are Sahaja Yogis here who are sitting,

915
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,840
who can help you also, those who have not felt it.

916
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,960
It will work out, it is going to work out.

917
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:52,560
It has worked in this lady: face is changed, looking so much younger.

918
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,600
You too.

919
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,720
What about you now? This gentleman, are you feeling now?

920
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,120
He's got just a Hamsa Chakra, this one.

921
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:06,360
The one who came to Louise? Not yet?

922
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:10,200
It's all right, it will work out. Now, don't lose patience.

923
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,600
You must have patience with yourself.

924
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:22,000
Please close your eyes, just close your eyes.

925
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:30,640
It's going to work out.

926
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,480
There! Now just watch Me without thinking. Let's see can you do it.

927
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,680
All right?

928
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,560
What about these people?

929
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,240
Aah, that's better!
