1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,890
It is a great pleasure for Me,

2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,940
greatest joy

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,000
to see so many Sahaja Yogis

4
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:21,940
for the Guru Puja.

5
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,960
It’s very gratifying

6
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:30,930
to think that there are so many,

7
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:39,820
so many of you who are disciples.

8
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,890
It was never expected

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,820
that I’ll have so many,

10
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,980
so many people following Me.

11
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:15,980
It is being expected

12
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,820
that you all will

13
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:29,790
follow My message of Love.

14
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:38,980
I do not have to say anything for Love.

15
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:50,930
Love is absolute gift,

16
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:01,790
gift of just feeling others.

17
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,980
There is no talking about it,

18
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,780
discussing about it, nothing;

19
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,930
just you feel that Love.

20
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:32,890
To feel the Love, I would say, one has to have a heart,

21
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,780
but how can you have a heart?

22
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:44,810
It is not your own doing, it’s all there.

23
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:55,950
So, it is something is already gifted to you, you have it,

24
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,970
that you can feel that Love.

25
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:09,010
It’s so much joy - giving, peace - giving.

26
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:17,780
Love has its own qualities

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,830
and one of the qualities is that Love understands.

28
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,900
Its understanding is not in words,

29
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,780
not in thought,

30
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,780
but understands within.

31
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,950
It can feel within,

32
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,010
which is very important.

33
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,950
This is the most important part

34
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,890
one has to realize

35
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,840
that Love you can only feel it.

36
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,790
You cannot talk about it,

37
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,920
you cannot show about it,

38
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,010
but it is within and you can feel it.

39
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,930
And that is why today

40
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:30,890
is your celebration of the Guru.

41
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,000
It’s the celebration where

42
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:45,810
you can feel that Love for your Guru.

43
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,950
That feeling is within

44
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,860
and only in within you can feel that.

45
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,940
So, we have to understand it’s not the show,

46
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,010
it’s nothing else but just the feeling within

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,970
that you know that you have Love of the Divine.

48
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,930
This you can have because

49
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,010
it is just there.

50
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,970
No one can give you,

51
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,790
no one can sell it,

52
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,870
no one can share it - it’s just there.

53
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:49,810
And that Love has to be felt and shared.

54
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,000
It has nothing to do with others;

55
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,980
whether others love you or not makes no difference.

56
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,810
It’s within yourself,

57
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,790
this feeling,

58
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,970
this depth is there which you enjoy.

59
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,910
It is the capacity -

60
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,860
every one has this, lots of it.

61
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,000
Sometimes you feel it, you have lost it;

62
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,890
Sometimes you feel you have gained it.

63
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:54,850
But it is there as much as the expanse of a sea.

64
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,930
Sea, you cannot say

65
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,990
today is full and tomorrow is not.

66
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,910
It is eternal.

67
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:12,860
In the same way, the source of your Love is eternal.

68
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,960
You cannot measure it,

69
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,830
it’s difficult.

70
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,890
But it’s beyond all your human expressions

71
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:49,910
and it shows your understanding,

72
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,930
your understanding of Love,

73
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,910
which has no words,

74
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,930
which cannot explain;

75
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,880
but by itself you will know

76
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,910
that "I have this quality to love

77
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,930
within myself

78
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,940
and I can enjoy with this Love within myself."

79
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:28,860
This is a very unique gift

80
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:38,830
which only very few human beings have.

81
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,940
Among animals also you find people who have love,

82
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,830
but that love is not deep,

83
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,800
that love has no meaning.

84
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,880
It has some purpose maybe,

85
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,010
but it is not human,

86
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,960
so, it lacks the beauty of human Love,

87
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:21,910
It lacks the understanding of human Love.

88
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,020
It is not easy to describe

89
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:34,020
or explain Love in human words.

90
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,830
This you can only feel within your Self.

91
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,930
That is what, once you start feeling,

92
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,930
you can feel who is your Guru,

93
00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:00,970
Whom do you think you are being taught

94
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:08,830
and persuaded and made to live in a particular manner.

95
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,930
All that is possible.

96
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,020
Everything is possible,

97
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,830
humanly possible,

98
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,820
but to love and to enjoy Love

99
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,850
is not so easy,

100
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,900
unless and until you are immersed in it.

101
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,790
It’s very gratifying,

102
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,970
it is very lovable

103
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,960
to see how people love each other

104
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:04,020
and then this Love spreads.

105
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,970
Love begets Love.

106
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:19,790
If somebody has Love, it just spreads.

107
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,830
You need not tell anyone,

108
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,990
you need not confess it,

109
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,880
but it will spread.

110
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,940
And this is what one has to learn,

111
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:43,940
how to see that Love in other person.

112
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,850
Somehow,

113
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,920
we are here already in Love

114
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,020
because of Sahaj happening.

115
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,970
We all love

116
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,920
and we enjoy love,

117
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,880
shows on our faces

118
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,020
that we are in Love;

119
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,800
in our characters,

120
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,810
in our lives,

121
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,800
that we are in Love.

122
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,830
What a thing,

123
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,910
which is not very normal,

124
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,020
becomes so normal

125
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,860
and so easily available.

126
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,920
It is a very big blessing

127
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,020
that you are human beings

128
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:52,870
and that this source of Love

129
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:59,860
is there, plus the feeling for Love is there.

130
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:05,020
It’s a very intricate situation

131
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,830
which cannot be explained in words,

132
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,840
only one can be in it

133
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,950
and enjoy it.

134
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,910
So today is the day

135
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:29,000
when we are celebrating the Guru Puja.

136
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:38,920
The greatest Guru that we have is Love,

137
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:46,840
Sahaj Love. It's the Guru within us which teaches us,

138
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,940
which somehow or other leads us.

139
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,020
We are lead into that

140
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,880
great line of understanding,

141
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,860
for which we don’t have to go to any college,

142
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,940
to any school for education.

143
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,780
It is something so much within

144
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:24,910
that it works and expresses itself,

145
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,940
expresses like a light.

146
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,830
Such people we can make out because

147
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,860
they are fully enlightened.

148
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,830
They have light

149
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,800
and through that light they see

150
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,870
the whole world,

151
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,780
which is very innocent and simple for them.

152
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:03,890
We have love for our children naturally,

153
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,880
we have love for our parents naturally.

154
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,780
We have love for some people;

155
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,940
but that love is different

156
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,860
from God’s Love, I’m telling you.

157
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,910
That has some connections,

158
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,990
some meanings

159
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:35,970
but this Love which is -

160
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,910
cannot be described in words,

161
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,890
has to be felt within.

162
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,980
Same, when you talk of your Guru,

163
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:59,020
you should have that Love within you.

164
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,860
Why do you feel it so much?

165
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:14,910
The reason is, Guru loves you

166
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,970
and you love Guru;

167
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,020
That’s the only reason

168
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,890
why should you love your Guru.

169
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,020
Now, there's no reason for that.

170
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,830
Because Love is Love.

171
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,840
and that is how

172
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:40,020
the Guru becomes very important in life.

173
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
We have people

174
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,950
who love their Guru

175
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,940
and are very much

176
00:16:53,970 --> 00:17:02,800
in chaste understanding of their Love.

177
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:09,830
In this great opportunity of Love that we are,

178
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:16,940
we are here to enjoy each other fully,

179
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,860
from our heart,

180
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,940
that there is this ocean within us,

181
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,810
we have to just get submerged in that ocean.

182
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,800
If we are lost in that ocean,

183
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,940
then we’ll have no problems,

184
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,860
no questions.

185
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,910
Everything will be our own

186
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,880
and we can manage

187
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:55,880
everything without any argument,

188
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,000
without any questioning.

189
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,020
That is what is being Sahaj.

190
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,810
The Sahaj way, if you have

191
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,830
this Love, you enjoy.

192
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,810
You enjoy yourself and enjoy everybody else,

193
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,990
because it is Sahaj.

194
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,910
Don’t have to make any efforts,

195
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,880
don’t have to try anything.

196
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,990
Just it is there and it works.

197
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:40,880
The feeling of Love

198
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:47,890
has no way of expressing itself.

199
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,860
It is just there,

200
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,850
it cannot express,

201
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:00,970
because it is without expression.

202
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,000
It is just to be felt within yourself.

203
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,990
Then you want to do so many things:

204
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,830
you want to help everyone,

205
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,830
you want to help yourself,

206
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:24,940
you want to do good to others.

207
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,970
So much has been done by great leaders of the world

208
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,990
because they had that Love.

209
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,780
They had nothing else but this Love

210
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,920
which they could not contain them within themselves,

211
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:46,020
so, they tried to spread it.

212
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,940
And they are called now as our Guru,

213
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,940
as our masters.

214
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,980
With that Love within,

215
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:04,020
which approached people in that unique manner.

216
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,990
That’s the thing that

217
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,980
we cannot possess,

218
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,870
you cannot claim -

219
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,020
it is there

220
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,020
and it works,

221
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,870
it works automatically.

222
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,980
This is what we have to know,

223
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:35,900
that we are that Love.

224
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,980
That Love is within us.

225
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,980
We have to have knowledge,

226
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,840
we have to have a complete knowledge

227
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:53,800
that we are that Love.

228
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,940
That will solve our problem,

229
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,950
because you can explain everything,

230
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,950
all your behaviour,

231
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,780
all your failures,

232
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,990
everything you can explain

233
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,810
when you know that you are endowed with that Love.

234
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,950
This is what is the Guru

235
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,810
is the Love within you

236
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,020
which wants to share

237
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,920
Love with others,

238
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,990
which wants to give Love to others.

239
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,840
This is what is peace and joy.

240
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,950
I can go on talking on Love,

241
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,950
but to feel it

242
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,930
within yourself is the biggest thing.

243
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,870
Like water:

244
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,960
if you are thirsty,

245
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,840
we can give you water,

246
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,980
but we cannot drink.

247
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,850
You have to drink water

248
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,010
and you have to

249
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,950
feel the taste,

250
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,810
feel the feeling,

251
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,880
what it does,

252
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,020
and all that is together,

253
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,880
that’s not separate.

254
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,990
I don’t think the subject

255
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,960
was too subtle for you people.

256
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,880
You all have reached a certain amount

257
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,990
of understanding of that Love.

258
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,850
I hope, it grows

259
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,900
and you grow into it,

260
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:55,870
all of you, and enjoy it.

261
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,920
May God bless you!
